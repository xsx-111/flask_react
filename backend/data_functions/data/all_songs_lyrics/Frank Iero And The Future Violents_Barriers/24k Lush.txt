24k Lush Lyrics
One more night in solitude
Removed from everyone
Even if I wanted to
I never have much fun, that I know

Do you think of me like I hope you do?

Rise my arms to the sky for once
I'm gold
No, I won’t give you up
I can't let you down any more than I have

One more time, I promise to revolve around the sun
Is one more year in servitude enough to pay for all I've done?
I don’t know

Would you wait for me as I long for you?

Rise my arms to the sky for once
I'm gold
No, I won't give you up
I can't let you down any more than I have
No time for giving eulogies
No time for second chance
No time for mixed apologies
Tonight we burn down Hollywood
Tonight's our shared last breath
They'll write about us in history books

No time for giving eulogies
No time for second chance
No time for mixed apologies
Tonight, we burn down Hollywood
Tonight's our shared last breath
They'll write about us in history books
Tonight, we’re gold, gold
Tonight, we’re gold
Tonight, we're gold, gold
Tonight, we’re goldEmbed
