Six Feet Down Under Lyrics
Now you don’t have to accept my fears but
But you better respect my fears 'cause
And I know I don’t have to explain myself to you
But I might feel better if I try
So, let's tell you something
There’s a part of me that’s not sure if I’m here
There's a definite part of me that don’t believe in the now, yeah
And that’s just the start of it
'Cause I ain't convinced you’re all real
There might be an art to it but
I don’t think I got the skill, and

Bless your heart, you don’t know how I feel
I’ll do my part, and try to explain, oh
And yeah, you might be smart
But you don’t know how this feels
Yeah, no matter the words in your heart
You can keep 'em
‘Cause this life is like doing time when you’re dead inside

I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die here
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don’t wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die
Sometimes, I get so low
That I swear I could cry
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me now, oh
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me now

Bless your heart, yeah, you don’t know how I feel
I’m doing my part, I try to explain
Over and over and over again
Yeah, you might be smart
But you don't know how this feels
Yeah, no matter the words in your heart, you can keep 'em, oh
‘Cause this life, girl
Yeah, this life is making a fucking fool out of me, oh
No one can tell me if it's just my fucking mind
Playing dirty tricks on me

I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die here
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die here
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like I did
I just wanna know
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don’t wanna feel like I did
I just wanna live
Yeah, sometimes, oh
Sometimes, I get so low that I swear, baby
I just can't figure out which way is up, oh, yeah
And these things that I’m seeing
They combat what I’m feeling
And I just need to know I’ve really survivedEmbed
