Police Police Lyrics
Unimpressed by the ignorance we choose to commend
Disgraced by the hate we love to embrace
Unimpressed by the ignorance we choose to commend
Disgraced by the hate we love to embrace
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
Killing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time
Doing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right

Life cleared the light from my eyes
And wiped the smirk from my face
It won't be seen anymore
If I let my time go to waste
I'll know the pills by their taste
They help us hide who we are

Leave what's left for the ones who are doomed to come next
Leave what's left for the ones who are doomed to come next
Killing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time
Doing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
Life cleared the light from my eyes
And wiped the smirk from my face
It won't be seen anymore
If I let my voice go to waste
I'll know the pills by their taste
They help us hide who we are

No more silence while children scream
Locked in cages built overseas
No more silence while children scream
Locked in cages built overseas

Every time we condone
Another version of hate
We get farther from God

I know you're tired, I know you tire
I know you're tired, I know you tire
I know you're tired, I know you tire
(Life cleared the light from my eyes)
(And wiped the smirk from my face)
I know you're tired, I know you tire
(It won't be seen anymore)
(Take it, it's yours)
(Take it, it's yours)
(Take it, it's yours)
(Take it, it's yours)Embed
