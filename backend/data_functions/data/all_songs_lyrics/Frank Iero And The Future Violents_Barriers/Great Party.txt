Great Party Lyrics
Our hearts need work, I'm scared we’re born to lose
Tired of acting tough when I should've known better
And our words get stuck so we taught ourselves to smile
Yours shines so bright that it makes me shiver

Just when you thought it can't get worse, always it does
Just when you thought it can’t get worse, always it does

We ignored the signs, got lost for miles and miles
Know what buttons to push with both middle fingers
And I'm out of touch, and your ticks are out of time
Couldn't wait to get gone, you're a real go-getter

Just when you thought it can't get worse, always it does
Just when you thought I can't get worse, I'm off my meds
I'm wondering is it me, is it me that made you feel so sad?

I miss you so much, I miss you sober
I hope you don’t mind
I miss you so much, I miss you sober
I hope you don’t mind
I won't call
Is it me, is it me that brings you down?
My heart needs work, it does what it wants to do
Keeps falling, oh, when I should’ve known better
And my words get stuck so I taught myself to smile
So sick of us, I hope I never get better1Embed
