No Love Lyrics
No love for my love
No glance to steal
No thrill from my touch
It kills me to feel the ghost
Of what we once embraced
There's no tell in your face
Although I can tell
There's no talk on your lips
Just the taste of his
And the gall it took to boast
While you burned our bridges down

Now, I know how all of this goes
Before the words come tumbling out
And I've felt the pain that you gave in spades
But I'll go to the end of the Earth
If it means I'll end up with you
Yeah, I'll cross the distance you aim to create

No love from your love
No kiss and tell
No fucks to give, love
Just one last farewell, in the form
Of a fragile poem
That promptly turns to dust
Yeah, I know how all of this goes
Before the words come tumbling out
And I've felt the pain that you gave in spades
And I'll go to the end of the Earth
If it means I'll end up with you
Yeah, I'll cross the distance you aim to create
Framed as last goodbyes

24/7, 24/7
24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7
24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7
24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7, 24/7, 24/7

Yeah, I know how all of this goes
Before the words come tumbling out
And I've felt the pain that you gave in spades
And I'll go to the end of the Earth
If it means I'll end up with you
Yeah, I'll cross the distance you aim to create
Framed as last goodbyesEmbed
