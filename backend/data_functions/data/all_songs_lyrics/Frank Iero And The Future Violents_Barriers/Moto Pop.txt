Moto Pop Lyrics
(We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room
We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room)
Whoo!

Oh, looking back, thereâ€™s nothing for me there
And standing still is just more than I can bear
That outside world will only cut your throat
And your hometown is just hoping you'll implode

I'm scared of shadows from my past
They loom large until there's light

I never thought that I could be happy
I just know I can't admit I'm not
We're overfed 'til the seams are bursting
I'm still starved for the love I never got

Scared of shadows from your past
They're looming large until there's light
And I can see the birds of prey circling overhead
And they might strip our bones and I might long for it
For it, for it, for it
Never meant to say "I'm sorry"
Just hate to hear an awkward pause
Unmarked, my feelings get buried
Up to my throat 'til I can't talk

I'm scared of shadows from my past
They're looming large until there's light
And I see the birds of prey circling overhead
And they might strip our bones and I might long for it
For it

There's nothing wrong with me
I've given everything
There's nothing left in my heart
I've used up everything

And I see the birds of prey circling overhead, oh yeah
And they might strip our bones
And sell the rest for scrap, oh yeah
And you might hear my words
But you can never truly know
'Cause these scars are my own
And I earned every one
You might hope someday
That a tiger's stripes will change
Oh, but, girl, I gotta say
That plan don't sound worth a fuck
(We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room
We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room)2Embed
