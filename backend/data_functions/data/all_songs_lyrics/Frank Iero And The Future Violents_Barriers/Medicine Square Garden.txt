Medicine Square Garden Lyrics
There's way too much on my mind
To give you all my time
But I know there’s something wrong
There's no justice in photographs
Such lovely eyes you have, that cry yourself to sleep

I got so scared last night
I couldn't breathe, I was paralyzed
I got so sad last night
My eyes deprived of the light you shine
I couldn’t see your dark

You gave me butterflies
Pinned to the sides of my stomach line
Your kiss is filled with fire
It charred my lips and my sense of pride
The way we twist and twine
If love is blind, cross out my eyes
I won't mind at all
'Cause some might say
That better days
Are on their way, but they lie
If suffering is beautiful
Then you're the most beautiful
Mirage these eyes could ever meet
And you made my fever spike
And I put up quite the fight
That I never planned to win

I got so scared last night
I couldn't breathe, I was paralyzed
I got so sad last night
My sight deprived of the light you shine
I couldn't see your dark

You gave me butterflies
Pinned to the sides of my stomach line
Your kiss is filled with fire
It charred my lips and my sense of pride
The way we twist and twine
Love is blind, it took both my eyes
I don't mind at all
And some might say, that better days
Are on their way but they're not
Oh, yeah
Is there anyone out there?
Send me a sign, turn water to wine
Lord knows
I need a kiss, don’t leave me like this
Hell no
You’re bought and I'm sold
You’re giving me cold sweats, sweats

You brought me a reason to live, I traded my soul
I tasted apocalypse and I needed more
As you kill me, make me ill baby, please
I never wanted a curse on my tongue 'til you1Embed
