Fever Dream Lyrics
I bask in silence, want you to notice
Simple yet complex, ventricle taste test
I'm on that side eye
Blackheart and tongue-tied
I'm old and loaded
I want everything you fucking got

Find a way, we can find a way
At least today, we can be most anything
Float away, we can float away
Far away from everything
Dust to dust and face to face
I'm ashamed of what remains in me

You gotta bleed
To make me believe
Pain hides my scent, yeah
I need a brand new shadow

When dust makes dust and our faces meet
I disconnect from every string you tied to me
I bask in silence, want you to notice
Simple yet complex, ventricle taste test
I'm on that side eye
Blackheart and tongue-tied
I'm old and loaded
I got it all and I still want more

I wanna bleed
Make me believe
I'll hide my scent
I need a brand new shadow
Yeah, I need a brand new shadowEmbed
