The Unfortunate Lyrics
I'm sorry darlin'
I'm not the man I thought I was
And I might regret it
I got so good at giving up

I felt you fade away, fade away and I let you go
I know, I know, I know, I know

Lost in the moment
I prayed we'd found our way back home
God as my witness
I never meant to hurt you so

I watched you fade away, and all of our dreams went up in smoke
I know, I know, I know, I know

If you find some peace of mind in my complete disgrace
Well then, who am I to deny your heart anymore?

I'm sorry darling
You deserve a better song
It hurts to say it
But I know we both fell out of love
I watched us fade away and all of our dreams went up in smoke
I know, I know, I know, I know

If you feel the same
I'll find a way to let you go
I know, I know, I know, I know
Just know, it's hell without you hereEmbed
