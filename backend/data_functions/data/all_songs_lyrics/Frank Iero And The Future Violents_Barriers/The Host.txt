The Host Lyrics
I can't stand the fun we're having
Drifting off and rambling on
With high roads full of mass contusions
My crippling fears, and your designer jeans

You're choking on all your good decisions
While I'm basking in what I settled for
(I never wanted to want much more)

Unmade bed and blanket statements
You're playing house like we're home alone

On and on, so far gone
On and on, I'm so far gone

You're choking on all your good decisions
While I'm basking in what I settled for
(I never wanted to want much more)

What have I waited for?
I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I'd give up everything all for a glimpse
On and on, I'm so far gone
On and on, I'm so far gone
On and on, so far gone
On and on, I'm so far gone

And you're choking on all your good decisions
While I'm basking in what I settled for
(I never wanted to want much more)

I'm looking for a sign
I'm looking for a sign
I'm looking for a sign
I did it right2Embed
