Chosen One Lyrics
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' love me and touch me the right way
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' run up and jump in the fight with me
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' keep it buck like Milwaukee
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' show off, gon' show off
Get right with me, right with me

You could be a chosen one
Kiss me with your native tongue
Shoot it if you holdin' some
Miss me 'til the mornin' come
Beat it like you're hittin' a drum
Freak me 'til the world is done
Oh, oh, oh

Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' love me and touch me the right way
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' run up and jump in the fight with me
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' keep it buck like Milwaukee
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' show off, gon' show off
Get right with me, right with me
You could be a chosen one
Fuck these niggas, all of them
Shoot it if you holdin' some
Kiss me 'til you make me cum
Beat it like you're hittin' a drum
Freak me 'til the world is done
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Uh
Can't get enough, look at that
Make you walk, pistol grip on
From the kitchen to the livin' room
To label me as the one, debatable
But second to none, that suit me like a tailored suit
And a nigga up, up like Sailor Moon
Brought a totally different energy up in the room
Heard your fans want to keep you in the underground, cool
When I blow up, said I did it for MF DOOM
No cap, no cap
I keep it one hundred, blowin' hundreds at The Beverly
All facts, all facts
Go look for another and come back and say you'll never leave
Your neck, your back
I could bust it open, super soaker, make the pussy leak
I could break it down and put it back together properly
I know what you want and I know what you need
We should be lovin' each other crazy
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our days are through
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be lovin' each other crazy (We should)
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our... are through
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be lovin' each other crazy
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our days are through
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to3Embed
