Jet Black Lyrics
Yuh, yuh

She was a fan, but her friend didn't care
I like the ones who buy they own damn beers
If you wanna toast to the life that you live
Pour enough shots for the whole year
Jet black hair, baby, jet black hair
Matte black Jeep with the Rubicon grill
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, don't go there
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, come here

Shaped like pear, baby, jet black hair
You bought the drinks and I paid no care
Hold a nigga down, don't go nowhere
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, come here

We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me
Yuh, yuh
We goin' in there from the window sills
I don't mind if they watch, I don't care
Who gon' love you when your love ain't there?
Baby, that ass is just unfair
Jet black hair, baby, jet black hair
At least two grams in your blunt wrapped there
These two hands always land up on the small of your back
Should I ask if eyes can go there?

You bought the drinks and I paid no care
Couple more shots, we can all get to bed
Yes, Lord, like you livin' on a prayer
Play too much, baby, come here

We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me (Sent for me, yeah)
We peakin'
If this is the mood, then you should know
I have to be honest, I love it
We peakin'
If this is the mood, then you should know
I have to be honest, I love it
We peakin'

And the coldest part is I'm not even there
I watch your feed, but I don't feed into that
Just give me the news
I miss all the parties, but I'm still the best dressed, clean
As the curtain on him pulls back

Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me
We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone liftin' me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me
We peakin'9Embed
