Make It Better Lyrics
How do you mend when you're worlds apart?
Ooh, carry on
Ooh, from the start
Somehow, we fell in love, then fell right out of touch
And ooh, that was hard
But ooh, here we are
And it’s easier to walk away
Than to look for what would make you stay
Remember when we first met?
We were havin' so much fun
So, now, how can we both forget
Tellin' each other, "We’re the one"?
We would make love (We would make love)
At the drop of a hat
Remember that? (Yeah)
I remember you and me (You and me)
Close as any two can be (Two can be)
Now we're strangers in the night (In the night)
Awkward and uptight

Oh baby, do you wanna make it better?
Uh, ha, do you wanna stay together?
Hey, if you do, then let's please
Make some new memories
When you take somebody for your own
It can't survive on history alone
Yeah, meet me at the hotel, motel
Though we got a room at home
Go to a place that we don't know so well
It be nice, add a lil' spice
Try some new seduction (You and me)
Show each other how (Show each other how)
Uh, give each other new instructions
On what makes us feel good now
I just wanna make you feel good now
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C'mon)

Do you wanna make it better? (Yeah)
(Just wanna make it right, c’mon)
Do you wanna stay together? (Uh)
(I meant when I said it)
And it’s easier to run away
Than to look for what would make you stay
Do you wanna make it better?
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C’mon)
Do you wanna stay together? (Yeah)
(Just wanna make it right, c'mon)
If you do, then let's please
Make some new memories
Do you wanna make it better?
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C’mon)
Do you wanna stay together? (Yeah)
If you do, then let's please (Just wanna make it right, c'mon)
Make some new memories
Do you wanna make it better?
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C'mon)
Do you want to stay together? (Yeah)
If you do, then let's please (Just wanna make it right, c'mon)
Make some new memories
Do you wanna make it better?
Do you wanna stay together?11Embed
