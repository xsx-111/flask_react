Winners Circle Lyrics
You're only allowed three great women in your lifetime
They come along like the great fighters, once every ten years
Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Lewis
Sometimes you get 'em all at once
Me? I had my three when I was sixteen
That happens, what are you gonna do?
Maybe she's your first great one
Thanks a lot, Sonny
I think I'm gonna go for one

This is not some super conventional
Extra slick talk meant to convince you all
Master classes reduced to simple form
There's nothing formulaic about it
This, more that
Papa told you only open the door if he opens it first for you
Mama, sit down, help me get through
Is this how you felt on the day you found it?

Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool
This is not some take you out for lunch
Wine and dine you and cha you on counter tops
Fill your mind with cotton candy hearts
What's the odds you stay a while?
This, more that
Get to know me, kiss me slowly, hard to focus
They just don't make 'em like this no more, whoa
But I think I've found it

Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool

Cha, cha-cha-cha
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, ooh
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah
Somebody go (Somebody go)
Somebody go (Somebody go)
Somebody go get me
I'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)
I'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)
I'm 'bout to go in deep
That's not what I thought it was
But it's more than I bargained for
Somebody go (Somebody go)
Somebody go get me sober

Yeah
They gon' have to come for me
Came out my comfort zone to be amidst your company
Somethin' about the way you never gave it up to me
But let me know that I can get it  any day of the week
If talk is cheap, well then, I'm broke
With both hands on the sweeper, cleanin' up dirty secrets
Told you don't ever give me that gushy, but I didn't mean it
Bring her home and I'ma bust it out the residence
When I get the gushy, I go dumb like the President
Yes, lawd, I'm way up, word to Sacagawea
If the gushy was a sneaker, it'd be moccasin trainer
If the gushy wasn't so sweet, I could save it for later
But every time I fuck with someone else, I wish you was there
Kinda douchey I know, how the fuck I get here
I got hoes, I got hoes, we don't need to go there
On my way out a zone, somebody gon' give me body
Pick my feet off the floor, boy, I think I'm fallin'
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool2Embed
