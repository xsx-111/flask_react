Come Home Lyrics
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

Darlin', I have to be moved from afar
The truth is the only thing worth holdin' onto anymore (Anymore)
Untie me, let me loose from the cord
I'm so gone, so far, I deserve more (More, I deserve more)
Yeah

I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)
I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Who should I rest blame upon
When all of the signs are brightly drawn
And point back to your open arms? (Point back to your open arms)
Back too soon, but I'm here for the last of support
No longer bound by a broken heart (Bound by a broken heart)

I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)
I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

Somewhere in a plane over water
My love, my love
Home base, wifey turn it off before I touch down
You're all I need, all of me on my knees
Normally harmony, bumblebee, hummingbird
I'm a nerd, study you
What are you, WWF?
We fightin', we might need counseling
Possibly moreso me
Sounds to me frowns'll be grounds to leave
Hounds'll be lookin' for you before you drop a tear, apres diem
Stop pretending that I ain't him
I ain't them, dim sum dumpling
I remember when you start dyeing them silver hairs
And start hiding from your age
I ask, "Why? How come?"
Amazin' how time can run away from us
I'm no nun, you're no priest, but I promise, hun, you gon' see
A phenomenon, come with me
Like it's Ramadan, I don't eat
Like it's Comic Con, I'm a freak for you (Yeah!)
I'm begging now, pretty please with cherries on top
Hairy wet twat
Harriet Tub-man, I don't give up
And if your gut tells you to strut, then strut
Then I'll hail you a car, but what man won't beg?
You know I'm nutmeg
I will show up on a lil' moped
With a lil' puppy, it'll be fluffy
You will un-toughen, we can discuss it
You know I'm sufferin', I do miss my friend
I don't like my fin bent up, Tilikum, well, that's ill-informed
Sweet stuff, Willa Wonk', we stuck, Billabong
'Least at minumum we gon' get along
Peace and inner calm, geez, it's been a long
T-I-M-E, um, please, I'm feelin' dumb
Please, I'm feelin' dumb
Please, I'm feelin' dumb
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah8Embed
