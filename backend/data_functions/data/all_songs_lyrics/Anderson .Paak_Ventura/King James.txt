King James Lyrics
We've been through it all, though it could be worse
We've been moved around in a state of alert
There's nothing new or sharp about the cutting edge
If they build a wall, let's jump the fence, I'm over this

Cold stares can never put the fear in me
What we built here is godly
They can't gentrify the heart of kings
Let's just not talk about it
If I make a move, you're coming with me

What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? Coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? You're coming with me

Hey
(Okay now) Hey now
(Just don't stay down) Uh, can't stay now
(Let's go shake down) Until we get what we need, oh yeah
(Okay now) I'm okay now
(Just don't stay down) Yeah, can't hold me down
(Let's go shake down) And let it fall like the leaves, I wanna know
We couldn't stand to see our children shot dead in the streets
But when I finally took a knee
Them crackers took me out the league
Now I'm not much for games
But I play for keeps
And we salute King James for using his change
To create some equal opportunities

Cold stares can never put the fear in me
There's a movement we've been groovin' on
You can move or stay your ass asleep
Let's just not talk about it
Everything they tried to hide
We're taking back for yours and mine

What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? Coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me
What about the love
What about the seed? It's coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me
Okay now
Just don't stay down
Let's go shake down (Shake, shake, shake, shake)
Okay now
Just don't stay down
Let's go shake down (Shake, shake, shake, shake)2Embed
