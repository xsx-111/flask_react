Twilight Lyrics
Don't be ashamed, don't close the door
Oh, trust me, baby, I've been there before
And I know you think it can't get lower than the floor
Walk out the basement, let's take a tour

It happens to everyone
You're not the only one, girl
This is called growin' up, sugar
Be careful, but still have fun, yeah

You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place

I'm just another annoyin' voice (Annoyin' voice)
You've heard it so many times, you could make a chorus (Make a chorus)
And I know you wonder where that magic is stored (Magic stored)
Your mind is a stairway, knock on Heaven's door

It happens to everyone
You're not the only one, girl
This is called growin' up, sugar
Be careful, but still have fun, yeah
You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place
You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place

It happens to everyone
You're not the only one, girl
This is called growin' up, sugar
Be careful, but still have fun, yeah

You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place1Embed
