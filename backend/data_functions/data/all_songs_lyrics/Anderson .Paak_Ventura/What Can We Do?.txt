What Can We Do? Lyrics
Yeah
Uh

It's the rap singer, the hook master
Real life convict, son of a gambler
Heart made of stone, and he move so cold
'Cause my girl up and gone, she'll be back in the morn'
Go lil' mama, take your drama
Seems like I can't live without it
I ache and moan
'Cause my heart is broke
'Cause my love went wrong
Yeah, another bag and she'll love me in the morn'
While the bubble over stove
As I was dreaming of a bag, then I woke
You were starting to snore, wake your ass up
Layin' in a bed full of cash
You slowly rolled over and whispered back to me
"That's just the way things have to be"
Hey

What can we do? (Yeah, what can we do?)
What can we do? (What can we do, baby?)
What can we do? (Hey, what can we do?)
What can we do? (Do)
That's when the change comes
That's when the game's done
That's when the walls come tumbling down
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
They see me gettin' action
Started, it ain't no fun
Time to grow up and turn it around
Ah, ah, ah, yeah

Hey, what can we do? (Yeah, what can we do?)
What can we do? (What can we do, baby?)
What can we do? (Ooh, what can we do? Yeah)
What can we do? (Yeah)

To make it feel just like it used to feel
If my cup was empty, you could fill it (Yeah, yeah)
I feel you, yeah, yeah, I hear you
To make it feel just like it used to feel
If my cup was empty, you could fill it (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

What can we do, what can we do, what can we do?
(Yeah, what'cha sayin', Nate?)
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do? (Yeah)
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do? (Like that)
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do?
Damn, Nate, you sound good than a motherfucker, man
I need a blowout in my voice, man
Keep singin' that shit
Yeah, you can erase all that, man
Hell naw, we already paid for this studio session, my nigga, hold on
It sound good, bro, where you goin'?
Living gone
Ayy, Nate
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nate
Mmm, ah, ah yeah3Embed
