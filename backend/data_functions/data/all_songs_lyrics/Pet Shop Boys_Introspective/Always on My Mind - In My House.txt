Always on My Mind / In My House Lyrics
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could

Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

If I made you feel second-best
I'm so sorry I was blind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
One more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied

You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always in my house

You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always

"You are always on my mind it's true
I never thought of anyone else but you
You are on my mind and in my dreams
I should have stopped to make you see
You are always..."
You are always
"I worked so hard, I thought you knew
My love, I did it all for you
I never really had the time
I guess you couldn't read my mind
You are always..."
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always
Always
You are always

You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind

Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Maybe I didn't love you1Embed
