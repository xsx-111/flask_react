Clouds Lyrics
The Clouds are here they aren't up in
The sky. I cupped them with my hands
And reached up high. I said to these
Clouds. "No more am I blind I have to
See straight and that will
Make me unkind."
Visions of blue I'm angry I'm wise
And you. You're under cloudy skies
Blue air I crave blue air I breathe
They once chopped my heart the way you
Chop a tree. Told to equate achievement
With pain I took their top prize and paid
Them back with rain
Visions of blue I'm angry I'm wise
And you. You're under cloudy skies
Blue air I crave blue air I breathe
They once chopped my heart the way you
Chop a tree. Told to equate Achievement
With Pain I stole their top prize and paid
Them back with rain
Visions of blue I'm angry I'm wise
And you. You're under cloudy skies
Visions of blue
Perverse and strong and you. You're
Under cloudy skies. What I did once
I now do everydayEmbed
