Was There Anything I Could Do? Lyrics
She comes home and she's happy
She comes home and she's blue
She comes home and she tells him
Listen baby we're through
I don't know what happened next
All I know is she moved
Packed up her bags and her curtains
Left him in his room
Was there anything I could do?
Was there anything I could do?
She went out with her paint box
Paints the chapel blue
She went out with her matchsticks
Torched a carwash too
I don't know where she's living
All I got is a card
A picture of her at the pyramids
A knife held to her heart
Was there anything I could do?
Was there anything I could do?
She came down from the mountains
Said goodbye to her guru
She went back to her room
Lost herself in voodoo
I don't say that I blame her
People don't know what they want
If you spend your life looking behind you
You don't see what's up front
Was there anything I could do?
Was there anything I could do?
Was there anything I could do?
Was there anything I could do?
Putting out her fire
Putting out her fireEmbed
