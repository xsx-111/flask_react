Love Goes On Lyrics
There's a cat in my alleyway
Dreaming of birds that are blue
Sometimes girl when I'm lonely
This is how I think about you
There are times that I want you
I want you so much I could bust
I know a thing about lovers
Lovers lie down in a trust

Love goes on anyway
Love goes on anyway

The people next door got their problems
They got things they can't name
And I know a thing about lovers
Lovers don't feel any shame
Late at night with the lights down low
The candle burns to the end
I know a thing about darkness
Darkness ain't my friend

Love goes on anyway
Love goes on anyway
I'm gonna make you happy
I'm gonna spin you round
I'm gonna cut your strings

I put my foot flat down on the floor
I took it as far as I could
I took it down there to Sheridan Street
By the dark wood
Late at night when I want you
I lock you in my room
'Cause I know a thing about darkness
I know a thing about lovers
I know a thing about lovers
Lovers want the moon

Love goes on anyway
Love goes on anyway
Love goes on anyway
Love goes on anywayEmbed
