Quiet Heart Lyrics

The heater's on
The windows are thin
I'm trying hard
To keep this warmth in
I turn to her
She's sound asleep
Someplace I don't know
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

I tried to tell you
I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your quiet, quiet heart

Two hours on
My eyes are open
There's bad blood between us
What did I say
That made you cry?
Our dream won't die
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go
I tried to tell you
Yeah, I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your quiet, quiet
Quiet heart


What is that light?
That small red light...
Scorpio rising
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

I tried to tell you
I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your heart
I tried to hell her
I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss her quiet, quiet
Quiet heart1Embed
