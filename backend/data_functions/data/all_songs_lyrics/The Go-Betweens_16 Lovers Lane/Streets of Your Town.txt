Streets of Your Town Lyrics
Round and round, up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town

And don't the sun look good today?
But the rain is on its way
Watch the butcher shine his knives
And this town is full of battered wives

Round and round, up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town

And I ride your river under the bridge
And I take your boat out to the reach
Cos I love that engine roar
But I still don't know what I'm here for

Round and round, up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
They shut it down
They closed it down
They shut it down
They pulled it down

Round and round, up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
Round and round, up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
Round and round, up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
Round and round, up and down
Through the streets of your townEmbed
