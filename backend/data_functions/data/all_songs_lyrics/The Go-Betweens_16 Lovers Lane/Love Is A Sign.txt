Love Is A Sign Lyrics
I'm ten feet underwater
Standing in a sunken canoe
Looking up at the waterlillies
They're green and violet blue
Still the sun it finds
A place to light me
Still the sun it finds
That it's warm beside me
Green and violet blue
No matter what you say no matter what
You do
I want to be the one and
Love is a sign
The letters that we're writing
Baby they just break our hearts
And when we get back together again
There's just no time to start
No time to restore
It's all on the ground
What you've been doing
Against what I've found
And this is what I find
No matter what you say no matter what
You do
I want to be the one and
Love is a sign
I'm not a playboy or a poet
There's no cool water from the well
I wish you had a big house
And that your work would start to sell
Wave after wave
Our tension and our tenderness
Wave after wave
Our tension and our tenderness
Green and violet blue
No matter what you say no matter what
You do
I want to be the one and
Love is a sign
I know I'll see you again
The world is too big or too small
I won't be the madman then
It will be me that's come to call
Me in freezing weather
Snow cuffs on my wrist
You down my the river
London no longer exists
This is what I find
No matter what you say no matter what
You do
I want to be the one and
Love is a signEmbed
