Welcome To Paradise V1.0 LyricsHey poor, you don't have to be poor anymore
Jesus is here!
In the name of Jesus (Alleluiah!)
Feel like your life is going nowhere
Ten seconds... standby
Jesus is the son of God
Come in, Jesus (Alleluiah!)
Oh God, I'm a sinner!
I deserve to go to hell (Alleluiah!)
No sex until marriage
Oh God, I'm a sinner
I deserve to go to hell
The bible said you keep him out in the lie
In the name of Jesus
Jesus is the son of God
In the name of Jesus (Alleluiah!)
Hey poor, you don't have to be poor anymore
Jesus is here! (Don't tell the devil)
Hey poor, you don't have to be Jesus!Embed
