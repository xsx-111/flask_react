Until Death (Us Do Part) LyricsNow you have me
Now I'm there
Now I have you
Now you care
Now I got you
Now you care
Now you have me and
Now I'm there
Now we're tied - Until death us do part
Now I'm making my way inside
Now I'm feeding myself with you
And the more I grow, the more you decline
Now we're tied until death us do part

Now it's time for you to be sure
That the life we share will be long
That what can't be cured has to be endured
Now we're tied until death us do part
