Headhunter V3.0 LyricsToday he has no means, he's alone and anonymous
But written in his cells, he's got the marks of the genius
I'm looking for this man to make us rich and famous
I'm looking for this man to sell him to other men
One, you lock the target
Two, you bait the line
Three, you slowly spread the net
And four, you catch the man
You catch the man
You catch the man
I'm looking for this man to sell him to other men
To sell him to other men at ten times the price at least
I'm looking for this man who knows the rules of the game
Who's able to forget them to realize my aim
One, you lock the target
Two, you bait the line
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, catch the man
Catch the man
Freeze, shoot to kill or die
Freeze, shoot to kill or die
I'm looking for this man to sell him to other men
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, catch the man
Catch the man
You catch the man
I'm looking for this man
I'm looking for this man
To sell him to other men
To sell him to other men at ten times the price at leastEmbed
