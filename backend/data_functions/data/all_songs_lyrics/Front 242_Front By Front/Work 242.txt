Work 242 LyricsIs this the kind of work you'd like to do?
Tonight I meet my friends
Together we celebrate...
The body mutilated
Another mutilated body
We have agreed to try hypnosis
Have you gone completely mad?
I wake up freezing, bleeding in the basement
Oh my head, I don't remember anything
I guess the night was exciting
Listen carefully!
When I'm clear, I happen to regret
All the losses I will never retrieve
Hey you, hey me, carcass in the mirror
As hard as a rock and selfish to the core
Water, water everywhere
I've been waiting for the good times
I Nostri Sogni Sono Sempre Presenti
All the bodies mutilated
In the same obscene mannerEmbed
