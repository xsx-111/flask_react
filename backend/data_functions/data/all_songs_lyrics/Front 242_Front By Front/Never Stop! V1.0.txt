Never Stop! V1.0 LyricsNever stop
Never stop
We have ignition
We have control
Speed is reality
We've got to kick... start!
Can't you see
Don't you feel
It will never stop (never stop)
With no support
But strong conviction
Another step ahead
We handle the game
We handle the game
Well can't you see
Well don't you feel
It will never stop
Never stop
Never stop
We have ignition
We have control
Another step ahead
Don't you feel
Repeat our moves again
Non stop
I'll show you at the end
To reach the top!
It will never stop!
Never stop!Embed
