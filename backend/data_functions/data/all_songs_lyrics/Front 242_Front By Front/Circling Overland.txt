Circling Overland Lyrics1-1-2029, the stars are shining bright
Nerves connected to the center, we are tied to the machine
Invisible and silent, circling overland
The planemakers designed us to outturn and outmaneuver
Intruders in the skies, intruders in our skies
1-1-2029, tonight the stars are shining bright
Backbone of the fighter force, of the defence industry
Devoted tools of the power, warrants of the order
1-1-2029 tonight the stars are shining bright
Silicon advisers leading the way
We reach our cruising altitude
1-1-2029, West Europe, midnight
Invisible and silent, circling overland
Scanning, taping, filing, instantly checking
Every human, car and plane of the quarters we survey
CIRCLING OVERLAND
