Always This Way Lyrics
I'd like to say that I could've stayed
But she didn't want me to
I'd like to know if she had to go
Or if she made a point to
It's so hard to say
"Is it always this way?"
Must every heart break
Like a wave on the bay

Like to think that we're all a link
In what makes the world go round
Lately I wonder if all my pondering's
Taken up too much ground
I make my own way
So at the end of the day
At least I can say
That my debts have been paid


25 years, nothing to show for it
Nothing of any weight
25 more, will I never learn from it
Never learn from my mistakes
It's too soon to say
"Was I always this way?"
Well at the end of the day
My debts have been paid

Now she's gone and I'm all alone
And she will not be replaced
Stare at the phone, try to carry on
But I have made my mistake
At the end of the day
At least I can say
I made my own way
And my debts have been paid
