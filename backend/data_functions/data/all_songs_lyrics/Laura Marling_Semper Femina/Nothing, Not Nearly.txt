Nothing, Not Nearly Lyrics
I won't forget the late September
Where we basked among the midnight embers
But it's going like a half-remembered dream
Left and north of where we met
Thinking better of going west
Yeah we lost each other in that river stream
I thought I'd come and find you there
Wait until you lost your hair
And got your place out in the woods
You're not afraid of trees or bears
Or anything with tendencies
To wanna hurt you good

The only thing I learned in a year
Where I didn't smile once, not really
Nothing matters more than love, no
Nothing, no, not nothing no, not nearly

We've not got long, you know
To bask in the afterglow
Once it's gone, it's gone

I won't forget the late September
Where we danced among the midnight embers
But it's going like a half-remembered dream
Left and north of where we met
Thinking better of going west
Yeah we've lost each other in a river stream
The only thing I learned in a year
Where I didn't smile once, not really
Nothing matters more than love, no
Nothing, no, not, nothing no, not nearly

We've not got long, you know
To bask in the afterglow
Once it's gone, it's gone
Love waits for no one
We've not got long, you know
To bask in the afterglow
Once it's gone, it's gone
Love waits for no one1Embed
