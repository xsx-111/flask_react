The Valley Lyrics
I know she stayed in town last night
Didn't get in touch
I know she has my number right
She can't face seeing us

She sings in the valley in the morning
Many a morning I have woke
Longing to ask her what she's mourning
Course I know it can't be spoke

Perhaps she's had too much of love
Can be a sickly thing
That's why she mourns the morning dew
And the newness that it brings

She sings in the valley in the morning
Many a morning I have woke
Longing to ask her what she's mourning
Of course I know it can't be spoke

I love you in the morning
I love you in the day
I'd love you in the evening
If only she would stay
We love beauty 'cause it needs us to
It needs our brittle glaze
And innocence reminds us to
Cover our drooling gaze

She's down there in the valley
I know she wanders there
She's down there in the valley
I can see her golden hair

I love you in the morning
My angel of the west
I love you in the evening
And I will do my very best
I'll do my very best2Embed
