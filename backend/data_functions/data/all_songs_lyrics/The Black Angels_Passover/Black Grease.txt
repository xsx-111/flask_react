Black Grease Lyrics
You're a storm, you're so emotional
Moody and controlled, sly and involved
You're alright, you come to me in times
You make me realize I'm not the kindest guy

But I give, give, give, give
I give what I can give
So just give, give, give, give
Give me what you have, dear

Slow, you kept me in that storm
You showed me things galore
Made me want much more
And I denied, the things I saw inside
The things I saw inside is what really caught my eye

And you give, give, give, give
Just give what you can
And I'll live, live, live, live
Live while I can, dear

You're so surprised, you see me put up fights
You hear me realize, you come along for rides
You're just so kind, the eagle with red wine
You made me see that bright eye between me and time
To just kill, kill, kill, kill
You kill what you can
And you kill, kill, kill, kill
Anything you want2Embed
