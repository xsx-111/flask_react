Bloodhounds On My Trail Lyrics
Standing on the front porch looking left and looking right
The bloodhounds out to get me, I already feel the bite
The rules of the road state, to hate those who hate
Sleeping in wet coffins, frozen warnings melt away

But you say no to me, just quit saying no to me
Just stop saying no to me, 500 times a day see

The billboards on the highway are the prophets of today
The roadkill speaks in poems through ads and through campaigns
The warden has his rifle, and the sniper's like an owl
I'm hiding in the tall grass with God and Vernon Howell
