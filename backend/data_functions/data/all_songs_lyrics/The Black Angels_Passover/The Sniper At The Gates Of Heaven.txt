The Sniper At The Gates Of Heaven LyricsWhere do you go when heaven calls you?
What do you do? Who do you turn to?
How old will you be when they finally catch you?
Don't stop moving, they're right behind yah
When there's no one left on this earth you know
Who can save you kid, so just wake up wake up wake up
What is it like when hell surrounds you?
How hot does it get? I think I've already felt it
Is there any way out? you better find one
Where do you go? down, down the book says
When there's no one here in this world of truth
Who knows first hand so just wake up wake up wake upEmbed
