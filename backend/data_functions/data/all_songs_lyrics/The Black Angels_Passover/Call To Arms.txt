Call To Arms LyricsHe drives a 90,000 dollar Jaguar to work everyday
He put his wife and kids in the zoo cause he had nothing left to do
Nothing left to do
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo, ooo-hoo-hoo
He bought a ticket for heaven, but it expired in June
The gun went off, but it was never on
The trigger to the finger, the finger to the trigger
One eye took the aim, just behind the man's brain
But who is to blame? I just think he's plain Jane
Plain, plain Jane
When I awoke my head was up off the ground
Nature spinning, oh, but she's makin no sound
Blessed she tells us all that she knows
Yeah, let the people live
Let the riches flow
I found, well, I found you at the fault
And it didn't mean nothing at all
You keep your money in stocks at the county garbage dump
You spend your days on tar at the local gas pump
You came in on your own and you'll leave all alone
You came in on your own and you'll leave all alone
As a start we off'd go down the path
Of feilds of gold, a vision that soon will pass
A great mistake, the diamond on his face
Black as night, where the coral snake will strike
But I found, well, I found, you at the fall
And it didn't mean nothing at allEmbed
