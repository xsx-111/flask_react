Empire Lyrics
Oh, the empire's calling trying to hear his voice
While he’s preaching to the choir and that choir is death and noise
And he closes up his fist, and he sees if they exist

Angels with broken wings, melodic harmonies she sings
She brings you white daffodils, you place them on your windowsill
Then you open up your fist, and you see if they exist

Well you sit in dark forests, you’ve been there for quite a while
And when they come to take you, you just sit and smile
You say, “Hey, you take this. I’m gonna see if you exist.”

Oh, it’s time to leave here, and I still have my knife
And it’s pressed up against my body,, tonight's gonna be the night
And I cut my own wrist just to see if I exist1Embed
