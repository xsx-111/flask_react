The Prodigal Sun LyricsYou scare us, yeah, you welcome us
And you motion us to move our mouths
And we lie, yes, we lie
And you know our thoughts, you put them there
You free us, tell us where to fall
So we hide, yes, we hide
When I breathe again I swear it'll be with you
You make us, yeah, you cure us, yes
You kill the calf as we second guess the first try
The suns too cold, oh no
The darkness falls as nothing moves
Your heartbeat slows, it gets too cold so you sleep
Yes, we all sleep
When I rise again
I swear it'll be with youEmbed
