Fighting In Iraq  LyricsYesterday I got a letter from my friend fighting in Iraq
And this is what he had to say:
'Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time will be up some time in November
Don't forget', he said, 'to tell my sweet Linsey
And he's fighting in Iraq
He's fighting in Iraq
He's fighting in the Iraq war
What for?
Well, it was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Iraq
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the US of A
And this is what she wrote to say:
'Don't be alarmed, mistress Brown', the telegram read
'But your son is dead, oh, your son is dead'
And he's fighting in Iraq
He's fighting in Iraq
In the Iraq war
He's fighting in Iraq
In the Iraq war
War
Someone stop that war
Somebody please stop that war
Somebody stop that war
Somebody stop that war now
Please stop that warEmbed
