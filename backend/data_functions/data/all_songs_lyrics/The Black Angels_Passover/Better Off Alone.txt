Better Off Alone Lyrics
I feel so low

Try me out for the evening, living in a lie
Your figure is alarming, take me to that fire
I'm better off alone

Living with a lady, one who helps me to decide
Take me to that room girl, get me through this night
I'm better off with one

Punish yourself on the weekend, you sneak into that bar
Open up that box girl, all that whisky is gone
I'm better off aloneEmbed
