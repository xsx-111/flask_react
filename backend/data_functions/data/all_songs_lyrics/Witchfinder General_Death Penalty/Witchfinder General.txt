Witchfinder General LyricsI'm coming to get you, yeah
I'm coming to take you away
You witches are evil
You worship the devil
So listen to what I say
Come peacefully from out of your huts
Or I'll have you witches prey
Must destroy you
Play and toy you
And watch you wither away
Who's coming to get you
's coming to take you away
Find you guilty witch woman
Because I'm the Witchfinder General
Trial's begun and people come
From many towns around
Find them guilty just to please me
Feed them to a hound
Bite their brains and cut their veins
And strike them to the ground
Insult their bodies till they're dead
Let the soil be their surround
Who's coming to get you
's coming to take you away
Find you guilty witch woman
Because I'm the Witchfinder General
Well he picks us up, he knocks us down
He says he hates our slang
Plays with us like pawns in chess
Come on let's get a gang
If your girl is tight, he'll take a bite
Say witch with evil mange
If you've hope, let's grab a rope
And watch that bastard hang
Well you think you can beat me
Hang me completely
Should know better than that
I'll take your wenches
Lie them on benches
Feed them to a rat
And if you try me
Even deny me
Beat you, you're a pratt
So come on folks
Don't try provoke
'Cos to me you're a fragile gnat
Well I'm the Witchfinder GeneralEmbed
