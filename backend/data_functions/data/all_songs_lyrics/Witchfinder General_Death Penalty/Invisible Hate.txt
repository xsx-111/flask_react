Invisible Hate LyricsEconomy it fills my mind
I don't know where to turn
The laws, the rights, the outta sights
You know they all should burn
People saying don't tell me
That's none of my concern
One day close, so very soon
You know they'll learn
Invisible hate inside me now
Invisible hate 'cos I am down
Invisible hate inside me now
Invisible hate I've gotta get out
Peace is what I need right now
So thing don't you start
Go away and leave my soul
And leave my broken heart
'Cos if you stay you'll provoke me
And I know I'll die
So go away now, go away now
High, high up into the sky
Invisible hate. . 
I still don't know if you'll leave me
I hope you will before you kill me
Here I am, I tried to fight you
Hope I can and not delight you
Invisible hate when there's no joy
Invisible hate I've got oh boy
Invisible hate inside my soul
Like in your head are girls that go
I've fought my hate now here comes joy
How I fought it I don't know oh boy
Some say God, some say faith
I say sex, drugs, rock and beer
My beer
I've fought. . Embed
