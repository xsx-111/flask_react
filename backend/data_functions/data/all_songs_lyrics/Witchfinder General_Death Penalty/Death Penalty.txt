Death Penalty LyricsLife in prison, is it enough
For what they do
One day soon, so very close
It could be you
A life for a life, that's the way
The only way I say
The chair is best, also sweet
The power's all we pay
The power's all we pay
We'll end it all today
The power's all we pay
Thirty years is all they do
Less if they are good
All this time we pay their way
Goodies say we should
Then they're out, they're on the loose
To do it once again
Back in they go, the more we pay
We say they are insane
They say they are insane
Blown right out of their minds
Really gone insane
The people's vote it should be cast
The murderers would not last
Eject the filth from my lifestyle
Keep them just on file
To take a life it is a shame
They've only got themselves to blame
Death should be the penalty
Quick and cold and finally
Give them food and beds they say
The people they will pay
Treat them good and talk to them
Teach them how to pray
Does it work, of course not
We'll end it all today
As I said let's have a vote
Let them know our way
Let them know our way
We'll execute today
The power's all we'll pay
How many victims unlawfully killed upon the earth
Homicidal killers, can you tell me what they're worth
They never have a reason, never tell you why
We'll take their lives, save their souls, let them dieEmbed
