Free Country LyricsReality it is a lie
The briefest dream before I die
To comprehend the cosmic scheme
See the truth behind my dream
Look out for me
Let's trip on L.S.D
Look out for me
D.S. look out for me
Rocky's gold, leb is red
Black goes right to my head
Mushroom tea, a toke of weed
Amphetamine is real good speed
Look out for me
Come have some mushroom tea
Look out for me
D.S. look out for me
Lines of speed on a mirror face
Sniff it up through a biro case
Heroin is for the hero
It's a killer, you gotta say no
Look out for me
Let's trip on L.S.D
Look out for me
D.S. look out for me
Turn to drugs to free my mind
Just to see what I would find
Tabs are great, now ask the drummer
Smack my friend is just a bummerEmbed
