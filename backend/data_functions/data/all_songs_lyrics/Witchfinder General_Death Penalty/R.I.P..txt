R.I.P. LyricsThe screams and the dreams and the nightmares it seems are from Hell
Things lurk in the churchyard and raise from the soil those who dwell
They come from a cult of evil and bad, No relent
To search for the body they seek there that night whose consent
Oh yeah they're grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Lucifer drives in today
Grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Messing with the sacred way
The corpse it is taken to Satanist's Hill for it's fate
Where hundreds of demons and creatures from Hell there do wait
Its heart does not beat but it's body is given to Hell
The air it is silent and all that you hear is his bell
Oh yeah they're grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Messing with the sacred way
Grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Lucifer drives in today
With many strange ways here on this earth I fear
For many a soul that rests in the church, it is clear
Although they are dead and cannot move, they can't rest
For when darkness falls, the snatchers from Hell, they do quest
Oh yeah they're grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Messing with the sacred way
Grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Stealing the bodies for prey
Oh yeah they're grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Lucifer drives in today
Grave snatchers, yeah, church gate-crashers
Leaving a hole where he layEmbed
