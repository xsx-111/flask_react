No Stayer LyricsI want a woman 'cos it's Saturday night
I wanna make you feel alright
I'm going to lay you, do you know what I mean
I really wanna make you scream
Oh, ok
No stayer on a Saturday night
Alright
No stayer 'cos I'm feeling alright tonight
Back at her place, she was in the mood
She sucked and licked my food
When it was running all over her face
She rolled over and then we screwed
Alright, take it
No stayer on a Saturday night
Oh, do it
No stayer 'cos I'm feeling alright tonight
Oh, c'mon honey
Give it to me
Next morning, do you know what she said
She said "Will you be my guy?"
I just got dressed and I walked away
I said "Now girl, I don't stay"
Oh, you know
No stayer on a Saturday night
Never have been, never will be
No stayer 'cos I'm feeling alrightEmbed
