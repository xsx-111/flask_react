Those Whole Girls (Run in Grace) LyricsThose whole girls
Hurl down words
Run in packs
With bloom to spare
They know health
Know it well
Skim the cream
And fill the brim
Drip with news
Spin intact
Blaze and stun
And feel no lack
Breathe with ease
Need no mercy
Move in light
Run in grace
Run in grace
Run in grace
Run in graceEmbed
