Predictions LyricsLet's tell the future
Let's see how it's been done
By numbers. By mirrors. By water
By dots made at random on paper
By salt. By dice
By meal. By mice
By dough of cakes
By sacrificial fire
By fountains. By fishes
Writing in ashes
Birds. Herbs
Smoke from the altar
A suspended ring or the mode of laughing
Pebbles drawn from a heap
One of these things
Will tell you something
Let's tell the future
Let's see how it's been done
By dreams. By the features. By letters
By dropping hot wax into water
By nails reflecting the rays of the sun
By walking in a circle
By red hot iron
By passages in books
A balanced hatchet
A suspended ring or the mode of laughing
Pebbles drawn from a heap
One of these things
Will tell you something
Let's tell the future
Let's see how it's been done
How it's been doneEmbed
