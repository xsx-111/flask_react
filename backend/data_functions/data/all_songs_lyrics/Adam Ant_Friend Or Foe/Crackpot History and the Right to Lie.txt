Crackpot History and the Right to Lie LyricsPeople come, people go
How long I'll stay I just don't know
When showbiz is a dirty word
I hope my time will come
Crackpot history and the right to lie
People love, people hate
For my downfall they just can't wait
When showbiz is a dirty word
I hope my time will come
Crackpot history and the right to lie
I wish that everyone could see a show by Liza Minnelli
Such a marvelous lady with talent by the ton
Crackpot history and the right to lie
People lie, people hurt
Like to read their Sunday dirt
So every Jekyll needs a Hyde to blame the business on
Crackpot history and the right to lie
Every rebel that I've met
Say they're going to die and yet
I see them now and they ain't dead yet, and pushing forty one
Crackpot history and the right to lie
Pumping is a splendid gift
I hope you will catch my drift
Some like pumping in the lift
Just like the Scottish Tongs
Crackpot history and the right to lie
There is nothing like the sound of a nicely laundered pound
Trying to collect around forty million
Crackpot history and the right to lieEmbed
