Carousels Lyrics
Carousels twirl all around exited youth
I do not mind at all
We’re tonight in a world full of thrills—it can carry me up
Far above it all

It’s a long way down
From here to the sound
Watch the faces go ‘round
To the stars then the ground

Ferris wheels carried us away not so long ago
Times I’ve betrayed
Where would we be now if I had taken your hand?
Well the years they pass by slow don’t they?

It’s a long way down
From here to the sound
Watch the faces go ‘round
To the stars then the ground1Embed
