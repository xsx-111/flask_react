Little Mouth Lyrics
Please open my mind and take what's left
Please fill this cup, with senseless bliss
Let me sup, oh, let me suck upon that which does not exist
Teach the weak, oh, teach me please, to cease to resist

Through halls of glass, through tunnels of chrome
Through corridors of burnished stone
Through fields of crystal and the shards of my bones
May I open my eyes, but not see what I am shown

And may I find my way to the reason to come home
May I find my way to the foot of your throne
And may I find your arms around my neck
And may I find your little mouth inside of this ventEmbed
