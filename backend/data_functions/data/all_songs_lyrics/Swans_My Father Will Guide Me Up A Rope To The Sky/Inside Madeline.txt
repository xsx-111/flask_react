Inside Madeline Lyrics
The engine divine is inside Madeline
The stardust is yellow and red
And its mapping out of time inside of her head

Now there's always Madeline
Rising up from where our limbs intertwined
Now walking a random invisible line
Clutching like snow to the side of the vine

Now you're free, free to do nothing
Now you're free to drift across the sky
Now you're free to be a shape just becoming
Now you're free, inside Madeline

Dropping a tear in the palm of my hand
Making her mark in a desiccate land
Bring light to Madeline
Bring new life to Madeline1Embed
