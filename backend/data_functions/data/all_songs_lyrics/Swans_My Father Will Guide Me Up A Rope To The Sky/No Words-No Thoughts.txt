No Words/No Thoughts Lyrics

See that man, ego
Inner man, hollow
Soul of man, fallow
Hollow man, ego
See that man, zero
Zero man, hallow
Inner man, hollow
Fallow man, ego
See that man, hollow


See that man, hollow
Hater man, evil
See that man, follow
Hater man, evil
Hater man, zero

Long may he live, long may he live
Long may his children drift through the wind
To think is a sin, to think is a sin
Long may his world never beginEmbed
