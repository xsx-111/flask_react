My Birth Lyrics
Then I strangled your neck, because I love you too much
Then I kissed your red mouth, because I love you to death
Now mother I need you, I need your claws in my neck
Every breath that I breathe in, feeds the life that I lack

Now right here I was born, in the place where you kneeled
In a burning white sand, in the blood that you spilled
Far far in the distance, I hear the howl of the beast
I feel his breath on my face, I feel the edge of his teeth

And I'll swallow your sorrow, and I'll inhale your fear
And I steal your tomorrows, and I'll inject your tears
So please never forgive me, please spit on my name
But I hold on to my memory, and keep me to blame

Please need me to blame
Yeah you need me to blame
You need me to blameEmbed
