You Fucking People Make Me Sick Lyrics
Now, diamonds are falling
Through a new wound in the sky
Obsessions, pink children
They are laid out in a line
They are screaming, they are polluting
They are demanding their life
These wrong feelings, they are calling
The red leper of time
I love you (I love you)
I need you (I need you)
Oh, show me (Oh, show me)
How to shine (How to shine)
I love you (I love you)
Young flower (Young flower)
Now give me (Now give me)
What is mine (What is mine)3Embed
