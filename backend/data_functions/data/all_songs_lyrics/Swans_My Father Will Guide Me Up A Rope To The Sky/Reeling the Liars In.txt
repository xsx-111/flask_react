Reeling the Liars In Lyrics
Reeling the liars in
We are reeling the liars in
We are removing their face, collecting their skin
We are reeling the liars in
We are burning them in a pile
We are burning them in a pile
The only true thing, the place to begin
Is to burn up the liar pile

Now the sun will hide
Beneath the ridge tonight
Clear flames of revenge
Will lick the black sky
And I, I will sing
As you eat their tongues
For I am the saint
Who will lead them to us

So I'm reeling the liars in
Reeling the liars in
Here is my hand, now drive the nail in
I am reeling the liars in
Here is my tongue, now cut out my sin
We are reeling the liars in
There is only one way, one place to begin
By reeling this liar inEmbed
