U16 Girls LyricsI met a girl in LA
The million dollar kind
She was all for all or nothing
She was open all the time
But when I called her number
Her mother's on the line sayin'
You've no business as God's my witness
With a child as young as mine
So make sure that she's old enough
Before you blow your mind
She may look like she knows enough
But look her in the eye
And if so
Let her go
You'll let her down in style
I met a girl in Paris
She talked like Vera Lynn
And her eyes were filled with dewdrop
The moment I walked in
She was awfully nice
The kind that likes to win
But if I'd been wiser, a whole lot wiser
Then I might have thought again
So make sure that she's old enough
Before you blow your mind
She may look like she knows enough
But look her in the eye
And if so
Let her go
You'll let her down in styleEmbed
