More Than Us LyricsMore than us
And we are them
But they don't know
What's in their hands
It's more than you
And it's more than I
But it's more
And everybody calls it love
But I'm not really sure if it's love
At all
No, not anymore
More than he
More than she
They all sleep
But we just dream
More or less
Means more for us
But it's more
And everybody wants a hand
But I'm too busy holding up the world
To carry on
Oh, not anymore
I wish that I
Could fly, fly, fly away
And if I should fall
And you hear me call
Would you stay
More than us
And we are them
But they don't know
What's in their heads
It's more than you
And it's more than I
But it's more
And everybody calls it love
But I'm not really sure if this is love
At all
No, not anymore, oh
Anymore
Anymore
