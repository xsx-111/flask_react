I Love You Anyways LyricsYou were on my mind inside the cinema
You looked so beautiful, I almost had to go
And when I got outside I thought of you again
I think you should be framed in some Fine Art gallery
I know you'd disagree with me but I love you anyways
And should I climb high my dreary city walls
They make me feel so small, oh, let me fade away
This city's so cold and old, forever rain or snow
I'd really love to come and go, oh, won't you go stay with me
I know you'd disagree with me
I just know you'd disagree but I love you anyways
You were on my mind inside the cinema
You looked so beautiful, I almost dried an eye
And when I got outside I caught the 44
It dropped me outside my front door
Forgot what I'd been living forEmbed
