The Line Is Fine LyricsLook at me, I'm so disgusting, I will never find another
Quite like you, you make me blue with the things you do
Look at you, you're so familiar, we could be so cool together
All the time could all be fine, we're on the line, the line is fine
Open up my window, the line is fine
Standing on the ledge, well, I don't look down
Looking at the people, well, they all look fine
It's not just life or death
Yesterday we talked together but tonight
It's just the weather chilling me
What's the point in silly talking, we could get there quicker walking
Down the line could all be fine but we're on the line, the line is fine
Open up my window, the line is fine
Standing on the ledge, well, I don't look down
Looking at the people, well, they all look fine
It's not just life or death
But staring at the faces standing in a row
Thinking of all the places that they have yet to go, they don't know
Open up my window, the line is fine
Standing on the ledge, well, I don't look down
Looking at the people, well, they all look fine
It's not just life or death, the line is fine
It's not just life or death, the line is fine
The line is fine, the line is fine
The line is fine, the line is fine
The line, the line, the line is fine, the line is fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine...Embed
