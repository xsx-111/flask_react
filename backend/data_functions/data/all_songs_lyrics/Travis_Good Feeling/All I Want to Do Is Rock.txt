All I Want to Do Is Rock LyricsHey
I would really like to talk with you
Girl
Do you have the time to stop?
Say
All I wanna do is rock
If this was any other day
I'd turn and walk the other way
But today
I'll stay
Not walk away
Hey
I'm a foot without a sock without you
Love
You seem to work around the clock
Say
All I wanna do is rock
If this was any other day
I'd turn and walk the other way
But today
I'll stay
Not walk
Just rock
Hey!
Love!
Say
All I wanna do is rock
If this was any other day
I'd turn and walk the other way
But today
I'll stay
