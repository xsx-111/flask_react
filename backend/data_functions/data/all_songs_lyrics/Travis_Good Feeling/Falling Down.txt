Falling Down LyricsYou think, I don't know
I swear, that I do
This time on my hands
I've had all this time
And I got a kick out of you
Now I'm falling down
And I'm felling sick how 'bout you
Oh I'm falling
But you seem out of sorts
But I know we'll be fine
These chances we take
Time wastes so much time
But I can't stand anymore
Without falling down
And I'm getting used to the floor
Forever falling
And I got a kick out of you
Now I'm falling down
And I'm feeling sick how 'bout you
Oh I'm falling
Yeah I'm fallingEmbed
