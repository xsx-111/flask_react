Tied to the 90's LyricsHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
We're tied to the 90's
In the middle
I'm terribly frightened (Hey)
I'm takin' it fast
Takin' it slow (Hey)
There's thunder and lightning (Hey)
It's terribly frightening
Oh, Lord knows
Where it goes
But I know
That if so
I want to tell you
We're tired of the 90's
We're tired of the 90's
But we're tied to the 90's
Tied to the 90's
Remember the 80's? (Yes)
They were something (Yes)
Worse than the 90's (Hey)
We're stuck in a path
Fashion is fast (Hey)
And nothin' is lasting (Hey)
It's all ghetto blasting
Oh, Lord knows
Where it goes
But I know
If so I want to tell you
We're tired of the 90's
We're tired of the 90's
But we're tied to the 90's
Tied to the 90's
Oh oh no
It's not long to go on
The hi-fi five alive ()
That's it I'm stayin' in bed
'til my hair falls out
Everything's old
It's said I like my wig
And I hate myself
I know it's all in my head
Hey, hey, hey, hey
We're tired of the 90's (Hey)
We're tired of the 90's (Hey)
We're tired of the 90's (Hey)
But we're tied to the 90's (Hey)
Oh we're tied to the 90's (Hey)
We're tied to the 90's (Hey)
We're tied to the nines
Tied to the nines
Tied to the 90'sEmbed
