Good Day to Die LyricsWhere is your mother, where is your father
Two little children locked in the cupboard
Into the wide world, high on the highwire
What would you give to fly away, away, away, away, away
Girl with the flower, boy with the hammer
Lost in a forest on another planet
Find me the exit, find them the way home
Find all the love they took away, away, away, away, away
'Cause your head is a brick wall and your heart is a football
And your eyes broken windows, when you cry it's a good day to die
And your head is a brick wall, and your heart is a football
And your eyes broken windows, when you cry it's a good day
'Cause your head is a brick wall and your heart is a football
And your eyes, it's a good day to die, to die, to die, to dieEmbed
