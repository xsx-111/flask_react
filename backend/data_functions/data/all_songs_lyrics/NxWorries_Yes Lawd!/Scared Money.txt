Scared Money Lyrics
My time ain't long, and it sure ain't free
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me
Scared money don't make none, baby, talk is cheap
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me
(Come on, what's the word)
Do it now, do it now
Put that loving on me
(Whats the word, what's the word)
It ain't never make none
(Come on, what's that word)
Do it now, do it now
Put that loving on me
(Waste my time)
(Come on, what's that word)

My time ain't long, and it sure ain't free (waste my time)
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me (come on, what's the word)
Scared money don't make none, baby, talk is cheap (waste my time)
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me (what's the word)

Is it real or is it phony
There's no need, no time to even be here if I don't have to (come on, what's the word)
Nigga don't you play with my money
I got way too much to lose
I swear to God, I might hurt you
My time ain't long, and it sure ain't free
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me
Scared money don't make none, baby, talk is cheap
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me
My time ain't long, and it sure ain't free
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me
Scared money don't make none, baby, talk is cheap
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me
My time ain't long, and it sure ain't free
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me
Scared money don't make none, baby, talk is cheap
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me

Hey baby, hey baby, to you
It's not right for me to 3Embed
