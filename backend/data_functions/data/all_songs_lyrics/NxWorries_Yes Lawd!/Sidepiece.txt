Sidepiece Lyrics
Um, um, um
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah

Off the top you know your love is nothing I can bargain for
It's been a while, I do admit I've been back and forth on my bullshit
It's hard for me to keep the promise ring when I head out on tour
One won't do and two is not enough for me, no
But if you give me time, I've been cleared to love
Wait for me patiently bae, you know I'll be faithful

I just want you
I want you
So I'll give up my sidepiece just to make room
I just want you
I want you
So I'll give up my sidepiece and make it come true

Whose love is this anyway?
Say, is it mine for the take?
And don't lie, I can try harder for Christ sakes, these days
My friends and foes are tricking off on fancy anniversary vacays
Is it my time? Or am I too late?
But since you held me down
It's best I say the vows
Loving for better or worse, hope you don't say no
I just want you
I want you
So I'll give up my sidepiece just to make room
I just want you
I want you
So I'll give up my sidepiece and make it come true

And make it come true bae
I want you
Make it come true, oh true
I'll make it true for you baby
I want you

Lend me your ear
I'll swear to never break your heart if I don't have to do it
Give me your head, I swear to never put another one over you
Lend me your ear
I'll swear to never break your heart if I don't have to do it
If I don't have to
I'ma do what I have to do just for you

And make it come true
I'll make it come true for you baby, baby
It's my time
How does it feel to (?)
Come true, come
Take know it was true
She's on me now
