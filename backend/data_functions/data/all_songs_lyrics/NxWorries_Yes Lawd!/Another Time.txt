Another Time Lyrics
Who brought out his latest to the ball
Who threw up a prayer and hit the mark
Of course it's out the way, get in the car
Of course you have to pay to play at all

But who you think that I look up to?
Who you think I got my game from?
Oh, I bet you thought it was you
Who you think I got the game from?

Yeah, who brings out the bands and hits the mall
Who takes all the chances, win or loss
You came a long way from the A-town
Numbers still the same, but you don't answer too many calls
Now baby, who put all the plastic in your bottom
Who spilt all the powder on my floor?
Get out the seat, you're too big for the two door
Sometimes you have to walk before you soar

But who you think that I look up to?
Who you think I got my game from?
Oh, I bet you thought it was you
Who do you think I got the game from?
Word to my OG, the game that he taught me will always suffice
It's the reason that I'm still alive
Big grandaddy, grandpa, my father and now it's my season to shine
It's bigger than you, it's bigger than I
From the start was the word
The solid rock that I stand upon
Yeah, only as strong as the base that you're building on
All this to gain if you can't stake your claim in this great big world
It's nobody's fault but yours

But who you think that I look up to?
Who you think I got my game from?
Oh, I bet you thought it was you
Who you think I got the game from?

Ayo, we got a problem
They're back
Ayo, we got a problem
They're back
Yeah, those cats are back, on the real, what we gonna do?Embed
