Wngs Lyrics
Baby, get your shit together
We hitting the town
It's been a long time since we drank all night
I wanna see that ass move around

Baby, get your shit together
I'm talking right now
Pick out your shoes and your favorite smelling perfume
I'm on my way home, you know exactly what I wanna do
Go get the liquor, leave the kids at your sister's
A little while longer, longer, I'm gon' get you
Go with your big ass, girl
I want you, you still a nasty girl
If I don't tell you, somebody else will
I want you, I hope you know it still

Baby, get your shit together
We hitting the town
It's been a long time since we danced all night
I wanna see that ass move around

Baby, get your shit together
I'm talking right now
It's been a long time, long time1Embed
