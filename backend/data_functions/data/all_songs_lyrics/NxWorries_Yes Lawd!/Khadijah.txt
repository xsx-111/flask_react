Khadijah Lyrics
Heaven I need ya
Can't wait 'til I see ya
Until the day I'm wide awake
I'll find my own Nirvana in the lap of Khadijah
Lord don't take me
Laid up with a Libra
I'm battlin' demons
Until the day I'm wide awake
I'll find my own Nirvana in the smoke of my reefer
Lord don't leave her

Cops wanna see a nigga dead
My plug chargin' double for the strain
My lady been on a young nigga's head
My sidepieces just chose up and fled
Kutless ain't runnin' like it used to
Money ain't comin' like the usual

Look to the sky and lift up my head
Word to my mother, mother's grave
Heaven I need ya

Heaven I need ya
Can't wait 'til I see ya
Until the day I'm wide awake
I'll find my own Nirvana in the lap of Khadijah
Lord don't take me
Laid up with a Libra
I'm battlin' demons
Until the day I'm wide awake
I'll find my own Nirvana in the smoke of my reefer
Lord don't leave her
Sister said, "Baby come see your nieces"
Mother said, "Baby go get that Jesus"
Brother said, "Nigga you look a mess"
Back and forth, rockin' on a ledge
My whole world runnin' 'round flesh
The whole world got me so vexed

Look to the sky and lift up my head
Word to my mother, mother's grave
Heaven I need ya

Heaven I need ya
Can't wait 'til I see ya
Until the day I'm wide awake
I'll find my own Nirvana in the lap of Khadijah
Lord don't take me
Laid up with a Libra
I'm battlin' demons
Until the day I'm wide awake
I'll find my own Nirvana in the smoke of my reefer
Lord don't leave her1Embed
