H.A.N. Lyrics
Hoe ass niggas, Hoe ass niggas
Oooh, yeah
Hoe ass niggas, Hoe ass niggas

Just travelling around town, trying to make my rounds
I came across these hoe ass niggas, hoe ass niggas
Was doing pretty fine, one day at a time
Until I saw you hoe ass niggas, Hoe ass niggas

Get the fuck, get the fuck from around me
Hoe ass niggas, Hoe ass niggas
Oooh
Get the fuck, get the fuck from around me
Hoe ass niggas, Hoe ass niggas

I'll never be the same, got me fucked up in the game
Thanks to all you hoe ass niggas, hoe ass niggas
Give a fuck about your job, give a fuck about your blog
You'll always be a hoe ass nigga, hoe ass nigga

Awe, yes, now, you may be unaware, even at this moment you could be standing next to a hoe ass nigga
Now, no, now don't be alarmed
This is a very serious moment
I need everyone to close their eyes, all eyes closed, all heads bowed
Now If I'm talking to you hoe ass niggas, I need you to raise your hands and come to the front
You sir I see you, hoe ass nigga in the back I see you, come to the front
Nobody looking now, come to the front, it's okay, it's okay
You sir, to the left, hoe ass nigga to the left come up
Actually, stay there
Deacon, go ahead and pray for him - lay hands on him actually (come here you bitch ass nigga)
Lay hands
Better you than me
All hoe ass niggas in the building, I need you to come forth we're gonna pray for you right now
Get the fuck, get the fuck around from around me
Hoe ass nigga, Hoe ass nigga

You know what?
You know what?
I ain't even mad at you
'cause you a hoe
I knew you was a hoe before you moved up here2Embed
