Kutless Lyrics
Yeah yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah

All this room in the Kutless
All this good, good, I'm loving, oh
Let's cruise for the moment
Let's do what they say can't be done
All this room in the Kutless
All this good, good, I'm loving, oh
Let's cruise for the moment
Let's do what they say can't be done
All this room in my Kutless
All this good, good, I'm loving, oh
Let's groove for the moment
Let's do what they say can't be done
All this room in the Kutless
All this good, good, I'm loving, oh
Hey, let's groove for the moment
Let's do what they say can't be done

1-2, 1-2, ah yeah, NxWorries!Embed
