Jodi Lyrics
Oh baby stop
You know I'm gonna tear that ass up later right? With your sexy ass...
You like my hair like this?
Shit is cute. Hol' on...somebody at my door, the fuck?
Well get it then
Ain't tell nobody to come over...
Babe run in the kitchen and make me a baloney and cheese sandwich?
Alrightâ€”with mayonnaise?
Yeah, put a lot of mayonnaise on my shit
Who this?

Jodi is a friend of mine
But you know she can get it
I keep it in the back of my mind
I'll be there when you get it
Jodi's a friend of mine
All these hoops I have to go through to get it
Jodi is a friend of mine
But you know she can get it
I keep it in the back of my mind
I'll be there when you get it1Embed
