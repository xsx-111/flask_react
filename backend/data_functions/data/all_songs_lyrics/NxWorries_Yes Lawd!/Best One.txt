Best One Lyrics
Oh, never knew a love stronger
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Down in the rain called love

Best love, yes love
By far
Best love, that's my lady

You love me like you know I could be leaving in a moment's notice
You telling me to stay until the morning
You know a nigga homeless
You give me everything inside the showroom
Your old school trophies
You used to work the small forward
Now you working corporate, dipping in a sports whip

I hope I never have to cut you off (Best love)
You're my best one (Yes love)
By far
I love it (Best love, that's my lady)

I think she could be in it for the long run
My niggas said I'm on one
I never knew a love stronger
My heart is a great big boulder
Hey, you fuck me like you know this could be something like your very last moment
I could leave it at the drop of a Fedora
But damn it girl I want you
I hope I never have to cut you off (Best love)
You're my best one (Yes love)
By far
Yeah, I love it (Best love, that's my lady)
Best love
I love it (Yes love)
By far
Best love, that's my lady

I hope I never have to cut you off (Best love)
I swear to God (Yes love)
By far
I love it (Best love, that's my lady)
You with me but you knew I could be... (Best love)
Yes love
By far
Yeah (Best love, that's my lady)

You with me but you knew that I could do it by my lonely
You fix a nigga cheese grits and cornbread
You know a nigga hungry

Best love
I swear to god (Yes love)
By far
That's my, that's my lady
I swear to god (Best love)
Yes love
By far
That's my, that's my lady
She's such a show off (Best love)
She's such a cold one (Yes love)
She know she go so hard yeah (By far)
She's such a star (Best love, that's my lady)
She's such a show off (Best love)
She know she go so hard yeah (Yes love)
She's such a cold one (By far)
She's such a star (Best love, that's my lady)
Yeah!

You know what? I ain't even mad at you
Because you a hoe
I knew you was a hoe before you moved up here
I shouldn't have never let you live in my house1Embed
