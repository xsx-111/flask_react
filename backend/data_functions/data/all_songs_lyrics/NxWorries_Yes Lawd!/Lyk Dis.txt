Lyk Dis Lyrics
Yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Don't want your heart, don't want your love
I want the head, I want the tongue
Who put the pussy in the coffin?
Then make it rise to god above
You would be down on all occasions
I fuck the sense up out your bank
Don't call me common, call me Crazy
No need to thank me, yours for the taking

And yeah, would you know, would you know it
Good love in the morning?
Only one way to show it
Turn around, let me go in

Let your hair down (Just like this)
Poke your back out (Just like this)
Talk dirty to me (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh when you do it (Just like this)
Say my name love (Just like this)
Now pick your legs up (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh when you do it
And I'm the favourite
Keep on your heels, take off your leggings
Who turned you on, and crawling, begging?
Who told your mum you'd have my babies?
I won't be long, I won't be brief
You at your peak is all I need
Something to hold you for the long run
Come get this awesome, won't you take it off for me

And yeah, would you know, would you know it
Good love in the morning?
Only one way to show it
Turn around, let me go in

Say, eye contact (Just like this)
Bring your arms back (Just like this)
Take the whole thing (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh when you do it (Just like this)
Say my name love (Just like this)
Now pick your legs up (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh when you do it, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, everything you do, oh when you do it
(Yeah yeah) Hey!
(Good love)
(Wrong way) Say
(Turn around) Hey!16Embed
