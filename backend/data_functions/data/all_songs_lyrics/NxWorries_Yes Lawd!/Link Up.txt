Link Up Lyrics
Bad bitches ought to link up
Two step and then we'll drink up
Young nigga with a mean strut
Dance with me if you keep up

Staring me down to get a clear view (Come on)
Breaking your neck to get a clear view (Come on)
Look at the lame nigga you came with
He can't dance the way your mans do
Look at my dip, watch the footwork
Won't you come over, get this good work
Tell that nigga go and get a cold one
We gon' dance until the songs done

Come on! Don't hate the groove
If a bitch wanna choose, gonna shake her loose
If a nigga act rude, I'ma take his boo
'Cause I only wanna dance with you (Come on!)
Don't hate the boss
If a bitch wanna choose, gonna take a loss
If a nigga act rude, I'ma take his broad
'Cause I only wanna dance with you
Come on, come on, come on!
Bad bitches ought to link up (Hey)
Two step and then we'll drink up
(Uh, sip somethin', bitch)
Young nigga with a mean strut
Dance with me if you keep up

Spinning around, I want you all night
Fucking around, I'll take you home tonight
Look at them pretty girls you came with
Tell them they can all get a dance, too
Look at my slide, that nigga footwork
Whipping my wrist, that nigga cookwork
Baby, we should go get a cold one
One more time before the songs done

Come on! Don't hate the groove
If a bitch wanna choose, gonna shake her loose
If a nigga act rude, I'ma take his boo
'Cause I only wanna dance with you (Come on!)
Don't hate the boss
If a bitch wanna choose, gonna take a loss
If a nigga act rude, I'ma take his broad
'Cause I only wanna dance with you
Come on, come on, come on!
Bad bitches ought to link up (Hey)
Two step and then we'll drink up
(Uh, sip somethin', bitch)
Young nigga with a mean strut
Dance with me if you keep up
Bad bitches ought to link up
Two step and then we'll drink up
Young nigga with a mean strut
Dance with me if you keep up8Embed
