Intro Lyrics
It's two thousand and motherfuckin'
You know?
Summertime was hot, we burnt it down
What's good with these niggas?
Man, all I can say is
The money's coming in the mail every month, homie
I'm far away, the fuck back, I got a nice ass Rollie pack
Far away from y'all hating ass niggas
You feel me?
Shit real good, man
My spit game is enhancing
Niggas is taking all types of chances
Wanna dance with the boy?
Nigga, you know y'all can't fuck with me, man
For real, I got love for niggas who show love back, man
And then they be turn around tryna' hate on it, nigga
Don't hate on the flow, nigga
The flow is profusious, nigga
Y'all niggas is scared, I feel it in
I feel it, you shakin' in your fuckin' draws, niggaEmbed
