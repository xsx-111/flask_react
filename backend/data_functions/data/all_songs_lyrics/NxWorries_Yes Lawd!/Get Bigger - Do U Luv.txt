Get Bigger / Do U Luv LyricsPart I: Get Bigger
I left home at 17 had to lighten the load
I was young but I was keen to survive on my own
In the fall gotta get it with my brother in law
Shopping work, bagging groceries, pushin' them carts
I was grateful to be working but say my back is hurtin'
I don't think it's the purpose, no this can't be the call
At night, I workin' grave, just counting the time
On my break I wrote a song 'bout the love of my life
This ain't right
Couple dollars and change
Walking home in the rain
Jump in the front of the train
Bitch, I might
On top of the roof, empty bottles of brew
Take a hit of my J, I'm in flight
Closing my eyes visioning in Monte Carlos with tinted windows and balling legitimate
Open my eyes I was in the same predicament
The next day I called in; said "I quit"
Bitch, I get bigger

You and me have to get bigger
I'm jumping the wall, raising the bar
Taking no bullshit
You and me have to get bigger
I'm legit, I'm legit
Too on, everybody rooting for me since I got a new jawn
Other bitch was too corny
My routine, fixing turkey and cheese
Now I got a new broad who can run and cook for me
Couldn't tell a nigga nothing, she couldn't do wrong
Had my nose wide open, I could sniff a cue-ball
Tenderoni, taking all of my time
It's the power of the P-U-S-S-Y, ain't that right
Split up the bank, gave her all of my change
Coppin' diamonds and rings
I can't lie
Stomach to leave
She said, "Music or me?"
The fuck do you mean, this ain't right
Closing my eyes visioning
Living with this bitch could end up giving me instant misery
Open my eyes, she was kissing my constituent
I threw that bitch off the cliff
And as I get bigger

You and me have to get bigger
I'm jumping the wall, raising the ball
Taking no bullshit
You and me have to get bigger
I'm legit, I'm legit
