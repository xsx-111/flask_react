Fkku Lyrics
(I do love you)
(I do love you)
(I do love you)
(I do love you)
(I do love you)

Fuck you, fuck you and even your stank, your funny looking rank ass, ugly baby. I hope they come up with a new ass whooping just for you, that some scientists gather a group and they do research, need tax dollars and everything in a secret lab, and they test and the product develops every little thing to find a new and inventive way to whoop your ass. That's what I hope. I hope there's a new way to put my foot up your ass one day. We got fucking talking watches now, and I hope they come up. That as soon they have the funds, they have a new way to whoop your ass. I hope somebody comes into your house and pisses all over everything, and haphazardly, their piss is very flammable, and they light that bitch up, and your house burns to the ground. I mean to the dust

I've been close to moving you out the way
But I still love you (I do love you)
Sometimes you drive a nigga crazy
But I still fucks with you (I really do)

This is the new season
Might have to peel that sticker off man4Embed
