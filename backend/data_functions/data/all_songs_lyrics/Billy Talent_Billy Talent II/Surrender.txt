Surrender Lyrics
She reads a book from across the street
Waiting for someone that she'll never meet
Talk over coffee for an hour or two
She wonders why I'm always in a good mood

Killing time before she struts her stuff
She needs support and I've become the crutch
She'll never know how much she means to me
I'd play the game but I'm the referee

(Surrender) Every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) Every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) All the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) All the hope that I lost you have found
Surrender yourself to me

Even though I know what I'm looking for
She's got a brick wall behind her door
I'd travel time and confess to her
But I'm afraid she'd shoot the messenger

(Surrender) Every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) Every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) All the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) All the hope that I lost you have found
Surrender yourself to me
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me
This flower don't belong to me
Why can't she belong to me?

Every word, every thought, every sound
Every touch, every smile, every frown
All the pain we've endured until now
All the hope that I lost you have found

(Surrender) Every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) Every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) All the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) All the hope that I lost you have found

(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender) Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender) Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender) Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask13Embed
