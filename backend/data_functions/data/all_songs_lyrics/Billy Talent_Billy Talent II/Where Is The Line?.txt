Where Is The Line? Lyrics
Urban Hipster, the new gangster
Fronting by the club
A new wave mannequin packing haircuts
Instead of packing guns
Magazines from overseas
Won't teach you how to feel
They trade in their hearts for indie rock charts
To tell them what is real

When did they assume putting on a costume
Gave them a right to ostracize?
Out of the woodwork, art aficionados?
Answer one question

Where is the line, where is the line
Between your fashion and your mind?
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line, where is the line?
To be yourself is not a crime
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
She sells street cred with no smile
At the local record store
She's acting the role and dressing the part
Pretending to be bored
The truth about conformity is
It bites without a sting
Trends come and go, but when you're alone
It doesn't mean a thing

When did they assume putting on a costume
Gave them a right to ostracize?
Out of the woodwork art aficionados?
Answer one question

Where is the line, where is the line
Between your fashion and your mind?
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line, where is the line?
To be yourself is not a crime
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line, where is the line
Between your fashion and your mind?
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line, where is the line?
To be yourself is not a crime
Where is the line, where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!

Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!Embed
