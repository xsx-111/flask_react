Fallen Leaves Lyrics
In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride until the coast
To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searching for something I couldn’t find at home

Can’t get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I’ll be fine
I swear to God, this’ll be my one last time

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
When it gets dark in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head will soon be fed
By the vultures, that circle round the dead

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I never once thought
I’d ever be caught
Staring at sidewalks
Hiding my track marks
I left my best friends
Or did they just leave me?

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

Run away before you drown!
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown!
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground10Embed
