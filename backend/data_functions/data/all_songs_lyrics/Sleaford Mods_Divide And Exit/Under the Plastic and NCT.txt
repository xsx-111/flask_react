Under the Plastic and NCT LyricsRyvita
Ryvita
Crack black pepper
Comrades pick up your arms
The long arm of the lawn is indeed in charge
I won't talk to nice people if they look rich
I know it's not on mate, I'm such a fuckin' bitch
Surfing comments
Lookin' at the likes
Whilst the coppers chase bandits through the top valley skies
To disagree on social networking sites
Is to kill the counter-culture
The overturn has died
We pander to the camera
And we want to be observed
We dont get what we ask for
We get what we deserve
Stale fags hang on my clothes like indie band badges
As I remember last night ignoring people I don't like
Trying to buy a pint
And what does it matter
What if I rot inside a care home
With eight of the bastards
Immobile with crap banter
Oh look there's Angry J - wah heeeey!
Give us a tinkle on the rattling joanna, mate
Under the plastic and NCT
Of grained handmarks devour me
Under the general weight of it all
Exist impossible visions of you
It's one of them ennit
The violent exit
Let's fuckin' bin it
Ryvita existence
A pointless opposition to the fat
Of pointless State resistance
And the State is no longer your voice
The mechanics hijacked by the lies
In false choice of a false fuckin' choice
Tied up in death
I hate the terror
The horrible fear
Whilst life knifes you as it screams:
"You got fuck all left!"
Under the plastic and NCT
Of grained handmarks devour me
Under the general weight of it all
Exist impossible visions of you
People might be in groups willingly
Let 'em get on with it
You can't expect people to listen to your fucking
Mouth just because you don't believe in it
Thousands of Saturday lager bellies punching the air
Denouncing the value of somebody else's flag
Whilst viciously believing in theirs
Fucking useless this well-trodden street
Vague notions about the so-called elite
And that moulds spit Trent Bridge chaos
It's not really is it?
Cardboard heavies
Drones to the delusions of a never-never land
Where the cross rings out the orders
Don't let the mechanics of beer
Trick you into thinking you are some kind of warrior
Eating barbwire on the wave of violent disorder
Three words:
Cage, Wheel, Hamster
'ere, here's a bit of cheese
- nibble the bastard!
Under the plastic and NCT
Of grained handmarks devour me
Under the general weight of it all
Exist impossible visions of loveEmbed
