The Corgi LyricsThe corgi - the Palace gets it right
The corgi - it's always warm at night
The corgi - the driveway and the range
The corgi
Mighty old times where will we be
Trench foot horror they overtake me
The yellow mist falls, oh what we gonna do
History repeats like BBC2
The corgi - the Palace gets it right
The corgi - it's always warm at night
The corgi - the driveway and the range
The corgi
To make it obscure is the mark of a man
Live a life of freedom near the river in France
I ain't no mouthy baker, the cake ain't for me
A four pint punter in the Chinese
The corgi - the Palace gets it right
The corgi - it's always warm at night
The corgi - the driveway and the range
The corgi
The guns ain't gonna scream
No signs of rain, no signs of rain
Let's walk it down
The guns ain't gonna scream
No signs of rain, no signs of rain
Let's walk it down
The men ain't gonna scream
No signs of pain, no signs of pain
Let's walk it down
The men ain't gonna scream
No signs of pain, no signs of pain
No signs of pain
The corgi - the Palace gets it right
The corgi - it's always warm at night
The corgi - the driveway and the range
The corgiEmbed
