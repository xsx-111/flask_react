Strike Force LyricsThe corner wakes everbody up
Especially the 'me first' waitin' to jump
Midnight snipers
Prowlin' the shopping centre whilst it's quiet
Whilst the flowerman sets up
Braggin' about the money he's got
The petite bourgeoisie with his new van
An' fuckin plantin' pots
Brown plastic
The man always acts fantastic
Tesco Extra an a real bad cough
That stinks of microwaved rice with beef stroganoff
The struggle in words - swivel servant
The struggle in words - swivel servant
The war torn lino on the toilet floor
And the way the decorator's mate blens it all in
We are caged
Tryin' to pick preferences out the unlucky bin
Strangers grunt and make a mess near the fuckin' sink
Tuck my shirt in
Shrunk from too much washin'
Twenty quid y'get what you give
An' I'm not talkin' 'bout that twat either
The wind blows on the favoured
Who managed to grease the eager machine
Eager beaver
The struggle in words - civil servant
The struggle in words - swivel servant
Adjust my tie, I hate this lie
The struggle in words - swivel servant
I can't see it
Ranges from "Pick you nose and do something else"
To "I just can't fuckin' believe it"
Can't you like it or can't you like it
The Club of Rome holds two grapes
And they belong to me mate
I got the option to cycle and get fit
Get the bus
Taxi
Walk it
Roundabouts
Cogs
Blocked
Audi T4
Some twat on a fix
Everybody looks like they got it
The strugglin' words - swivel servant
The strugglin' words - swivel servant
Adjust my tie - I hate this lie
The strugglin' words - swivel servant
Adjust my tie - I hate this lie
Adjust my tie - I hate this lie
Adjust my tie - I hate this lie
The strugglin' words
