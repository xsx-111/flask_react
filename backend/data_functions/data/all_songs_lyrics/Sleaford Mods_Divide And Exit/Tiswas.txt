Tiswas LyricsPop round Matt, I'll give you a fiver!
The Land That Time Forgot is on repeat
I can hear the screams of people, who wanna be me
They wanna shave my tongue
And tell the others that they were the ones who made me
Who made me
I've got called an anarchist
That's for the middle class trainspotters
I don't want my dog on a string
That's gonna hurt the thing
We got jobs in the mortgage clan
And a car with a smoking window down
Blaow to your life and lob it right off
It don't make sense I know, look

The dinosaurs are stuck on Denmark Street
The boots of Hendrix lick my feet
I'm not bothered, I never was
Here's a crap caravan on Tiswas
The dinosaurs are stuck, no way to get down
The meteor sinks its teeth in the ground
I'm not bothered, I never was
Here's a crap gag from "Spit the Dog"
Cameron's hairdresser got an MBE
I said to my wife you better shoot me
It's all gone, what to do I do
Tell my daughter it's not true
Tell my daughter it's all gone wrong
Pete Tong, Pete Tong, Pete Tong
Get out of the mood
Get out of the way

Tiswas! OTT!
