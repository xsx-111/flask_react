A Little Ditty Lyrics
 we've been told what to do
I didn't realise either mate, I'm with you
I've been following white lines all my life
Touch√© Turtle, jump the castle, avoid the disco dancers
No hassle, doing beak like that with a kid at your mums
Paramedics, you shoulda thought about that one
Heart stopper,  boom clear
What happened to Richard, all I can see is gear
Breathless, incinerate, processed cheese
Become what you hate, become what we are
A series one with dreams to reach a series four
Drive, dive, six packs, drive, drive, white teeth, kit-kat
Take the money and run, join the elite
You sold yourself to no-one
Pied piper, whiskey notes, the wonderwall fell down on you

A little ditty and it's all gone wrong
I don't expect the tools to sing along
A little ditty and it's all gone wrong
A little ditty
A little ditty

I ain't a threat, they leave me alone 
You know when I worked there I got a bad feeling from a man
I can't work with someone like that again, Sam
A little ditty and it's all gone wrong
I don't expect the kid to sing along
That band from the '80s that punk band what are they called
The Queen's Park Rangers
Been around ages you tool
We're all up in the top room of the pub
Getting heavy with the past that didn't exist
You reshape to give celeb mates Shoreditch yarn
In the, have you been for a poo-poo barn
Gnarly coke death faces
Death, death, death, death, nine to a cubicle
Like squeezing, screwing-up faces
Last choke push the wheels of the next big thing
You scratch my back, I don't scratch anything
Apart for my nads
Oy Mick I'm born to be bland
Jumped up in black leather
Flints, death, currywurst
Smashed, and in everything
