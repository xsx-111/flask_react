Air Conditioning LyricsAlright, alright...
Waitin' room stench
The loo's smell nice
Faces of death rip the tickets
50 potential health problems
Cover the walls
I could have them all
Who cares
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Alright, alright...
Death rays burn the air conditioning
And smash out the warnings
That everyone needs to hear
This is the end
This is the end of your cool
Black Monday
Deadly 60
Ray gun battered hate
I can't believe the rich still exist
Let alone run the fuckin' country, mate
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Alright, alright...
Dog waste car showroom
Look fuckin' stupid, shiny
Inventions unobtainable
For the real
Obtainable for the tits
Big car, small life
That's just the way it is
I been debt and confused
For so long it's not true
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioning
Death rays burn the air conditioningEmbed
