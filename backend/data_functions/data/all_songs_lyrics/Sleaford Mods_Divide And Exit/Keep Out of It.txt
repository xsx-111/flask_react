Keep Out of It LyricsCharcoal coloured night at the entrance
Hazed, I won't walk in
Those nights those weekends
Give you a kickin'
People half your age
I feel like Elaine Paige
But without the fuckin' tunes an' Joe Cocker bollocks
East miserable Mainline
Where the air con won't be saved by Nicolas Cage
Put some fuckin' heatin' on
Don't be shy
Smoker's cough and a poky loo
Gets drenched when I turn the tap on
One pint can on
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
Play it smooth
Too much to consider
I didn't ask you to, did I?
2 wi one 'o' or two spelt 't' double 'o'
Oh no, Speak & Spell hell
Ian's a twat and he still works in a clothes shop
Desperately announced any death of whatever
Strengthens
Better pay ya respects
Quick for the kudos
Coffees at expensive tea shops
Full of local art
Fuck off!
Gromit
Thomas the Tank Engine
Forties sleepy village carrot cake hell
Vomit
His unimagined work towards the goal
Of no soul
Just happenings
Within the four walls of your own fuckin' home
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
Eatin' Coffeemate by the spoon
It tastes like cake mix
I waste time flickin' bogeys
Really sore nose
"Is this your handywork?"
As the green particles from the men's toilet
Land on your fuckin' shirt
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
I keep out of it
Keep your eyes slit make it
Keep your eyes slit, aye
Keep your eyes down to it
Keep your eyes, aye ayeEmbed
