Tweet Tweet Tweet LyricsI get a shaky start to Tuesday
Sweat stains on bus windows
I don't want ruin my coat but
That’s just the way it goes
“Cheer up you fuckin’ bastard!”
That’s all I heard him say
St George’s flag on white van
This is the human race
This is the human race
UKIP and your disgrace
Chopped heads on London streets
All you zombies tweet, tweet, tweet
These wheels are turning tricks
This bus is full of pricks
8 hours of Gedling Council fuck your life
It’s spare room hassle
Dead weight is living flesh
We are no longer spesh
These grips that pull my hair
A life not lived ‘cos I don’t care
This is the human race
UKIP and your disgrace
Chopped heads on London streets
All you zombies tweet, tweet, tweet
Well I just bit half a mine
Throw myself on the Metroline
We 'ad to walk back from the train
With the Stella kicking in my brain
Well I just bit half a mine
Throw myself on the Metroline
When I walk back from the train
With the Stella kicking in my brainEmbed
