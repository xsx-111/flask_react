Superhero Lyrics
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go!

A superhero
I'm tugging on your cape
Tell me will your sons
Know their father one day

Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Will you be one of them?

Like an American drug
Makes a mean cock grow
Turns a coward to a priest
Makes a superman of you
Go, go, go, go...
With the S on your chest
You're feeling like a god
An order of animal
We try to find a ride
Superhero, sensei, Nero, smiling, hiding, riding, flying, sumo, charring , falling, burning

Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Ain't no grave gonna' hold this body down
The sunrise is here to save us now
All myths are erased
Storybook ends
Sweet memories
Wash it away
Wash it away
Wash it away
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go!
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be on of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be on of them?
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go...7Embed
