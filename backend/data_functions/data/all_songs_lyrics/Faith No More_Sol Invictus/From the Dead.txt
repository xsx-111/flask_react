From the Dead LyricsHomecoming parade
Welcome home my friend
There'll be no more sleeping on this forest floor
Open heaven's door
Around you, 'round you
Around you
'round you 
Around you
Comin' 'round the bend
Welcome home my friend
There'll be no more weeping like a canyon gorge
Hear your lion roar
Around you, 'round you
I can see you shining like a morning sun
Hear your lion roar 
Around you, 'round you
I can see the parade
Welcome home my friend
Weâ€™re revising history of present time
Watch your watch unwind
We've been turning miseries to nursery rhymes
The sigils and the signs
Around you
Watch your watch unwind
Back from the dead
I can see the end
Welcome home my friend5Embed
