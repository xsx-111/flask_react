Separation Anxiety LyricsOh, separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety
Oh, separation anxiety
Hey, you know it's mine
Had love come back
Like it was before
House creaking
The hinges on the door
Thoughts creeping
Oh, separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety
Hey, you know it's mine
Separation anxiety
Hey, you know it's mine
It's like when your mind
Has a mind of its own
Please take mine
Don't leave me alone
Capture me
Separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety
Hey, you know it's mine
I can't let you go
'Cause you're a part of me
Not apart from me
Hereâ€™s a little sip for me
Well, it's good enough for me
I cannot separate from this anxiety
Come home and make our truce
Violence is what we learned
Listen in reverence
Why it can not pass
If you only make us
Then violence is what we learn
How can I separate
From this anxiety?
Separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety, hey
Oh, separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety, hey
Oh, separation anxiety
Hey, separation anxiety, hey, hey
Separation anxiety, hey
Separation anxiety, hey, hey
Closing my eyes
Separation anxiety, hey
Separation anxiety, hey, hey
Closing my eyes
Separation anxiety, hey
Separation anxiety, hey
Closing my eyes
Separation anxiety, hey
Separation anxiety, hey, hey
Closing my eyes
Separation anxiety, hey
Separation anxiety, hey, hey, hey5Embed
