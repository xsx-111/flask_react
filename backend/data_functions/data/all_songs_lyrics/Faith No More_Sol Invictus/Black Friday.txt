Black Friday LyricsThis is only a test

1, 2, what you gonna do?
3, 4, 5, twistin' your arm and your eye
You will buy
Step right up, donate a memory
To the bank of love, that could loan you your daydreams

BUY IT!
(x2)
Black Friday's come 'n gone

Buy me a future regret
A shrink wrapped fantasy, that I'll wanna forget
In the age of the mercenary
In the nursing home where river swallows the sea
That's where we'll be, with guns

Into the age of scrutiny
And the grandest frapp√©
Well I ain't gonna pay
Trimming the tree, I can hang, I won't swing
It's only a test
 x3
I'll pry my seat
From the children's graves
Hear the angels sing
All the zombies walk on Black Friday

It's a riot at the salad bar
Predatory lenders
Safari mission is far but you paid for them
To kill your mom
 x2
Kill 'em now!!
