Rise of the Fall LyricsRise and fall
Through it all
An Olympus of friends
Highs and lows
And the broken prose
And our losses we'll win
Quemar (x6)

Buildings fall
But we're standing tall
Where only chimneys remain
Beg for law
With a crying jaw
Like a jungle in flames
Quemar (x6)
Gravity
It pulls our waves
And it creates
Monuments of flame
Every house in town
Burn it down
Burn it all down
Burn, burn, down, down...
Coming
The moments grow weak
Coming
With gloves at your throat
Burn it
Into the grave
Burn it
The freedom we'll heat
Burn it
Electrical thing
Burn it
Smell the white flame
Burning
Smell the white flame
Burning
Smell your filthy life
Burning!
What in this life
Lifts us up so high
Down to this campfire?
From around the coast
To the junkyards
When will I see you again?5Embed
