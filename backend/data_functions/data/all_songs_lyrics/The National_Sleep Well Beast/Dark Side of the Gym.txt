Dark Side of the Gym Lyrics
The first time I saw you, you were walking out
I wanted to ask if you could stay
But you were on something with your friends around
There was nothing I could say

But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

The next time I saw you, you were breaking down
A million years had gone away
You looked right at me, and I just turned around
There was still nothing I could say

But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singing to us from the trees
I have dreams of the first man and first lady
Singing to us from the sea
So I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singing to us from the trees
I have dreams of the first man and first lady
Singing to us from the sea4Embed
