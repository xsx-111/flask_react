Nobody Else Will Be There Lyrics
You said we're not so tied together
What did you mean?
Meet me in the stairwell in a second
For a glass of gin

Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there

Can you remind me the building you live in
I'm on my way
It's getting cold again but New York's gorgeous
It's a subway day

Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there

Why are we still out here?
Holding our coats
We look like children
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?
Hey baby, where were you back there
When I needed your help?
I thought that if I stuck my neck out
I'd get you out of your shell
My faith is sick and my skin is thin as ever
I need you alone
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?

Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there15Embed
