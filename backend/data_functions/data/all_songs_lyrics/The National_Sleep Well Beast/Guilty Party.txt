Guilty Party Lyrics
You're sleeping night and day
How'd you do it
Me I am wide awake
Feeling defeated

I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I know it's not working
I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
We just got nothing
Nothing left to say

Another year gets away
Another summer of love
I don't know why I care
We miss it every summer

I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doing this
There's no other way
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
I just got nothing
Nothing left to say
It all, all catches up to me
It all, all catches up to me
All the time

I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I know it's not working
I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
We just got nothing
Nothing left to say
I say your name
I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doing this
There's no other way
It's nobody's fault
No guilty party
I just got nothing
Nothing left to say
It all, all just catches up to me
It all, all catches up to me
All the time6Embed
