Empire Line Lyrics
You've been sleeping for miles
So what did you see?
Here the sky's been falling white flowers
And there's ice in all the trees
I've been tapping the table
I've been hoping to drink
There's a line that goes all the way from my childhood to you

Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?

I've been trying to see where you're going, but you're so hard to follow
And I don't think we're getting anywhere any time soon
We have so much to cover and I don't know what I'm expecting
You just keep saying so many things that I wish you won't

Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?
I've been talking about you to myself
'Cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want
And I want everything
I want everything
I've been talking about you to myself
'Cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want
And I want everything
I want everything

Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?4Embed
