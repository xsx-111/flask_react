Day I Die Lyrics
I don't need you, I don't need you
Besides I barely ever see you anymore
And when I do it feels like you're only halfway there
Young mothers love me, even ghosts of
Girlfriends call from Cleveland
They will meet me anytime and anywhere

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

Don't do this, I don't do this to you
And don't expect me to enjoy it
'Cause I really don't have the courage not to
Turn the volume up inside my ears
For years I used to put my head inside the speakers
In the hallway when you get too high and talk forever

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
I get a little punchy with the vodka
Just like my great uncle Valentine Jester did
When he had to deal with those people like you
Who made no goddamn common sense
I’d rather walk all the way home right now
Than to spend one more second in this place
I’m exactly like you Valentine
Just come outside and leave with me

Let's just get high enough to see our problems
Let’s just get high enough to see our fathers’ houses

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?7Embed
