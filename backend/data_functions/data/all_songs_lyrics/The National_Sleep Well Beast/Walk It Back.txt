Walk It Back Lyrics
I’m always thinking about useless things
I’m always checking out
I’m always mothering myself to bits
I’m always checking out

Forget it, nothing I change changes anything
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair

I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck up the place
I better walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back

I try to save it for a rainy day
It’s raining all the time
Until everything is less insane
I’m mixing weed with wine
Forget it, nothing I change changes anything
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair

I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsing space
I better cut this off
Don’t wanna fuck up the place
I better walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back
Walk it back, walk it back


"People like you are still living in what we call the reality-based community.  You believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that reality - judiciously, as you will - we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.  We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do
Apparently that was written on a whiteboard with a red sharpie in the Roosevelt bedroom, sometime around Christmas 2007. Yeah, so I can't stay..."
I can't stay and I can't come back
I'll just keep awake
And I won't react
I'll walk through Lawrencetown
Along the tracks
My own body in my arms
But I won't collapse
So don't go dark on me
It's all alright
If I'm gonna get back to you, someday
I'll need your light4Embed
