The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness Lyrics
Maybe I listen more than you think
And I can tell that somebody sold you
We said we’d never let anyone in
We said we’d only die of lonely secrets

The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

I thought that this would all work out after a while
Now you’re saying that I’m asking for too much attention
Also no other faith is light enough for this place
We said we’d only die of lonely secrets

The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God

I can't explain it
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it
Any other, any other way

The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hiding from me?
We’re in a different kind of thing now
All night you’re talking to God
I can't explain it
Any other, any other way
I can't explain it
Any other, any other way
I can't explain it
Any other, any other way
I can't explain it
Any other, any other way17Embed
