Seven Day Weekend Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Monday's calling you too early when you're sound asleep
Bells are ringing by your bedside and out in the streets
You say Monday's long enough, but this is just the start
Tuesday's just the same as Monday without the surprising part

Wednesday's point of no return
When you've squandered all you've earned
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven day weekend 

This is all I'm thinking about as the days go by
Spend your life on holiday and even when I die
There could be but one inscription: "This was not his day"
If it isn't Thursday anymore, it must be Friday

I can't wait until I maybe
Get off work and see my baby
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven day weekend 
I can't wait until I maybe
Get off work and see my baby
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven day weekend
