Uncomplicated Lyrics
Blood and chocolate
I hope you're satisfied what you have done
You think it's over now
But we've only just begun
I asked for water
And they gave me rose' wine
A horse that knows arithmetic
And a dog that tells your fortune

It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
Uncomplicated

I want to buy you
A big blue Diamel
Cheap white plastic shoes
That don't walk out and don't let in
I want to show you
How I love you
When you're over me
There's no-one above you
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
Uncomplicated
Uncomplicated

You think it's over now
But this is only
This is only
This is only the beginning

It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
Uncomplicated
Uncomplicated
Uncomplicated

You think it's over now
But this is only
This is only
This is only the beginning
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
Uncomplicated
Uncomplicated
