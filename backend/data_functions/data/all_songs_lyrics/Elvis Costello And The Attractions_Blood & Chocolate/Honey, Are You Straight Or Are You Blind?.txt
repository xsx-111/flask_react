Honey, Are You Straight Or Are You Blind? Lyrics
Who do you see when you turn your eyes down?
Who do you see when I'm not seeing you?
The news is out all over town
And all these girls are taking turns at being you
Well, well, well you'd better make up your mind
Honey, are you straight or are you blind?

She's coming in between us, you know that she is
I'm not holding on to her but one of us is
My hands are in my pockets, my face is in a book
She could walk 'round naked and I wouldn't sneak a look
Well, well, well you'd better make up your mind
Honey, are you straight or are you blind?

Honey are you straight or are you blind?
Honey are you straight or are you blind?
Honey are you straight or are you blind?
Honey are you straight or are you blind?

She walked in and your eyes flew out the door
You squeezed my hand until the circulation ceases
She's just a doll like so many more
She's the kind of doll that you'd like to pull to pieces
Well, well, well you'd better make up your mind
Honey, are you straight or are you blind?
Well
Well, well, well you'd better make up your mind
Honey, are you straight or are you blind?
Well, well, well you'd better make up your mind
Honey, are you straight or are you blind?Embed
