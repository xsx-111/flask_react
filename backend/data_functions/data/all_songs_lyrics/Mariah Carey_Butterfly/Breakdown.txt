Breakdown Lyrics
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was O.K
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
(Underneath the guise of smile)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry
So, what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I will survive"
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave this way"
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
Break-breakdown
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Steady breaking me on down
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind (losing my mind)
Break-breakdown
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
(Under the smile)
Steady breaking me on down
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(How do I feel?)
Break-breakdown
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering
Steady breaking me on down
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Break-breakdown
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry
Steady breaking me on down
Yeah
Come on, yeah
Come on, come on

I don't wanna break down
(Breakdown, breakdown)
Break-breakdown
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
I don't wanna break down
(Breakdown, breakdown)
Steady breaking me on down
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
I don't wanna break down
(Breakdown, breakdown)
Break-breakdown
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
I don't wanna break down
(Breakdown, breakdown)
Steady breaking me on down
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)

Gonna break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Trying to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it
I be feeling like you're breaking me down
Kicking me around, stressing me out
I think you better go and get out
And let me release some stress

Don't ever wanna feel no pain
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I'm feeling pressures you all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
(I'm crying)
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
(I'm gradually dying inside)
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
(In my heart, I'm crying)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(How do I feel?)
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering
(I'm losing my mind)
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry
(So I breakdown and cry)

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(How do I feel?)
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering
(What do you think? You gotta know I'm suffering, so I...)
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
(I turn off the lights and breakdown and cry)
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
Break-breakdown
(Cry, cry, cry)
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Steady breaking me on down
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Break-breakdown
(Cry, cry, cry)
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Steady breaking me on down
(Cry, cry, cry)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
Break-breakdown
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering
Steady breaking me on down
(Cry, cry, cry)
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Break-breakdown
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry
Steady breaking me on down

I don't wanna break down
Break-breakdown
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
I don't wanna break down
Steady breaking me on down
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)6Embed
