Close My Eyes Lyrics
(Ladadadada lada lada ladadada ladada dala dala)

I was a wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know

But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

(Ladadadada)
(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadadadadada)
(Ladadadada)
(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadadadadadadada)
Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away (And block it away)
I left the worse unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget

As I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

(Ladadadada)(Oh)
(Ladadadadada)(Hmm)
(Ladadadadadadadada)(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadada)(Hmm)
(Ladadadadada)(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadadadadadadada)
Nearing the edge (Nearing the edge)
Oblivious I almost (Oblivious)
Fell right over (I almost just)
A part of me (A part of me)
Will never be quite able (Will never be)
To feel stable (Able to feel)
That woman-child (That woman-child)
Feeling inside (Feeling inside)
Was on the verge of fading (Practically died)
Thankfully I (Thankfully I)
Woke up in time (Woke up in time, time, time)
(I)

Guardian angel, I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image (Into your image)
And you're still alive (You're still alive)

As I closed my eyes (You're always alive)
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky (Head to the sky)
And though time's rolled by (Time)
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
(Ladadadada)(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadada)(Hey no no hmm)
(Ladadadadadadadada)(Baby I)
(Ladadadada)(Hmm)
(Ladadadadada)(No)
(Ladadadadadadadadadada)(Too soon)
(Ladadadada)(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadada)(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadadadadada)(Ladadadadadadadadadada)
(Ladadadada)(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadada)(Ladadadadada)
(Ladadadadadadadadadada)(Ladadadadadada)3Embed
