Honey (Def Club Mix) Lyrics
I need it, need it, need it
Honey, you can have me
Honey, you can have me when you want me
Honey, you can have me

Honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
Every time you call me I come runnin' (Runnin')
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (Comes over me)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency (I've got a dependency)
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' (Dyin') for ya, cryin' (Cryin') for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

Oh, I can't be elusive with you, honey (Honey)
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you (That I'm feelin' you)
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
(You're the only thing I wanna do)

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (When your love)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency (I've got a dependency)
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
(One hit of your love addicted me)
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside (So good inside)
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Baby, I can hardly wait
Gotta have another taste
I can hardly wait
Gotta have another taste

It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
And it's just like honey (It's like honey, honey, honey)
When your love comes over me (Honey)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency (Ooh)
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
(One hit of your love addicted me)
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see? (It's like honey)
Every night and day (It's like honey)
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey (Honey, honey)
It's like honey
Honey, honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
It's like honey
Honey
It's like honey
It's like honey

I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it, need it, need it
I need it, yeah
Ooh, I, I need it

I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
Ooh, IEmbed
