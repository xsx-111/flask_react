Honey (So So Def Radio Mix) Lyrics
If Jermaine likes it... (He do, I do)
Then I like it...

You know what?, y'all ain't ready for this
You're still scrambling from the damage of the last remix
Most of your stories bore me, y'all love to lie
To my royalties, be the glory
Mariah, Honey B. Fly
Ah, me and B-R, we are
Usually seen in hot spots
Jumpin' outta two seaters
We got Money to make
And many records to break
We not similar to any
So make no mistake
This is So So Def

Oh, honey, you can have me
When you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who
Makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far
Beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (When your love comes over me)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency (I've got a dependency)
Always strung out for another taste of your
Honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' (Dyin') for ya, cryin' (Cryin') for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you, honey
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
Y'all be saying this and that
But then y'all don't wanna see this new phenomenon
This Don Chi Chi
It's something nasty
Word to B.I.G
I'm in it for life
Dead president for life
And by the minute, I get more nice
I'm the J-E-R, The M-A-I, N, don't forget the E
And she goes by the unforgettable name
Of the B to the R to the A to the T

I like colossal size pieces of rocks
And getting pushed in the Bentley drop top
Undefeated indefinitely
Don't stop
We rock in all kinds of spots, calling all the shots
And y'all knows how we get down
My beliefs is being dolla bill seeker and a Benjamin keeper
Don't mind poppin' the glory
Or slow wind with some clown with seven digit accounts

They say
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night (Dancing all night)
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night (Dancing all night)
They say
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night (Dancing all night)
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night (Dancing all night)
(Honey it's like) It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet (Oh sugar, you know)
And I'm dyin' for you, cryin' for you, I adore you
(Oh, I need your love right now, baby)
One hit of your love addicted me (One)
Now I'm strung out on you darlin' (Every)
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
(I need a taste of honey)
(I need it) It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for you, cryin' for you, I adore you
(Oh honey, oh honey, I)
One hit of your love addicted me
(I nee-e-ed it, nee-e-ed it, nee-e-ed it)
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
(Oh honey I, honey I)
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
(I nee-e-ed it, nee-e-ed it, nee-e-ed it)
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for you, cryin' for you, I adore you
(I nee-e-ed it, nee-e-ed it, nee-e-ed it)Embed
