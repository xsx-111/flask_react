The Roof (Back in Time) Lyrics
(I got you stuck off the realness)
(I got you stuck off the realness)

It wasn't raining yet (Yet)
But it was definitely (But it was definitely)
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding (Pounding)
My inner voice resounding (Oh)
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web of my desire for you (I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Every time I feel the need
I envision you, caressing me
And go back in time (I go back, I go back, I go back)
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet, and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms (You took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet (So I)
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time (I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you (Envision you), caressing me (Caressing me)
And go back in time (Back)
To relive the splendor of you and I (You and I, you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night (That rainy)
Every time I feel the need (Night)
I envision you (Envision you), caressing me (Me)
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I (You)
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night, I (Last night, I)
Dreamed that I (Dreamed that I)
Whispered the words "I love you, boy" (That I love you, boy)
And touched you, so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
(Pretty baby, how I'm missing you
Every time)

Every time I feel the need (I, I)
I envision you (Envision you), caressing me (Caressing me)
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I (I, I, I)
On the rooftop that rainy night (On the rooftop that rainy night)
Every time I feel the need (When I feel the need, I envision you)
I envision you, caressing me (Over and over and over again)
And go back in time (Time)
To relive the splendor of you and I (It was oh so sweet, you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night (On that rainy night)
Every time I feel the need (Last night, I had this dream, this dream)
I envision you, caressing me (It was such an incomparable night)
And go back in time (And I whispered)
To relive the splendor of you and I (That I love you, very subtly)
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you, caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night6Embed
