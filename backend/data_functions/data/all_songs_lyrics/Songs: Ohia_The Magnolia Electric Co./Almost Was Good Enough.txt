Almost Was Good Enough Lyrics
It's been hard doing anything
Winter stuck around so long
I kept trying anyhow, and I'm still trying now
Just to keep working
I remember when it didn't used to be so hard
It used to be impossible
A new season has to begin
I can feel it leaning in, whispering
"Nothing's lonely now
Nothing anymore in pain
Nothing's lonely now
Nothing anymore in pain"

A tall shadow dressed
How the secrets always dress
When they want everyone
To know that they're around
Leaning in
Whispering:
"My friend over there
Don't know what he's talking about"
Did you really believe?
C'mon, did you really believe
That everyone makes it out?
Almost no one makes it out
Almost no one makes it out
Almost no one makes it out
Almost no one makes it out
I'm going to use that street to hide
From that human doubt
To hide from what was shining
And has finally burned us out
Almost no one makes it out
Almost no one makes it out
No one makes it out
You're talking to one right now

For once, almost was good enough
Almost was good enoughEmbed
