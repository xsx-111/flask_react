Hold On Magnolia Lyrics
Hold on Magnolia
To that great highway moon
No one has to be that strong
But if you're stubborn like me
I know what you're trying to be

Hold on Magnolia
I hear that station bell ring
You might be holding the last light I see
Before the dark finally gets a hold of me

Hold on Magnolia
I know what a true friend you've been
In my life, I have had my doubts
But tonight, I think I've worked it out with all of them

Hold on Magnolia
To the thunder and the rain
To the lightning that has just signed my name
To the bottom line

Hold on Magnolia
To that great highway moon
No one has to be that strong
But if you're stubborn like me
I know what you're trying to be
Hold on Magnolia
I hear that lonesome whistle whine
Hold on Magnolia
I think it's almost time
Hold on Magnolia
I think it's almost time
It's almost time2Embed
