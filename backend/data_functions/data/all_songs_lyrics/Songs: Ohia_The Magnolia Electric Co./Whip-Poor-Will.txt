Whip-Poor-Will LyricsI've got my window open in the southern cross hotel
It's been my longest night i can tell
By the way i'm not surprised
To see the desert cover over paradise
Now count every rhododendron in this cool mountain light
I made more mistakes than that just tonight
So all of you folks in heaven not too busy ringing the bell
Some of us down here ain't doing very well
Some of us with our windows open in the southern cross motel
Still waitin
Still waitin
For you to sing that song again
The one you were singin at the very fall of man
It ain't hallelujah but it might as well have been
Sing it brother one more time
Sing it brother one more time
Sing it sister one more time
Sing it sister one more time
Once for everybody who got left behind
Whip-poor-will
Oh whip-poor-will
Whip-poor-willEmbed
