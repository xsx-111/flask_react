John Henry Split My Heart LyricsStood on the 66 highway
I stood on the 66 highway
Wysteria, Magnolia beside the green line track
Said "don't come back"
I found myself standing on the mountain
I found myself standing on the mountain
Beneath my full moon heart
John Henry split this heart, split this full moon heart
John Henry split this heart, split this full moon heart
Swing the heaviest hammer you got
Hit this one out of the park
John Henry split my heart
He says, "Boy what you going to do
With your heart in two?"
"Boy what you going to do
With your heart in two?"
If it's good enough
Only if it's good enough
If it's good enough
But only if it's good enough
Half, I'm going to use
To pay this band
Half, I'm saving
'Cause I'm gonna owe them
Long dark blues
Long dark blues
Big star is falling
Long dark blues
Will o' the wisp
Long dark bluesEmbed
