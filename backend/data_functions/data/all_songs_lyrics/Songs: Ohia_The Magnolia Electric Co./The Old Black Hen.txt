The Old Black Hen Lyrics
Old Black Hen, is that you again?
Singing the Bad Luck Lullaby
Come right on in, it's midnight again
Time for the Bad Luck Lullaby
You know the one, it's the same one you sung
When you worked on the Revelation

Now sing it over the cradle of the child who's born next
Bad Luck Lullaby
Leave all the truth in so they know what comes next
With the Bad Luck Lullaby
Leave in the true love they never find
Show how they're looking for it all of their lives

When I saw the banner hanging over my door
And heard the Bad Luck Lullaby
I already knew who the party was for
Bad Luck Lullaby
All of my pain found a partner in that room
And the devil's tail swayed with the tune

Make that Black Record roll the tapes all night long
Bad Luck Lullaby
Make that Black Record and we'll all sing along
To the Bad Luck Lullaby
Look down the long street
And see who's that crying
Tell them that every day I lived
I was trying to sing the blues the way I find 'emEmbed
