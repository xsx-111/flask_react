Peoria Lunch Box Blues LyricsGwendolyn, I wonder what you'd've called them
I think a name you might choose is Nobody's Blues
You see when you were just a kid
They think you won't remember what they did
They said how you were just a kid
You wouldn't remember, but you did
Then you learned how to say
"Everything you love tries to get away"
Then you learned how to say
"Everything you love finally does"
It's finally looking good up there our skyline
See how if fits right in there with heaven
The constellations and Comiskey's lights
Two old friends in the night
Who always knew they would if they could
Meet one last time in the old neighborhood
Hey, wait a minute, things ain't looking that good
It's getting quiet and the light's getting dim
And this ain't like no place I've ever been
What kind of trouble am I in?
Oh Gwen, here they come again
It's nobody's Blues
Here they come againEmbed
