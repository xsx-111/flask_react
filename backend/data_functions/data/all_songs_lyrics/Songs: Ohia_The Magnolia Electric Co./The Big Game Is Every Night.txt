The Big Game Is Every Night LyricsIt'll get so quiet when this record ends
You can hear the first hour of the world
You can hear the willow branches touch the wave
Write our names beside our darlings hearts
You can hear the willow branches touch the wave
Write our names beside nothing
Rise moon, on the shores of the sea
Shine on the distance between me
And the last thing I see
Let it be me helping
Let it be me, honestly
Let it be me working
On being a better me
Now light the field for the big game tonight
Mark Twain to Thomas Jefferson:
Strike
Luke the Drifter to Zimmerman:
Line drive to keep the team alive
To keep the team alive
Rise moon, on the shores of the sea
Shine on the distance between me
And the last thing I see
Let it be me helping
Let it be me, honestly
Let it be me working
On being a better me
Unitas to Berry
Unitas to Berry
So good it's scary
With everything against you, sweetness
You get the first down again
See it's ones like this you can always trust
Not to disappoint us
Moon shine that white-lightning light
Down on the possums stage tonight
Maybe on the man in black
You could hold a little something back
To let his eyes adjust to the light
Rise moon, right above me
Rise moon, right above me
Rise moon, right above me
Show an American, if really
I am the snake, they're all saying
If they look up here, do they see just my black tail swaying?
If I'm all fangs, and all lies, and all poison
If I'm really what they're saying
I don't want to disappoint themEmbed
