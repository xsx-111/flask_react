Farewell Transmission Lyrics
The whole place is dark
Every light on this side of the town
Suddenly it all went down
Now we'll all be brothers of
The fossil fire of the sun
Now we will all be sisters of
The fossil blood of the moon

Someone must have set 'em up
Now they'll be working in the cold grey rock
Now they'll be working in the hot mill steam...
Now they'll be working in the concrete
In the sirens and the silences now
All the great set up hearts
All at once start to beat

After tonight if you don't want this to be
A secret out of the past
I will resurrect it, I'll have a good go at it
I'll streak his blood across my beak
Dust my feathers with his ash
I can feel his ghost breathing down my back
I will try and know whatever I try
I will be gone but not forever
I will try and know whatever I try
I will be gone but not forever

Real truth about it is
No one gets it right
Real truth about it is
We're all supposed to try
There ain't no end to the sands
I've been trying to cross
The real truth about it is my kind of life's no better off
It's got the maps or if it's lost

We will try and know whatever we try
We will be gone but not forever
Come on let's try and know whatever we try
We will be gone but not forever

Real truth about it is there ain't no end to the desert I'll cross
I've really known it all along
Mama here comes midnight
With the dead moon in its jaws
Must be the big star about to fall
Mama here comes midnight
With the dead moon in its jaws
Must be the big star about to fall
Long dark blues
Will-o'-the-wisp
Long dark blues
The big star is falling
Long dark blues
Will-o'-the-wisp
The big star is falling
Long dark blues
Through the static and distance
Long dark blues
A farewell transmission
Long dark blues
Listen
Long dark blues
Listen
Long dark blues
Listen
Long dark blues
