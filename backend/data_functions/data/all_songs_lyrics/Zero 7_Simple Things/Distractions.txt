Distractions Lyrics
Fancy a big house
Some kids and a horse
I cannot quite, but nearly
Guarantee a divorce
I think that I love you
I think that I do
So go on, mister
Make Miss me, Mrs. you

I love you, I love you
I love you, I do
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth

Fancy a fast car
A bag full of loot
I can nearly guarantee
You'll end up with the boot

I love you, I love you
I love you, I do
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth
And I love you, yeah
I love you, oh I do
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth1Embed
