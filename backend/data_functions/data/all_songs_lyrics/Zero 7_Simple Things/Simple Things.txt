Simple Things LyricsIt's an easy ride, to roam
You'll never walk, alone
Naturally, we blew
Simple things, we say
Everyday, we'll find the way
Seems like we've opened up the door
Feels like we've walked this way before
Naturally, we blew
Simple things, you say
Everyday, you'll find the way
It amazes
