Away from Here Lyrics
I'm so sick, sick, sick and tired
Of working just to be retired
I don't want to get that far
I don't want your company car
Promotions ain't my thing
Name badges are not interesting

It's much easier for me, see
To stay at home with Richard and Judy

A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here

I'm fed up of early mornings
Wake up calls are getting boring round here
Feet dragging on the pavement
The same people with the same arrangements
Well, it can be quite funny
Your making other people money
My working day has just begun
It's not exactly what I'd would call fun

I want to wake up in the afternoon
With daytime TV and my favourite tune
'Cause it is much, easier for me
To stay at home with Richard and Judy

A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way a way, a way, away from

Saturday is your only highlight
When you go out and live the high life
Meeting up with other people
Get interaction with the weekend people
At least when all i said and done
You wouldn't been the only one
To be a slave to the modern wage
Your crappy weekend is your only escape
I want to wake up in the afternoon
With daytime TV and my favourite tune
Cause it is much easier, for me see
To stay at home with Richard and Judy

A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way, a way oh, oh-oh, away from here
A way a way a way, away from hereEmbed
