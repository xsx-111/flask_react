This Song Is About You Lyrics
Half the kids who you grew up with were pushin' prams by the time that they were just sixteen
If love is a drug then where is the cure for the girl who used to talk to you about her dream
And all the boys with all their toys couldn't see the signs as we scorched out eyes with nicotine
And the grownups said, listen to your head but our hearts were crying out for heroes on TV screens

Now this song is about you
Now this song is about-

Changes in your mind
Changes in your life
Changes in the times
And the reason you can't sleep at night
Changes in your mind
Changes in your life
Changes in the times
And the reason you gave up the fight

Half the kids that aren't pushing prams are pushing pills to boys and girls who are half their age
And the pubs and clubs are full of drunks they don't remember the day they were born or even their mum or their names
An old man sings a tune but he's drowned out by a fight next to a fruit machine
And all of this, our hearts, our nation
A total lack of civilization
Will it ever be the same
Now this song is about you
Now this song is about...

Changes in your mind
Changes in our lives
Changes in the times
And the reason you won't sleep tonight
Changes in our mind
Changes in our lives
Changes in the times
And the reasons we gave up the fight

Now this song, is about, is about, is about you
Now this song, is about, is about, is about you
Now this song, is about, is about, is about you
Now this song, is about, is about, is about youEmbed
