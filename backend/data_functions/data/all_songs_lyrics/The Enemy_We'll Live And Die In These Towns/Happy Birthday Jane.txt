Happy Birthday Jane Lyrics
Good mornin' Jane
Happy birthday, once again
What would we do
What would we do without you?
Without you

Wake up, the sun is shining
Shining for you
To take all your troubles away
Just for a day
To take all your troubles away
Just for a day
For a day

So goodnight Jane
Happy birthday, once again
Now what will we do
What will we do without you
Without you

Wake up, the sun is shining
Shining for you
To take all your troubles away
Just for a day
To take all your troubles away
Just for a day
For a day
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, Jane
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, Jane
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, Jane
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, JaneEmbed
