Had Enough Lyrics
Give me a good enough reason
Why I should not cut you down
You've been taking too much ever since you started hanging round, this crowd
And I've had enough, had enough
Yes you let me down, let me down
And now I'm giving up, giving up
Yes I'll see you round, see you round and now-now

Hey, hey
What's the matter with your face, face?
When you have it your way, way
Won't you give me some time
To understand your mind?

Oh, it's alright
Oh, it's alright

Let me say what I want
Don't you know what was on the tip of my tongue?
If you were into rise, take a look outside
You will see, you're wrong
And I've had enough, had enough
Yes you let me down, let me down
And now I'm giving up, giving up
Yes I'll see you round, see you round and now-now
Hey, hey
What's the matter with your face, face?
When you have it your way, way
Won't you give me some time
To understand your mind?

Oh, it's alright
Oh, it's alright

Had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough (Let me down)
Had enough, had enough (See you round)
Had enough, had enough (Let me down)
Had enough, had enough (I'll see you round)

Hey, hey
What's the matter with your face, face?
When you have it your way, way
Won't you give me some time, to understand you're mine?Embed
