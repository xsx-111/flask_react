Pressure Lyrics
Pressure, pressure, step into the pressure zone
Don't let the pressure, let the pressure get the better
Keep a, measure, a measure on your pressure
Better check the pressure
Watch out for the pressure!

Take a little walk outside
To see you now
Pressure, let it all slip away

Working nine-to-five, she was a dance
She got in her mind, she has the answer now
Oh, that she's always a show
To make your breath go faster
Working nine-to-five, she was a dance
She got in her mind, she has the answer now
Oh, that she's always a show
To make your breath go faster

Pressure, pressure, step into the pressure zone
Don't let the pressure, let the pressure get the better
Keep a, measure, a measure on your pressure
Better check the pressure
Watch out for the pressure!
Working nine-to-five, she was a dance
She got in her mind, she has the answer now
Oh, that she's always a show
To make your breath go faster
Working nine-to-five, she was a dance
She got in her mind, she has the answer now
Oh, that she's always a show
To make your breath go fasterEmbed
