Technodanceaphobic Lyrics
Shelly was a good girl
She never left her daddy's side
She was a technodanceaphobic
And every night inside, she'd cry

Megan was a bad girl
She never knew no right from wrong
Well they found her alone
Her daddy left her at home
And hoped that she was gone

Yeah, yeah
'Cause they were bangin' on the back seat all night long
Yeah they were bangin' on the back seat all night long
Yeah they were bangin' on the back seat
On the back seat
Bangin' on the back seat all night long!


Sammy was a good boy
He never left his mummy's side
He was an alcoholaphobic
And every night inside, he'd cry
Danny was a bad boy
He liked to kick and scream and shout
Well on a Saturday night
He got the feeling alright
To throw his weight about

Yeah, yeah
'Cause they were bangin' on the back seat all night long
Yeah they were bangin' on the back seat all night long
Yeah they were bangin' on the back seat
On the back seat
Bangin' on the back seat all night long!
Yeah, yeah
So they were bangin' on the back seat all night long
Yeah they were bangin' on the back seat all night long
Yeah they were bangin' on the back seat
On the backseat
Bangin' on the back seat all night long
I said
Bangin' on the back seat
Yeah on the back seat
Bangin' on the back seat
(All night long)
Yeah they were bangin' on the back
On the back seat
Bangin' on the back seat
All night long!Embed
