40 Days and 40 Nights Lyrics
I took a walk to the supermarket
It was so cold
I couldn't get back home
Through all of the snow
Took a vacation to the petrol station
They were sold out
I couldn't get back home
They didn't want to know

She's had it all night long
Where did it all go wrong
She's had it all night long, long (yeah)
Forty days and forty nights, oh
One too many girlfriends
Forty days and forty nights, oh
What's he gonna feed her
Forty days and forty nights, oh
Yeah ya' gotta problem
Forty days and forty nights, oh
What's he gonna do about that
We'll always talk and lost in conversation
When you stopped in anticipation
You couldn't quite believe what you were hearing
Woah-woah, oh-woah, oh-oh-oh
But what I heard a little birdie told me
What she said, it's quite serious
Well she told me you're sleeping with the enemy
Woah-woah, oh-woah, oh-oh-oh
She's had it all night long
Where did it all go wrong
She's had it all night long, long (yeah)

Forty days and forty nights, oh
One too many girlfriends
Forty days and forty nights, oh
What's he gonna feed her?
Forty days and forty nights, oh
Yeah ya' gotta problem
Forty days and forty nights, oh
What's he gonna do about that?

Ya just slack
What you know about that

Boy you got one too many girlfriends
For my liking
It's not frightening
But someone told me she's sleeping with the enemy
Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Boy you got one too many girlfriends
For my liking
It's not frightening
But someone told me she's sleeping with the enemy
Woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
She's had it all night long
Where did it all go wrong
She's had it all night long, long (yeah)

Forty days and forty nights, oh
One too many girlfriends
Forty days and forty nights, oh
What's he gonna feed her?
Forty days and forty nights, oh
Yeah ya' gotta problem
Forty days and forty nights, oh
What's he gonna do about that?Embed
