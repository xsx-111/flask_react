Silkworm Exploding LyricsWhen you kiss me, I'm a silkworm exploding
When you kiss me, I'm a silkworm exploding
When you kiss me, I'm a silkworm exploding
The Titanic slipping into the sea
In the frozen water, so quietly
We, in the lifeboat safe now
We're wrapped in blankets, and you're next to me
And when you kiss me, I'm a silkworm exploding
When you kiss me, I'm a silkworm exploding
The Titanic never waved goodbye
To the iceberg melting or thе starry sky
'Cause me, I'm like a zеppelin
Floating into your ear, when you're next to me
And when you kiss me, I'm a silkworm exploding
Into the iceberg on the Atlantic Ocean
When you kiss me, I'm a silkworm exploding
Into the iceberg on the Atlantic Ocean
Don't be sad for the song you sing
There's a happy ending for everything
There goes the Titanic now
She never really sank
She just became an airship
Floating high in the sky
As light as a gigantic silkworm
The Titanic is an airship
And she's finally arriving in New York City
Look, you can see her
The passengers are waving as the floats over Manhattan
Over the clouds
She's docking with the needle
At the top of the Chrysler BuildingEmbed
