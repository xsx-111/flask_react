So Painful LyricsI imagined her with him
I imagined her with him
And it was so painful
I predicted her and him
I predicted her and him
And it was so painful
Oh, baby, it is so painful
Now I see them, walking around
He is holding the hand that I used to hold
And it is so painful
She's so much happier to be with him
And it is so sincere, this love that they are in
And it is so painful
Oh, baby, it is so painful
I cannot avoid to see her and him
So I'll, I'll force a smile, for her and him
And it is so painful
Oh, baby, it is so painful
Oh, honey, it is so painful
Oh, baby, it is so painful
So painful
So painful
