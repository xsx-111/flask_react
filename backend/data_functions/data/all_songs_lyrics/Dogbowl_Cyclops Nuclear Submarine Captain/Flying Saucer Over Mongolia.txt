Flying Saucer Over Mongolia LyricsThere's a great big old eyeball
Rolling on the whitewashed fence
Under shooting stars falling
Falling under purple planets
There's a rock with a big top
Licking me on my earlobe
Floating in the midnight sun
Up in the purple Arctic Circle
Mongolia, I long for you
Mongolia, in my flying saucer I'm searching for you
And a giraffe is dancing
Tango upon my forehead
While we glow in the 
Mongolia sings my favorite salt song
Genghis Khan was a Mongol
And he had a good eyeball
He comes from where I am dreaming
Dreaming of scrеaming horses that tap-dance
Mongolia, I long for you
Mongolia, in my flying saucer I'm sеarching for you
Mongolia, I long for you
Mongolia, in my flying saucer I'm searching
In my flying saucer I'm searching
In my flying saucer I'm searching for youEmbed
