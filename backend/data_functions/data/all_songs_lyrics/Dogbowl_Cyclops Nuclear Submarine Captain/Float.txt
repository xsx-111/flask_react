Float LyricsYou fly in and out
Of my head at night
When I wake up the morning
You are gone
All again
Long ago you were
So purple and perfect
Kisses that were velvety blue
You gave me
A tomorrow
You'll give me
All again
From the ceiling in
My bedroom you emerge
You float down to me
Just like you once did
A tomorrow
You will float
All again
You will float
All again
You will float
All again
You fly in and out
Of my head at night
You fly in and out
Of my head at night
You fly in and out
Of my head at night
You fly in and out
Of my head at nightEmbed
