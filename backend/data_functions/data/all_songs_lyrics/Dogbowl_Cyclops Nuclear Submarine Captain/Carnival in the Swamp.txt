Carnival in the Swamp LyricsThere's a highway on the swamp, it makes me high
The smell of the saltwater rising up
Into my head the marshes call me
Driving me to jump from my automobile
Into you
Into you
And the sun is going down, the sun is going down
It makes all the wetlands orange and red
The color my hair, the color of my heart
Is running to the swamp and falling on its face
Into you
Into you
Now it's dark, now it's night
The fireflies dance with their lantern light

There's a carnival in the swamp, I'm dancing with you
Upon our ten-foot crocodile
This makes me smile, the salt in the air
And the Indian girl running her fingers through my hair
Into you
Into you
Into you
Carnival!
Carnival, carnival!
Carnival, carnival!Embed
