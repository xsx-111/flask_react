Cyclops Nuclear Submarine Captain LyricsI am a cyclops, and I've got just one eye
I am a cyclops, and I've got just one eye
I am a cyclops, and I've got just one eye
And I'm looking at you
I am the captain of a nuclear submarine
I am the captain of a nuclear submarine
I am the captain of a nuclear submarine
And my periscope's on you
Yes, I'm looking at you
I am a cyclops, and I've got just one eye
I am a cyclops, and I've got just one eye
I am a cyclops, and I've got just one eye
And I'm looking at you
I am the captain of a nuclear submarine
I am the captain of a nuclear submarine
I am the captain of a nuclear submarine
And my periscope's on you
I am the cyclops nuclear sub captain
I am the cyclops nuclear sub captain
I am the cyclops nuclear sub captain
And I'm looking at you
And I'm looking at you
My big old eyeball
Looking through the periscope
I see you in the crosshairs
I wanna launch my torpedo at you
I wanna launch my torpedo at you
I wanna launch my torpedo in you, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, babyEmbed
