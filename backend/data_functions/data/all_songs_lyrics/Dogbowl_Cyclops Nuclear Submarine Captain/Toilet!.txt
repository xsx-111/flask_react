Toilet! LyricsBig top ocean man
Here come a television
Gonna put you in the toilet
Flush you down to the bottom
Lizard eye pluckin down
I watch you in the corner
Fluckin with the ice cream man
Falling in the toilet bowl
Everything is fake and fluckin
Chemicals are roly-poly
In my body, in my heinie
Mammoth heinie, roly-poly
Big top ocean blubber
Bigger than a mammoth blubber
Bigger than breast in opera
Bigger than the toilet flush
You see you in the back door
Eating all the snowflake falling
Falling in the toilet bowl
Landing on your blubber lips
Show mе your pajama
You say you're from Pa-ginia?
Well, I'm from Long Island
And my tongue is biggеr than an island
Falling in the toilet bowl
I'm dripping through the rusty pipes
Thinking of the flunking
Thinking of the something
The culture-catching that we had
Has given me a bump or two
Now I'm stuck inside the sewer
In the shape of floppen-flooper
Could there be a motive
In the bottom of an eyelid
That makes a lady want to flush me
Down into the toilet?
Could there be a motive
In the bottom of an eyelid
That makes a lady want to flush me
Down into the toilet?
Could there be a motive
In the bottom of an eyelid
That makes a lady want to flush me
Down into the toilet?
Could there be a motive
In the bottom of an eyelid
That makes a lady want to flush me
Down into the toilet?
That makes a lady want to flush me
Down into the toilet?
That makes a lady want to flush me
Down into the toilet?
That makes a lady want to flush me
Down into the...
