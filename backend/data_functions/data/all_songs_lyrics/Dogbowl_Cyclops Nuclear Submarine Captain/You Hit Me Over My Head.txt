You Hit Me Over My Head LyricsYou hit me over my head
When I lay my eyes on you
You have me falling into your spiderweb
You've wounded me, deliciously
I would be happy if you wrapped up me
Into your silver, silvery spiderweb
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 seconds, oh...
This is the moment
And that is the moment you caught me
Black is your color that I'll never see
When your webs are blinding me
It doesn't matter, 'cause I hear your spidery heart
You spin above, like a velvety dove
How can I struggle when I fall in love with you?
Your trap is like honey, and I am your prey
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 seconds, oh...
This is the moment
And that is the moment you caught me
And I'll hang like a fly for you
I will hang like a fly for you
I will hang like a fly for you
You hit me over my head
When I lay my eyes on you
Unsuspecting, unsuspecting was I
You don't know I fall into your web
You don't know I'm in your web
Unsuspecting, unsuspecting is you
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 seconds, oh...
This is the moment
And that is the moment you caught me
And I'll hang like a fly for you
I will hang like a fly for you
I will hang like a fly for you
This is the moment
And that is the moment you caught meEmbed
