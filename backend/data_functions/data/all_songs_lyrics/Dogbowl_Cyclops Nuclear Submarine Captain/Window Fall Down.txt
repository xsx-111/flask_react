Window Fall Down LyricsWindow fall down
I saw her hands upon the
Window they were
Ivory and made for me like
Hailstones falling
Or tents made out of 
And placed on a tray filled with fire
She tried so hard
To leave the prison in her head
But always her hands
Were falling off and sprouting wings
Upon the table
That looks just like the sky at night
So filled with stars, it's a beacon
Window fall down
That's the way the glass it shatters
When her face remains among the tiny windows
Placed upon the
Crashing waves of salt and green and
Flowers that talk on ÐµndlesslyEmbed
