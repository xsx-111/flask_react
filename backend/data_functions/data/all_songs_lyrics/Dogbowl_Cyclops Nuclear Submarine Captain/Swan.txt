Swan LyricsShe's animation
She’s a Dalmatian
Her neck is twenty feet high
She comes to me like a serpent in the sea
Swan will swallow me like a flower
She's like a dinosaur
My lips are so sore
The lotus eaten is me
I'll never forget the lazy sunset
Swan swallows me like a flower
She is a giant swan
She has a magic wand
She has me under her spell
I’m going crazy just being so lazy
Swan will swallow me like a flower
Lovely swan she cries all the day
When i tell her i'm going away
The tragedy and lies beneath her beauty
She'll always be unknown
I see her neck high
Above the island sky
She looks at me as i'm sailing
I cry all day but i know if i stay
The swan will swallow me like a flowerEmbed
