Ferris Wheel LyricsCarousel, you ride a purple horse
Under the light bulbs bursting in a circle of golden tulips
The carousel takes you far from me
Way across the sea of parking lots and cars and stars
The size of comets and planets and comets and planets
And comets and planets
You wear lipstick of Alaskan spiders
Spinning webs like the Ferris wheel rolling behind you
Miniature golf isn't absent in Wonderland
Ferris wheel takes you high in the sky
Above the ocean of parking lots and suburban roommates
You can see the cars made out of seashеlls
And comets and planets and comets and planеts
And comets and planets
So many years ago you broke my heart
Under the light bulbs bursting as the roller coaster
Slammed into me with the words you sing-song
I spent the night wandering to the dark
As the Ferris wheel followed me all the way home
Rolling like a memory and covered in bright lights
And comets and planets and comets and planets
And comets and planets
I felt the lust that takes you down to the harbor
I felt the lust that takes you down to the harbor
You kissed his lips on his lusty ship
And I watched you sail awayEmbed
