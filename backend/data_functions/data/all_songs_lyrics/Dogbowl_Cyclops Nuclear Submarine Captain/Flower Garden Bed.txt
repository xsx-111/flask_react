Flower Garden Bed LyricsUp on your house rooftop
I tried to fly
But i fell down instead
And landed hard on the pavement where I broke myself into
Little pieces of me for you to find and take with you
And you can plant each one
In soil floor
Your flower garden bed
Where i will grow into you and you into me because
Eache little piece of me
Will find each little piece of you
When the snow is coming down
I will be one with you
When you are down
Into your garden you will call into me
And what a good life we will have
As a tree growing made of pieces of me and you
And in the meantime i will ask you out
On a date with me
And we can go to the forest and watch all the trees growing
Just like the way your grow on me
Just like the way your grow on me
Just like the way your grow on meEmbed
