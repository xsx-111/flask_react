Apple Mary LyricsApple Mary makes me feel like candy
When she's kissing me high
Bowling ball dancing on an army bird highway
She's got apple pie eyes
They glow in the dark down in Central Park
Upon the Fourth of July
In my skull the fireworks fly
You and me inside a plastic tree
We're drinking cellophane tea
While Pluto-man has got his head in the sand
He's looking too much like me
Orantugan-bangatang is eating a boomerang
And you excite me
When you lie back on the wet carpet floor
Apple Mary don'tcha makе me your King Kong
I've got eyеs made of flies
Buzzing and busting while our aging is rusting
On the Fourth of July
While apples are smashing in a cyclotron ding-dong
You are kissing the sky
Making it all the time, you're going to blow my mind

You say, follow me high
Clipping the skin upon the crack of dawn fancy
You say, follow me lie
Orangutan-bangatang is killing his boomerang
And you excite me
I would die for just one night with you
Apple Mary don'tcha make me your fun-funk
Apple Mary turns me into her fun-funk
Apple Mary turns me into her fun-funk
