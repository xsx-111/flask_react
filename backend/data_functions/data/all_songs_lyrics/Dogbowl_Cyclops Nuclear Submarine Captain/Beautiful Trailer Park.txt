Beautiful Trailer Park LyricsBeautiful trailer park is a little company of sailors
High on a mighty ship made of ivory
The creaking of the little walk the ladies so sadly are crying
Their captain's wife, she washes her angle to see
And the sun sets not yet on her life
For her man with the ivory leg has a knife
And he'll sail his railroad train 'til he slays the white beast
All day long the commuting ones are filling the taxis
Each with a place to go on the mighty sea
So hail the mighty ivory captain with an ivory ship on his shoulders
His pagan crew of savage mechanics are true
From the antenna tops of the trailer park
They search for the white one who glows in the dark
And will spout from its gas tank a fountain of blasphemy
The fountain of white then opened its mouth filled with perfume
Seduced by the smell, we sharpened our razor blades
The ivory-leg captain then charged at his nemesis with vengeance
Into a blinding white light he gallops in veins
And then I saw this vessel so worthy of the sea
Sink to the bottom as cracked ivory
Now I'm an orphan adrift on a casket in the middle of
I'm an orphan adrift on a casket in the middle of
I'm an orphan adrift on a casket in the middle of the sea
In the sea
In the seaEmbed
