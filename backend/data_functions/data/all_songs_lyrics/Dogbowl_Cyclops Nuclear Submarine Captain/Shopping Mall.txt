Shopping Mall LyricsAurora Borealis I find
So deep in your pupils inside your eyes
Away with a halo of icicles
Falling from you
Halley's Comet and Comet Kohoutek
Each hold a spot in a velvety iris
Passing through both of your eyes
When you're eliminating me
I waited for you in the shopping mall
I waited for you in the shopping mall
Botticelli was dreaming of you
When the seashell opened presenting you
He painted you naked
And I fainted and fell to the floor
You emerged from the department store
Like a Venus rising from the ocean floor
The comets inside of your eyes eliminating me
I waited for you in the shopping mall
I waited for you in the shopping mall
There's not a lonelier place in the world
Than sitting alone in the shopping mall
Just waiting for something to happen
Anything at all
There's not a lonelier place in the world
Than sitting alone in a shopping mall
Just waiting for someone to happen
Anyone at allEmbed
