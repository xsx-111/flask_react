Revolution of the Homeless LyricsRevolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the...
I see TV antennas
They're dancing upon roofs of houses
Crumbling among the police sirens
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the...
I see bricks are flying
They are like the hailstones falling
On the sidewalk where the heads are cracking quietly
Revolution of thе homeless
Revolution of thе...
Police cars are burning
And the television stations have been
Taken by the people left with nothing
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the...
 with their doors broken
Are occupied by people holding
Bricks and stones and sticks and they are chanting
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
Smoke is rising in columns
Over the cities and the towns
Across the USA where the people are desperate
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the...
They call out the army
From the soldiers, join the revolution
They fight for the freedom to be sheltered
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the...
New York City stock exchange is collapsing
Into worthless ticker tape
And television sets burning
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the...
See the White House filled with people
Seeking shelter, they are rooting
The Oval Office and they are chanting
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
We want in, we want in, we want in, we want in
Homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Revolution of the homeless
Homeless, homeless, homeless, homeless...Embed
