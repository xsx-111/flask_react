Love Bomb LyricsIt's true that I don't know
The difference between
Inspired lunacy
And stupidity
'Cause I'm doltish, I'm clumsy
I'll fall on my face for you
So drop your big bomb, call me a bad bomb
I'm just your love bomb when you're kissing me
Love bomb, I'll be your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
Love bomb, I'll be your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
For you, for you
I'll chase you and then I'll kiss you
I'll put my tongue inside of your mouth
Under the covers we are lovers
You kiss my button and I'm exploding with you
'Cause I'm doltish, I'm clumsy
I'm a sloppy guy and you're an uptight girl
So kiss me, on my mouth, baby
I'm a love bomb for you
Love bomb, I'll be your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
Love bomb, I'll bе your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
For you, for you
Love bomb, I'll bе your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
Love bomb, I'll be your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
Love bomb, I'll be your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
Love bomb, I'll be your love bomb
Love bomb, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
For you, for youEmbed
