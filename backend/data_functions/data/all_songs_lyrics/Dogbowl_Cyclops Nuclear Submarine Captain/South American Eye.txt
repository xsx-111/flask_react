South American Eye LyricsOutside Argentina was burning
As she played her cello or viola
While the country was falling in ash
There was music in her ears
She smiled, a sound so lovely
So lost was she eternally
Below he saw the desert pass beneath as he flew
In the darkness the Arabian oil fields
Were like fire spots dancing
He smiled, the desert air lovely
Carries him into the sky
Later when the morning arrived
He flew right down to her
She was playing her cello or viola
At the top of the empire state building
Hello my argentine princess
I'm the Arabian Knight who flies
Over the desert and the ocean
Over the desert and the ocean
Over the desert and the ocean
Over the desert and the ocean
Over the desert and the ocean
Over the desert and the ocean
Over the desert and the ocean
Just to trade the sky for one long look into your South American eye1Embed
