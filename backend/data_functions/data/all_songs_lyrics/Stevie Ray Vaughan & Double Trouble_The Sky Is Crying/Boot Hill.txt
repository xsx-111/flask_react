Boot Hill LyricsLook up on the wall baby, hand me down my shootin' iron
Look up on the wall baby, hand me down my shootin' iron
Call your mother long distance, tell her to expect your body home
If the city don't bury you baby, Lord knows the county will
If the city don't bury you baby, Lord knows the county will
You've made your last mistake, you're goin' way out on Boot Hill
Lord, I don't wanna whacks you darlin', cause you gave my first thrill
Lord, I don't wanna whacks you baby, 'cause you gave me my first thrill
You did me so wrong baby, you're goin' out on Boot HillEmbed
