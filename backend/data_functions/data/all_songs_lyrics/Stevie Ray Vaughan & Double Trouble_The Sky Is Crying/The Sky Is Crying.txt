The Sky Is Crying LyricsThe sky is cryin....
Can't you see the tears roll down the street
The sky is cryin....
Can't you see the tears roll down the street
I've been lookin' for my baby
And I wonder where can she be
I saw my baby early one morning
She was walkin' on down the street
I saw my baby early this morning
She was walkin' on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
Made my poor heart skip a beat
I've got a real real real real bad feelin'
That my baby, she don't love me no more
I've got a real real bad feelin'
That my baby don't love me no more
Well, this guy, this guy's been cryin'
Can't you see the tears roll down my noseEmbed
