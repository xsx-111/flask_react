May I Have a Talk With You LyricsWell now, now darlin, may a have a little talk with you
Well now, now, now, now darlin, may a have a little talk with you
Because it won't be long before our true love will be through
Well now now now darlin am I right or am I wrong
Yeah now now now darlin am I right or am I wrong
Because it won't be long before our true love will be through
You know I like my coffee sweet in the morning
And I'm crazy about my tea at night
Yeah, I like my coffee sweet in the morning
And I'm crazy about my tea at night
You know you'd come out a little better now baby
All I want you to do is treat me rightEmbed
