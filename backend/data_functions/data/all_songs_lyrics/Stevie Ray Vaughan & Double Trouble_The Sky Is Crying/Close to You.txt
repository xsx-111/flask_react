Close to You LyricsI wanna be close to you baby, as I can get
Close to you baby, as water is wet
Close to you baby, as the hair on your head
Close to you baby, you better believe what I said
I wanna be close to you baby
Yeah, let me be close to you
I wanna be close to you darlin'
'Til you don't know what to say or do
I wanna be close to you baby, as white is to rice
Close you you baby, as cold is to ice
Close you you baby, as fire is to smoke
Close you you baby, as a pig is to pork
I wanna be close to you baby
Whoa, let me be close to you
I wanna be close to you darlin'
'Til you don't know what to say or do
I said closer and closer, baby
Closer and closer, baby - ha ha
Closer and closer, baby
Closer and closer, baby
I wanna be close to you, darlin'
'Til you don't know what to say or do
I wanna be close to you baby, as the whites of your eyes
Close to you baby, as cold is to ice
Close to you baby, as an egg is to a hen
Close you baby, as Siamese twins
I wanna be close to you baby
Yeah, let me be close to you
I wanna be close to you darlin'
'Til you don't know what to say or doEmbed
