So Excited Lyrics
Well, I'm so excited, darlin'...
Every time I think of you
So excited, baby
Every time I think of you
Makin' love to you, baby
Is all I ever want to do
You're like a four leaf clover, baby
A four leaf clover in my hand
Bring your love right over darlin'
A four leaf clover in my hand. ?
Luck is what I said, just like the love I have for you ?Embed
