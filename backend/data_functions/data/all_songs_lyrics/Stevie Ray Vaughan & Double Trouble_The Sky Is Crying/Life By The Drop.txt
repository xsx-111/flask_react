Life By The Drop Lyrics
Hello there my old friend
Not so long ago it was 'til the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
On our way up the road we started over again

You're living our dreams, oh you on top
My mind is aching, oh Lord it won't stop
That's how it's happened, living life by the drop

Up and down that road in our worn down shoes
Talking about good things and singing the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time

You're living our dreams, oh you on top
My mind is aching, Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens, living life by the drop

No wasted time, we're alive today
Churning up the past, there's no easier way
Time's been between us, a means to an end
God it's good to be here walking together my friend
Living our dream
My mind stopped aching
That's how it happened, living life by the drop

That's how it happened, living life by the drop
That's how it happened, living life by the drop3Embed
