Come to Terms LyricsThese lives are so contrived
And out of focus
But if I can derive some happiness from this
Then I’ll have made it out alive
‘Cause people always change
But ain’t always changing for the better
And just because the two of us
Will both grow old in time
Don’t mean we should grow old together
So I’ll be sure to turn my back
On everything you said you’d do
I’m gonna come to terms
Before I have to
Been keeping all my time In my back pocket
Taking from it only what I need to be
Whoever I’m supposed to be
But when I look at you I get so lonely
I used to just adore you
But now you bore me
‘Cause people always change
But ain’t always changing for the better
And just because the two of us
Will both grow old in time
Don’t mean we should grow old together
So I’ll be sure to turn my back
On everything you said you’d do
I’m gonna come to terms
Before I have to
I’ll never know If looking out the window
Is what brings me to my knees
Or if it’s what’s inside that’s killing me
‘Cause people always change
But ain’t always changing for the better
And just because the two of us
Will both grow old in time
Don’t mean we should grow old together
So I’ll be sure to turn my back
On everything you said you’d do
I’m gonna come to terms
I’m gonna come to terms
Before I have toEmbed
