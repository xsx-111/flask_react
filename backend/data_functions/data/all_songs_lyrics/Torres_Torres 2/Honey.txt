Honey LyricsThis cannot happen again
Twice in a year is too much
Heavy are you on my mind
Twice in a flush, it ain’t enough
Honey, while you were ashing in your coffee
I was thinking ‘bout telling you
What you’ve done to me
Honey, pretending like it never happened
Come over here and let me
Put you back together
Writing just to save my life
You stretch barelegged across each line
What ghost crawled inside my guitar?
Don’t move, just stay right where you are
I don’t need to look I’d know that voice anywhere
Everything hurts but it’s fine (it’s fine)
Happens all the time
Oh, happens all the time
Heavy are you on my mind
Heavy are you on my mind
Honey, while you were ashing in your coffee
I was thinking ‘bout telling you
What you’ve done to me
Honey, pretending like it never happened
Come over here and let me
Put you back together
Maybe some other time then I’ll come back again 
Honey, while you were ashing in your coffee
I was thinking ‘bout telling you
What you’ve done to me
Honey, pretending like it never happened
Come over here and let me
Put you back together 
Maybe some other time then I’ll come back again Embed
