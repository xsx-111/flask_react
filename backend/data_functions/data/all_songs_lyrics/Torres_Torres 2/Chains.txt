Chains LyricsThis was more than I had bargained for
They stuck gold and beelined for the door
Now I'll make me up from head to floor
If I don't find me soon, I won't be searching any more
'Cause I am starving for the truth
So feed me something real while I've got youth left in my veins
I believe I knew it all along
But you're the only one who didn't try to tell me I was wrong
So soon, so soon, so soon, I will run
Until then I'll sit and let you saw, saw away
'Til my chains are gone
Fool me once and I won't make a sound
Fool me twice, there's shame to go around
But I fooled myself for my whole life
Let me be the first to say, these feet never left the ground
And now I'm starving for the truth
So feed me something real while I've got youth left in my veins
I believe I knew it all along
But you're the only one who didn't try to tell me I was wrong
So soon, so soon, so soon, I will run
Until then I'll sit and let you saw, saw away
'Til my chains are gone
'Til my chains are gone
Gone
'Til my chains are gone
Don't give up on me just yet
Don't give up on me just yet
Don't give up on me just yet
Don't give up on me just yet
I am starving for the truth
So feed me something real while I've got youth left in my veins
I believe I knew it all along
But you're the only one who didn't try to tell me I was wrong
So soon, so soon, so soon, I will run
Until then I'll sit and let you saw, saw away
'Til my chains are gone
'Til my chains are gone
'Til my chains are gone
'Til my chains are gone
'Til my chains are gone
'Til my chains are gone
Gone
