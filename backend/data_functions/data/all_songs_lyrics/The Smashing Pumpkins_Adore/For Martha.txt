For Martha LyricsWhenever I run
Wherever I run to you, lost one
It’s never done
Just hanging on
The past has let me be
Returning as a dream
Shattered as belief
If you have to go, don’t say goodbye
If you have to go, don’t you cry
If you have to go, I will get by
Someday, I’ll follow you and see you on the other side
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
Your picture out of time
Left aching in my mind
Shadows kept alive
If you have to go, don’t say goodbye
If you have to go, don’t you cry
If you have to go, I will get by
I will follow you and see you on the other side
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
Long horses we are born
Creatures more than torn
Mourning our way home4Embed
