Annie-Dog LyricsAmphetamine Annie-Dog
Has her leash and a face
Her velvet spleen
Her shackle spine
Her diamond curse
It comes with mine
A vessel she for violent I
Confession arms a wake
Mine, mine, you were always mine
Possessed by my taste
And below, the angel dog
Combs her hair and sings her psalms
The bombs go off, she doesn’t notice
It all goes wrong, she sets things tragic
She is Venus, she is Mars
She’s electric, and the struggle of
Upon her face, we leave no trace
But in her stomach, mercury aged
She holds the blood
She carves the knives
She tapes the wires in our babies
Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Pulls her trash and her stories
From place to place, and bed to bed
Gives of herself and the magnet head
Another floor, another ceiling
Counting stars with double meanings
Is it wrong to be swallowed whole?
To disappear in her?
To give to her the priceless peace
Of giving up control?
We tumble out into the streets
And Annie-Dog, she drags her leash
Pretty face, ugly mouth
Bitter bred and so released
And by the no, and in the yes
Annie goes, if you couldn’t guess
A simple man, a sycophant
Her elephant with the laughing call
She wants clean sheets, and fresh flowers
And dental shots, and the Hong Kong glue
Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Has her leash and a face1Embed
