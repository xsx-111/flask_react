Crestfallen LyricsWho am I to need you when I’m down?
And where are you when I need you around?
Your life is not your own
And all I ask you
Is for another chance
Another way around you
To live by circumstance, once again
Who am I to need you now?
To ask you why?
To tell you no?
To deserve your love and sympathy?
You were never meant to belong to me
And you may go, but I know you won’t leave
Too many years built into memories
Your life is not your own
Who am I to need you now?
To ask you why?
To tell you no?
To deserve your love and sympathy?
You were never meant to belong to me
Who am I to you?
Along the way
I lost my faith
And as you were
You’ll be again
To mold like clay
To break like dirt
To tear me up in your sympathy
You were never meant to belong to me
You were never meant to belong to me
You were never meant to belong to me
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?4Embed
