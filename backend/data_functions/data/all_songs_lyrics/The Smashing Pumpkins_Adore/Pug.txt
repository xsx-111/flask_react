Pug Lyrics
Kiss and kill me sweetly
Come and drive me home
Drag the miles in me
I am yours alone

Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into you

Desire me so deeply
Drain and kick me hard
Whisper secrets for me
Try to go too far

Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into…
Please, don’t change
Please, don’t change at all
Bring your rain
Bring your rain to fall

Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into you

Come and kiss me sweetly
(Kiss kiss)
Ride the telephone
(Kiss kiss)
Drag the miles to me
(Kiss kiss)
I am yours alone
(Kiss kiss)
Yours alone
Yours alone
On the telephone
Yours alone
Looking for a kiss, kiss
Yours alone3Embed
