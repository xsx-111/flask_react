The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete Lyrics
Dusty screams
Through doors and imaginary floors
Why can't you miss me?
Pistol Pete
Removes the final breaths from her, unkind
And she is shaken

What does this mean?
In love or in peace?
With you lying next to me
So faithless, serene
And she calls to him

Let the waste
Cross the ancient trails to you
Far out
Beneath the sorrow clouds
Let them taste
The bitter, lost mistake of you
Let them cry out
Through your rusted scars

Alone, he roams
Inside the ordinary catacombs
Of her waiting
With raven hands
She steals and staggers towards her man
Still scorned by his demon
Because he's undone
Become the language of
Disaster and love
Vengeance and dust
And she calls to him

Let the waste
Cross the ancient trails to you
Far out
Beneath the sorrow clouds
Let them taste
The bitter, lost mistake of you
Let them cry out
Through your rusted scars

Dusty screams
Through doors and imaginary scenes
Of hurt and teardrop

As he holds her down
In the cold, lonely winds
Together again
Her inside him
And she calls to him
Let the waste
Cross the ancient trails to you
Far out
Beneath the sorrow clouds
Let them taste
The bitter, lost mistake of you
Let them cry out
Through your rusted scars1Embed
