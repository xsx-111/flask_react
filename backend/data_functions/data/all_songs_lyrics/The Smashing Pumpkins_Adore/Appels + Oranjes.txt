Appels + Oranjes Lyrics
What if the sun refused to shine?
What if the clouds refused to rain?
What if the wind refused to blow?
What if the seas refused to wave?
What if the world refused to turn?
What if the stars would hesitate?

What if, what is isn’t true?
What are you going to do?
What if, what is isn’t you?
Does that mean you’ve got to lose?
Digging for the feel of something new

What if the silence let you dream?
What if the air could let you breathe?
What if the words would bring you here?
What if this sound could bring you peace?

What if, what is isn’t true?
What are you going to do?
Digging for the feel of something new
What if, what is isn’t you?
What are you going to do?
It came from your thoughts, your dreams and visions
Ripped up from your weeks and indecisions

What if the sun refused to shine?
What if the clouds refused to rain?
What if the world refused to turn?
What if the clocks would hesitate?

What if, what is isn’t true?
What are you going to do?
What if, what is isn’t you?
Does that mean you’ve got to lose?
Digging for the feel of something new

Does that mean you’ve got to choose
The feel of something new?
Does that mean you’ve got to lose
The thoughts you cannot use?
What are you gonna do?1Embed
