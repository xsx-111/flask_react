Once Upon a Time LyricsMother, I’m tired
Come surrender, my son
Time has ravaged on my soul
No plans to leave but still, I go
Fallin’ with the leaves
Fallin’ out of sleep
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?
Mother, I’ve tried
Wasting my life
"I haven’t given up," I lie
To make you so proud in my eyes
Fallin’ out of sleep
Crawlin’ over me
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?
Tuesday's come and gone
Restless, still, I drive
Try to leave it all behind
Fallin’ out of sleep
Fallin’ with the leaves
I go crawlin’ over me
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
I went falling
I went falling
Mother, I hope you know
That I miss you so
Time has ravaged on my soul
To wipe a mother's tears grown cold1Embed
