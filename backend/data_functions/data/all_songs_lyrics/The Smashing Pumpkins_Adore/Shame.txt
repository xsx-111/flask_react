Shame Lyrics
You’re gonna walk on home
You’re gonna walk alone
You’re gonna see this through
Don’t let them get to you

Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame

Love is good and love is kind
Love is drunk and love is blind
Love is good and love is mine
Love is drunk all the time

Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame

You’re gonna walk on home
You’re gonna walk alone
You’re gonna walk so far
You’re gonna wonder who you are
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Shame
Shame

Love is good and love is kind
Love is good and love is blind
Love is good and love is mine
Love is good all the time

Hello, goodbye
You know you made us cry
Hello, goodbye
You know you made us cry
Hello, goodbye
You know you made us cry
Hello, goodbye
You know you made us cry
Hello, goodbye
You know you made us cry
Hello, goodbye
You know you made us cry
Hello, goodbye
You know you made us cryEmbed
