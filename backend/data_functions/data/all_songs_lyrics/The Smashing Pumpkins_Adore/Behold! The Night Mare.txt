Behold! The Night Mare LyricsI’ve faced the fathoms in your deep
Withstood the suitor's quiet siege
Pulled down the heavens just to please you
Appease you
The wind blows and I know
I can’t go on
Digging roses from your grave
To linger on
Beyond the beyond
Where the willows weep
And the whirlpools sleep
You’ll find me
The coarse tide reflects sky
And the night mare rides on
And the night mare rides on
With a December black psalm
And the night mare rides on
What I fear is lost here
The wind blows and I know
All you have to do is run away
And steal yourself from me
Become a mystery to gaze into
You’re so cruel in all you do
But still, I believe, I believe in you
So may you come with your own knives
You’ll never take me alive
With all the force of what is true
Is there nothing I can do?
I can’t go on
Digging roses from your grave
To linger on
Beyond the beyond
Where the willows weep
And the whirlpools sleep
You’ll find me
And the night mare rides on
And the night mare rides on
With a December black psalm
And the night mare rides on
I’ve faced the fathoms in your deep
Withstood the suitor's quiet siege
Pulled down the heavens just to please you
To hold the flower I can’t keepEmbed
