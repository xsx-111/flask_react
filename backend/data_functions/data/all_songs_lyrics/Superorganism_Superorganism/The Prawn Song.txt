The Prawn Song Lyrics
Oh, have you ever woke up from a daydream
And realized that the world's gone crazy?
You people are all the same
Going blah blah blah, going bang bang bang
Oh, I'm a laid-back girl
Float in the sun, looking down at the world
Oh, just sippin', it's kinda my thing

You do you, I'll do me
Chillin' at the bottom of the sea and I say...

I'm happy just being a prawn
Oh, I'm happy just being a prawn, prawn, prawn, prawn

Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn

Oh, have you ever seen the prawn cause a world war?
Have you ever kissed a prawn; got a cold sore?
Have you ever seen a prawn kick off?
Have you ever seen a prawn in a pair of handcuffs, oh
You people make the same mistakes
Over and over, it's really kinda dumb, oh
Slow learning is kinda your thing
You do you, I'll do me
Chillin' at the bottom of the sea and I say...

I'm happy just being a prawn
Oh, I'm happy just being a prawn (ooh)
I'm happy just being a prawn (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm happy just being a prawn, prawn, prawn, prawn

Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn

...recently being discovered that these prawns have a highly sophisticated social system, similar to that of bees or ants
Prawn, prawn
...different individuals are specialized for particular tasks... this superorganism is impressive no matter how you look at it
Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn
Prawn, prawn5Embed
