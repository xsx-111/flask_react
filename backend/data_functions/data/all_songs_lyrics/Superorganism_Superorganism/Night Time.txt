Night Time Lyrics
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)

They said sleep is for the weak
And I gave into the mantra
The scene was derelict
The Facebook propaganda
My router is a candle
That ignites my slim innocence
And I see how this was so dull
But I liked the blue brittleness

Of the nighttime (wake up, wake up, wake up)
Of the nighttime (wake up, wake up, wake up)
Of the nighttime (oh-oh, in the nighttime, oh-oh, in the nighttime)
Of the nighttime (oh-oh, in the nighttime, oh-oh)

Curious camgirls
Cruel and kind cherry boys
They were restless for those refills
Superimposed on a green screen
Your aimless web surfing
And arranged brain battling
I just wanted to be R. Crumb
Sitting like a clot in my brain
In the nighttime (wake up, wake up, wake up)
In the nighttime (wake up, wake up, wake up)
In the nighttime (oh-oh, in the nighttime, oh-oh, in the nighttime)
In the nighttime (oh-oh, in the nighttime, oh-oh)


Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh
In the nighttime (oh-oh, in the nighttime, oh-oh, in the nighttime)
In the nighttime (oh-oh, in the nighttime, oh-oh, in the nighttime)
In the nighttime (oh-oh, in the nighttime, oh-oh, in the nighttime)
In the nighttime (wake up, wake up, wake up)10Embed
