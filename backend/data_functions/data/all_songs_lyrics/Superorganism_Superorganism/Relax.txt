Relax Lyrics
Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of the time

Breeze is buzzing about
But school's out, join the crowd
We've got it all, the dilettante
Not ignorant, our honey hunt
You know we've got the best itinerary

So just relax, oh just relax
Turn on, tune in, drop out if you can
And just relax, oh just relax
We're breathing in, breathing out, oh, oh

So just relax
Oh just relax
Yeah just relax
Oh just relax

Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of the time
Stereo's getting too loud
Mustard seeds on the ground
Our ride must be still wet, I bet
Too much honey will put you in debt
Stop giving yourself a cold sweat

So just relax, oh just relax
Turn on, tune in, drop out if you can
And just relax, oh just relax
We're breathing in, breathing out, oh, oh

So just relax
Oh just relax
Yeah just relax
Oh just relax

Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of the time
Most of theEmbed
