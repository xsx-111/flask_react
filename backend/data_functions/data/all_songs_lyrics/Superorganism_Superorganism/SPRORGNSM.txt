SPRORGNSM Lyrics
When I grow up, I wanna be
A superorganism, come on give it to me
Put your mind in my brain and you'll see
Everything is better when you're everything

Don't let the kids suck you up, in flux
Wait for the seed to erupt and be gone

Everybody wants to be a superorganism
A superorganism, a superorganism
I wanna be a superorganism
A superorganism, a superorganism

A superorganism is a creature
Made up of many different individuals
Thanks to technological systems
You are me, and I am you
We are tied together into a single processing system
Together we are an amazing superorâ€”

When I grow up, I need to be
A superorganism, come on give it to me
Are you aware? Are you alone with the taste
Of architectures forming from my acid waste
It wasn't right for you to refuse
It's okay now you're part of the only thing alive

Everybody needs to be a superorganism
A superorganism, a superorganism
I wanna be a superorganism
A superorganism, a superorganism
I gotta be a superorganism
A superorganism, a superorganism
I have to be a superorganism
A superorganism, a superorganism

When I grow up, I wanna be
A superorganism, come on give it to me7Embed
