Nobody Cares Lyrics
Incomplete without tearing up all of the sleeves
Nobody cares
"You look fine", no I don’t, let’s consult our favorite recipe
Nobody cares
Oh no, nobody cares

Out we go into the world of scary eyes and lies
Low key baby, I’m never feeling quite alright
Nobody cares
Oh no, nobody cares
Oh no, nobody cares

How am I to care, how am I to care
How am I to care when nobody else does

Sweet relief when you grow up and see for yourself
Nobody cares
Have a drink, have a smoke, do whatever you need to unload
Nobody cares
Oh no, nobody cares

Record skip, tripping over, falling up the stairs
Awkward kids putting gel into their greasy hair
Nobody cares
Oh no, nobody cares
Oh no, nobody cares
How am I to care, how am I to care
How am I to care when nobody else does6Embed
