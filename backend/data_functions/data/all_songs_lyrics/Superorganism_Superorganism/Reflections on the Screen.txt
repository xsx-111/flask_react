Reflections on the Screen Lyrics
It was never jealousy
Just acute hyperbole
Idiocracy, I dream
And he's still keen to chill with me
I've zoomed in 1080p
Your pseudo-smile is so unfree

All this stalling, keeps me going
Just recalling, you and me
And there's something, so affecting
In the reflections, on my screen

This is a portfolio
The chat log's loading way too slow
Your good girl lingerie shows
And she's still keen to chill with me
Ditched on her master's degree
What a drag your life must be

All this calling, keeps me going
Just recalling, you and me
And there's something, so affecting
In the reflections, on my screen
Without you I don't know where I'd be
Without you I don't know where I'd be
Without you where the hell would I be? (oh oh oh)
Without you I don't know where I'd be
Without you I don't know where I'd be
Without you where the hell would I be?

All this stalling, it keeps me going
Just recalling, you and me
And there's something, so affecting
In the reflections, on my screen

It makes me feel alive
Sat in bed lit by the light
A silly gif playing on repeat3Embed
