Something for Your M.I.N.D. Lyrics
I know you think I'm a psychopath
A Democrat lurking in the dark
This sucks, I'm the Kmart soda jerk
Cirque du trash, I kept the stash
Of cocoa candy straight from Japan
Hologram Anne—she was never as near
I think you know what I need to get by

Something for your mind (mind), mind (mind), mind (mind)
Something for your mind (mind), mind, mind (mind)
(무엇인가 정신에 집어넣으세요)
Something for your mind (mind, mind, mind)
(마음에 어떤 것 필요합니까?)
Something for your mind (mind, mind)
(정신에 집어넣으세요)
Something for your, for your
M-I, M-I, M-I-N-D
M-I, M-I, M-I-N-D

I know you think I'm a sociopath
"My lovely prey," I'm a cliché
Make way, I'm in my Pepsi mood
Mama needs food, how about a barbecue?
For us the bourgeoisie, so carefree
Remember when we?
I don't know what you need to get by
Something for your mind (mind), mind (mind), mind (mind)
Something for your mind (mind), mind, mind (mind)
(무엇인가 정신에 집어넣으세요)
Something for your mind (mind, mind, mind)
(마음에 어떤 것 필요합니까?)
Something for your mind (mind, mind)
(정신에 집어넣으세요)
Something for your, for your (for your)
M-I, M-I, M-I-N-D
M-I, M-I, M-I-N-D18Embed
