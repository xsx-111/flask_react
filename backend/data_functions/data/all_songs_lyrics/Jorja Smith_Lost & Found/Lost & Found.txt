Lost & Found Lyrics
Yeah like that, sounds cool


(Why do we all fall down? Why do we all fall down?)
Why do we all fall down with innocence still on the ground?
No, oh-oh-oh
Why do we all fall down and apart on the lost and found? (Hm)

I never thought I would ever find
Something so assured but so fine (But so fine, but so fine)
I'd fantasize that you'd come around
Focus and your dreams turn to reality
So, tell me, how am I ever gonna find love in you?
If I do not even know what I want from you
'Cause we both want different things
Why can't this be one common theme?
No, I never thought I would ever find
Something so assured but so fine

Why do we all fall down with innocence still on the ground?
No, oh-oh-oh
Why do we all fall down and apart on the lost and found? (Hm)
I never thought you would stay around
It felt way too good to be real (To be real, to be real)
I heard that good things don't last a while
Please don't be the one to leave first
They say we're way too young to get the job done
Are we really too young to be havin' so much fun?
'Cause I'm not quite sure right now
I don't really understand how
I am ever really gonna be in love with you
'Cause I never even thought you would want me too
I am gone now

Why do we all fall down with innocence still on the ground?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Why do we all fall down and apart on the lost and found? (Hm)

I'm in love with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you13Embed
