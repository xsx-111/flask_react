Lifeboats (Freestyle) Lyrics
And it all falls down, yeah
And it all falls down again
And it all falls down, yeah
And it all falls down

How can you learn  how to swim before you get in?
Sometimes you got to take the plunge just to get in
Life's not full of shallow ends, your house ain't full of armbands
Stay afloat, someone might put their arm out to help you
I don't know, I would
If I saw somebody drowning in a sea of self-confusion
I wanna be the one to try and understand why their tide ain't coming in
And their lighthouse ain't shining, mmm

So why do we all fall down
If there's a reason we can stay afloat?
Why do we watch them drown?
We're too selfish in the lifeboats
Why do we all fall down
If there's a reason we can stay afloat?
Why do we watch them drown?

So why are all the richest staying afloat?
Seeing all my brothers drowning even though they nicked the boat
Mothership ain't helping anyone
See, the ships are getting bigger, full of greedy wasteful men
Soaking kids with the lies before they even got to ten, mmm
Sailing the internet waves, a tsunami of wires
A flood to take us under if we can't afford the life jackets
Majority don't even have the life jacket
Majority might fall where the tax brackets
The minority might jump to the next bracket
On a form to sign up for a raft and a pay packet
With the same old unemployed age bracket
Even money sinks to the bottom when it's waterlogged
So nobody truly stays afloat
So why do we all fall down
If there's a reason we can stay afloat?
And why do we watch them drown?
We're too selfish in the lifeboats
Why do we all fall down
If there's a reason we can stay afloat?
Why do we watch them drown?

And it all falls down, yeah
And it all falls down again
And it all falls down, yeah
And it all falls down5Embed
