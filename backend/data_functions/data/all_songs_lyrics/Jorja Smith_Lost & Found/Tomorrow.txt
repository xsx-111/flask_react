Tomorrow Lyrics
The hardest thing I have learned is I can't help myself
If I can't trust my worth
Then I can't trust my words
Accepting it's not my fault but I'm the one to blame
And I know I've got to change
No I'm not ashamed

You've given me all of your time
You've been there for all of my crimes
You've shown me there's flaws in blue skies
Only you, only you

So don't you wonder why
I won't say goodbye
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
Why I can't sleep at night
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow

Patiently there for me when I'm full speed ahead and
It's all been in my head, I need to get out of your bed
Well no one can understand confusion like I do
These blue days are my truth
There's silence in my room
You've been there for all of my crimes
Only you, only you

So don't you wonder why
I won't say goodbye
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
Why I can't sleep at night
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow

I've said what I can
But do you hear it? Do I know who I am?
Will you believe me that I won't do you wrong?
That's what I've done all along
By finding myself I nearly lost it all
By fighting your help I thought I knew it all
I'm lying alone and now I know it all

So don't you wonder why
I won't say goodbye
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
Why I can't sleep at night
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
(Why, bye, cry)
It will all make sense tomorrow
(Why, bye, cry)
It will all make sense tomorrow8Embed
