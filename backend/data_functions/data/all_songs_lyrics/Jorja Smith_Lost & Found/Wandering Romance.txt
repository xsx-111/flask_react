Wandering Romance Lyrics
No one knows the pain
No one sees what I see in you
No one feels the same
No one sees myself like you do
Would it be easier if I stayed at home?
Wasting my time on my own
Hoping that you'd come along
And would you be honest, babe?
If I said the words "Do you love me?" for a moment
Or is this just wandering romance?

Tell me why you can't control
The feelings you desire
Burning all my bridges
As you set my walls on fire

Save me being honest, babe
Save me from your promises
Taint me with your constant shame
Let me bleed your love away

So take it how you want it
Take on my love
Take it how you want it
Take on my love
Take it how you got me now
After breaking down my heart
Take it how you want it
Take on my love
No one knows the pain
Nobody is watching when you're gone
No one cleans the stains
But no one keeps me dirty like you do

Tell me why you can't control
The feelings you desire
Burning all my bridges
As you set my walls on fire

Save me being honest, babe
Save me from your promises
Taint me with your constant shame
Let me bleed your love away

So take it how you want it
Take all my love
Take it how you want it
Take all my love
Take it how you've got me now
After breaking down my heart
Take it how you want it
Take all my love
Burning, yeah
Burning all my bridges
As you set my walls on fire
Save me being honest, babe
Save me from your promises
Taint me with your constant shame

So take it how you want it
Take all my love
Take it how you want it
Take all my love
Take it now you've got me now
After breaking down my heart
So take it how you want it
Take all my love11Embed
