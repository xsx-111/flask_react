On Your Own Lyrics
There ain't nothing left
Photographed our picture by my bed
What you think when you said all that you did
You let me think that I caused all of the shit, no

Said you're tired of my problem, that's a lot of big talk
Yeah, I'm tired of being hushed, now I'm all done talking to ya
One last thing for ya, uh (Ay)

So take it all
On your own tonight
You're all alone tonight
Wasted it all
On yourself tonight
You're by yourself tonight

This time, I'm gone
Even better now I've left you
But I've lost a lot of trust
Over time and I've gotten lost in love
Got hearts broke so I know why
I wouldn't trust
So I'ma build myself back in my own way
Go on and take you of your old ways
Now I'm all done talking to ya
One last thing for ya, uh (Ay)

Take it all
On your own tonight
You're all alone tonight
Wasted it all
On yourself tonight
You're by yourself tonight

Take
All the love
And waste
Yourself tonight

Take it all
On your own tonight
You're all alone tonight
Wasted it all
On yourself tonight
You're by yourself tonight
Take it all
On your own tonight
You're all alone tonight
Wasted it all
On yourself tonight
You're by yourself tonight11Embed
