February 3rd Lyrics
There's a life outside I didn't know
Tied up, fallin' down to an empty soul
And Lord knows that this love has taken toll
I've given all of my love to this broken home

So why don't you lose yourself for me?
Why don't you lose yourself for me?
What is it that your eyes don't see?
Why don't you lose yourself for me?

It won't work if it don't make sense at all
I'm so lost that I can't see through the fold
The same stains that were left from the cherry wine
The same stains that I wish we could both rewind

Did you notice that the feelin' ain't never gone?
Did you notice it's the feelin' you've been runnin' from?
You wouldn't notice if your eyes ain't fallin' for me
Did you open up my heart just to take it from me?

So why don't you lose yourself for me?
So why don't you lose yourself for me?
What is it that your eyes don't see?
Why don't you lose yourself for me?
Why don't you lose yourself for me?
Why don't you lose yourself for me?
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself, it ain't the same
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose, lose
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose yourself from playing games
Lose, lose

Well, sometimes you could be lost, you could be found
I've been lost, I've been lost again and I've been found
Then I found myself but I'm constantly finding myself11Embed
