Where Did I Go? Lyrics
Maybe this fate was overdue
Baby, it's late and I'm confused
You showed me love that wasn't real (wasn't real)
Can't teach yourself to be sincere

Where did I go? When did the sun rise?
How did I fall? Got lost in the moonlight
Where did I go? When did I realize
My love was on hold? So now this is goodbye
Good, goodbye, goodbye
Good, goodbye, goodbye

This time my questions lay with you
(Lay with you, lay with you)
'Cause each time inside I play the fool
(Played the fool, play the fool)
Silly boy, where did that man go?
The one that hurt my soul
(The one that hurt my soul)
Now little man, I left you on your own
With the whispers on your phone
I've been askin' all along
(Asking all along)
Where did I go? (Where did I go?) When did the sun rise? (When did the sun rise?)
How did I fall? (How did I fall?) Got lost in the moonlight (lost in the moonlight)
Where did I go? (Where did I go?) When did I realize
My love was on hold? So now this is goodbye (This is goodbye)

Good, goodbye, goodbye
Good, goodbye, goodbye
Good, goodbye, goodbye
Good, goodbye, goodbye

Where did I go? (Where did I go?) When did the sun rise?
How did I fall? (How did I fall?) Got lost in the moonlight
Where did I go? When did I realize
My love was on hold? (On hold)
So now this is goodbye, good, goodbye10Embed
