Goodbyes Lyrics
One, two, three, four

How could we know
That there wouldn't be tomorrow?
No birds will sing
But the bells will ring for you
So far to go
But you've already reached the light
Your new beginning
Chapters are written out for you

Down here they're hurting
From a broken heart
Trying to figure out
How this is real

'Cause they're never coming back down
They belong to the stars in the clouds
Goodbyes, good times
L-O-V-E was all for you
If you didn't say your goodbyes
Don't worry, love will power through
'Cause they're never coming back down
They belong to the stars in the clouds
How do we grow
If you're not moving with us?
Constantly dark
Time will move in our favor
They'll never know
But they just keep on asking when

We're down here hurting
From our broken heart
Trying to figure out
How this is real

'Cause you're never coming back down
You belong to the stars in the clouds
Goodbyes, good times
L-O-V-E was all for you
If you didn't say your goodbyes
Don't worry, love will power through

I'm sorry that I never replied
How was I to know this would be our last goodbye
We can't look at the world with tears in our eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Just think of the good times you've left behind
L-O-V-E was all for you, no
If you didn't say your goodbyes
Don't worry, love will power through, no, no
'Cause you're never coming back down
You belong to the stars in the clouds53Embed
