Razor Face Lyrics
Has anybody here seen Razor Face?
I heard he's back, looking for a place, to lay down
Must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him around
Needs a man who's young to walk him around

Oh, it must be hard for the likes of you
To get by in a world that you just can't see through
And it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home
How does it feel to know you can't go home

Come on, Razor Face, my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, ooh! Amazing grace, protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

Has anybody here seen Razor Face?
I heard he's back, and looking for a place, to lay down
Must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him around
Needs a man who's young to walk him around
Come on, Razor Face, my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, ooh! Amazing grace, protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

I love your Razor Face
I love your Razor Face
Ooh, I love Razor Face
Love your Razor Face
I did love your Razor Face
I love your Razor FaceEmbed
