My Parties Lyrics
Well this is my back yard - my back gate
I hate to start my parties late
Here's the party cart - ain't that great?
That ain't the best part baby - just wait
That's a genuine weathervane - it moves with the breeze
Portable hammock baby - who needs trees
It's casual entertaining - we aim to please

At my parties
Check out the shingles - it's brand new
Excuse me while I mingle - hi, how are you
Hey everybody - let me give you a toast
This one's for me - the host with the most

It's getting a trifle colder - step inside my home
That's a brass toilet tissue holder with its own telephone
That's a musical doorbell - it don't ring, I ain't kiddin'
It plays "America the Beautiful" and "Tie a Yellow Ribbon"
Boy, this punch is a trip - it's OK in my book
Here, take a sip - maybe a little heavy on the fruit
Ah, here comes the dip - you may kiss the cook
Let me show you honey - it's easy - look
You take a fork and spike 'em - say, did you try these?
So glad you like 'em - the secret's in the cheese
It's casual entertaining - we aim to please
At my parties
At my parties
Now don't talk to me about the polar bear
Don't talk to me about the ozone layer
Ain't much of anything these days, even the air
They're running out of rhinos - what do I care?
Let's hear it for the dolphin - let's hear it for the trees
Ain't running out of nothing in my deep freeze
It's casual entertaining - we aim to please

At my parties
Do what you please
At my parties
Yeah at my parties
You do what you please
At my parties
Oh yes at my parties
Yeah I thought you'd like that
Hmm that's nice
At my parties
Yeah at my parties
Oh yeah at my parties
You do what you please
At my partiesEmbed
