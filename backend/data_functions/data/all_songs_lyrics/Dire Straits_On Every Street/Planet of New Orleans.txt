Planet of New Orleans Lyrics

Standing on the corner
Of Toulouse and Dauphin
Waiting on Marie Ondine
I'm trying to place a tune
Under Louisiana moonbeam
On the planet of New Orleans
In a bar they call the Saturn
And in her eyes of green
And something that she said in a dream
Inside of my suit I got my mojo root
And a true love figurine
For the planet of New Orleans

New Orleans
With other life upon it
And everything that's shaking in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of New Orleans

Now I'm trying to find my way
Through the rain and the steam
I'm looking straight ahead through the screen
And then I heard her say
Something in the limousine
About taking a ride across the planet of New Orleans

If she was an ace
And I was just a jack
And the cards were never seen
We could have been the king and the queen
But she took me back to her courtyard
Where magnolia perfume screams
Behind the gates and the granite
Of the planet of New Orleans

New Orleans
With other life upon it
And everything that's shaking in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of New Orleans
With other life upon it
And everything that's shaking in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of New Orleans1Embed
