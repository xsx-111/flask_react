The Bug Lyrics
Well it's a strange old game - you learn it slow
One step forward and it's back to go
You're standing on the throttle, you're standing on the brakes
In the groove 'til you make a mistake
Sometime-a you're the windshield
Sometime-a you're the bug
Sometime it all come together baby
Sometime-a you're a fool in love
Sometime-a you're the Louisville Slugger baby
Sometime-a you're the ball
Sometime it all come together baby
Sometime you're gonna lose it all
Groovy
(Groovy)
(Groovy)

You gotta know happy - you gotta know glad
Because you're gonna know lonely and you're gonna know bad
When you're rippin' and a-ridin'
And you're coming on strong
You start a-slippin' and a-slidin'
And it all go wrong, because
Sometime-a you're the windshield
Sometime-a you're the bug
Sometime it all come together baby
Sometime-a you're a fool in love
Sometime-a you're the Louisville Slugger baby
Sometime-a you're the ball
Sometime it all come together
Sometime you're gonna lose it all
Groovy
(Groovy)
And again, groovy
(Groovy)
Right now

One day you got the glory, then you got none
One day you're a diamond and then you're a stone
Everything can change in the blink of an eye
So let the good time roll before we say goodbye

Sometime-a you're the windshield
Sometime-a you're the bug, yeah
Sometime it all come together baby
Sometime-a you're a fool in love
Sometime-a you're the Louisville Slugger, baby
Sometime-a you're the ball
Sometime it all come together baby
Sometime you're gonna lose it all
I said
Sometime-a you're the windshield
Sometime-a you're the bug
Sometime it all come together baby
Sometime-a you're a fool in love
Sometime-a you're the Louisville Slugger, baby
Sometime-a you're the ball
Sometime it all come together baby
Sometime you're gonna lose it all
Groovy
(Do the bug)
(Do the bug)
(The bug, yeah)
(The bug)
