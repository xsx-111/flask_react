Cry, Cry Lyrics
My my my
My my eyes
I can't believe I'm cryin'
Yeah, cryin'
You you
Yeah you, you broke my heart it's true
Yeah, true
It seems to me
You should have told me
I just can't go on this way

My my my
My my eyes
I can't believe I'm cryin'
Yeah, cryin'
You you
Yeah you, you broke my heart it's true
Yeah, true
You say to me
You say you never
Realized how much you were suffering
So don't you call me on the phone
Oh baby no baby
Just to say you're all alone
And cry, and cry cry cry

It seems to me
You should have told me
I just can't go on this way

Ooh don't you call me on the phone
Oh baby, no no baby
Just to say you're all alone
And cry, oh cry cry cry

Oh cry, cry
Cry, cry
Cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry
Oh cry, don't cry
Ooh no, ah
Ooh, ooh
Feel so sorry
I feel so lonely
Oh, oh, ahEmbed
