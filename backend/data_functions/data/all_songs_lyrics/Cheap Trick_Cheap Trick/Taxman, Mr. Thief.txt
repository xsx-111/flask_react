Taxman, Mr. Thief Lyrics
You work hard, you make money
There ain't no one in this world who can stop you
You work hard, you went hungry
Now the taxman is out to get you
You worked hard
And you slaved and slaved for years
Break your back, sweat a lot
Well, it's just not fair

He hates you, he loves money
And he'll steal your shit and think that it's funny
Like the Beatles he ain't human
Now the taxman is out to get you
You worked hard
And slaved and slaved for years
You played
And you played and played for years

Taxman, Mr. Heath
He's looking for a run-in, yeah
Taxman, Mr. Heath
He's looking for a run-in, a run-in yeah yeah
Taxman, Mr. Heath
He's looking for a run-in, yeah
Taxman is a thief
He's looking for a run-in, a run-in yeah yeah


You work hard, you make money
There ain't no one in this world who can stop you
You work hard, you went hungry
Now the taxman is out to get you
You worked hard
And you slaved and slaved for years
Break your back, sweat a lot
Well, it's just not fair

Taxman, Mr. Heath
He's looking for a run-in, yeah
Taxman, he's a thief
He's looking for a run-in, a run-in yeah yeahEmbed
