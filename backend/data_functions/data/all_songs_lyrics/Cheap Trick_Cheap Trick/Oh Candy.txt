Oh Candy Lyrics
Oh Candy why did you do it?
You should've called me on the telephone
I didn't expect for you to call me
'Cause I didn't think that you were alone
So alone

Oh, Candy worked so hard
At doin' what he thought was right
It really really doesn't mean a thing
Oh, Candy worked so hard
At doin' what he thought was right
It really really doesn't mean a thing

Oh Candy, why did you do it?
You didn't stick a needle in your vein
You just got so damned depressed
We all liked you except yourself
Oh no, oh no


Oh, Candy worked so hard
At doin' what he thought was right
It really really doesn't mean a thing
Oh, Candy worked so hard
At doin' what he thought was right
It really really doesn't mean a thing

You, you won't be comin' around no more
Oh, oh (You won't be comin' around no more)
You, you won't be comin', you won't be comin'
You won't be coming
You won't be comin' around no more
(You won't be comin' around no more)
You, you won't be coming around no more
Oh, oh (You won't be comin' around no more)
Oh Candy, why did you do it?
I didn't think you heard a word that I saidEmbed
