Daddy Should Have Stayed in High School Lyrics
I've been waiting every night after school
For five long years, five long years
I'll keep waiting there for five nights a week
'Cause I'm no good

Ooh, rockin' and a rollin'
Reelin' till the juke breaks
Ooh, reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' till the juke breaks down

I'm thirty but I feel like sixteeen
I might even know your daddy
I'm dirty but my body is clean
I might even be your daddy

Ooh, rockin' and a rollin'
Reelin' till the break of
Ooh, reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' till the juke breaks

I like you and you like me, yes?
Sorry but I had to gag you
You look better completely undressed
Sorry but I had to have you

I like you and you like me, yes?
Sorry but I had to gag you
You look better completely undressed
Sorry but I had to have you

Ahh I'm thirty but I feel like sixteeen
How would you like some candy?
I'm thinking more than a kiss
Whip me, spank me, grab me

Grab me
Grab me
Grab me, me, ohEmbed
