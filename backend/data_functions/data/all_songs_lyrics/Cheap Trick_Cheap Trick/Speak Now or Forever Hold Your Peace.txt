Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace Lyrics
Yesterday feels like running away
Feels like givin' the child, gettin' lost losin' mind
I'm feelin' low and I got no place to go
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up yeah yeah

Oh yesterday feels like running away
And I know, I'm givin' up my time to still lost still lost up in my my mind
Even things that I know, and I've got no place to go
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up

Right now

Yesterday feels like running away, well I know
I'm giving up my time, I'm, I'm just giving up
I can't find my mind
Even things I don't know
And I've got no place to go
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up
Oh yeah yeah
Oh oh oh

Ooh I need your tender lovin'
You need me too, I know
There's still chance for a better life
Yes I know1Embed
