Mandocello Lyrics
I can hear you laughing
You're a million miles away or you're here
I will never leave you
But I'm a million miles away or I'm near

I'm the thoughts you're thinking
But you're a lifetime away from your home or you're here
I, I can see you crying
You're a million miles away or you're here

Look at me like I look at you
Think of me like I think of you
Speak to me like I spoke to you
Dream of me how I dream of you

I can hear you thinking
You're a million thoughts away
I'm the dreams you're dreaming
I'm a million dreams away or I'm here

We can go down slowly like the rain
I could leave and be with you again, oh
I could be your lover, let's pretend, oh oh
