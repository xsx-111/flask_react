I Want You to Want Me (Early Version) Lyrics
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'm begging you to beg me

I'll shine up the old brown shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

I'll shine up the old brown shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Feeling all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dying
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?


Feeling all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dying
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?


Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't, didn't I, didn't I, didn't IEmbed
