Lookout (Studio Version) Lyrics
There is somewhere, someplace
In the world I want to take you
Lookout, lookout, lookout
And remember one boy in a thousand
That wants to make you
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl lookout
Ah ah ah

If you're hiding and I'm hiding
From some bum that wants to get you
Lookout, lookout, lookout
If you're lonely and I'm lonely
And I'm near you I can hear you
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl lookout
Ah ah ah

See over yonder when the rights are read your name
Search to the riddle, to the clue, to the river she came
Look out on the land, to the south, to the east three said
Cancel Colorado in the march by request
Don't go on the look out of a whim, aye she said

There is somewhere, someplace
In the world I want to take you
Lookout, lookout, lookout
And one boy, one boy in a thousand
That wants to make you
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl lookout
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ahEmbed
