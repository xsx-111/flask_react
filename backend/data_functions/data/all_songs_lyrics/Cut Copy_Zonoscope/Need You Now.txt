Need You Now LyricsHush darling, don't you cry
Hush darling, don't you cry
Cause they're never gonna reach you
Never gonna reach you
Hush darling, don't you cry
Hush darling, don't you cry
Cause they're never gonna reach you
Never gonna reach you

In the morning I come down
In the morning I break down
But you're never gonna get away
Gonna get away

I know I'm running baby
But I need you now
Said I know we're going crazy
But I need you now
I need you now
To fight somehow
There's a beauty in the waking night
There's a memory waking up
But it's never gonna reach you
Never gonna reach you

Hand touches your body now
Lips touch as you're falling down
Run for the last train
One of them will get you home

I know we're going crazy
But I need you now
I know we're running baby
But I need you now
Need you now
To fight somehow
But I need you now
But I need you now
