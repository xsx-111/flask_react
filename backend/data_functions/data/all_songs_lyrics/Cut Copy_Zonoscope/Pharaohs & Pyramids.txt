Pharaohs & Pyramids LyricsAll thoughts
All thoughts
All thoughts
The way clouds drift on a warm summer afternoon
House is burning, she's so cold
Hands of silver, hands of gold
Rising from a pyramid
She'll take you where the pharaohs live
Neatly packaged, sleek design
Glossy pamphlet, neon sign
Borrowed like a cigarette
So that way you'll be good, I guess

Please, baby, please, baby
Don't take my heart away
Just save it for another day
When you need my love some more
Beauty of a love his ghost
Familiar as a talk show host
Quick and deadly in the night
She's something we can't live without

Loudspeakers sound, white disco light
It's one for us who fall apart
Loudspeakers sound, white disco light
It's one for us who fall apart
Loudspeakers sound, white disco light
Nobody here breaking hearts
It's one for us who fall apart
Nobody here breaking heartsEmbed
