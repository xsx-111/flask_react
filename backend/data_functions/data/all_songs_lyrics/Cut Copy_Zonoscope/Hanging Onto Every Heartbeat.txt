Hanging Onto Every Heartbeat Lyrics
Years that talk
And years that fall
Down
Years that give
And years that take
Away
A substitute
The business suit I'll trade you
A little space
To clear a place in my head

Hanging on to every heartbeat
Satellites in the sky
Watching up where the stars gleam
And we'll be fine

The government
Heaven sent in our heads
This owing scent
In our hands embrace
Like private eyes
On our own lives we're watching
But if you're watching
Who's that living there?
Hanging on to every heartbeat
Satellites in the sky
Watching up where the stars gleam
And we'll be fine
Hanging on to every heartbeat
Satellites in the sky
Watching up where the stars gleam
And we'll be fine

Heartbeats in the sky
Feel my pulse
Electric eye
In our image by the frame
Here we are
Oh here we are
We're gonna drift away
So you might never see the light of day
We're gonna drift away
So you might never see the light of day
We're gonna drift away
So you might never see the light of day
We're gonna drift away
So you might never see the light of day
Hanging on to every heartbeat
Satellites in the sky
Watching up where the stars gleam
And we'll be fine
And we'll be fine
And we'll be fine
And we'll be fine
Hanging on to every heartbeat
Satellites in the sky
Watching up where the stars gleam
And we'll be fine
Hanging on to every heartbeat
Satellites in the sky
Watching up where the stars gleam
And we'll be fineEmbed
