Alisa LyricsTen thousand years I've traveled
And many hearts unraveled
I've seen worlds through many eyes
I'm dancing in and often
Will carry lonely hearts to you
Don't think that I'm your shrink now
I don't know what to say or do
Love to see your heart again
Beats like this
Treat it like your only friends
A piece like this
Though our love was never meant
It beats like this
A name I knew from a song
Is it wrong to cry for you?
Alisa
Alisa
It's funny how it isn't
And life can sometimes be confused
You heard I love you, baby
Words in a song, they're not for you
Love to see your heart again
Beats like this
Treat it like your only friends
A piece like this
Though our love was never meant
It beats like this
A name I knew from a song
Is it wrong to cry for you?
