Take Me Over Lyrics
Do you hear that voice inside your head
Whispering to live your dreams instead?
Some people cling to what they know
But I woke up, now it's time to go
Ooh, I can hear it calling
Ooh, did you see me fall in and out of love?
Ooh, I can hear it calling
Ooh, did you see me fall in?

Take me over
Now take me out
Give me something
To dream about

Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night in paradise, paradise
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night forever

Hold the things seen only on the screen
Of printer columns, that's no way to live
City's memories from this stereo
But don't sleep cause now it's time to go
Ooh, I can hear it calling
Ooh, did you see me fall in?

You may not notice now what people talk about you
Some people think that we're running away
I'll push the board up with, it's all I ever done
So give me a reason to stay
