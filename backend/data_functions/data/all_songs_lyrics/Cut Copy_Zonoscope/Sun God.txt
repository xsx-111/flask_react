Won’t you give your love to me?
Please please please
Won’t you give your love to me?
Are you gonna give me your love
Love won't be enough
Are you gonna give me your love
Love won't be enough

You got to die
So what’s the purpose of you and I
You want some passion

And it ain’t no question
In this I believe
You got to live
You got to die
So what’s the purpose of you and I
You want some passion
You can receive
And it ain’t no question
In this I believeEmbed
