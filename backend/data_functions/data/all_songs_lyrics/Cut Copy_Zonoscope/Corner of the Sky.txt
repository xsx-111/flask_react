Corner of the Sky LyricsWisdom from a stranger
Legacy of danger
This is where the answer lies
Underneath the rainbow
Chasing where the gold go
Acid smiles, distant eyes
Oh, eyes to the middle
Don't try to change your mind
What you love is right in the middle
Don't try to change it

If you see a comet
In the corner of the sky tonight
Maybe you can catch it
And keep it secret 'til the end of time
Meeting in the boardroom
Drop you in the cauldron
You're the means, you're not the end
Facts and figures suit you
Jackets made of voodoo
Sign the line, it's in the sand
Oh, eyes to the middle
Don't try to change your mind
What you love is right in the middle
Don't try to change it

Oh, it makes me wonder if you'll ever see
If you'll ever seeEmbed
