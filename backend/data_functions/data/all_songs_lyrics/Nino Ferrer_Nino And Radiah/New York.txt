New York LyricsGot to go to New York
See what's going on today
What do they think about living
What kind of music they play
Got to go to New York
See those alligators
Living together in the sewer
Got to find out if it's true
I wanna walk down Broadway
I wanna see Harlem
I wanna go on my way
Between all those men
That I don't know
What do they look like
And what do I
Got to go to New York
I'm a little bit home-stoned
What is the color of the river
How is the garbage in the street
Got to go to New York
Hope I'll find some friends because
It's a very big city
I supposeEmbed
