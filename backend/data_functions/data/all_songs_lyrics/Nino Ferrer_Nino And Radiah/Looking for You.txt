Looking for You LyricsI'm looking for you
I'm looking for you
Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I walk along the streets
Between a million people that I don't see
Maybe they think I am mad
I feel in love, I am in love with you
Nannana nana nana
I made this song 'cause I love you
I made this song just for you
I made this song deep in my heart
I was thinking of you
Because time runs so fast
And it never comes back
And that's all I can keep with me
That sweet love that you gave to me
I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you
Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I walk along the streets
Between a million people that I don't see
Maybe they think I am mad
I feel in love, I am in love with you
Nannana nana nana
I made this song 'cause I love you
I made this song just for you
I made this song deep in my heart
I was thinking of you
Because time runs so fast
And it never comes back
And that's all I can keep with me
That sweet love that you gave to meEmbed
