Mint Julep LyricsSipping Mint Julep
Rocking in my rocking chair
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sun to go down
Sipping Mint Julep
Archibald you get out at there
Waiting for my baby
Waiting for that baby of mine
Sipping Mint Julep
Kinou she's looking fine
Telephone is ringing
Got to go and look it around
George and Paul and John and Luke
And Bob and Ted and Moses
Want to come for dinner but the dogs
Are in the roses
Marylou is coming but that woman
Is kinda nosy
Gonna sing and do our thing
And dance the tipsy toesy
Sipping Mint Julep
Sipping Mint Julep
Sipping Mint Julep
