Moses LyricsMoses
You better slow down your pace
You know sometimes, haste makes waste
Moses
You better stop blowing the breeze
You better give the jive the freeze
Moses
You better keep the wheel a turning
Cause the man is churning too
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Moses
You better stop hogging the joint
Because you know it ain't no point
Moses
You better stop your hoochie-cooing
And put them ribs on the barbecue
Moses
You better stop popping your gum
Sucking your thumb and your looking dumb
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Moses
You better stop chasing the boys
And get some unbreakable toys
Moses
You better stop sleeping so late
And try to get up half past eight
Moses
You better stop steering a fuss
Because what would you do without us?
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Don't do what I do
Do what I say
Don't do what I do
Do what I sayEmbed
