Monuments Lyrics
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go it's shining bright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

Love can dust you easy as you know
And dust must make you feel slow
Cause when you shake what's pleasing then you'll go
I know, I know you'll go
Lover, you're strange
Lover, you're strange
Lover, you're strange to me

I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go it's shining bright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

Vespers in the evening of your soul
And whispers carry as they're sewn
And dulled by every feeling that I've known
Take hold, babe, take hold
Lover, you're strange
Lover, you're strange
Lover, you're strange to me
And what do you want me to do?
It's all gone mad
What do you want me to say?
I'm lost like you

I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go it's shining bright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright1Embed
