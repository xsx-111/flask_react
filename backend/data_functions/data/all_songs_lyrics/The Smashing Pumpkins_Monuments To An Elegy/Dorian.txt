Dorian LyricsDorian, Dorian
What have you done?
Dorian
As you run, a setting sun
Dorian
A setting sun, it finds you
Is it always as you thought?
Is it always as you want?
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian
What have you done?
Dorian
Oh my child, when our number's up and done
It's what they'd sought
Dorian
As you run, a setting sun
Dorian
A fleeting dream that binds you
Is it always as you thought?
Is it always as you want?
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian, what have you done?
Dorian
My setting sun
Dorian, Dorian
Dorian, Dorian
Whoever binds you
Whoever finds youEmbed
