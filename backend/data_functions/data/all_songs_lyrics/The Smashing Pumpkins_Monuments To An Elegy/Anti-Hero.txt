Anti-Hero Lyrics
Never been kissed by a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
Love me baby, love me true, ooh
Everything I want, I had to have
And with madness, it's love that's sad
Trust little baby, oh can't you see?
Ooh, it's me

Ode to the alien weekend
What they bring starts to turn slow
You said should have borne weakness
And built that happy home

With a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
Love me baby, oh can't you please?
Ooh, with a girl like you
Vroom, with a girl like you, ooh
With a girl like you

Times that preach how it's been
As I stroll in turn without
You're so alone they'll let you in
Ooh, if they let you in
Odes to the alien weekend
Sold where it starts to burn slow
You said should have borne weakness
And built my happy home

With a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
Love me baby, oh can't you please?
Ooh, with a girl like you
Vroom, with a girl like you, ooh
With a girl like you

You can say I will listen
You can swear 'no more'
You can blur all tradition 'till I'm bored
With a girl like you
With a girl like you, ooh
With a girl like you, ooh, ooh

I'm so alive with a girl like you
I'm so alive with a girl like you
Trust little baby, can't you please?
Vroom, a girl like youEmbed
