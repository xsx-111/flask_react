Drum + Fife Lyrics
Away, away foul dreams
You're gonna listen now to me
No rules, or in-betweens
You're gonna listen now to me
Waste all your time
Find another kind of boy
A feint up on the line
A phantom I don't care to hold

Come on along on an eastern shore
Come on along you're mine
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along you're mine
You're mine

In sight, the drum and fife with steam
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast with need
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

In mind. A fetching June
You're gonna listen now to me
What's done, what's left as ruin
You're gonna listen now to me
Come on along on an eastern shore
Come on along you're mine
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along you're mine
You're mine

In sight, the drum and fife with steam
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in need
To remedy what's been bleeding
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying day
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

Don't you ever be afraid
Don't you ever be afraid
Don't you ever be afraid
No more, no more, no more

Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
(Don't you ever be afraid)
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying day
Cause I will bang this drum5Embed
