One and All (We Are) Lyrics
I don't mind what you're running
Cause you and me we're just something
Don't just hang what you're running on
I don't mind we're so alone

One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young
One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young
One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

Lest it be that we're livin'
Don't ya hide what you're given
Don't ya pulse for the ones that stall
Don't ya mind if it's me at all
Don't ya mind if it's me at all
If it's me at all?

I'd just say when you're bluffing
Cause you and me we're off running
Baby sweet of the ruts and cuts
I don't save for rainy days
One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young
One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young
One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

Catch as can what you're doing
Me and you we're just ruins
Sespertines for the morning's trawl
Don't ya mind, if it's me at all
Don't ya mind, if it's me at all
If it's me at all, if it's me at all

I don't mind a thing or two
One and all
We are, we are so young
One and all
We are, we are so young
One and all
We are, we are so young
One and all5Embed
