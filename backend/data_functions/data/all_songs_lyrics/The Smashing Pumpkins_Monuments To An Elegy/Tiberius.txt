Tiberius Lyrics
Fuss my love, don't fight
Never leave here this night
Words, pray? Dull fame
For what is love if love obeys?
Let flee doves in flight
May we stray from our right
And ever leave here softly

I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
Your pyres of wonder can't say what it means
And still I love you, and like everything
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes

If you break, believe me
If you take, deceive me
To the sound of one clapping hand
Is your heart so lonely
That your honor is only
As good as can be bound on command
Hush my love, don't fight
Never leave here this night
I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
Your pyres of wonder can't say what it means
And still I love you, and like everything
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes

I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes6Embed
