Run2Me Lyrics
Run to me
Run to me
Run to me
Run to me
Where the sun never leaves
Run to me, my special one
Run to me

Find first obsessions before yourself
A candlesong for where you are
You can't escape this, like someone else
Your love remains

Run to me
Run to me
Run to me, my special one
Run to me
Run to me, my lover strange
Run to me, who can't be changed
Run to me
Run to me

Where the frost spoils the leaf
Run to me
Run to me
As the desert rose desert dreams
Run to me, my tender sage
Run to me
Disavow affection maybe hold against your hold?
Move to that light in every window
Without exception and no one's left
You can't be kept from your turn
From your turn
From your turn

Run to me, my lover strange
Run to me
Run to me, my silent page
Run to me, you that can't be named
Run to me, yeah
Run to me
Run to me
Run to me
Run to me
No other door sets us free
Run to me
Run to me
Run to me
My lover strange
Run to me, my lover strange
Run to me, my lover strange
Run to meEmbed
