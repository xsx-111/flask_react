Anaise! Lyrics
Anaise! Anaise!
In a captive's coat
In a word, a word, I can't let go
I need her so, you haunt me
Anaise
In the finds, a sign, of lonely ones
And you're her to gnash, what's done is done
It's simply known, despite her
Hold out on me

Ooh, what must count as use for lovers?
Ooh, send this on the wings
Lovers let me hear from you
As you all go under
Anaise
Love you, Anaise

Anaise! Anaise!
What's thread as blown
By your times, blackhearts, and lace built own
An armies woe, oh now don't you
Anaise
Ooh, what should count as doom for lovers?
Ooh, send this by the way
Lovers let me hear from you
As you all go asunder
Ooh, send this by the way

If I could raise her?
Suppose I'd dare?
My arms to brace against her will
Imagine reeling
From twilight to scare
All to stand within the grace

Ooh, what becomes of use as lovers?
Ooh, send this by the wing
Lovers let us hear from you
As you all go under
Anaise
Love you, Anaise
Love you, Anaise
Love you, Anaise
Love you, Anaise
Love you, AnaiseEmbed
