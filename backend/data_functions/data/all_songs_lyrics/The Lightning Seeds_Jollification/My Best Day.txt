My Best Day LyricsHe said I'm not dead but don't wake me ever
'Cos I may have to think this through
She said she's changed her mind
And I didn't try to put it right
Though I've every reason to
I don't know, she wouldn't say
Exactly when she intends to mince her light fantastic my way
And make my very best day
Let me tell you the way it will always be
He'll see it all but he won't see me
And didn't I show him every sign
That his best days are leaving me behind
Later if it's her you can say I've gone away
I get nowhere peachy keen
You tell her next week
And maybe find out where they're going
So I know where I should be
She's got a nerve and that's okay
But I want to hear when she's finally got something decent to say
Could be my very best day
Let me tell you the way it will always be
He'll see it all but he won't see me
And didn't I give him every sign
That his best days are leaving me behind
What exactly do you want me to say?
No I don't feel good for you
And you can get that girl out of my face
I don't enjoy her like you do
And this is the way it will always be
He's seen it all but he won't see me
And how do I show him diamond skies
When all he has are best days in his eyesEmbed
