Telling Tales LyricsWith frozen hands and feet on smoky days
I wish I'd kept more of those things you gave me
Snow melts on your palm
A bigger coat to keep us warm
Nothing's like it was before
But this is worth it after all
Day in, day out, good night all
This is us now
Day in, day out, good night all
This is us nowEmbed
