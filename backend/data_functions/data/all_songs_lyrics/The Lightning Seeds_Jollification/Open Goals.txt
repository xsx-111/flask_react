Open Goals LyricsWoke up and smiled this morning
Wishes swam like fishes in my head
I rub my eyes as all the reasons chase the demons from my bed
I'm on top of the world
And it's just for a moment
I know all the right words
And I wish that I'd told you them
I know now
I know how
Come and splash in the waves
And they'll kiss you with cold
'Till you shiver and say
That you wish I would hold you
Well I know now
I know how
Woke up and smiled this morning
Wishes swam like fishes in my head
I rub my eyes as all the reasons chase the demons from my bed
Open goals that call me over
Got to take them
Don't fall over againEmbed
