Perfect Lyrics
See the rivers filled with rain
I wish it could be blue again
Hazy petrol nights
Crimson sun on traffic lights
A perfect day a perfect night
Tell me all those perfect lies
And lie back in the garden till it's light
Streets get full up every night
With people buzzing round the lights
And waving at the taxis driving by

Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's todays just fade away
Watch the morning chase the night
Rolling home it's getting light
Feeling sleepy full of wine
Fall in bed just in time

The perfect stare of perfect eyes
That kiss you as they tell you lies
And wonder where you're going where've you been
In towers high with time to fill
Gardens on your window sill
In between the pavement and the sky
Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's todays just fade away
Tell me why
All the words will never come out right
Fumbling blind
I've been driving through the danger signs

A perfect day a perfect night
Tell me all those perfect lies
And lie back in the garden till it's light
Perfect silence me and you
It's really me I really do
Remember every moment magnified

Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's todays just fade away
Tell me why
All the words will never come out right
Fumbling blind
I've been driving through the danger signsEmbed
