Lucky You Lyrics
You're lying again
Say you don't, but then you do
I'm trying again
To build a wall around your heart
Then break it through to you
You make it happen

Everything's blue now
Oh, lucky you (oh, lucky you)
There's nothing to lose
And if it's really true
Oh, lucky you

You're chasing the moon
Reaching out to touch the stars
But you land too soon
What will it take to make you see
The way things really are?
You've got this far
So let it happen

Everything's blue now
Oh, lucky you (oh, lucky you)
There's nothing to lose
So if it's really true
Oh, lucky you

You're lying again
Give it up and tell the truth
You can't stop the rain
It's gonna fall on every roof
I've got the proof
And only you can make it happen

Everything's blue now
Oh, lucky you (oh, lucky you)
There's nothing to lose
So if it's really true
Oh, lucky you

Oh, lucky you
Oh, lucky you
Oh, lucky you
Oh, lucky you1Embed
