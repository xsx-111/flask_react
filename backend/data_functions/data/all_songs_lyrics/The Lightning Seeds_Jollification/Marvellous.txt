Marvellous Lyrics

Oh, you had to fit
But you're fit to drop
Open up the window and jump into the blue
Things could be marvellous
Things could be fabulous
You need a push
I'll push you off
Open up the window and jump into the blue
Things could be marvellous
Soon

Oh, well these are the days
And this is the life
There'll always be something on your mind
You'll never quite find
Won't you ever make your mind up?

Oh, well you had to hit
'Til you hit the top
Open up the window and jump into the blue
Things could be marvellous
Things could be fabulous
Soon
Oh, well these are the days
And this is the life
There'll always be something on your mind
You'll never quite find
Won't you ever make your mind up?

Now, you'll never be sure
If this is the time
If this is the moment
The end of the line
You'll never decide
You used to know but now you've forgotten

You sit there and wait for the phone to ring
When are they going to call?
Are they ever going to call you at all?
But then oh!

Things could be marvellous
Things could be fabulous
Soon
Oh, and these are the days
And this is the life
There'll always be something on your mind
You'll never quite find
Won't you ever make your mind up?

Now you'll never be sure
If this is the time
If this is the moment
The end of the line
You'll never decide
You used to know but now you've forgotten

A submarine got stuck to the bottom
These are the days so wake up
'Cos this is the time
And you know I'm rightEmbed
