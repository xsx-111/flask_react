Feeling Lazy LyricsMr Johnson's car
Gets the weekend shine
And it's so fine
Music plays on radios
And Lisa in the garden singing
To the washing line
Well never mind
People do the strangest things
Our English sky
(English sky)
May well cry
(may well cry)
Housewives talk
(housewives talk)
I'm so bored
Oh did you love that lazy feeling
(do you love that lazy feeling)
So do you feel like sleeping
(let the world go by)
Mr Bentley yawns
He hates the daily grind
So it's goodnight
A thousand sleepy heads on pillows
Monday start all over
Tuesday safe behind your blinds
Come on over
We can spend an hour or two
Our English sky
(English sky)
May well cry
(may well cry)
Housewives talk
(housewives talk)
I'm so bored
Oh do you love that lazy feeling
(do you love that lazy feeling)
So do you feel like sleeping
(let the world go by)
We spent a perfect day
And talked the hours away
Just drifting through the streets
And melting in the heat
Oh do you love that lazy feeling
(do you love that lazy feeling)
So do you feel like sleeping
(let the world go by)
Do you feel like sleeping
Do you feel like sleeping
Do you feel like sleeping
Do you feel like sleeping
Do you feel like sleepingEmbed
