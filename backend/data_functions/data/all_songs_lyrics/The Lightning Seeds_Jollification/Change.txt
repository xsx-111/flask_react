Change Lyrics
The world is full of fools
Who never get it right
You don't know what to do
So you do anything you like

(Put your foot down and drive)
Oh, you're a silly thing
(Put your foot down and drive)
You're such a pretty thing
(Put your foot down and drive)

You're never going to be like all those fools
You're going out tonight
There's nothing to lose
You're going to give it all a try

Don't ever change (change)
Don't ever change (never change)
No, never change (never change)
Never change (don't ever change)

You better say your prayers
A whisper to the wise
And thank your lucky stars
For coming out tonight
(Put your foot down and drive)
Oh, you're a silly thing
(Put your foot down and drive)

Don't you ever change (change)
Don't ever change (never change)
No, never change (never change)
Never change (don't ever change)

When tearful eyes
Are open wide
They're still too blind to see
A change in style
For a little while
Is only make believe

(Put your foot down and drive)
Oh, you're a silly thing
(Put your foot down and drive)
You're such a pretty thing
(Put your foot down and drive)
You're never satisfied
So look for something new
There's nothing to find
And nothing you can do

Don't ever change (change)
Don't ever change (never change)
No, never change (never change)
Never change (don't ever change)

Oh you fool, you've got me started
Oh you fool, you've got me started
Oh you fool, you've got me started
(Don't you ever change)
Oh you fool, you've got me started
(Don't you ever change)1Embed
