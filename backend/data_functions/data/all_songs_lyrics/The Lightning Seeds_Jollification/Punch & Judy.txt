Punch & Judy LyricsBaby's eyes are black
She's taken all the clothes
She's never coming back
The yes turned into no
Oh, you know you made a fool of everyone
Turn around and take a bow
But everyone's gone
Look at you hiding in the corner
Wishing we were somewhere new
Nothing is forever, we're not so clever now
You say I'll never learn
I've been around the world
You thought I never heard
Oh, you know I let you down like everyone
I messed around and took a bow
But everyone's gone
Look at you standing in the corner
Wishing I was somewhere new
I promise it's the last time I lie to you
Oh, you know you made a fool of everyone
Turn around and take a bow
But everyone's gone
Look at you hiding in the corner
Wishing there were something new
I didn't have the patience
