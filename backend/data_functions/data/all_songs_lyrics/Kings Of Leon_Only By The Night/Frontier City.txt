Frontier City Lyrics
Find yourself a new frontier
Because life is going, going, gone
Fly yourself away from here, into the clear
Before it's going, going, gone

Say it loud and in the light
For it's going, going, gone
Shake the hands
The hands that pick, pick the fight
Because life is going, going, gone

Yes I'll find you
And cut you down
Friends and neighbors, sleepy town
If you wake up, before the blow
Pick your face up
We come, we go
We come, we go
We live until we live no more

Travel with the dead black eye
Before it's come and, come and gone
Cradles and the rocking chairs
Make a life
Before it's come and, come and gone
