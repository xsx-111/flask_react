Notion Lyrics
I got a notion that says it doesn't feel right
Got an answer in your story today
It gave me a sign that didn't feel right, no

So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before

I just wanted to know if I could go home
Been rambling day after day
And everyone says I don't know

So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
Got to notion to say what doesn't feel right
I just wanted to know if I could go home

So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
So don't knock it, don't knock it

So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before2Embed
