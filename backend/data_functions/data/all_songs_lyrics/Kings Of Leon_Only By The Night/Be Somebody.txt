Be Somebody Lyrics

Taking to the floor with the reach to the sky
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie

Trying to recall what you want me to say
I shake your way, I shake your way
Counting on the night for a beautiful day
I shake your way, I shake your way
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

Given a chance
I'm going to be somebody
If for one dance
I'm going to be somebody
Open the door
It's going to make you love me
Facing the floor
I'm going to be somebody
Now is your time and you know where you stand
With a gun in your hand, with a gun in your hand
Now I'm no longer an ordinary man
Was this your big plan, your gun in your hand
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

Given a chance
I'm going to be somebody
If for one dance
I'm going to be somebody
Open the door
It's going to make you love me
Facing the floor
I'm going to be somebody

Be somebody
