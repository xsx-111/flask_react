Closer Lyrics
Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun
Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies are blinking at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You who shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer32Embed
