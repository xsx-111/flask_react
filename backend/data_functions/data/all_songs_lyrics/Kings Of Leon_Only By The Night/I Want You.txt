I Want You Lyrics
Get back on track
Pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman
Probably thinks she's cooler than you

A hay ride at 5
Everybody's coming around
So go press your skirt
Word is there's a new girl in town

I call shotgun
You can play your R&B tunes
The fellowship time
It always comes a little too soon

The land of the creeps
Freshened up from baby faced shave
Put your eyes on me
And I know a place that we can get away, ay

Just say I want you
Just exactly like I used to
'Cause baby this is oooo-only bringing me down
Home-boy's so proud
He finally got the video proof
The night vision shows
She was only ducking the truth

It's heavy, I know
The black cat with the gift down below
A choke and a gag
She spit up an' came back for more, oh ahh ahh

She said I want you
Just exactly like I used to
And baby this is oooo-only bringing me down

She said I want you

I want you
Just exactly like I used to
And baby this is ooo-only bringing me down

I said I want you
Just exactly like I used to
And baby this is ooo-only bringing me down10Embed
