17 Lyrics
Oh she's only 17
Whine and wine and wound up over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers frightened and when's a baby going to sleep
Hidden ship that sails away

Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's the tick of our time and the tick in her hair
That made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay

Oh she's only 17
Wind and wind and wound up over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers frightened when's a baby going to sleep

Hidden ship that sails away
Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's the tick of our time and the tick in her hair
That made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay
I could call you baby I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay19Embed
