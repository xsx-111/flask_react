Manhattan Lyrics
I like to dance all night
It summons the day
But that's how I play
Yeah that's how I play
I said who are you
No matter who you are
So we dance all night
And dance all day

I Say
I Say

We're going to fuel the fire
We're going to stoke it up
We're going to sip this wine
And pass the cup
Who needs avenues
Who needs reservoirs
We going to show this town
How to kiss these stars

I Say
I Say
I'm on a hunt to kill
I'm going to skin the hide
A yelp and scream
And away I ride
I'll never top this view
I'll never follow ground
It's all for you
For what you found

I Say
I Say
I Say
I Say

It's going to take your hand
And going to drive you home
Just going to keep on, keep on, keep on
And then forever roam4Embed
