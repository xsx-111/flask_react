Two Hearts Lyrics
Here we go again
God, I listen but I'm not listening
Everything she says
Oh, I've heard it all before
So what if I have
It doesn't mean it isn't beautiful
And everyone needs company
Once in a while

Two hearts, one of them will break
Like bad ideas on a beautiful day
Two figures moving through the dark
Three words is all it takes to break your heart in two

Every time she goes
I just pretend like it's not happening
And every time she comes
When she comes, oh God
So what if she's right
So what if she's so beautiful
More beautiful than you
Good for a laugh and too kind
Two hearts, one of them will break
Like bad ideas on a beautiful day
No hands, this thing will steer itself through the dark
Three words, is all it takes to break your heart in two
All it takes to break your heart
Is just three words, three words and two hearts
Three words and two heartsEmbed
