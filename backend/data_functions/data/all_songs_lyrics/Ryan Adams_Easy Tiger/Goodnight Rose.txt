Goodnight Rose Lyrics
Goodnight Rose
We're goin' to win
Put your troubles behind you
And go on to bed
Let go of the worry
There's so much nobody understands
Don't live your life in such a hurry
Life goes by us all so fast

And the sun will come up again
And I will be here
If you get scared just hold my hand
Tomorrow is yours and who knows
Maybe we'll win the whole shebang

Goodnight Rose
Goodnight
Goodnight Rose

Good morning sunshine
A new day begins
And the hustle and bustle of the traffic greets you kindly
I can tell because you're smiling
C'mon give 'em everything
That the winning demands
Just one more ribbon, Rose
Before the mantle place caves in
And the sun will come up again
And I will be here Rose
If you get scared just hold my hand
Get out of that dress
Go on to bed, the bar is closed

Goodnight Rose
Goodnight
Goodnight Rose
Goodnight Rose
Goodnight
Goodnight, Goodnight Rose


Goodnight Rose
Goodnight
Goodnight Rose
Goodnight Rose
Goodnight
Goodnight RoseEmbed
