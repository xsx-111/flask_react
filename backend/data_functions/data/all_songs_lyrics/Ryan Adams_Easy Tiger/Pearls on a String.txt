Pearls on a String Lyrics
One, two, three

Blue eyes for miles
Pretty as a peach
Glorious kind and always on time
And never far out of reach
Tomorrow's on its way
There's always new songs to sing

Glorious kind and always on time
Pearls on a string

Soft, precious and easy
Under the sea
If you dive down far enough to the bottom
Look around and you will see
Tomorrow's on its way
And there's always new songs to sing

Glorious kind and always on time
Pearls on a string
Glorious kind and always on time
Pearls on a string

The sun shinin' down
The children laugh and play
Glorious kind and always on time
And out there in the day
Tomorrow's on its way
And there's always new songs to sing

Glorious kind and always on time
Pearls on a string
Glorious kind and always on time
Pearls on a string
Glorious kind and always on time
Pearls on a string
Glorious kind and always on time
Pearls on a stringEmbed
