Oh My God, Whatever, Etc. Lyrics
Something's beating on the wall on the other side
Strange lovers moan each other's names on by sheets
For the very first time, one of them's James
The other's some name she changes every time she lies across his bed

But the light of the moon leads the way towards the morning
And the sun, the sun's well on its way too soon to know
And oh, oh my God, whatever, etcetera

If I could I'd fold myself away like a card table
A concertina or a Murphy bed, I would
But I wasn't made that way so you know instead
I'm open all night and the customers come to stay
And everybody tips but not enough to knock me over
And I'm so tired, I just worked two shifts

But the light of the moon leads the way towards the morning
And the sun, the sun's well on its way too soon, to know and
Oh, oh my God
Oh my God, whatever, etceteraEmbed
