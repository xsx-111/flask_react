Off Broadway Lyrics
Hanging 'round Broadway and I think I saw your face
Cars speeding by me reminding me of us
Rats scurry from the gutter to their holes
All these people they're trying to get home

And I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
Used to be off Broadway

I miss your locket and the things you kept inside
And I just can't stop it, it hasn't killed me yet but give it time
Shuffle down to the watering hole
Getting tired and I want to go home

I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
Used to be off Broadway
Used to be off Broadway
Used to be off Broadway
Used to be off Broadway
But I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where I live anymore
I don't know where I live anymore
Used to live off BroadwayEmbed
