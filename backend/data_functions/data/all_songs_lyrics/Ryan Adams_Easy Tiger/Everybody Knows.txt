Everybody Knows Lyrics
You come for me in the worst of places
You come for me, you come and try to take me home
I'm always in need and it's hard to be reciprocating
The fabric of our life gets torn

And everything's changing so how am I to know
How I'm going to hold on to you when I'm spinning out of control
You and I together but only one of us in love
And everybody knows

He says her name, it echoes in my head like it was a canyon
He says her name, he says it and I know what's up
You come to me sometimes when I'm thinking like a cannonball shooting out a cannon
And I forget whatever it was I was thinking about

With everything changing how am I to know
How I'm going to hold on to you when I'm spinning out of control
You and I together but only one of us in love
And everybody knows
Everybody knowsEmbed
