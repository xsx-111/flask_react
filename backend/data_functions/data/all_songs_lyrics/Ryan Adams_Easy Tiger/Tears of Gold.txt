Tears of Gold Lyrics
One day we are young
And by the next one we are old
Despite the years
And tears of gold precede the rapture
Time has its way
With everyone in its path
She combs her hair
And tears of gold fall on the gray

Tears of gold
Tears of golden restraint
As evidence of the pain that we feel inside

Mary Anne, settle down
Let's bring the band around "How 'bout"
And we'll sing you to heaven and back
Laura Lee sets the food out on the table top for us
And when she asks Mary Anne to say Grace
Mary Anne settles down
Wiping tears of gold from her face

Where we are strong
By tomorrow we will grow weak and disappear
Our families will gather 'round to remember
Where we are flesh and blood by the next one we are dust under the wheels
Without a love we're only ash in urns of silver
Tears of gold
Tears of golden restraint
As evidence of the pain that she feels
Tears of gold
Tears of gold promise the rapture and heal the soul
Replacing tears of gold with music and laughter
Tears of gold
Tears of goldEmbed
