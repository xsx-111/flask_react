Rip Off Lyrics
I can name the people I know that don't know themselves
Without talking to nobody
I can count the people I know that want to fix themselves
Without taking my hands out of my pockets

I make these promises but all my promises hurt
It's like they never get a lift off
So if I'm being honest with you and it seems like I'm being cruel
At least you didn't get a rip off, a rip off
And you'll know how I feel

I've got faith in you
And it's a little too late for "goodbyes"
Good morning, open your eyes

I can see the tears so long before they know your face
I can almost draw the lines
But when you smile it spins me like a Ferris wheel
Washed out to sea in your eyes

I make these promises but all my promises hurt
It's like they never get a lift off
So if I'm being honest with you and it seems like I'm being cruel
At least you didn't get a rip off, a rip off, a rip off
And you'll know how I feelEmbed
