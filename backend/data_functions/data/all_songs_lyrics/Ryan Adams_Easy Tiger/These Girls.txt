These Girls Lyrics
Well, girl sometimes I feel just like a boy
Put here on this earth for you to toy around with
Like Matchbox cars you buy and burn in your backyard
Like monsters underneath your bed you ain't afraid of yet

But you let me in
And I feel alright
Yeah, I feel alright

Late night girls are anxious and they're coming out to play
And I've been stranded on their doorstep for every night and day
I only want them more, so sad
But when they smile, God I've been had
I get hypnotized and I wanna go to bed

I used to pick up shells cast off the reef
One Christmas I got a funeral and they handed me the receipt
How many lies I tell without my tongue
Get twisted into memories till I believe in some

And I toy with you
And you toy with me
Can you stop it please?
God bless all the late night girls and they're coming out to play
And I've been stranded in their doorstep for every night and day
I only want them more, how sad
But when they smile, how can anybody feel bad?
It makes me tired and I wanna go to bed
These girls are better off in my head
These girls are better off in my head
These girls are better off in my head
These girlsEmbed
