Acid Tongue Lyrics
Someone's always paying for that banter, baby

I went to a cobbler to fix a hole in my shoe
He took one look at my face and said, "I can fix that hole in you"
"I beg your pardon, I'm not looking for a cure
I've seen enough from my friends in the depths of the God-sick blues"

You know I am a liar (Liar)
You know I am a liar (Liar)
Nobody helps a liar (Liar)

'Cause I've been down to Dixie and dropped acid on my tongue
Tripped upon the land 'til enough was enough
I was a little bit lighter and adventure on my sleeve
I was a little drunk and looking for company
So I found myself a sweetheart with the softest of hands
We were unlucky in love, but I'd do it all again

We built ourselves a fire (Fire)
We built ourselves a fire (Fire)
You know I am a liar (Liar)
You know I am a liar (Liar)
And you don't know what I've done
And by the rolling river is exactly where I was
There was no snake-oil cure for "unlucky in love"
To be lonely is a habit, like smoking or taking drugs
And I've quit them both, but, man, was it rough

And now I am tired (Tired)
It just made me tired (Tired)
Let's build ourselves a fire (Fire)
Let's build ourselves a fire (Fire)1Embed
