Jack Killed Mom Lyrics
When Jack was born, he winked at Mom
Her pretty face was the first he saw
Was Jack wrong 'cause he loved Mom?
Things weren't bad, 'fore they got worse
Mom would pinch Jack until it hurt
Mama thought her boy was cursed

You leave (Leave!)
You leave (Leave!)
Leave that boy to me
Oh, Jack, I love him
But you leave that boy to me
You leave (Leave!)
Leave (Leave!)
Leave that boy to me
I know his condition and soon he'll be sin free

Off at school, Jack was cruel
He'd become the bully's bull
Was Jack wrong to mimic Mom?
And after school from the corner stool
Mom was kissing on the Golden Rule
Jack had become the teacher's fool
You leave (Leave!)
You leave (Leave!)
Leave that man to me
Oh, Mom, I love you, and soon you will be free
With my will (Will!)
And my hands (Hands!)
Like old Solomon
And in your honor
I'm gonna cut that man in half

All the lessons Mama would teach
Books from Rome and ancient Greece
Men push rocks up stony mountains
Turning one fish into five thousand
A king went blind from his mother's love
A terrible rage came over Jack
His Mama lyin' on her back
The one who taught him right from wrong
But knew no better all along
She got ran through when Jack killed his Mom

Don't leave (Leave!)
Don't leave (Leave!)
Don't leave this world to me
Oh, Mom I love you, I didn't mean to set you free
With my will (Will!)
And my hands (Hands!)
Like old Solomon
Oh Mom, I love you, I didn't mean to set you free
Was Jack wrong? (Jack killed Mom!)
Was Jack wrong? (Jack killed Mom!)
Was Jack wrong? (Jack killed Mom!)
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Jack killed Mom
Oh
When Jack killed his MomEmbed
