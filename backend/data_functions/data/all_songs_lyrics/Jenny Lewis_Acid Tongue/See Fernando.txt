See Fernando Lyrics
I wear a ponytail like a waterfall
Loudspeaker cause a land slide
I have a room key and a Johnny
A good buzz, feeling all right
Pitch a tent, pop a top
Forget about what you ain't got
See the sites, sleep 'til night
Stamp your feet, turn out the lights

If you want to go where they chain up the sun
See Fernando, see Fernando
He'll buy a bottle of suds for you and everyone
See Fernando, see Fernando

If you're high strung or stressed out
Down in the dumps, been turned out
Stabilized, motorized, insecure, or fableized
Curious or furious, picked apart like Prometheus
Legalized, penalized
Stamp your feet, dry out your eyes

If you want to go where they chain up the sun
See Fernando, see Fernando
He'll buy a bottle of suds for you and everyone
See Fernando, see Fernando
You've been Jezebeled, back from hell
Cooling off, feeling well
Tired of talking, talked out
Ticked off or toughed up
Too talled or backed up
Haven't made your mind up
TBD'd or TB'd
Tired of falling to your knees

If you want to go where they chain up the sun
See Fernando, see Fernando
He'll buy a bottle of suds for you and everyone
See Fernando, see Fernando
And if you want to go where they chain up the sun
See Fernando, see Fernando
He'll buy a bottle of suds for you and everyone
See Fernando, see Fernando1Embed
