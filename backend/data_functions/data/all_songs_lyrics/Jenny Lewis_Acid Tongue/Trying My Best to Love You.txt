Trying My Best to Love You Lyrics
Our love is sweeter than strings
Our love is thicker than angel wings
But still sometimes, I can't believe you're real
It's just that I've got diamonds in my eyes, for you
For you

Our love is simple
Our love is crystal
But still sometimes, you cannot help yourself
You step outside and hear bells ringing
For you, for you

Trying my best to love you, oh
Trying my best to love you, oh
Trying my best to love you, oh
They make it so hard on us, baby
It's so hard on us, baby

I want you back, my baby
I want you back in my arms
I want you back right now
They make it so hard on us, baby
It's so hard on us, baby
Trying my best to love you, oh
Trying my best to love you, oh
Trying my best to love you, oh
They make it so hard on us, baby
It's so hard on us, baby
It's so hard on us, baby
It's so hard on us, babyEmbed
