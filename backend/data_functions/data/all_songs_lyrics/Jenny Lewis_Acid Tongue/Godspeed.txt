Godspeed Lyrics
No good, no how
No man should treat you like he do
So come on, right now
It's time for you to get up and out of his house
I've known you too long
To let you carry on this way
When I was in bad shape
I'll never forget what you always used to say

What are we gonna do with you?
You don't make it easy on me
What am I supposed to do with you
If you won't let me help you?
Won't you?

Godspeed, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, put out the light
And hope that I make it alive

There's no telling what he'll do
I wouldn't want him to hurt you, in that way
Things you don't say
Reach me somehow, anyway
What are we gonna do with you?
You don't make it easy on me
What am I supposed to do
If you won't let me help you?
Why won't you?

Godspeed, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, put out the light
And hope you make it alive
Godspeed, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to you, keep the lighthouse in sight
Godspeed to youEmbed
