Sing a Song for Them Lyrics
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing the song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing the song for them

For the bats in the belfry
And the fairies on Main Street
For the deadbeat daddies
And the Boulevard freaks
For the little girls with the carousel eyes
And the bric-Ã -brac finding housewives, losing their minds

Sing the song for them
If you sing a song, sing the song for them
If you sing a song, sing the song for them
If you sing a song, sing the song for them

To the never-made-its, and the unrecognized
To the alley rats and the tenement flies
To the weekend tweakers, the blonde and the blind
To the ex-thrill seekers in the methadone lines
Sing the song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them

To who you are, and will never be
To the shaking hand
Of the maker we're all gonna meet
Sing a song for them

Sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for them
If you sing a song, sing a song for themEmbed
