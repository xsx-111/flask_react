The Next Messiah Lyrics

Livin' in the meadow
The mighty, mighty meadow
With too many people
Suckin' all the water
And my daddy was a farmer
He was a race car driver
He is a four-leaf clover
He is the next messiah

Now he's livin' in the woods
The dark and dank woods
With a cocktail waitress
Who thinks she's an artist
Take her down to the river
Split her right up the middle
Now it's gonna be trouble
For a pregnant lamb and a con man

Got sick in the clink
Dye his hair in the sink
And the tumor gonna make a
Man outta him
Now my daddy was a chancer
He was a bad-check bouncer
But he beat that cancer
He's a survivor
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah


You're carving it up, it's squeezing it off
You're watching it bleed
You're washing it off, taking it back
She's down on her knees
When did she come to detest you?

Givin' it back, backin' you up
Nothing's for free
You're givin' it back, for lockin' you up
Those terrible deeds
When will they come to arrest you?
When did she come to detest you?

When will they come to arrest you?
When did she come to detest you?

I'm gonna give my love to you
One day, you gotta bring it back
I'm gonna give my love to you
One day, you gotta bring it back
I'm gonna give my love to you
(I want to tell you I love you)
One day, you gotta bring it back
(I want to tell you I love you)
I'm gonna give my love to you
(I want to tell you I love you)
One day, you gotta bring it back
(I want to tell you I love you)

I want to tell you I love you
I want to tell you I love you
I want to tell you I love you
(But I'm gonna go out for a walk)
I want to tell you I love you
(You better be here when I get back)
I want to tell you I love you
(I'm gonna go out walking, baby)
I want to tell you I love you
(You better be here when I get back)
Well, I'm gonna give my love to you
One day, you gotta bring it back
I'm gonna give my love to you
One day, you gotta bring it back
I want to tell you I love you
I want to tell you I love you


He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiahEmbed
