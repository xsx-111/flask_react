Carpetbaggers Lyrics
They come to town when the war is over
Dirty boots in the middle of the night
Trollin' the bars, hitting on the soldiers
Boys give it up without a fight
They say "Hey, boy, how about your place?
I know you really wanna take me home"
Drop the bags off on the bedroom floor
They make love with the lights on, sayin'

"I'm a carpetbagger, baby
I'm coming to your town
I'm gonna treat you kind
I'm gonna rob you blind
I'll smile all the time"
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah

Sally could've had any one of the boys
But she couldn't love no one she could not control
Friend of mine and her got married
I don't hear too much from him anymore
Last I heard, he had a rope 'round his neck
Draggin' around the grocery store
Carryin' her bags, pushin' down the aisles
Saying, "I ain't got no home in this world anymore"
I'm a carpetbagger, baby
I'm coming to your town
I'm gonna treat you kind
I'm gonna rob you blind
I'll smile all the time
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah

They come to town when the party's over
Books been written and true's been tried
They'll take it all if the door's left open
Steal the nose right from under your eyes

I'm a carpetbagger, baby
I'm coming to your town
I'm gonna treat you kind
I'm gonna rob you blind
I'll smile all the time
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeahEmbed
