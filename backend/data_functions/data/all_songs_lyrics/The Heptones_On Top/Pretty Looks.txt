Pretty Looks LyricsI lost my baby, but she's coming back, yeah
She wrote a letter stating she needs me badly
And if she comes home, I'll have a precious time
My little honey says her new guy treats her badly
It seems to me his pretty looks isn't much either
All I can say, pretty looks isn't all
My little honey says she's going to stay, now
I asked her why, she replied she loves me dearly
She's not gonna leave me until her dying day, dying day
She's not gonna leave me until her dying day, dying day
She's not gonna leave me until her dying day, dying day
She's not gonna leave me until her dying day...Embed
