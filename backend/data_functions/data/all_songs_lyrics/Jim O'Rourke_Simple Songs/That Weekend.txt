That Weekend Lyrics
Have you seen the yard?
It's not hard to miss
You should really check the yard
Your roof has a curve in it
Not the kind that you'd expect
Never seen a curve like that

I could come over this weekend, if you like
Be glad to come over this weekend, if you like
I'd love to come over this weekend, if you like

You should really wash your car
It's a different color than before
Maybe you should trade your car
Your door has a hole in it
I think there used to be glass here
You should really look into it

Just let me come over, just let me come over
Just let me come over, just let me come over
Just let me come over, just let me come over to your house
I'd love to come over this weekend, if you like
I could come over this weekend, if you like
Just let me come over, just let me come over
Just let me come over, just let me come over
Just let me come over, just let me come over
Just let me come over, just let me come over
Just let me come over, just let me come over to your houseEmbed
