Friends with Benefits Lyrics
Nice to see you once again
Been a long time, my friend
Since you crossed my mind at all
There's no need to beat about
Not hard to figure out
This ain't no social call

It's been quite a long, long time
But not enough to find the line
To get me goin' once again
Just one word I could respect
But then what do I expect?
You missed that boat a long time ago

Would you mind
Keepin' your hands inside?
I am friends with so many
Of the dead
Who already
Take a lot of space
In my head

I hear from them every morning
About all of their longing
Must be tired by now of where they are
I sense that you are not so sure
Of takin' the grand tour
Without some kind of guarantee
I'll make this easier on you
Just let me walk you through
Relax, and take my lead
And if you feel a little strange
I won't leave you shortchanged
Don't worry, this one's on me


I hear from them every morning
About all of your moaning
Must be tired by now of where you are

There are friends already waiting
For the space that you're containing
Keep your hands inside
It isn't farEmbed
