All Your Love LyricsI see in your eyes
I think you notice
That I'm so happy now
And I blame you
Please don't cry
I might enjoy that
Don't do anything to change the way I think of you
All your love
All your love
All your love will never change me
All your love
All your love
All your love will never change
I know you try
To make me notice
All of the things you think are good in you
Here's a surprise
I wouldn't need them
Even if there's no one left but me and you
Cause all your love
All your love
All your love
Will never change me
All your love
All your love
All your love
Will never change1Embed
