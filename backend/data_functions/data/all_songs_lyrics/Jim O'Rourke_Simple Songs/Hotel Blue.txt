Hotel Blue Lyrics
That shadow you're seeing
Has nowhere to go
There's no way of saying
Just go home
There's no sense in wearing
White so you can be
Seen out in the open
There's always me

Come aboard with us now
It's a long way to go
I know where to stow
Where you'd be allowed

There's no harm in asking
It won't change a thing
I could, or couldn't, do for you all the way
We'd better get going
Not much left to see of you
If we wait for the sun to go down

Come on board with us now
Cause all seats are taken
Then taken away
Far away
All seats are taken
Then taken away
Far away
All seats are taken
Then taken away
Far away
All seats are taken
Then taken awayEmbed
