End of the Road LyricsSome day I'll see
There's a place but one
No one, there's nothing to see here
And if I laugh they'll know
I used to sit in there
You're not moving cause you're having a bad time
Having a bad time now
If you were out that's it
They'll throw you overboard
Even a captain needs some rest
A castoff has no need
To find his way ashore
Cause nothing beats a holiday in the sun
If we happen to meet again
Could you look me in the eye
Although you might not really comprehend
It's not cause I didn't try
These years that you let slip by
So I just gotta ask
Just one time before you go
Is that too much to ask
Just one time before you go
Is that too much to ask
Just one time before you go
Is that too much to ask of you
Do you agree
A little thing for you
Only take one home into give to meEmbed
