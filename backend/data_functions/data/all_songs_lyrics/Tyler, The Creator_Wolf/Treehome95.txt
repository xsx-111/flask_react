Treehome95 Lyrics
You wanna hear the new song we just did? It's not finished but... yeah

I wanna go
I wanna go
Baby, let's go
To my treehome (To my treehome)
Treehome

Special
So let's go
Let's go oh-oh
Oh, let's go
I wanna go
Mmm
Treehome
Bridge!
Colorful you are
Yeah, that won't stop
You're my favorite crayon in the box
Let's think outside the lines
Come to my treehouse, yeah letâ€™s escape
Then let me go, headfirst in your lake
From what I heard, it's great
It's great
There's a party
Tuesday is good news day Woo!
Not usually a full tray Yeah
Can you pack your PJs?
There's a party
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be special
I'm special, baby
No one ever comes here
Yeah

Tuesday is good news day
Not usually a food tray
Boy, you must be special
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be (Let's go to my treehouse baby)
Let's just escape
Let's go to my treehouse baby
Special
Let's just escape
You and me
Oh, he's special
Let's just escape
Will you come into my treehouse?29Embed
