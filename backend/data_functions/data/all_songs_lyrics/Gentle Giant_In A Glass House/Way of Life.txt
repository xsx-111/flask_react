Way of Life LyricsGO
You'll find an answer, You've got to believe in your own way
Of life
So you'll have to find an answer, You'll have to find a way
Try to find, Try to find
You'll try to question her, Does she believe in the choice of
Your life
So you have to try to ask her, when you are away, left
Behind, out of mind; away
And in the end you discover, examine, you have to decide if
There is an answer, if there is a way, Let her find piece of
Mind
And another day, all alone, think there is away at home
Every other may, have their own, way of life that is their
Own
And your wandering only a game to realise no joy your
Own
And another day, all alone, choice of life is not your own
You'll try to question her, Does she believe in the way of
Your life
So you have to try to ask her, You'll have to find a way, left
Behind, out of mind; awayEmbed
