The Runaway LyricsHe is the runaway
Lie low the wanted man
Mask his elusive face
Soon he will getaway
And free is his future
No more aimless time to spend
And evading, he's escaping
Four dirty walls and a bed in a cage his home no more
Run in the underwood
Cover and hide the trail
Senses like sharpened sword
Guards for the shadow on his tail
And yet his joy is empty and sad
All thoughts are scarred with the prison cell
And freedom seems like freedom's hell
Hopes stained with strange regret
His dreams are dreams for that he cannot get
And yet his joy is empty and sad
Lose all identity
Vanish in own denial
Seeks only lies and hide
Truth never brought to trial
And caught in his own net
He looks to find endless life
And evading, he's escaping
Four dirty walls and a bed in a cage his home no more
Run in the underwood
Cover and hide the trail
Senses like sharpened sword
Guards for the shadow on his tailEmbed
