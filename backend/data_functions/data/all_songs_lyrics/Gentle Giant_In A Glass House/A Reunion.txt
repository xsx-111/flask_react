A Reunion LyricsMeeting in this way who could have known
How our destinies and ways apart have grown
Looking still the same after all these years changing only in
My memories not clear
And believing all futures we would share
Fate design playing natures mime and today by chance we
Meet again after all this time
Meeting in this way no-one could have known
Sharing thoughts and deeds simple harmony plans and
Hopes erased in our maturity
Now tomorrow's dreams are now yesterday
Fate design playing natures mime and today by chance we
Meet again after all this time
Meeting in this way no-one could have knownEmbed
