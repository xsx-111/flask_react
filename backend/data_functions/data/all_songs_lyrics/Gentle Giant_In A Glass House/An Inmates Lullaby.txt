An Inmates Lullaby LyricsLying down here in the afternoon
In my pretty cosy little cushioned room
I can talk to all my funny friends in here
I was told to rest why ... I am not quite clear
Eating flowers growing in the garden where there are tasty
Tulips and I don't care
If I wet my trousers there was no time
I had nowhere else to go nowhere else I could find
Staring up at the great big white light
That shines everyday and shines all through the night
Hearing voices of the silly friends of mine
Always lock the door nurses waiting outside all the time
Hurt myself this morning, Doctor gave me warning sent me
To my room and told me that I'm bad
I heard someone saying I think he'll be staying maybe for a
Long time, Why does everybody else think that I'm mad
I heard someone saying I think he'll be staying maybe for a
Long time and that I'm mad
Lying down here in the afternoon
In my pretty cosy little cushioned room
I can talk to all my funny friends in here
I was told to rest why ... I am not quite clearEmbed
