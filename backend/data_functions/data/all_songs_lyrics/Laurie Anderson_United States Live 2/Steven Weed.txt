Steven Weed Lyrics(Right stereo channel) Steven Weed
(Left stereo channel) Was asked
(R) By the FBI
(L) To come in
(R) And answer
(L) A few questions
(R) And he said
(L) It wasn't like
(R) An interrogation room
(L) At all
(R) There were no
(L) Bright lights
(R) But he said
(L) They had it set up
(R) So that there was an agent
(L) On his right
(R) And an agent
(L) On his left
(R) And that they kept
(L) Alternating questions
(R) So that he had to keep
(L) Turning
(R) His head
(L) In order
(R) To answer them
(L) And he said
(R) After a few
(L) Hours
(R) Of doing this
(L) That no matter what
(R) Question they asked
(L) Or what answer
(R) He gave
(L) The answer
(R) Always
(L) Looked like
(R) No
(L) No
(R) Uh-uh
(L) NoEmbed
