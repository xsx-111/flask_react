Pray for Newtown LyricsI was a Junior in  a high school when I turned the TV on
James Huberty went to a restaurant, shot everyone up with a machine gun
He was from my hometown
We talked about it til the sun went down
Then everybody got up and stretched and yawned and then our lives went on
And I had just left Safeway, when I walked through my doorway
When a guy took a boat to an island and shot up a bunch of little kids up in Norway
Called a few of my friends round here, but no one much really cared
But I did, because I've got a lot of friends there
I just arrived in Seoul, by way of Beijing
I had an hour to myself in my hotel when I turned on the TV
It was quite a thriller, CNN was promoting the Batman killer
His eyes were glazed like he was from Mars
Yesterday he was no one, today he was a star
I was down in New Orleans, at the Monteleone
Enjoying some time all to myself when I turned the TV on
There were shootings in a Portland mall
It was everyday America and that's all
It was just another one walked down Royal Street
The rest of the world was out having fun
December fourteenth, another killing went down
I got a letter from a fan he said Mark say a prayer for Newtown
I ain't one to pray, but I'm one to sing and play
For women and children and moms and dads and brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts
December twenty-fifth, and I was just laying down
I picked up a pen, I wrote a letter to the guy in Newtown
I said I'm sorry about the kids, and the teachers who lost their lives
I felt it coming on, I felt it in my bones and I don't know why
So when Christmas comes and you're out running around
Take a moment to pause and think of the kids who died in Newtown
Who went so young, who paid the price
To make us stop and think and try to get it right
Who went so young, who knew a cloud so dark over them hung
When they left home, gave their mom and dad a kiss and a hug
So when your birthday comes and you're feeling pretty good
Baking cakes and opening gifts and stuffing your mouth with food
Take a moment for the children who lost their lives
Think of their families and how they mourn and cry
When you're gonna get married and you're out shopping around
Take a moment to think about the families that lost so much in Newtown4Embed
