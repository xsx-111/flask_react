Truck Driver Lyrics
My uncle died in a fire on his birthday
Redneck that he was, burning trash in his yard one day
And onto the pile, he threw an aerosol can of spray
And that's how he died in the fire that day
Before he retired, he was a truck driver
He'd be gone through the winters and all through the summers
In the winters, us kids would order at Domino's and watch Happy Days
And in the summer, we'd gig frogs at the pond and fry up their legs

My aunt still lives there
Out in Ohio
I visit her in the elder care
She makes me smile
We remember the story
Of when I was young
Getting stung by a hornet
She caressed my foot, rubbed baking powder on it

I was probably five at their home in Navarre
My cousin's friend was in the yard, playing guitar
We all gathered around to listen to her play and sing
And I fell into a trance and knew that one day, I'd do the same thing
My uncle died in a fire on his birthday
Out by the barn and his old collection of cars
Third-degree burns, a charred-up shovel near his hand
My uncle died a respected man

I flew out there
I went to his funeral
It was storming that day
The sky was deep purple
And babies were crying
Kentucky Fried Chicken was served
And that's how he would've wanted it
I'm sure

And after the funeral out there in Navarre
They all gathered 'round when I picked up a guitar
They fell into a trance as I sang and I played
And outside, the frogs croaked, and the mantises prayed2Embed
