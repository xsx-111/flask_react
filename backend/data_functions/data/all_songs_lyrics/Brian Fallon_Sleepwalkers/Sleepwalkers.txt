Sleepwalkers Lyrics
Oh and now mama, could you
Bend your ear for just a tiny minute?
I’m afraid I’m goin' crazy again
Could you spare me a little perspective?
See, I’m having all these visions, ma
But I don’t want you to worry
And there’s this girl that I must’ve been wild about
In some long-distance point in my history

And I saw her last night with a handsome young man
She was glowing to me, is she glowing to him?
And mama she was famous in my dreams

And on a good night
Can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean
I will find you in a dream
In between the needles and the pins
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep
Mm-mm

And I don’t mind, the empty hours
I’m learning to sit with my demons
Been itching to write up this book again
But it’s so hard explaining the fevers
I’m workin’ to live with the livin’, ma
'Cause I spent too many years running
And I just want to find somebody designed
With the same electricity humming
And I saw her last night with a handsome young man
She was perfect to me, is she perfect to him?
And mama she was famous in my dreams

And on a good night
Can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean
I will find you in a dream
In between the needles and the pins
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep

If you see her
Say I'm waitin' on the fireworks
I’m waitin' on this sunburn
I’m waitin' on the fireworks

And on a good night
Well, can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean
I will find you in a dream
Yes, I will find you in a dream
And on a good night
Can you keep a secret in the low light?
Where heaven meets the ocean
I will find you in a dream
In between the needles and the pins
Where you and I go walkin’ in our sleep

Honey, ain’t this life, whoa
Honey, ain’t this life a pretty little dream?
Honey, ain’t this life a pretty little dream?Embed
