My Name Is the Night (Color Me Black) Lyrics
Can you give me something?
Tonight, I'm so alone
The moon is upside down
Hanging on a telephone
But I remember every little bad dream
Every pretty slow dance

So can I pick you up later?
(When your temperature's better)
If you need a little shelter
(Be your cool operator)
Keep it all quiet, yeah
(Just a little while)
Let the night wind you down, baby, down

And she smiles, how 'bout that?
I was just about to jump before you called me back
And you know the pain comes home
And the whispers come to call me in my bed when I'm alone
And I've lost so much more than I ever had
Now my name is the night, honey, color me black
C-color me black
Can I take you somewhere?
Would it make a difference?
Like pretty roses on a deathbed
But I remember, in your white dress
In your mama's hands

So can I pick you up later?
(When your temperature's better)
If you need a little shelter
(Be your cool operator)
Keep it all quiet, yeah
(Just a little while)
Let the night wind us down, baby, down

And she smiles, how 'bout that?
I was just about to jump before you called me back
And you know the pain comes home
And the whispers come to call me in my bed when I'm alone
And I've lost so much more than I ever had
Now my name is the night, honey, color me black
C-color me black

And how long, how long
Until you believe that part of me is gone?
With your sweet, naive kiss
Well I used to feel the same until I let the darkness in
And it cost me nothing, baby
Nah, nothing more than this
Nothing more than this useless heart in my chest
Nothing that I needed, nothing I regret
Nothing that I needed, and I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
And she smiles, how 'bout that?
I was just about to jump before you called me back
But you know the pain comes home
And the whispers come to call me in my bed when I'm alone
Singing, "Ooh, not just yet"
When I go, I'll be going out in flames and fiery wrecks
And the quiet to me, such an ominous sound
Said my name is the nighttime now
Yes, the quiet to me, such an ominous sound
And my name is the night, honey, color me black1Embed
