See You on the Other Side Lyrics
All my life I've been a slave to a pardon
My eyes transfixed somewhere far over the Jordan
And all my years I've wanted someone to die for
So I had a reason I burned

But I've never been where you were born
Or felt the things that broke your heart
Come talk to me, come talk to me
I want to understand

And when we both grow old
And there's nothing left to say
I want you to know
That I loved you all my days
And when we close our eyes on this lifetime
I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you on the other side

I would count myself lucky, love, to entertain you
To find myself in the things that complicate you
And spend my life in Your Majesty's service
And I'd call myself satisfied
But in our limb of bone and lace
And time and love and body aches
I loved you more, I loved you more
But a clock keeps ticking down

And when we both grow old
And there's nothing left to say
I want you to know
That I loved you all my days
And when we close our eyes on this lifetime
I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you on the other side

If you hold on
Hold on, hold onto me

And when we both grow old
And there's nothing left to say
I want you to know
That I loved you all my days
And when we close our eyes on this lifetime
I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you on the other side
And when we both grow old
And there's nothing left to say
I want you to know
That I loved you all my days
And when we close our eyes on this lifetime
I'll see you on the other side
Yes, I'll see you on the other sideEmbed
