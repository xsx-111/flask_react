Forget Me Not Lyrics
Stacy, I'd like to take you to a movie
In a world without a death wish
On a night under the fireworks in heaven
Oh but Stacy
Baby, you can't take me anywhere
Because I get a lot of low downs
So just put me in the cold ground and visit
Oh, but what if
What if my soul was still trembling?

Would you put your black dress on and visit my bones?
And bring my football top and a scarf for the cold
Playing melancholy songs that somehow made us
Feel a whole lot better
While I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow
In the cold, hard ground with some letters you wrote
Would I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?
Or would you just go on?

Stacy, I never thought I'd miss the small talk
I never knew the gift the day was
I just used to hear the time clock
Whistle stop
Sleep and get back up again
Stacy, I never thought I'd miss the hard love
I wish I took the time to miss you
While we were sitting only right there under heaven
Oh, but what if
What if my soul was still trembling?
Would you put your black dress on and visit my bones?
And bring my football top and a scarf for the cold
Playing melancholy songs that somehow made us
Feel a whole lot better
While I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow
In the cold, hard ground with some letters you wrote
Would I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?
Or would you just go on?

Could you promise me something if you find someone?
That you'll forget me not
Never feel too much
Even if they do all the things that I couldn't do for you
And I'll promise you something if I find someone
That I'll forget you not
Never feel too much
Even if they do all the things that I couldn't do for you
Oh, but what if
What if your soul was still trembling?
 I would put my black suit on and visit your bones
And bring your Football top and a play that you wrote
And an English song by a band that you love
Here comes the sun, little darling
And the kingdom come and the trumpet blow
In the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote
Would you get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?
Or would you just go on?
Would you put your black dress on and visit my bones?
And bring my Football top and a scarf for the cold
(Please forget me not)
Playing melancholy songs that somehow made us
Feel a whole lot better
(Would you just go on?)
Well, I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow
In the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote
(Please forget me not)
Would I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?1Embed
