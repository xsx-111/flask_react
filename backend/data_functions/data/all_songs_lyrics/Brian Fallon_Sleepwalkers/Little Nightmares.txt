Little Nightmares Lyrics
I know you know I know
That there's something that's worth holding on to
In spite of the burned out scene and the aging pains
And the quiet little monsters
And you know I know you know that I feel the same
I feel just like you do
When I hear you say sometimes there's
Something pure about growing up lonesome

All my life I was the quiet kind
I just kept to myself and my dreaming
And all my life I just tried to survive
I'm not trying to shut you out

And she says, "I just wanna live
And if I get the chance
Then I would wanna live again"
But I get this nightmare
Where you leave me on my own
And all I want is to let you know
But my words get lost
And haunt the back of my throat
And little nightmares
Keep telling me you'll go
Keep telling me you'll go
I see you shake and shake and shake and shake
And I wanna reach out now
Because there must be a brighter light
There's a simple life that gets past these breakdowns
And you know that I know you know
That I crash the same in tiny little pieces
You gotta know that I'm on your side
And there's something gold
About someone you can bleed on

All my life I was the killing kind
I was cruel as the cold stormy weather
All my life I just tried to survive
I'm not trying to shut you out

And she says, "I just wanna live
And if I get the chance
Then I would wanna live again"
But I get this nightmare
Where you leave me on my own
And all I want is to let you know
But my words get lost
And haunt the back of my throat
And little nightmares
Keep telling me you'll go
Keep telling me you'll go
Don't you know there's an ocean of hope
Underneath the grey sky where you're dreaming?
And it's so hard to know which lonely hand you should hold
You can hold me until you don't want me
We can cry together through the bad dreams
We can cry together through the bad dreams
We can cry together through the bad dreams
We can cry together through the bad dreams
Through the nightmare that is the waiting and
(Yeah, 1,2 bad dreams)
And she says, "I just wanna live (like that)
And if we get the chance
Then I would wanna live again"
But I get this nightmare
Where you leave me on my own
(Goodbye baby)
And all I want is to let you know
But my words get lost
And haunt the back of my throat

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
(From you baby)
She says, "I just wanna live
And if we get the chance
Then I would wanna live again"
But I get this nightmare
Where you leave me on my own
Where you leave me on my ownEmbed
