Etta James Lyrics
Did you spend most of your life waitin'
On a fairytale read between pages?
Did you huddle up close to your boombox radio
Is somebody waiting on the same song?
And we sold our souls on the fantasies
We found in records and black and white movies
And I used to beg June to burn me alive
If that would get me anywhere but here

Now Etta James, hit that symphony
'Cause she drifts through my blood like a remedy
And for most of my sad life
I figured I was gonna die alone
'Cause I just burned in the curve of my scars
Twenty long years away from your heart
'Til finally, finally, my love is in my arms
My love is in my arms

And it was impossible to hold on to anything
In my chest was a lonesome, growing cyclone
I kept pictures tucked up into the rearview above
To the sirens I lost in the ocean
And all we wanted was absolutely everything
Like foolish, hungry young lions
I was lost and alone, a million light years from home
It was nobody's fault but mine
Now Etta James, hit that symphony
'Cause she drifts through my blood like a remedy
And for most of my sad life
I figured I was gonna die alone
'Cause I just burned in the curve of my scars
Twenty long years away from your heart
But finally, finally, my love is in my arms

And was there a hole in your life?
Did you kill to keep warm
But somehow never quite satisfied?
Do you feel like it's always time to go?
And it's always wrong, and it's always off
And it's hard to know which heart to hold
Now, do you lie to someone?
Is someone else, on your mind?
Do you lie to someone with me on your mind?

Now Etta James, hit that symphony
'Cause she drifts through my blood like a remedy
And for most of my sad life
I figured I was gonna die alone
'Cause I just burned in the curve of my scars
Twenty long years away from your heart
Til finally, finally, my love is in my arms
My love is in my arms
(Etta James, Etta James
Etta James, sing it one time for my pain
Etta James, Etta James
Etta James, sing it one time for my pain)
At last, at last
(Etta James, Etta James
Etta James, sing it one time for my pain)
At last, at last
(Etta James, Etta James
Etta James, sing it one time for my pain)
Like Etta said, my love has come along2Embed
