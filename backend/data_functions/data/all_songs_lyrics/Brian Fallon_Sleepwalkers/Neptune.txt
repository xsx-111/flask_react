Neptune Lyrics
I never felt like I was home
Felt like a strange long-distance caller
Set to the words I heard on the needle spinnin' by my bedside
And I used to stay up most of the night
With my ear tuned to any sign
Of life, of love, of something that felt like redemption

And I never dreamed that I would see you again
But I never forgot all the times that we spent
Flying rolled down low like the window

And maybe we believed in very, very foolish things
Maybe these songs kept us breathing another tomorrow
And we were always very sure we were never gonna change the world
I never held any grudges or kept any pictures

And what did it mean for all these years I spent chasin' them ferris wheels
That were always gone like visions come the morning?
But there's not one day I regret
And I would do it all again
'Cause if I go down, Lily, I'm going down believing
And I never dreamed that I would see you again
And I lost myself for a season in Hell
Flying rolled down low like the window

And maybe we believed in very, very foolish things
Maybe these songs kept us breathing another tomorrow
And we were always very sure we were never gonna change the world
I never held any grudges or kept any pictures
(Hey!)

She said, "tonight, my love, I declare this war for your falling from grace with me"
While Neptune rolled out a carpet made of gold for the mermaids he drowned in the sea
It's been a long time since I kept any pictures
And it's been a long night, I don't know where to find her

And maybe we believed in very, very foolish things
Maybe these songs kept us breathing another tomorrow
And we were always very sure we were never gonna change the world
I never held any grudges or kept any pictures

It's been a long time
Since I kept any pictures
It's been a long night
And I don't know where to find her
It's been a long time
Since I kept any pictures
It's been a long night
And I don't know where to find herEmbed
