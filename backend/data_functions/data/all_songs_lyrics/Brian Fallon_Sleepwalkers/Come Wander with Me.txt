Come Wander with Me Lyrics
I came to this world in a seaside town
Where the water could cool your broken body out
I learned you can rise over the cards in your hand
Mama was a woman and a hard-workin' man
Now, everyone I know had to make their own bed
Try to do as good as their fathers did for them
I never knew mine, so I bandaged the hurt
I pretended that my daddy was a bank robber

Oh, but you, you always said
"You're just too good a ship to wreck"
You said, "never mind nothin'
There's a summertime hummin'
Once the bandages come off"
Yes, and you always believed
There was some kind of diamond in me
Oh, but if you still burn
Every night in the hurt
I know a place where the pain doesn't reach
Come wander with me
Come wander with me

Now I tried to believe but it's so hard to know
Gotta do right, Rudy, with the seeds that we've sown
But the voices are loud and the miles are long
And a hero's a hard thing to find when you're grown
Oh, but you, you always said
"You're just too good a ship to wreck"
You said, "never mind nothin'
There's a summertime hummin'
Once the bandages come off"
Yes, and you always believed
There was some kind of diamond in me
Oh, but if you still burn
Every night in the hurt
I know a place where the pain doesn't reach
Come wander with me
Come wander with me

Now, I hope the things that trouble me
They don't catch you or press you on your knees
But I found out time and work don't make you a man
Because time didn't teach me anything
And the working only broke my hands
And when someday came I did not understand
U-understand, understand

Oh, but you, you always said
"You're just too good a ship to wreck"
You said, "never mind nothin'
There's a summertime hummin'
Once the bandages come off"
Yes, and you always believed
There was some kind of diamond in me
Oh, but if you still burn
Every night in the hurt
I know a place where the pain doesn't reach
Come wander with me (it's hard to sleep
I can bring you a dream
My baby, come wander with me)
Come wander with me (it's hard to sleep
I can bring you a dream
My baby, come wander with me)
Come wander with me (it's hard to sleep
I can bring you a dream
My baby, come wander with me)
Come wander with me (it's hard to sleep
I can bring you a dream
My baby, come wander with me)
Just past the doorEmbed
