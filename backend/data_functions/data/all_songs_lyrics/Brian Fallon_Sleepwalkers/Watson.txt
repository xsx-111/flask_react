Watson Lyrics
I went walking to clear my head of the buzzing
I went, I went stumbling past your car
Then all the bad blood down in my bones came a-rushing
Singing who's gonna love you when she's gone?

'Cause it took such a heavy light
Just to find you in the first place
Through all that rain and remaining fog

But if you're thinking you might wanna stay with me
I don't wanna go on my own
Lord, I worry when I get old, I'll be lonesome
Chasing all the umbrellas in London
Every footstep in Angel Station
For even the scent of her perfume again
Watching detectives chase the one that got away
The one that got away

And who would be the heart
She'd hold on after mine?
I bet he's a fine upstanding man
'Cause it took such a heavy light
Just to find you in the first place
But "do what you love"
I once heard you say

But if you're thinking you might wanna stay with me
I don't wanna go on my own
Lord, I worry when I get old, I'll be lonesome
Chasing all the umbrellas in London
Every footstep in Angel Station
For even the scent of her perfume again
Watching detectives chase the one that got away
Oh, the one that got away

I remember how we danced
Through the towns on the Thames
For one little night, I felt like I
Could be made new again
And you stayed here with me
While I lost nearly everything
But "what do you really love?"
I heard you say
If you're thinking you might wanna stay with me
'Cause I don't wanna go on my own
Lord, I worry when I get old, I'll be lonesome
Chasing all the umbrellas in London
Every footstep in Angel Station
For even the scent of her perfume again
Watching detectives chase the one that got away
The one that got away
The one that got away

Hang on Watson, hang on Watson
(I don't want to go on my own)Embed
