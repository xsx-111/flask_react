Proof of Life Lyrics
There's so many voices
Jamming up the stations
And it's hard to hear the angels
So I don't feel too forgiven
And I get up in the morning
Like a ghost chained to a haunting
And I come home in the evening
Because you're all I ever wanted
And I feel like you keep me hanging on

So I'm gonna sing right now
While my heart still pounds
Because tonight is almost over
Tomorrow's such a long time
And if all my words are gone
To waste away in the unknown
As long as you know how I loved you
That would be the proof of life
When I am gone

Now I used to hear a thunder
There was lightning in my veins
Sometimes I can feel it
Like it's coming back again
But some nights it's so heavy
And the weight is pressing down
And I lie awake in arguments
With shadows and with doubts
But I feel like you keep me hanging on
So I'm gonna sing right now
While my heart still pounds
Because tonight is almost over
Tomorrow's such a long time
And if all my words are gone
To waste away in the unknown
As long as you know how I loved you
That would be the proof of life
When I am gone

So gimme all your troubles
Gimme all the spiders in your brains
Let me see the parts with the real deep scars
Though I cannot wash your sins away, mmm

So I'm gonna sing right now
While my heart still pounds
Because tonight is almost over
Tomorrow's such a long time
And if all my words are gone
To waste away in the unknown
As long as you know how I loved you
That would be the proof of life
When I am gone
As long as you know how I loved you
That would be the proof of life
When I amEmbed
