Anna Lee Lyrics
Helpless child
They invite your hands to fill their needs
Will you be the same?
Shameless smile
To steal from you the innocence that bleeds
Will they feel your pain?

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't want to breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't want to be alone
Where do you belong
Anna Lee?

Behind those eyes
The vivid scene
A lucid dream within
Questioned secrets are revealed
And every time
You can't deny
The lines that trace your skin
Wounds that never heal
Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't want to breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone

She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't want to be alone
Where do you belong
Anna Lee?

And now she's calling out a name
Can't keep on hiding all her pain
You feel the rain move in
As you begin
To turn and answer the call

Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't want to breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone
She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't want to be alone
Where do you belong
Anna Lee?2Embed
