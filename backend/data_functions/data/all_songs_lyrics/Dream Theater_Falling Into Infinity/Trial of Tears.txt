Trial of Tears LyricsI. It's Raining

Under the sun, there is nothing to hide
Under the moon, the stranger waits inside
People disappear, the music fades away
Splashing through the rain, I'll dream with them one day

It's raining, raining on the streets of New York City
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven

I may have wasted all those years
They're not worth their time in tears
I may have spent too long in darkness
In the warmth of my fears

Take a look at yourself, not at anyone else
And tell me what you see
I know the air is cold, I know the streets are cruel
But I'll enjoy the ride today

It's raining, raining on the streets of New York City
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
Raining deep in heaven
I may have wasted all those years
They're not worth their time in tears
I may have spent too long in darkness
In the warmth of my fears
And as I walk through all my myths
Rising and sinking like the waves
With my thoughts wrapped around me
Through a trial of tears

Hidden by disguise, stumbling in a world
Feeling uninspired, he gets into his car
Not within his eyes to see, open up, open up
Not much better than the man you hate
II. Deep In Heaven

III. The Wasteland

Still awake
I continue to move along
Cultivating my own nonsense
Welcome to the wasteland
Where you'll find ashes, nothing but ashes
Still awake
Bringing change, bringing movement
Bringing life
A silent prayer thrown away
Disappearing in the air
Rising, sinking, raining deep inside me
Nowhere to turn
I look for a way back home

It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven
It's raining, raining, raining deep in heavenEmbed
