Spasmolytic LyricsMaking time in a low rent highrise
No place to go downtown
Crushing crucifixion
Particles aching
Harmful descent
Take a shot and hide
Subway slam dance
Stale mattress
Slow throb bloating
Freshly open grave
Barefoot beggar
Barefoot beggar
Freshly open grave
Knotted finger
Turning pages in a book descending
No noise
The great trees fall
Calmly through the window see
Backward elevation
Faded spirit of the gold toothed whore
Moon dances wondering how could this ever be
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Possession in the flesh
Loves made up melancholy
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Trip back and unleash all anger
Emerging from the waterfall
Branch fork horse rear
Snorted downward a vulgar desire
Playing cards conjured on
Fly blown dimly lit
Round a room of shadows
Claw the side phantom pinches
Waking from a dream
Half eaten candy from some disordered heaven
Swirling tastes
Fornicate
Rotted meat
Swirling tastes
Fornicate
Rotted meat
A nested virus feeds eating dish
Aging
She sits alone in the worry she's created
More time put aside
Sorry, I'm fucked up inside
Holy hatred
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habit
Kicking the habitEmbed
