Shore Lined Poison LyricsTrials administer tidal oil that suffocating
Base the fire gold
Pouring mercury
Life given river deformed
In amongst patient building
Raise an urgent call reformation strike
The picking miners claw
Kick my ass
Waste the given gift
The natural cure
In an age of reason
Gone bad
Morning in between the cold stone
Ashes fall upon the wretched chosen ones
A hundred megatons evaporate those chosen
Things get in a difficult situation. It poses a risk to others
Vaporize case in point and deserving it
Vaccinate all stranger than whispering
Crushed velvet corpse grind a... awaiting underneath
And returning to the earth
Unraveled mask not needed
Decisions from one side of the brain
Insolent dented fibers optic
Looks the world of growth
Fleeting image ghost destruction TV screen
Fleeting image ghost destruction TV screen
Oh it gives off an orange cloud of light and just floats right out of the city, wow!Embed
