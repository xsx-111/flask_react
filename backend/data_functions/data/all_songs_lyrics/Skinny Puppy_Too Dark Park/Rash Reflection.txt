Rash Reflection LyricsNotice that phrase thorough vileness of his delivery ninety seven cars and free love
Kiss the master's feet
Poor soul searching
All this seen
Deeper stillness tranquility
Eat the food drug passive response
Spoiled putty in the master's hand
All this seen is obscure enough
Kiss the master's feet
Sure that vision is a vagrant holiday
Reflective silence chooses one stance
Hidden behind throne of freedom in the field of the black sheep
All this seen is obscure enough
Confess all the truth seekers see for the first time
Cult grows from a Rolls-Royce dream preach from the back of a limousine feel the rash burn
Notice that phrase through the vileness
How sweet feel the rash start to burn
Sure that vision
Kiss the master's feet
Kiss the master's feet
Sure that vision is a vagrant holidayEmbed
