Morpheus Laughing LyricsAn extreme solution
No fossil fuel mimicking
Exhaust rattles
Troublesome a madmans vast
Direct iron grooved world
Primary state average distance
Closer to the sun
Draws a comet nearer
To a complex destruction
It appeared to me as if in a dream
A spectre so violent in its views
Lies impervious altitude
Has a tendency under pressure
To reveal its identity
Gaping hole bright star
Penetration blindfold reliance
Wrinkles in the cloth of time
Unity among
Such a poor existence in this third world
Resistance should be used
Civil disobedience central pivot
Revolving heated combustion
Back to the origin of it all
All of it no unwarranted fear
Courage shown the white line
On the ball we live on
Deserted streets hallucinated
The bursted species
Abnormal conditions
Deep sentiment
For repulsive power
Nations knows
Immense populace
Ingenuity and progress
Never progressed
Out of the sun
All experiments prove
Not needed
The well established greed
And pain inflicted on the animal model
Still nothing no cure
The ravaged instinct silent waking
To a chemical perversion
Wartime underground
Imperfect plotting grows the seeds of time
Imperfect plotting grows the seeds of time
Grows the seeds of time1Embed
