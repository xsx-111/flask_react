Tormentor LyricsWalls trapped within
Yellow eyes the cutters drooling face
Rips apart
Cuts to the heart
Disease shown
Let it out
Movement crosses crimson light
Washes darkened corners gently
Forces open wide
And lingering awhile
Pouring thoughts electric fingers
Blinding pressure sockets stream
Matter grey the nerve free fall
Safely buried out behind a face
Let it out
Be careful watching living mask
Misshapen tumors ride the pressing
Tinted nightmare dreams
Let it out
Mental shock
Disturbed thoughts rotting
Long lasting reaction
Make it stop
Stir up the pot
Taking away means nothing
Mental shock
Distorted moodswing smile
Altered music shadow covers
Melted honey bitter pie
She utters
Tasting quite lovely
Motion on towards a truthful
State mincing with words align
Orders form to multiply
Mental shock
Relentless and leaning
Compiling the list
Mental shock
Measure the 
But always cover what was
Mental shock
Disturbed thoughts rotting
Long lasting
Mental shock
Relentless and leaning
Compiling the list
Mental shock1Embed
