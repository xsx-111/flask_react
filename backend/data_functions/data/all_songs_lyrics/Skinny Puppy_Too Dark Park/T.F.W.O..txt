T.F.W.O. LyricsTreason trapping animal hide in the vision of paradise
Two explains your head deranged
Time spun web deluded of life
Wicked black witch lady localize
Intelligentsia
Go write a book to cry in
Face it lost that look
Survivals hard enough
Fading fire
Climbing higher
Time to realize
That I'm on fire
Patience sun the lord looks over
Who cowers in the watchtower
Freeze arm scraping inches the vein
Blind distracted the worshiping
Metal point a scraping
Hole forever breaking in out temper test bottom so vile
Fading fire
Climbing higher
Time to realize
That I'm on fire
Fading fire
Climbing higher
Time to realize
That I'm on fire
Faded higher
Why you liarEmbed
