Convulsion LyricsHeavens trash fixation
Turning mass direction
Having a relationship without guilt
Mass direction
Off and away hazy circles round the eyes
How long
Heavens trash it's a vacant
Scathing vapor ancient role play
Downward the shores of Pluto
Downward 
Downward shores of Pluto
Heavens trash dusty circles
Flies the byways of the mind
Mass direction
Flower cauldron answer brew to mystify
Hate disease 
Downward 
Downward shores of Pluto
Hate disease 
Sure
Sure all
Sure all
Sure all right
Sure
All
RightEmbed
