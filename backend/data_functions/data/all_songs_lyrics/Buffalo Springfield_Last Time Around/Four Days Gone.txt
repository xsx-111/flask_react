Four Days Gone Lyrics
I met two kind people on the road
I was parched and dry from the cold
I've been traveling four days and nights, sir
And I do want to thank you for the ride, sir
And the soup your wife made tasted fine
If it's all the same, I'll be on my way at the next turn
And I'm three miles shy of my town

And my baby is a-waiting, I hope, sir
After fifteen trucks and an old For
And the government madness, I ran away
And I hate to say, I can't tell you my name
'Cause I'm four days gone into running

I can't even go home
Take my baby and run
I got the reason to live
I got the things I can give
And I'm four days gone into running1Embed
