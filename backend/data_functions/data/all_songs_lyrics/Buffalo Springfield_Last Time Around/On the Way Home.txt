On the Way Home Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane, like a smoke ring day
When the wind blows
Now, I won't be back 'til later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me (You know me)
And I miss you, now

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you (I love you)
Can you see me now?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you (I love you)
Can you feel it now, yes?

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-oohEmbed
