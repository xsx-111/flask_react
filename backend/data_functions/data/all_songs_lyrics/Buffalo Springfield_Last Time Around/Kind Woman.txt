Kind Woman Lyrics
Got a good reason for loving you
It's an old-fashioned sign
I kinda get the feeling like, mmm, you know when
I fell in love the first time

Kind woman, won't you love me tonight
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right

Remember once before, you're hearing the old folks say
Love's an ageless, old rhyme
Now-a-days, you know they're saying "Depends so much on
The kind of woman that you find"

Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Are you saying it's all right?

Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all rightEmbed
