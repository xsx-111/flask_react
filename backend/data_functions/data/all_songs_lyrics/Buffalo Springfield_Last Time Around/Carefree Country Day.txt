Carefree Country Day LyricsI get up in the morning with a cock-a-doodle-do
I get myself together if and when I choose
I'm just buckin' time, without a reason or rhyme
Oh, what a wonderful way to spend a carefree country day
I got to have it that way
I best get all my chores done, got some friends a coming by
There's a lot of country living in just trying to get by
I'm just buckin' time, without a reason or rhyme
Oh what a wonderful way to spend a carefree country day
I got to have it that way
I make myself a living off of hauling old junk
The wagon that I'm driving came from happy worker's dump
I'm just buckin' time, without a reason or rhyme
Oh, what a wonderful way to spend a carefree country day
Oh yeah, I've got to have it that wayEmbed
