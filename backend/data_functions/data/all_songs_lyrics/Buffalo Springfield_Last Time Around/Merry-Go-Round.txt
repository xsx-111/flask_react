Merry-Go-Round Lyrics
Upside down on a merry-go-round
Now, just look at me
Straining your eyes to see, just steady on me
Know it's a lover you'll see

Not your standard love and not just to be
Someone you can call neighborly

What in the world did you do
To make me love just you?
What did you do to me?
What you did to me

This time, next time, whichever may be
There's something I can't deny
I'm telling you now, your love is something to me
It's like a sweet lullaby

A melody that could only imply
Loving you's certainly worth a try
What in the world did you do
To make me love just you?
What did you do to me?
What you did to me
What did you do to me?Embed
