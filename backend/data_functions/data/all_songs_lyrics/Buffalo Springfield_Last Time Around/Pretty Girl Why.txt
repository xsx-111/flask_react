Pretty Girl Why Lyrics
Like the ghost of someone dear
She comes to haunt me in my sleep
Still unable to sincerely
Give her heart away for keeps

Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why not love me?
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why?

There she leaves me twice as lonely
As I was but yesterday
Keeping such a hold upon my thoughts
So near yet far away

Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why not love me?
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why?

The minstrel boy has gone to war now
Burdened with his father's sword
Still, she doesn't see how she can
Give him peace amidst the horror

Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why not love me?
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why?Embed
