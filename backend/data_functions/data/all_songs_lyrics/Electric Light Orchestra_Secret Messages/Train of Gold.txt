Train of Gold Lyrics
I saw her there from across the street
She was dressed in black
And when she moved, she moved to a beat
Like a Cadillac
She rode a train, train, train, train
(Telling lies, such a liar)
A train of gold

She was a woman of suspicious ways
Never saw daylight
And in her room, she sat and passed the days
And she'd creep out at night
She rode a train, train, train, train
(Telling lies, such a liar)
Train of gold

Train of gold, train of gold
It took me so long
To find out I was wrong
Now I wait for her in the night

Looked through a window, saw a velvet sky
A shade of green
A violin was playing soft and sweet
Like it was a dream
She rode a train, train, train, train
(Telling lies, such a liar)
Train of gold
(Telling lies, such a liar)

Train of gold, train of gold
It took me so long (So long)
To find out I was wrong (Was wrong)
Now I wait for her in the night

Train of gold, train of gold
I don't believe her (Believe)
It just couldn't be her (Be her)
I can't get it out of my mind

She rode a train, train, train, train
Train of gold
She rode a train, train, train, train
Train of gold
Train, train of gold
Train, train of gold
She rode a train...Embed
