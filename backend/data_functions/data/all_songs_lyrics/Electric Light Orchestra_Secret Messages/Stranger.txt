Stranger Lyrics
You're playing me backwards

On a cold and windy morning
I said goodbye to my old friends
They were hanging 'round the corner
They were staying 'til the end, 'til the end
On the other side of midnight
I was looking for a place to stay
And one thing's sure for certain
I ain't never going back again, no more
(These strangers)

The streetlights looked so pretty
As they spread into a town
I was looking for another sundown
And my head was spinning round and round, round and round

Looking through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Looking through the eyes of danger
Looking at the all-night dancers
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never taking all of the chances of a stranger (Stranger)
As I walked into the main street
I saw a crowd across the square
And I heard a guitar playing
And I saw you standing there, standing there

Looking through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Looking through the eyes of danger
Looking at the all-night dancers
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never taking all of the chances of a stranger

Distant bells, they started ringing
Somewhere far-off in the night
And the place was full of loneliness
That disappeared from sight, ooh

Looking through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Looking through the eyes of danger
Looking at the all-night dancers
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never taking all of the chances of a stranger
(Looking through the eyes of a stranger)

I ain't never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back1Embed
