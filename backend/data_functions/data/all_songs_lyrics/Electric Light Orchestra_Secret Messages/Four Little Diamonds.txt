Four Little Diamonds Lyrics
Is this on?
Okay, after four...
Four!


I used to think she was the greatest thing
I really cared, gave her a diamond ring
She said she'd rather die than ever leave me
Well, I never saw her face since then

And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds

She must be somewhere on the open road
She always said she was a lonely one
She gets you down with her tales of woe
She took me for everything

And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Ooh, four little diamonds
I looked around
I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone with the night
I thought about the things she said
And all the things we'd done
But where could she run?
There's just no answer to give


I keep on wonderin' 'bout her, day and night
She probably thinks I was a fool, she's right
She don't know it, but I'm gonna
Keep on searchin' for that woman
I'm gonna search everywhere

And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Ooh, four little diamonds

I looked around
I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone with the night
I thought about the things she said
And all the things we'd done
But she ran away, oh
There's just no answer to give

I still hear her callin' out to me
I still listen for her endlessly
But it never even crossed my mind
She was a cheater
I gotta find where she hides

'Cause if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds

Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Hey! Four little diamonds
Hey! Four little diamondsEmbed
