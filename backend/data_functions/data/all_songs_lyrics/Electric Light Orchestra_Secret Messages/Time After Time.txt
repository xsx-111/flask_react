Time After Time Lyrics(Time after time, time after time)
The skies are darkening, they grow so dim
Strangers are meeting, but it never ends
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know
(Time after time)
From far away, there comes a warning sound
(Time after time)
And no one listens, but it's all around
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know
Time after time, no hiding anywhere
Time after time, the visions in the air
Time after time, they come from everywhere
(Time after time
Time after time
Time after time)
Just listen to the sirens of the world
(Time after time)
They breathe a whisper waiting for the word
(Time after time)
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know
(Time after time)
Time after time, it is the same old story
(Time after time)
Another footstep on the trail of glory
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know
Time after time, no hiding anywhere
Time after time, the visions in the air
Time after time, they come from everywhere
The beauty of the earth from way up high
Shines like a jewel on the velvet sky
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know
The skies are darkening, they grow so dim
Strangers are meeting, but it never ends
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know
(Time after time)
Time after time, no hiding anywhere
(Time after time)
Time after time, the visions in the air
(Time after time)
Time after time, they come from everywhere
(Emit retfa emit)
Emit retfa emit, no hiding anywhere
(Emit retfa emit)
Emit retfa emit, no visions in the air
(Emit retfa emit)
Emit retfa emit, they come from everywhereEmbed
