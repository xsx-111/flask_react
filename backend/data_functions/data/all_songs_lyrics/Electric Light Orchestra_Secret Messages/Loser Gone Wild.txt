Loser Gone Wild Lyrics
I don't mind the pain or the joker's cold refrain
The days pass by so slowly, I count them all again
The silence of a basement, shades all closed at noon
(Loser gone wild)
Lie awake for fear of strangers
Darkness comes on slowly, twilight is the ecstasy
Like a candle burning bright, shadows dance until the light
Empty rooms and chilling smiles, ooh
(Loser gone wild)
They go on for miles and miles (and miles, and miles, miles, miles)

But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town
Where the music is playing all across the night
And every cloud disappears from sight
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone
There goes another (Loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone wild

I don't mind if violins don't play
I won't listen to them anyway
I don't care what people say (Loser gone wild)
Some things just can't be arranged
But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town
Where the music is playing all across the night
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone
There goes another (Loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone wild


But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town
Where the music is playing all across the night
And every cloud disappears from sight
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone
There goes another (Loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone wild

Icy fingers are touching you
Silent voices calling, too
What else is there to lose?
(Loser gone wild)
I'm here, but where are you?
(But in the evening when the sun goes down
I crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town)
(There goes a loser)
