Secret messages

Welcome to the show
And again

Welcome to the show
Secret messages


A moving stream of information that is floating on the wind
The secrets never end
And now they call, they sing, they play
They dance for you from out of the blue
What can you do

The secret messages are calling to me endlessly
They call to me across the air
The messages across the atmosphere
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere
Where words cascade like rainbows tumbling from the sky
Then I'll be there
I'll be there
When messages will call to you, there's secrets all around
Without a sound they're all around

The secret messages are calling to me endlessly
The call to me across the air
The messages across the atmosphere
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere
They're calling everywhere

Those secret messages that spill into the air
From far away, so far away
A flowing river of illusion running with confusion
Never gone, it goes on and on

The secret messages are calling to me endlessly
They call to me across the air
The messages across the atmosphere
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere
Secret messages
(The messages across the atmosphere, they whisper in your ear)
Secret messages
(The secret messages are calling to me endlessly)
Secret messages
(The messages across the atmosphere, they whisper in your ear) Secret messages
Secret
