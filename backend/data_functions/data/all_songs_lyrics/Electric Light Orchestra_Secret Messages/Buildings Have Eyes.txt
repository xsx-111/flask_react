Buildings Have Eyes LyricsPretty pretty are the girls as they go by
Chilly chilly is the air under moonlit sky
The windows watch you as you walk along
And the streets lead back to where you started from
The city's watching and you can't get by
No matter where you hide, you know the buildings have eyes too
This place is lonely but you can't get away
No matter what you say, you know the buildings have eyes too
Silly silly are the thoughts that fill your head
Wish I'd never set out, wish I'd stayed in bed
You see reflections from across the street
So you better get movin' stop draggin' your feet
The city's watching and you can't get by
No matter where you hide, you know the buildings have eyes too
This place is lonely but you can't get away
No matter what you say, you know the buildings have eyes too
Money money, gotta get some money and run
A position I find unenviable
It doesn't matter which way you turn
But you gotta keep trying cause you never learn
The city's watching and you can't get by
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes too
This place is lonely but you can't get away
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes too
Funny funny how the world goes round and round
You better watch your step don't make a sound
The windows watch you as you walk along
And the streets lead back to where you started from
The city's watching and you can't get by
No matter where you hide, you know the buildings have eyes too
This place is lonely but you can't get away
No matter what you say, you know the buildings have eyes too
Pretty pretty
Chilly chilly
Silly silly
Money money
Funny funny
