Bluebird Lyrics

The streets, the signs are pointing all one way
(One way)
But you don't realize just what they say
(They say)
You may fight (You may fight)
You may run (You may run)
You may know (You may know)
What you've done (What you've done)

It makes me feel so sad (Makes me feel so sad)
To think what I might've had (What I might've had)

I watch the stars (I watch the stars)
I watch the sun (I watch the sun)
Now I watch for anyone
But it's only make-believe

You work, you work, you work so hard and then
Someone, someone would come around again
You may think (You may think)
It's for real (It's for real)
But you know (But you know)
How you feel (How you feel)
The places that I go (The places that I go)
Don't feel good anymore (Don't feel good anymore)

I see it all (Rainbows)
Rainbows in fall
I see her face upon my wall
But it's only make-believe (Make-believe)
Fly away
Bluebird, fly away for me
To a place somewhere far across the sea

Fly away (Fly away)
Far away (Far away)
Don't look back (Don't look back)
Go today (Go today)

The waves that crash upon the sand (Crash upon the sand)
Another place on far-off land (Place on far-off land)

And every day (And every day)
I have to stay (I have to stay)
But you are free, you can fly away
But it's only make-believe
Ooh, ooh
Bluebird, bluebird, fly away for me
Bluebird, bluebird, fly away
Bluebird, bluebird, fly away for me
Bluebird, bluebird, fly away
Bluebird
Fly away, away, away
Oh, bluebird
Bluebird, fly away...2Embed
