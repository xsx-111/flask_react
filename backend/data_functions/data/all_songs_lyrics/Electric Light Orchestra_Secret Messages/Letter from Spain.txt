Letter from Spain Lyrics
I read the papers this morning
I saw your photograph
You look good in the movie
It must be so much fun

Letter from Spain
From someone I once knew
Letter from Spain

I got a letter this morning
(You're doing very well)
Postmark said it was from Spain
(Never thought you'd have the time)
Your writing is so very strange
(To think of me and write)
I guess it always was that way
(I'm glad you're doing fine)

Letter from Spain
From someone I once knew

Letter from Spain
From someone I once knew
Letter from Spain
From someone I once knew
Letter from SpainEmbed
