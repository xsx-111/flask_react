Endless Lies Lyrics
Bye-bye, pretty woman
I've got to leave you now
I find you never really cared

Sometimes I think I live on a merry-go-round
I don't know if I'm going up or down
On a merry-go-round

Endless lies shine in your eyes

It's all right, count to ten
It will all be better then
It's all right, the world will go away

Sometimes I think I live on a merry-go-round
I don't know if I'm going up or down
On a merry-go-round

Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes
The heartbreak is, if you could only see
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Endless tears that flowed through the years
You take it all, and then you take some more
Then you come running back to me
Play on, pretty music
Play on and on for me
Shine on, silver stars
Over the sea

Sometimes I think I live on a merry-go-round
I don't know if I'm going up or down
On a merry-go-round

Endless lies, I see it in your eyes
Endless lies shine in your eyesEmbed
