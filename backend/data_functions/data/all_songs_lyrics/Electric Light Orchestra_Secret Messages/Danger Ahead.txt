Danger Ahead Lyrics
Plant a tree


Here she comes down the street, and the look is in her eye
And the way she looks, if looks could kill, they might
All the kids down in the street run away
When she comes by, it's the end of the day

So, believe what they say
There's danger in the air

Look through a window, and you see her standin' there
She's the latest of the greatest, with the wind blowin' in her hair
The prima donna, she's back in town
And you'll see her for miles around

So, believe what they say
There's danger in the air

Beware, there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out, there's danger ahead
Monday mornin', she's already up and gone
Aw, she knows what she wants, and she knew it all along
With her entourage on either side
Just one look, she can't be denied

So, believe what they say
There's danger in the air

Beware, there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out, there's danger ahead

Beware, there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
(Backwards)
Look out, there's danger ahead

Ooh!

She's got a reputation that's way ahead of her time
She's got adulation that's way ahead of her mind
Everybody runs around to please
Whe she looks in the mirror, she just has to freeze
So, believe what they say
There's danger in the air

Beware, there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out, there's danger ahead
Beware, there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out, there's danger ahead

Ooh!
Ooh!Embed
