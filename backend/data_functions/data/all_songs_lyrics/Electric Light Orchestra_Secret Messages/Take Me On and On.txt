Take Me On and On LyricsThe stars that shine so brightly
They call to me
I dream of how it might be
Somewhere far away
Oh, take me on and on
Oh, ooh, until the world has gone
Take me on and on, on and on
The chains that hold you
Those chains will soon be gone
Sail upon the ocean
Sail back to me
Oh, take me on and on
Oh, ooh, until the world has gone
Take me on and on, on and on
Take me on, on and on
I see it all below
I know which way to go
I see the afterglow
Oh, take me on and on
Oh, ooh, until the world has gone
Take me on and on, on and on
Take me on and on, on and on
Take me on and on, on and on
Take me on and on, on and on
Take me on and on, on and on
Take me on and on, on and on...Embed
