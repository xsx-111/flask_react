Still Learning How To Crawl LyricsI looked at you, your lips were moving
But I did not hear what you said
You wanted me, you wanted my name
I was carrying two feet of lead
See the rising sun on this make-believe town
White shoe shine and leather, both of us so brown
I was in the water, you were dry
You yelled my name, now I know why
I'm still learning how to crawl
I'm still learning how to crawl
If the big drum, drum is rumbling
Keep me in line, keep me from stumbling
When I first went down everything was right
Skinny white leg, laying on my bed
Over there running, afraid to be found out
Tasting everything with a scream and shout
All I wanted I rejected
Drinking from a cup of killing
I'm learning how to crawl
I'm still learning how to crawl
He ain't coming in till you lay the table
He ain't coming in, not coming to watch me fall
The killer moves in, moves right into your face
When everything seems to be in its right place
Can't wait for love, love to be king
Can't wait for the love, to come with its sting
You blew away in your blue dress
I lost the one that I loved best
I'm still learning how to crawl
I'm just learning how to crawl
I'm still learning how to crawl
I'm just learning how to crawlEmbed
