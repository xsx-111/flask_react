Death Of A Train LyricsUnion Station, tombstone high
No more tears, this fountain dry
Nameless faces, just headlines
We don't ride that train no more
No resistance, turn my head
They could go out east instead
Newfoundland, land of my father
I don't ride your train no more
Cold steel shining, Battle Creek
Eyes are heavy, rain and sea
Massey-Ferguson memories
Don't ride that train no more
Hey there, captain, is that you
Could you tell me, tell me what to do?
I been twenty years on that Sault line
Now we don't ride your train no more
Smoke rises from the face of sand
Dreams about, dreams of beaver dams
Sam can't hear quite like he used to
Tell them why we don't ride no more
Hey, Pierre Trudeau, oh where are you?
My friend to lead us through
These hard times, oh so much confusion
I don't hear your train no more
I can't ride no more
I can't ride no more
I can't ride no more
I can't ride no moreEmbed
