For The Beauty Of Wynona LyricsThe ingots are burning red
I'm working time and a half
Tomorrow I'll stay in bed
What a hell it is, what a life
Laugh in my face, why don't you
Laugh with the rest who know it well
I tripped and then I fell for
The beauty of Wynona
At night I toss and I turn
And I try and dial your number
It's changed and god only knows
Where you been since last December
Where you been with that twisted smile
Throwing your mother in the pond
Break him easy when he go down
For the beauty of Wynona
Girls they skip double dutch
They saw you go, mama gone
My prayers don't mean nothing much
To the heart that cannot be won
Tangled in your fishing net
Right here in my own bed
Drowning in the tears I shed
For the beauty of WynonaEmbed
