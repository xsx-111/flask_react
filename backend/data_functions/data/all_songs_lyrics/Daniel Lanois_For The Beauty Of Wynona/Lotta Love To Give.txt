Lotta Love To Give LyricsI'm watching the rain clouds in the sky roll in
I'm sick of these red pills, sick of the dealer's grin
Daniel, Daniel, by the bonfires
On the telephone wire
She's calling you, saying, hey, I got a lot of love to give
You walked up to me and said did I make a mistake
I feel so naked I could use a twist of fate
There's a sermon that I heard the other day
Confused me so I looked the other way
I'm watching you now with a whole lot of love to give
I'm half crazy, eyes are heavy
If I can't be with you I would much rather be very dead
Please don't break it, could you make it
Into something that fits into your very pretty head?
I'm half crazy, eyes are heavy
If I can't be with you I would much rather be very dead
Please don't break it, could you make it
Into something that fits into your very pretty head?
Just trying to write it down while I still remember it
The winds are cold but not yet, it's not yet December
Fireballs bursting in the sky
Wasaga Beach, first of July
You said to me, hey, I got a whole lotta love to giveEmbed
