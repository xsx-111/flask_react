Beatrice LyricsBeatrice, come over here
Come and lay yourself down
Yeah, tell me all about it
To that lonesome sound
Take a look outside
It's all a bit crazy
People are real nervous
Too nervous to talk to a mother's son
Beatrice, let's get dressed
Take a look at what's been done
Yeah, you got me thinking
About what I don't want to know
Beating of the chest
Stink rising in the patriot's nest
Doing what's best
Kicking out the face of a mother's son
Beatrice, I like your smile
Makes me want to own you
Well, okay, but just for a while then
Before they stone you
Tell me, how do you speak to God?
Tell me, how do you speak to God?
When you're down there on the floor
Singing the song of a mother's son
Oh singing out now
Oh singing out now
Oh singing out now
Oh singing out now
Oh singing out now
Oh singing out nowEmbed
