The Unbreakable Chain LyricsYou wake up and there's something there tugging at your sleeve
It's not the pitter-patter of the one in your dreams
Held on by the chain, the unbreakable chain
Held there by the chain, the unbreakable chain
You walk and you know that the wind is not passing you by
It's speaking and you listen and the tears don't come now when you cry
Cry, cry, crying won't break the unbreakable chain
Crying won't break the unbreakable chain
It's thirty years ago and you live with your decision
You talk to him in a prayer, you send out your transmission
But a prayer won't break the unbreakable chain
Your prayers won't break the unbreakable chain
Your baby's not yours but he walks the streets of your city
He wants to know you, there's no self pity
It's pulling at your heart, the unbreakable chain
Pulling at your heart, with the unbreakable chain
And you, you put an ad in the paper, it's foolish but maybe
Maybe he'll see cause he's searching for mama mi
Oh mama here, mama feel the unbreakable chain
Mama feel the unbreakable chain
You can't believe that it's now, it's turned itself around
You're frightened of the way that you look, but you meet him there in town
Oh the joy and the fear of the unfailable pain
The joy and the fear of the unfailable pain
He stares at you and you step back and no words are spoken
You say hello to your boy and he says, "Mama, you've awoken"
Ah yes, you have broken the unbreakable chain
Yes, you have broken the unbreakable chain
You have broken the unbreakable chain
Yeah, you have broken the unbreakable chainEmbed
