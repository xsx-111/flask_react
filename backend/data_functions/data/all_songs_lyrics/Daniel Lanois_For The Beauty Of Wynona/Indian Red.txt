Indian Red LyricsMighty cooty fiyo
Hey la hey, hey la hey
I've got a Big Chief, Big Chief
Big Chief of the Nation, wild, wild creation
He won't bow down, down on the ground
Oh how I love to hear him call Indian Red
When I throw my net in the river
I will take only what I need
Just enough for me and my lover
I will take only what I need
Sing
Mighty cooty fiyo
Hey la hey, hey la hey
Mighty cooty fiyo
Hey la hey, hey la hey
Mighty cooty fiyo
Hey la hey, hey la heyEmbed
