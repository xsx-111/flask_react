Brother L.A. LyricsThe way you wait up late
When you finish the midnight shift
And you try to put out the hate
You know it's going to drift
Brother, you're going down
Down from the final blow
You can call on the one
The one that you knew
It feels right with you, my brother
It feels right when you're right here
No, I don't want to know
Every mountain every fear
Like a big old brother
Who can always pick you up
Who can fill your pocket
When you're all messed up
The sea that promises defeat
Is the flood that will come
The heat that keeps your habit warm
Is the flame that will burn
Are you wearing your filters?
Are you changing your clothes?
Are you wearing your colours
So that nobody knows?
Oh brother, brother, brother, brother of mine
Like a big brother
Who'll pick me up
Fill my pockets
When I'm all messed up
Invitation, you don't have to hide no more
You can give me something, I don't mind
You can lay it down on me
You can say it, I want to know
Oh brother, brother, brother, brother of mine
Oh sister, sister, sister, sister of mine
Look for my brother
Look for my brother
Look for my brother
Look for my brotherEmbed
