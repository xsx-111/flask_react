The Messenger LyricsGot a letter from a messenger
I read it when it came
It said that you were wounded
You were bound and chained
You had loved and you were handled
You were poisoned, you were pained
Oh no, oh no
You were naked, you were shamed
You could almost touch heaven
Right there in front of you
Liberty just slipped away on us
Now there's so much work to do
Oh the door that closes tightly
Is the door that can swing wide
Oh no, oh no
Not expecting to collide
For a minute I let my guard down
Not afraid to be found out
Completely forgotten
What our fears were all about
Oh no, oh no
There's no need to be without
There's a chance and I will take it
This desire I can't kill
Take my heart, please don't break it
I will crawl to your foothill
I'm frightened but I'm coming
Please, baby, please lay still
Oh no, oh no
Not coming for the kill
Oh no, oh no
Not coming for the kill
Oh no, oh no
Not coming for the killEmbed
