Crashing by Design LyricsNothing must pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
You're crashing by design
You once believed that crazy accidents were happening to you
You were chasing a capricious wind
Whenever bad luck and trouble happened to pursue you
The dice would surely save your skin
But when you look back, you must realize
That nothing in your life's divine
Everything that's ever befallen you
Happened simply 'cause it crossed your mind
You're crashing by design
Nothing can pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
You're crashing by design
In your single-roomed flat in a courtyard building
You sit alone just like a broken toy
Where's your mother, where's your lover, where are your children?
Are you a man or are you still a boy?
Who left you behind or did you run
From the crush of so many options?
Now you know the special despair of the man
Discussed, debated and offered for adoption
Nothing can pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
Another man without a woman
Dropped like a useless tool, no longer required
A man who longs for the stifling, milk flowered bosom
A fool who's no longer desired
Another man without a woman (Nothing can pass this line)
Too many rages have cost you this time (Unless it is well defined)
Another man among a hundred children (You just have to be resigned)
You're just a child who is lost in time
You're crashing by design
You're crashing by design
It all happens by design
It all happens by design
You're crashing by design
It all happens by design
It all happens by design
You're crashing by design
It all happens by design
Crashing by design
It all happens by design
Happened by design
It all happens by design
You're crashing by designEmbed
