Secondhand Love LyricsDon't bring me secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love
Now you went out tonight
Who've you been hanging around this time?
I don't care if he's black or white
I just don't like his kind
I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love
He's been leaving his scent on you
I can sense it from a mile
And all my money is spent on you
But you're still selling your smile
Don't bring me secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
Give your love and keep blood between brothers
Give your love and keep blood between brothers
I don't want your secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love
I can guess where you've been tonight, yeah
You've been hanging on the street
Wearing your dress too tight
Showin' out to anyone you meet
Well, I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
Don't bring me your secondhand love
Don't bring me your secondhand love
I want the first call on your kiss
Answer me one question, can you promise me this?
I want my defences laying in your hands
I don't want to rest in the palm of another man
I don't want your secondhand love
Don't want, don't want your secondhand love
I don't want, I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want, I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want, I don't want your secondhand loveEmbed
