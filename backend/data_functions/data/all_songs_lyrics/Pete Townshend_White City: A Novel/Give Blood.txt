Give Blood Lyrics(Give blood) But you may find that blood is not enough
(Give blood) And there are some who'll say it's not enough
(Give blood) But don't expect to ever see reward
(Give blood) You can give it all but still you're asked for more
(Give blood) But it could cost more than your dignity
(Give blood) Parade your pallor in inequity
(Give blood) They will cry and say they're in your debt
(Give blood) But then they'll sigh and they will soon forget
(We're heading for the day of reckoning, I'm telling ya. It's all building up to something, something that can only be redeemed with fire.)
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
(Give blood) But you may find that blood is not enough
(Give blood) And there are some who'll say it's not enough
(Give blood) But don't expect to ever see reward
(Give blood) You can give it all but still you'll be asked for more
So give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love, give love and keep blood between brothers
Give your love and keep blood between brothers
Give your love and keep blood between brothers
Give love, give love, give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love, your love, and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothersEmbed
