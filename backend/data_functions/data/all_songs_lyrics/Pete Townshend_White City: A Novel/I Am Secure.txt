I Am Secure LyricsMy room looks out to the wide open spaces
My heart is touched by awakening faces
I see the panic of people in motion
I can stand here, look out on an ocean
I am a wall awaiting a catchword
I see the city laid out like a patchwork
Alone, I am free from hatred and blindness
I hope that this life is frozen and timeless
My man is here, we grow old by inches
Tomorrow I'll walk among heroes and princes
I feed the boys, I hear secrets whispered
I know the hearts that are battered and blistered
I am secure in this world of apartheid
This is my cell, but it's connected to starlightEmbed
