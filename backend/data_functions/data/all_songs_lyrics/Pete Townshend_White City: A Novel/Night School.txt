Night School LyricsThe night school comes to life
Every minute it gets better
Got to learn to enjoy the night
Follow every letter
(A)
Assess cleaned up the past is all forgiven
(B)
Better get teamed up, alone you just can't live it
(C)
Check out your bus stop, look good and you feel right
(D)
Don't get messed up, standup to your fool
Fight at the night school
Nocturnal education
(E)
If they get beaten down, no one will give a damn
(F)
Forget the elite in town, you know where life began
(G)
And when you criticize, believe in yourself again
(H)
Hide from the hypnotized, they transferred surely into night school
Nocturnal education
(I)
I am the one that's crying
(J)
The journal has thrown away the key
(K)
To your daily grind
(L)
They take to the moon
(M N)
I'm teaching down at night school
(O)
Open the moment, don't count on tomorrow
(P)
Put up postponement, face up to your sorrow
(Q)
Quick get it over, get back to the dance floor
(R)
Release your phobia that's what we were meant for
At the night school
(S)
Stay in society, keep pain the raps
(T)
Terms of sobriety, in the tender traps
(U)
You heard of the raging moon, you where under it's spell
(V)
Now vanish like a burst balloon, and listening now for the bell
Night school
Nocturnal education
Night school
Nocturnal education
(W)
We are the one tonight
(X)
Excepting only the dead
(Y)
You ain't been listening to a word I said!
(Z)
Yea!
At the night school..... yeah
Teaching down at night school
Ooo yeah
I'm teaching down at night school
Taking classes at the night school
Teaching down at night school
Keeping the night
Keeping the night
Night school
Oooh yeahEmbed
