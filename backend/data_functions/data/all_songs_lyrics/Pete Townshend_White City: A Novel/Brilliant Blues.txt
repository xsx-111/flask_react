Brilliant Blues LyricsSay goodbye to the brilliant blues
Say goodbye to the brilliant blues
Say goodbye
It's time to live
So make me, take me
It's time, to give
So don't betray me, pay me
The brilliant blues
Don't want to be frozen
I spend my mornings at the sunshine cafe
I've read the news and the clique-ridden notions
I know that now is the time to stay
It's time (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
To teach (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
So tell me (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
Come on and tell me (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
It's time (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
To preach (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
So help me (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
Come on and help me (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
The brilliant blues
Will never flow this way again
The colour of the Mersey is grey
The brilliant blues
Have faded into sadness and pain
And now is the time to say it's time
You and me are going to finally sail away
(We'll get far away from the blues and the mist in the rain)
You and me are going to fight until we win the day
(For now is the time that we must say goodbye to)
The brilliant blues
I don't want to be frozen
I spend my mornings at the sunshine cafe
I've read the news and the clique-ridden notions
I know that now is the time to stay
It's time (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
To trust (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
So buy me (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
Come on and try me (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
It's time (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
To thrust (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
So guide me (Say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
Stay beside me (say goodbye to the brilliant blues)
The brilliant blues
Will never flow this way again
The colour of the Mersey is grey
The brilliant blues
Have faded into sadness and pain
And now is the time to say it's timeEmbed
