Come to Mama LyricsPride is like a bandage
He is wrapped in a warm cocoon
His pride is like heroin
He is back inside the womb
His pride is like an ocean
Encircled by a reef
His pride's a hypnotic potion
His memory is a leaf
Her pride is like an armour
Flaming ring of fire
Her pride is like a blindness
An ever tightening wire
Her pride is like a razor
A surgeon's purging knife
Her pride is like a censor
She's slashed out half her lifeEmbed
