Face the Face LyricsFace the face, got to face the face
Face the face, got to face the face
You must have heard the cautionary tales
The dangers hidden on the cul-de-sac trails
From wiser folk who have been through it all
And the faded names sprayed up on the wall
We've got to judge the judge
We've got to find the finds
We've got to scheme the schemes
We've got to line the lines
We must stake the stakes
We gotta show the shown
We gotta take the takes
We gotta know the known
(Try to place the place
Where we can face the face)
We got to face the face
(Try to place the place
Where we can face the face)
Face the face, got to face the face
Face the face, got to face the face
Got to
Got to
You must have tried and defied belief
Maybe buried your head in insular grief
I need your hunger, you need mine
A million mouths can swallow up time
We've got to fool the fools
We got to plan the plans
We got to rule the rules
We got to stand the stands
We got to fight the fight
We must fall the falls
We got to light the light
We got to call the calls
(We must race the race
So we can face the face)
We got to race the race
(We must race the race
So we can face the face)
Face the face, we got to face the face
We got to race the race
We got to
Keep looking
New York, Chicago
London and Glasgow
Keep looking
Keep on looking
Keep on cooking
Got to stay on this case
Study the pix
Watch the flix
We've got to find the face
Face the face, got to face the face (Watch the flix)
Got to
We've got to judge the judge
We got to find the finds
We've got to scheme the schemes
We got to line the lines
We got to fight the fight
We got to fall the falls
We got to light the light
We got to call the calls
(Try to place the place
Where we can face the face)
We got to face the face
(Try to place the place
Where we can face the face)
(Try to place the place
Where we can face the face)
Keep looking, keep looking
(We must race the race
So we can face the face)
We got to race the race
(We must race the race
So we can face the face)
We got to face the face
We got to race the raceEmbed
