Hiding Out LyricsFrom my window, I see roads
They lead to darkness, leading home
And in the midnight of a soul's unsleeping
I hear the waterfall of women weeping
Hear the distant noise of traffic stalling
I hear the prostituted children calling, calling out
From the barred and mesh-floor streets
Of a winter's night, without a moon
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I look over chequered fields
And the towering web of steel
Young and old will sit and judge unfeeling
While the empty church's bells are pealing
And the green hills lay ignored, untended
The lonely watchers remain unbefriended
And out in the one-way streets
Is a swelling maze, without a door
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here, yeah
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
I am safe
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here (I gotta hide out, yeah)
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here
