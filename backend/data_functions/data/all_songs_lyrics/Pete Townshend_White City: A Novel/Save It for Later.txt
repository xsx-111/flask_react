Save It for Later LyricsTwo dozen other dirty lovers
Must be a sucker for it
Cry, cry, but I don't need my mother
Just hold my hand while I come to a decision on it
Sooner or later
Your legs give way, you hit the ground
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down
Sooner or later
You hit the deck, you get found out
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down, you let me down
You run away, run away, let me down, run away
Black air and seven seas all rotten through
But what can you do?
I don't know how I'm meant to act with all of you lot
Sometimes I don't try
I just now, now, now, now, now...
Sooner or later
Your legs give way, you hit the ground
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down
Sooner or later
You hit the deck, you get found out
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down, you let me down
Run away, run away and let me down
Why don't you hold me
Why don't you hold me and kiss me now
Why don't you just hold me
Why don't you hold me and kiss me now
Two dozen other stupid reasons
Why we should suffer all this
Don't bother trying to explain them
Just hold my hand while I come to a decision on this
Sooner or later
Your legs give way, you hit the ground
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down
Sooner or later
You hit the deck, you get found out
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down, you let me down
Run away, run away, run away and run away and let me down
Run away and run away and let me down
Save it for later
Save it for later
Save it for later, honey
Save all that stuff for later
Hold me
Why don't you hold me and kiss me now
I want you to hold me
Why don't you hold me and kiss me, honey
Save it for later
Don't run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away and let me down
Run away, run away, run away, run away and let me down
Run away, run away and let me down
Run away, run away and let me down
Run away, run away and let me down
Run away, run away and let me downEmbed
