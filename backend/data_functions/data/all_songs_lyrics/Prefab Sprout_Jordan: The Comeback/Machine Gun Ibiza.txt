Machine Gun Ibiza LyricsHe's a stone Delta blues man
He's a top rollmo' star
He's a stone Delta blues man
He's a top rollmo' star
Black wand, white magic, nitroglycerine
He's earned the right to be known as
Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
If you've never been nowhere
Don't you pay that no mind
If you've never been nowhere
Don't you pay that no mind
Feel part of no circle?
If you make no scene
Well you've earned the right
To hang out with
Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
If you're a goddess
If your heart's sixteen
Girl you're gonna wake up buddies with
Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Ooh light a fire - Be an ex-marine
Baby learn to burn your dog tag like
Machine Gun Ibiza
Voodoo up rollmo' down
Machine Gun Ibiza
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten... sound
Machine Gun Ibiza
