Doo Wop in Harlem LyricsThere is a door we all walk through
And on the other side, I'll meet you
Reunion in the air, a cappella meets pure prayer
Somewhere, I can't wait to meet you there
Somewhere, I can't wait to meet you there
If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
They never sang doo-wop in Harlem
If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
They never sang doo-wop in Harlem
There is a door it may seem locked
But in a little while, don't be shocked
Above the noise, behind the glare
I know you're listening out there somewhere
Somewhere, I can't wait to meet you there
Somewhere, I can't wait to meet you there
If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
They never sang doo-wop in Harlem
If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
They never sang doo-wop in Harlem
If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
They never sang doo-wop in Harlem
If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
They never sang doo-wop in HarlemEmbed
