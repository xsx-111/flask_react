Scarlet Nights LyricsThis is where your sleepless eyes will close
This is where the weary find repose
This is where a kinder bugle blows
This is where you'll wake
To find the River Jordan flows
Scarlet nights waiting sleep is overdue
Scarlet nights ending here on in they're blue
Yes I know we're not saying goodbye
Yes I know that farewell don't apply
Yet I know no matter how I try
Yes I know, and you should know
That all the same I'll cry
Scarlet nights waiting sleep is overdue
Scarlet nights ending here on in they're blue
Blue as skies and blue as heavens
Watching over Galilee and Rome
Blue as water, Jordan's waters
Blue as dawn and dawn will take you home
Scarlet nights waiting sleep is overdue
Scarlet nights ending here on in they're blue
Blue as skies and blue as heavens watching over you
Blue as water, Jordan's waters washing over youEmbed
