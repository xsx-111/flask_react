Michael LyricsAll the jobs I've ever held, positions I have known
The one I was a fool to leave
Was right-hand to the throne
Ambition took me speed of light
To God's exclusion zone
Michael, if you're listening
Michael who stayed true
One of us got out of line when Paradise was new
One of us was exiled and the one who wasn't's you
Michael, help me write a letter to you know who
I will sign it “Lucifer regrets“
Can't forget his final words were
“Ain't no comeback gonna come your way“
What if I pray?
Michael the Archangel listen
Michael, don't you see?
We've come to stand for principles that
Prove free will is free
If you are on the side of good
Now where does that leave me?
Michael, help me write a letter to you know who
I will sign it “Lucifer regrets“
Can't forget his final words were
“Ain't no comeback gonna come your way“
He never could resist a sinner
Or ignore a distress call
But such a fallEmbed
