The Ice Maiden LyricsStanding on the boulevard
You wish to know my name
I'm the Ice Maiden
I think perhaps you like being unhappy
I'm the Ice Maiden - The limit of your dreams
Arctic winds blow and still you believe
Loves makes you one of the chosen
Die in the snow - I'll never grieve
So what if tomorrow you're frozen
Death is a small price for heaven
Welcome to the glow of high octane affairs
Esperanto style and blonde disheveled hair
Subterranean streams, duckling you're a swan
Infinities of dreams imploding into one
All those nights I dreamt of you
I wonder where they've gone
You're the Ice Maiden
Standing on the boulevard
I've always known your name
You're the Ice Maiden
Let you and I grow frosty together
You're the Ice Maiden - Today you meet your match
Girl when I burn - Hell nothing's the same
I'll singe your pretty blonde lashes
We're talking fire - We're talking flame
We're talking ice into ashes
But death is a small price for heaven
All those nights I dreamt of you
I wonder where they've gone
Girl when I burn - Hell nothing's the same
I'll singe your pretty blonde lashes
We're talking fire - We're talking flame
We're talking ice into ashes
But death is a small price for heavenEmbed
