Paris Smith LyricsLittle Paris Smith
Lovely name for a girl is Paris Smith
Baby Paris Smith
Don't repeat my mistakes Paris Smith
Paris : Any music worth its salt is good for dancing
Paris : But I tried to be the Fred Astaire of words
Paris you heard
Little Paris Smith one day you'll have a job
Yes Paris Smith
Baby Paris Smith don't you grow up a snob
No Paris Smith
Paris : There are benefits to syncopated motion
Paris : Which no high falutin' double talk can show - Paris
Paris : Any music worth its salt is good for dancing
Paris : But I tried to be the Fred Astaire of words
Paris you heardEmbed
