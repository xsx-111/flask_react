Wild Horses LyricsThrough the rails I spied
Your ponytail, I tried
With sugar cubes, and they're OK
But I don't think I'll catch you that way
I hate myself 'cause you're so cool
With your mocking eyes
Won't you look at the old fool
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to...
Look at you, unflawed
Now look at me, plain overawed
Grace and looks take no credit, for
Girl you're young and they're part of the score
Like the chemicals at war in me
'Til I'm a wolf with an eye for the ponies
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to...
(I want to have you)
(I want to have you)
I want extra time to play
Afternoons in the hay
It's a sorry way for a man to feel
But sentimental is part of the deal
I hate myself because it shows how
I'm a fool for your rodeo
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses
(I want to have you)
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have
Wild horses, I want to have you
(I want to have you)
Wild, wild, I want to have you1Embed
