Moon Dog LyricsThe funeral cars crawl down
The heartbreak side of town
The mourners all discuss
The boy who caused a fuss
We chopped a billion trees to print up eulogies
But guys we should have guessed
The girls would say it best
...MOONDOG!
Love. 'Cos love's the final word
Nothing crosses love
Reason has to bow if love demands it
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
Up there a flag will fly for mom and apple pie
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
The one place left to play
- The comeback's underway
The world was younger then
- In bed asleep by ten
And daddies shook their fists
At hidden communists
The earth was merely round
Before the slapback sound
Is there one spell can bring
The once and future king?
...MOONDOG!
Cut... To somewhere deep in space
Beyond the Colonel's arms
Handsome doggone rake the truly weightless
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
Up there a flag will fly for mom and apple pie
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
The one place left to play
- The comeback's underway
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
Up there a flag will fly for mom and apple pie
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
MOONDOG! - Guess who's on the moon
The one place left to play
- The comeback's underwayEmbed
