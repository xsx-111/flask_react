Jordan: The Comeback LyricsThey say the spirit moves in mysterious ways
Sometimes the way it moves looks plain berserk
But two things you should be slow to criticize
A man's choice of woman and his choice of work
Some work'll earn you top dollar
In this here tinseltown
That's where I started thinkin' of something else
'Cos they couldn't film the spirit
From the waist on down
Sometimes I don't sleep too well
But one day I know:
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
And all those books about me
Well there wasn't much love in 'em boys
I'm tellin' you if I'd taken all that medication
Man, I'da rattled like...one o' my lil girls toys
Now they call me a recluse
Been in the desert so long
Layin' on my back bidin' my time
I'm just waitin' for the right song
- Then I'm comin' back
Sometimes I don't sleep too well
But one day I know:
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
Jordan sweet Jordan
Hand me any cup you find that's lyin' spare
Lord I've long time been a thirstin' for a share
Jordan waiting for me there
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
Jordan sweet Jordan
Hand me any cup you find that's lyin' spare
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
Jordan sweet Jordan
Hand me any cup you find that's lyin' spare
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
End of the road I'm travelling
I will see Jordan beckoning
Jordan sweet Jordan
Hand me any cup you find that's lyin' spareEmbed
