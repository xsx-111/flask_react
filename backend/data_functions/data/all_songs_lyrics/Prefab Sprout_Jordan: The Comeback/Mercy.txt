Mercy LyricsMercy on me, oh say that I'm forgiven
And wrap your arms around me
To your goodness I surrender
Without mercy where is goodness?
Won't you have mercy on me?
Mercy on me, oh say that I'm forgiven
And wrap your arms around me
To your goodness I surrender
Without mercy where is goodness?
Won't you have mercy on me?Embed
