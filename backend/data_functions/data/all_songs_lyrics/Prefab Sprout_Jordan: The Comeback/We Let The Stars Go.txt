We Let The Stars Go Lyrics
There was that girl I used to know
She'd tease me about my name
Fan the embers long enough
I sometimes catch her flame
The soothing voice of distance tells me
That was just a fling
Other music fills my ears
But I still hear her sing
She sings:

"Paddy Joe! Say, Paddy Joe
Don't you remember me?
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go
Paddy Joe! Say, Paddy Joe
Don't you remember me?
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go free"

There was a boy I used to be
I guess that he was cold
If she came to buy him now
How cheaply he'd be sold
But the light is gone and it is dark
What used to be the sky
Is suddenly embarrassing
To the naked eye

"You see, Paddy Joe
See, Paddy Joe
Can't face this memory
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go
Paddy Joe
See, Paddy Joe
Can't face this memory
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go
Long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go
Long ago one stupid night
We let the stars go free"

(We let the stars go free
We let the stars go free)
We let the stars go free
We let the stars go freeEmbed
