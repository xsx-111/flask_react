Leeds United Lyrics
We watch you your expert double X's
It's just like you to paint those whiter fences
It's so polite, it's so polite
It's offensive, it's offensive
It's so unright, it's so unright
It's a technical, accept it

But who needs love when there's law and order
And who needs love when there's Southern Comfort
And who needs love at all

We stalk you your expert double X's
We oxidize you in your sleep
There's no exit, there's no exit
You're on a roll, you're on a roll
No one gets it, no one gets it
Your honor, no, your honor
Can't you protect us, protect us

But who needs love when there's law and order
And who needs love when there's Southern Comfort
And who needs love
When the sandwiches are wicked
And they know you at the Mac store
I'm so excited
The blacks and beat kids
I'm getting frightened
Someday, someday, Leeds United

Bugsy Malone came to carry you home
And they're taking you all to the doctor
Burberry vices, all sugary spices
It's nice but it's not what I'm after
Sure, I admire you
Sure, you inspire me, but you've been not getting back so
I'll wait at the Sainsbury's
Countin' my change making bank on the upcoming roster

And we'll stop you your expert double X's
Oh yeah, a big stock holder extra cold with two X's
That never talking thing you do
Is effective, it's effective
Your shoulder's icy colder, oh
Than a death wish, than a death wish

But who needs love when there's law and order
And who needs love when there's Dukes of Hazzard
And who needs love
When the sandwiches are wicked
And they know you at the Mac store
I'm so excited
The blacks and beat kids
They're so excited
When I think about Leeds United

I'm getting frightened
The blacks, the blacks, the blacks, and beat kids
It's so exciting
Someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday
