Blake Says Lyrics
Blake says no one ever really loved him
They just faked it to get money from the government
And Blake thinks angels grow when you plant angel dust
He shakes his head and blinks his pretty eyes but trust me

He's no Valentine
Though he said he would be mine
His heart is in Alaska all the time

Blake stays underwater for the most part
He collects loose change for all tomorrow's parties
And when Blake dates girls with tattoos of the pyramids
He breaks their hearts by saying it's not permanent

But in his velvet mind
He believes with all his might
We'll all go to Alaska when we die

Blake makes friends but only for a minute
He prefers the things he orders from the Internet
And Blake's been having trouble with his head again
He takes his pills but never takes his medicine
He tells me that he's fine
And the sad thing is he's right
And when it's two o'clock it feels like nine

Blake says he is sorry he got through to me
If it's okay he'll call right back and talk to the machine
Blake says it looks acid rain today
He takes the fish inside, he's very kind that way

But just like Caroline
He doesn't seem to mind
The globe is getting warmer all the time

It's still cold in Alaska
It's still cold in AlaskaEmbed
