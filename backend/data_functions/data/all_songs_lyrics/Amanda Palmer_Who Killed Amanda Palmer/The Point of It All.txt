The Point of It All Lyrics
Oh, what a noble, distinguished collection of fine little friends you have made
Hitting the tables without you again: no we'll wait, no we promise, we'll wait
June makes these excellent sewing machines out of common industrial waste
She spends a few months at a time on the couch but she says
She wears shades, she wears shades

But no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
And you're learning that just 'cause they call themselves friends
Doesn't mean they'll call...

They made the comment in jest
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it all

Maybe a week in the tropics would help to remind you how nice life can be
We propped you right up in a chair on a deck with a beautiful view of the sea
But a couple weeks later we came back and you and the chair were nowhere to be seen
You had magically moved to the closet
Eyes fixed to the place where the dryer had been
Oh, but no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for coming along
You're almost human, after all
Why on earth would I keep you propped up in here when you so love the fall...?

The pattern's laid out on the bed
With dozens of colors of thread
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point in the end

But it's better to waste your day watching the scenery change at a comatose rate
Than to put yourself in it and turn into one of those cigarette ads that you hate
But while you were sleeping some men came around
Said they had some dimensions to take
I'm not sure what they were talking about but they sure made a mess of your face

But still, no one can stare at the wall as good as you, my baby-doll
And you're aces for playing along
You're almost human, even now
And just 'cause they call themselves experts
It doesn't mean sweet fuck all...
They've got the permanent press
Homes with a stable address
And they've got excitement
And life by the fistful
But you've got the needle
I guess that's the point of it allEmbed
