Strength Through Music Lyrics
A peculiar thing happened to me this morning
Just as I reached into my pocket to find it empty of any sou
I saw two broken twigs on the ground
Shaped like the Greek letters "F" and "S"
"F" and "S", Helium, "F" and "S"
These are the chemical symbols for Iron and Sulfur
It was a sign, Iâ€™m sure, for me to make gold from these two elements
I have been working all day
Over these hellish flames

Locked in his bedroom
He saw the world
A web of answers
And cumshot girls

Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick

Don't bother blaming
His games and guns
He's only playing
And boys just want to have fun
He picked a soundtrack
And packed his bag
He hung his walkman
Around his neck

Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick

It's so simple
The way they fall
No cry, no whimper
No sound at all

Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick
