Salvation LyricsCome on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation
Ooh-oh-oh
There's a neighborhood called Blackhawk
Where all the rich people hide
I was down on my luck, workin' for the Salvation Army
The shelter's where I reside
Every day we drive in to Blackhawk and we pick up the offerings
Microwaves, refrigerators for the suffering
Come on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation
Ooh-oh-oh
I can't believe these people live like kings
Hidden estates and diamond rings
I'm a rat out on a mission
I'm in your front yard under suspicion
Come on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation
Ooh-oh-ohEmbed
