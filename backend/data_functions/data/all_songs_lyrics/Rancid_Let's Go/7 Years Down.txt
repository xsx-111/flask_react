7 Years Down LyricsThere's a place where I like to go
When I got no food or I got no shelter
It's a house where I can get away
For maybe 3 days
To get off the drink and stay off the haze
Who's the opposition?
I'm 7 years down
The human spirit prevails
Yeah I'm down down down
Woke up in the bushes 6:30 tuesday morning
With a unopened Heineken, a head that was burning
For 7 years I walked the same path
Dreams of being loved was all I ever had
Who's the opposition?
I'm 7 years down
The human spirit prevails
Yeah I'm down down downEmbed
