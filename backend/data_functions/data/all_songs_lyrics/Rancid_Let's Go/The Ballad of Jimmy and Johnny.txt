The Ballad of Jimmy and Johnny LyricsJimmy & Johnny are two friends of mine
Skinheads what they claim
Outside similarities but they don't feel the same
Johnny thinks Jimmy's a mod
And Jimmy thinks Johnny's a punk
Jimmy listens to ska and Johnny likes Last Resort
Jimmy and Johnny in the trenches
Went down tonight
Drinking Guinness and a fight, fight, fight
Once you're in the middle everything's alright
Skinhead tats and a Fred Perry
There's a war in the cemetery
Start to fight, start to drinking
What the fuck were they thinking?
Jimmy and Johnny tell me what you're seeing
Jimmy and Johnny tell me what you're seeing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jimmy had his two-tone coat
On the back of his scooter that night
Johnny had a jacked up Chevy
That could blow you right off the line
Skinhead tats and a Fred Perry
There's a war in the cemetery
Start to fight, start to drinking
What the fuck were they thinking?
Jimmy and Johnny tell me what you're seeing
Jimmy and Johnny tell me what you're seeing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
