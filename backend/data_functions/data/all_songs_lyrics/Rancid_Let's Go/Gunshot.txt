Gunshot LyricsEverybody wants to follow, but nobody wants to pay
No one likes a show off, but they do anyway
I was kept up and knocked down to my knees
Shame blamed for my guilty pleas
Gunshot
Gunshot
Gunshot through my heart
Searchlights like guides, I can’t deal with the heat
Everything’s imperative, but I can’t fuckin' keep
I know where you are, and I never cared
I’ve got ideas, but no decision
Gunshot
Gunshot
Gunshot through my heartEmbed
