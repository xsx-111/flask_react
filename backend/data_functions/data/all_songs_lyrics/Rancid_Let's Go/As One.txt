As One LyricsWar between races, war between lines
War between something that was deep inside
You were wrong all along, I was right you lied
'U' to the 'N' to the 'I', 'T', 'Y''
Straight down too late can't kick the feelin'
Lookin' from the bottom I can't see the ceiling
Shots rang out in the Oakland winter
Can't stand alone you can't stand together
As one
As one
As one
As one
No matter what you do they'll try to divide you
Way down down down the scale
With a hook you're anchored to the gates of hell
Once you realize that it was so simple
What you're given you can't take with you
I asked somebody if they had the same vision
He said, "Yeah, I had the same vision"
As one
As one
As one
As one
War between races, war between lines
War between something that was deep inside
You were wrong all along, I was right you lied
'U' to the 'N' to the 'I', 'T', 'Y''
Straight down too late can't kick the feelin'
Lookin' from the bottom I can't see the ceiling
Shots rang out in the Oakland winter
Can't stand alone you can't stand together
As one
As one
As one
As oneEmbed
