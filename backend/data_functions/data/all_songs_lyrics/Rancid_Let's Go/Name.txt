Name LyricsYou don't know my name
Man, you don't know my name
You don't know my name
Man, you don't know my name
You don't know my name
Man, you don't know my name
Paint a number on my head
Work me until I'm dead
I can't believe I've wasted
All of these years I've tasted
A million days and nights and pain and struggle
All for what I ask? All the hate and trouble
You don't know my name
Man, you don't know my name
You don't know my name
Man, you don't know my name
Punch drunk from the punch clock
Opportunity never gonna knock
No more  blue collar
All the unions getting smaller
A million nights and all the pain and struggle
All for what I ask? All the hate and trouble
You don't know my name
Man, you don't know my name
You don't know my name
Man, you don't know my nameEmbed
