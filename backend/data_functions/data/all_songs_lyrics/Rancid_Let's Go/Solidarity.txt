Solidarity LyricsSolidarity, love and unity
Set me free with a bullet in a gun
Solidarity, love and unity
Set me free with a bullet in a gun
You said it was nothing
I knew it was something
It was no surprise then
I saw you crying
About you
Said what went wrong
About you
Said you can't go on
About you
Said it's a long time gone
About you
Now your life's too long
Solidarity, love and unity
Set me free with a bullet in a gun
Solidarity, love and unity
Set me free with a bullet in a gun
Didn't see it coming
Your fears went hunting
9 millimeter
Stops you running
About you
Said the pressure's on
About you
Now you can't go wrong
About you
Now you're long time gone
About you
So what went wrong?
Solidarity, love and unity
Set me free with a bullet in a gun
Solidarity, love and unity
Set me free with a bullet in a gunEmbed
