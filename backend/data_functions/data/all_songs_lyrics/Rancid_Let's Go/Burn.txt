Burn LyricsThirteen red and white stripes flying
White for skin and red for dying
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hell
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hell
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hell
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hell
Thirteen red and white stripes flying
White for skin and red for dying
Thirteen red and white stripes flying
White for skin and red for dying
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hell
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hell
Oh, I'm in hell
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hell
One cannot walk on through
And not feel like one is in hellEmbed
