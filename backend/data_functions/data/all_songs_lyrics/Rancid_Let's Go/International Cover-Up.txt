International Cover-Up LyricsBack down, no back down coming up
Rise up, no rise up showing up
Lock down, no lock down coming up
International cover up
Back down, no back down coming up
Rise up, no rise up showing up
Lock down, no lock down coming up
International cover up
What about the state of union?
What about the games they're using?
What about the kids that don't matter?
What about a general strike?
You don't know what it is like
What it's like, what it's like
Back down, no back down coming up
Rise up, no rise up showing up
Lock down, no lock down coming up
International cover up
Back down, no back down coming up
Rise up, no rise up showing up
Lock down, no lock down coming up
International cover up
What about the cage getting rattled?
What about the eternal battle?
What about the kids who are dreaming?
What about the kids who got stuck?
You don't know what it is like
What it's like, what it's like
Back down, no back down coming up
Rise up, no rise up showing up
Lock down, no lock down coming up
International cover up
Back down, no back down coming up
Rise up, no rise up showing up
Lock down, no lock down coming up
International cover upEmbed
