Motorcycle Ride LyricsIf you wanna make a move then you better come in
It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin
Living and dying and the stories that are true
The secret to a good life is knowing when you're through
You were wrong all along, it's gone it's over
Too late to run for cover
Said, backed into a corner, you're fit to die
Can't help me cause I'm lonely inside
Sarah ceased existing long before she died
A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle ride
Sarah went down and tripped and fell
Lost her footing on the way to hell
She said that's okay today all right
Said today I played and survived
If you wanna make a move then you better come in
It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin
If you wanna make a move then you better come in
It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin
Sarah ceased existing long before she died
A fifth of bourbon and a motorcycle rideEmbed
