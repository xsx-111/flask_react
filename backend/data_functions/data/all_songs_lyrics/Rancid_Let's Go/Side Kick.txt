Side Kick Lyrics
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
My name is Tim, I'm a lesser-known character
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
Fighting crime in the streets together
Down in Oakland, off of West Grand
St. Joseph relief, poor program
A good place where good people get food, yeah
Help your fellow man, a good thing to do, yeah
Government agency said, be afraid of me
I'll shut your doors down and it won't phase me
Wolverine came through, left the agent for dead
Opened up the doors back up, everyone was fed

I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
My name is Tim, I'm a lesser-known character
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
Fighting crime in the streets together
Do not bill them, abandoned buildings
It's nice to sleep when you got a ceiling
Neighborhood watch said, "we gotta put a stop, yeah
Can't have people livin' for free, call the cops, yeah"
Here comes the SWAT team and an M-16
They'll shoot the walls in, destroy the buildings
Wolverine was sad and it made him mad
Every single cop got a bullet in the head
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
My name is Tim, I'm a lesser-known character
I had a dream I was a vigilante's side kick
Fighting crime in the streets togetherEmbed
