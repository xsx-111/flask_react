Nihilism LyricsCome into the union district
Drive down on Sharmon Palms
White ghettos paint a picture
Broken homes and broken bones
I was so full of scotch I could not stand up
I was hittin the shots and I moved to a cup
Release me from moral assumption
Total rejection, total destruction
Nihilistic feelings start moving
If you try really hard, you'll see right through them
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
Come into the union district
Drive down on Sharmon Palms
White ghettos paint a picture
Broken homes and broken bones
Walkin' a path of self destruction
Not affected by the repercussions
Lady on the billboard offer me a drink
Said not right now I need time to think
Nihilistic feelings are moving
If I try really hard, I'll see right through them
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
Nihilism!
I was so full of scotch I could not stand up (Nihilism!)
I was hittin' the shots and I moved to a cup (Nihilism!)
We'll I've come into union district, an you drive down Sharmon Palms (Nihilism!)
White ghettos paint a picture, broken homes and broken bones (Nihilism!)
Yeah, broken bones!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!1Embed
