Dope Sick Girl LyricsThis song's about a girl who ripped me off
She was dope sick
Dope sick girl
Hit and run, she took my money
Eighty-seven dollars gone, now she's running
How was I, I to know
That girl could take my heart everywhere she go
Dope sick girl
Got a rig and a ride, she's got no freedom
Little demon gonna hide inside
She gotta's feed 'em
How was I, I to know
That girl could take my heart everywhere she go
Everywhere, everywhere she go
Dope sick girl
There she was at the methadone clinic
Drank a cup, called it a base coat, swore not to get back in it
How was I, I to know
That girl could take my heart everywhere she go
Dope sick girl
Got a rig and a ride to New York City
Gonna run away, gotta watch it burn
In the heart of New York City
How was I, I to know
That girl could take my heart everywhere she go
Everywhere, everywhere she go
Dope sick girlEmbed
