Midnight LyricsNo doubt about it, that's right
No doubt about it, come on
No doubt about it right now
No doubt about it, that's right
No doubt about it
Midnight, I know where I am
That's right, I know where I'm going
Shut down, vacant city
Ghost town, all the tensions rising
Kick kick, gonna kick the ground and
Look look, look around and
Affairs, affairs of the nation
When the pressure came down
Sustained authority
When the pressure came down
Sustained authority
Midnight, I know I can
That's right, I ain't broken
Shut down, a vacant city
Ghost town, all the tensions rising
Kick kick, kick the door in
Look look, look around there
For a favorite 
When the pressure came down
Sustained authority
When the pressure came down
Sustained authorityEmbed
