St. Mary LyricsShe's got her ticket and she's waiting at the station
She's got to get away, get away as far as she can
Her problems will arise as sure as the sun does shine
She's got to get used to life living on the lam
Now Mary's out the door with a loaded .44 in her hand
Shooting down the law that shot down her dear departed man
When I last saw her she was lookin' troubled
She said this is the night, I'm gonna be alright
She took the Greyhound in to Salinas
I got a letter then that she dropped out of sight
Now Mary's out the door with a loaded .44 in her hand
Shooting down the law that shot down her dear departed man
Shrouded in anger
Encompassed by pain
He was your best friend
And you'll never ever ever see him again
Now Mary's out the door with a loaded .44 in her hand
Shooting down the law that shot down her dear departed manEmbed
