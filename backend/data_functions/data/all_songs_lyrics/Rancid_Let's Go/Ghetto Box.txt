Ghetto Box LyricsGhetto box talkin' (time for the back streets)
Cocaine's rockin' (time for the back streets)
And I'm not finished talkin' (time for the back streets)
And the PUNX say stop it (time for the back streets)
Let go of my hand
I don't understand
Streetlights comin' through
Time for the back streets with you!
Cadallic rollin' (time for the back streets)
Police are patrolin' (time for the back streets)
Well I see a fellow going (time for the back streets)
Mississippi highway (time for the back streets)
Ripped a man apart with a K-9 unit
Nazi cops fuck you!
Time for the backstreets with you
Ghetto Box talkin' (time for the backstreets)
Cocaine's rockin' (time for the backstreets)
And the four were stalkin' (time for the backstreets)
And the PUNX say stop it! (time for the back streets)
Let go of my hand
I don't understand
Street lights comin' through
Time for the back streets with you!Embed
