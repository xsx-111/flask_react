Radio Lyrics
Never fell in love until I fell in love with you
Never know what a good time was until I had a good time with you
If you wanna get the feeling and you wanna get it right
Then the music gotta be loud
For when the music hits I feel no pain at all

You know
Warm summer night I was drinking with my dad
He tried to give me the love that I never had
But he gave more love to his bottle of wine
So I had to go out and find love of another kind

Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go

The Radio Clash, Magnificent 7
I was a choir boy, you showed me no heaven
Two tools surely lost
No remorse ignoring the cost
Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Don't 'cha know?

Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Oh I got a place, oh I got a place, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
When I got the music, oh I got a place to goEmbed
