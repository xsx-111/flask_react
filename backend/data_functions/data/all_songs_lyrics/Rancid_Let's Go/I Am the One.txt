I Am the One LyricsI'm the one who's got a religion
I'm the one, I've got a date with my knife
I'm the one who's got a religion
I'm the one, I've got a date with my knife
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Are you gonna be ready to use it
If you hesitate they'll pursue it
Put the gun to your dome no question
Now the holy ghost's in question
What about the banks, when they say go
Standing at the top then they let go
Standing can't take can't take that time
When I try sometime I can't stay high
I'm the one who's got a religion
I'm the one, I've got a date with my knife
I'm the one who's got a religion
I'm the one, I've got a date with my knife
Are you gonna be ready to use it
If you hesitate they'll pursue it
Good and evil came from above
Death peace eternal love
Bleeding at the gates and I can't come in
Courage that abates a life of sin
Sure that it holds and it holds no others
With the lies of the brave the kid don't matter
I'm the one who's got a religion
I'm the one, I've got a date with my knife
I'm the one who's got a religion
I'm the one, I've got a date with my knifeEmbed
