Gave It Away LyricsI  too many for too, too long
January was cold as fuck
Set it aside, 
While all the time you gave it away
You gave it away
You gave it away
You gave it away
I seen your finish
I saw your at the start
I remember you
Straight from the heart
 what you say
You gave me your heart
Now you're taking it
You gave it away
You gave it away
You gave it awayEmbed
