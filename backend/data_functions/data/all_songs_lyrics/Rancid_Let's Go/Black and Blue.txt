Black and Blue LyricsI started watchin' them all down the line
Keep steppin' and rejectin' all the time
They try to pull me in
Can't let that happen again
They try to do it again all on me
Sedation through the nation
We're screaming black and blue
Intoxication of a generation
We're screaming black and blue
The blind leading the blind
They told me I was dumb
They said their security system was too big to outrun
I broke away and I'm never goin' back
For all the souls they broke
Mine never cracked
Sedation through the nation
We're screaming black and blue
Intoxication of a generation
We're screaming black and blueEmbed
