Harry Bridges LyricsBloody Thursday was July 5th, the pigs killed three workers
Harry Bridges grabbed the mic
The city shut down July 6th, the workers outraged
It was a general strike
The media claimed that the commies
Were taking over and some believed it was true
Three uncompromising strikes paved the way
Minneapolis, SF and Toledo
Over and over again
The doors are locked and the windows are broken
Over and over again
The doors are locked and the windows are broken
Eddie worked for General Motors and he swore
That he'd never lose his job again
A union man who owned his own home
In beautiful Flint, Michigan
Eddie lost his job and Eddie lost his wife
And so Eddie lost his self esteem
Last time I saw Eddie
He was living in the trailer park again
Over and over again
The doors are locked and the windows are broken
Over and over again
The doors are locked and the windows are broken
I believe Eddie forgave too much too soon
I got a letter about Eddie and it was bad news
Over and over again
The doors are locked and the windows are broken
Over and over again
The doors are locked and the windows are brokenEmbed
