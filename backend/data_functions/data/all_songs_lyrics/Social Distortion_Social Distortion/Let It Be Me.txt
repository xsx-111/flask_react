Let It Be Me LyricsI've been in love, but now I'm waiting
Don't ever want to worry about a thing
I sit at home and I wonder
Will I rise or will I go under

Let it be me-if you're lonely
Let it be me-your one and only
Let it be me-to satify you
Let it be me-if your feelin' blue
I've seen you around but you don't know me
I've watched your life but can't always see
I'll try and I'll try girl to love you
And when we die you will have loved too

You know your friends talk bad about me
Your folks say it's not suppose to be
You know girl your life is going by fast
Try to make it last
