Sick Boys LyricsSick-boy, in his faded blue jeans
Sick-boy, black leather jacket scene
Sick-boy, he's always in trouble
With the law don't ya know...
Sick-boy, he carries a switchblade knife
Sick-boy, likes to get into fights
Sick-boy, he'll go drinkin'
With the boys all night long

Sick boys-nananana
Sick boys-ohwayoh
Sick boys-nananana
Sick boys-ohwayoh
Sick boys
Sick-boy, he rides a big motorbike
Sick-boy, he combs his hair up just right
Sick-boy, with tattoos up and
Down his arms, don't ya know...
Sick-boy, he's got a girl wrapped around his arm
Sick-boy, with his street-like charm
Sick-boy, he'll make love to her
All night long, don't ya know...
