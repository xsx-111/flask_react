Drug Train Lyrics
It'll take you as high as the heavens
It'll take you to the depths of hell
It'll make you friends, it'll take your friends
Who will never live to tell

Drug train, drug train
Drug train, drug train

The train's first stop is pleasure
The second stop is fun
But in a jail cell baby or a hospital bed
You'll need hope 'cuz you ain't got none

The train passes through the graveyard
May the loved ones rest in peace
For the last stop baby is a violent crash
And hard times they never cease

Drug train, drug train
Drug train, drug trainEmbed
