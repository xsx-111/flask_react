Story of My Life LyricsHigh school seemed like such a blur
I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections
And in class I dreamed all day
Of a rock 'n' roll weekend
And the girl in the front of the room
So close yet so far y'know she never seemed to notice
That this silly schoolboy crush
Wasn't just pretend

Life goes by so fast
You only want to do what you think is right
Close your eyes and then it's past;
Story of my life
And I went down my old neighborhood
The faces have all changed there's no one left to talk to
And the pool hall I loved as a kid
Is now a 7-11
I went downtown to look for a job
I had no training, no experience to speak of
I looked at the holes in my jeans
And turned and headed back
Life goes by so fast
You only want to do what you think is right
Close your eyes and then it's past;
Story of my life
And good times come and good times go
I only wish the good times would last a little longer
And I think about the good times we had
And why they had to end
So I sit at the edge of my bed
I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song
Thinkin' about what you're doin' now
And when you're coming back

Life goes by so fast
You only want to do what you think is right
Close your eyes and then it's past;
