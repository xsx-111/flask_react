A Place in My Heart LyricsWell I saw her today
Oh God I miss her smile
A pleasant memory
Of the things in life worthwhile
The things worthwhile

We used to walk and we used to talk
We used to laugh and we used to cry
And there will always be a place in my heart for her
Well I thought of her today
Of years together spent
A pleasant memory
Of places that we went
The places we went
Well I saw her today
Oh God I miss her smile
A pleasant memory
Of things in life worthwhile
Things worthwhile
We used to walk and we used to talk
We used to laugh and we used to cry
And there will always be a place in my heart for youEmbed
