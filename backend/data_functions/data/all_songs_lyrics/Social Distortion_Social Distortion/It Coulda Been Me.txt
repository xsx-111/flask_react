It Coulda Been Me LyricsI got friends who are in prison
Friends who are dead
I'm gonna tell ya something
That I've often said
You know these things that happen
That's just the way it's supposed to be
And I can't help but wonder
Don't ya know it coulda been me
Well, I had me a good girl
Her kisses sweeter than wine
And I had always hoped
That someday I'd make her mine
But she ran off and married
That's just the way it's supposed to be
And I can't help but wonder
Don't ya know it coulda been me
Well the junkie cop's on First Street
Sticks a needle in his arm
No, he never meant to do
Anyone no harm
But he's buried six feet deep
That's just the way it's supposed to be
And I can't help but wonder
Don't ya know it coulda been me
I had me a good girl
Her kisses sweeter than wine
And I had always hoped
That someday I'd make her mine
And I can't help but wonder
Don't ya know it coulda been me
Coulda been me. (x8)
Coulda been...
Should've been...
