How Long Is the Night? Lyrics
If we run far away, think we will ever die?
We'll throw these books
(In the fire)
Can you stop the train?
Cause it some delay?
The change machine lied
And it's too late
(To scream)

"How long is the night?"
It's never over, it's never over
And the ribbon is tied
The card was never read
It's never over, it's never over
The ribbon was crimson
The color of the night

Can you see the handwriting on the walls?
And on the autumn leaves that fall
Ooh-ooh, what are we gonna do?
Trees are giving up, on us
The needle and the thread
Stitch us to the branch
And the night never ends
What are we gonna do?
The trees are giving up, on us
The needle and the thread
Won't stitch, won't stitch us to the branch
And the night, it never ends
The night, it never ends
It never ends
The night, it never ends
I will never sleep again
(I, I, I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again
(I, I, I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again
(I, I, I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again
(I, I, I'll never even close my eyes)

If the sun's on its way
Then, we will never die
And we'll follow these tracks
(To the sight)
Now the lungs collapse
Air is getting thin
All breath expired
Is too late
(To heal?)

How long is the night?
It's never over, it's never over
And the ribbon is tied
The card was never read
It's never over, it's never over
The ribbon was crimson
The color of the night
It's all I ever see
(Anymore)
But the day looked so bright
(Bright)
In the pictures
In the photo album that you gave me
(It's all I have)
To live for
(Live for)

I'm falling down, I'm falling down
And you're not there to break my fall
I shut my eyes when you're around
I hold my breath to kill the sound
I'm falling down, I'm falling down
And you're not here to catch my fall
I shut my eyes when you're around
I hold my breath to kill the sound
I'm falling down, I'm falling down
And you're not here to catch my fallEmbed
