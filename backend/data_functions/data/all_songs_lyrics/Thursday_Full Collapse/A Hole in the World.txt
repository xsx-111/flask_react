A Hole in the World LyricsIn this blackout, inertia will hold our thoughts...
And the exit sign offers no light to see by
Can we cast our shadows alone in the dark?
I can't see without you
When the world is crashing down
Part with it, start again
When the world is crashing down
These notes will fold themselves
Standing at the margin's edge
To see where the daybreak ends
You can find compassion here
But the page turns too fast
We fell in this hole that opened up
Giving up on hope
Living without love
We still type black lines
When the world is crashing down
These notes will fold themselves
Adjust the aperture to focus on the negative
Like phosphors in the darkroom ignite
Like dodging faces in the corner of the print
Frame by frame, this hole is opening up
And we fall in
Love is love is love is love is love
(There is no such thing as whole)
Is love is love is love is love is love
(There is a hole in the world)Embed
