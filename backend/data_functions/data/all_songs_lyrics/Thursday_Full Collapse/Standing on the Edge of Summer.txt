Standing on the Edge of Summer Lyrics
In this room I'm sitting by your side
'Cause it rains for hours and the phone is off its hook
Standing on the edge
Casting lots to set me up before you knock me down
Off the summer's edge and drown me

We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost
In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades
(one breath, one step could knock it all down)
But you lead with your eyes and you give it away
(decide, design to cut from the clouds)
When the people you love get lost in the shuffle
(when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts)
You let it go and then you fold

So we stay on the open road
We drive for hours and still no end in sight at all
Driving in your car, miss the stop sign, fall in love, just to get knocked out
Off the summer's edge and drown me

We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost
In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades
(one breath, one step could knock it all down)
But you lead with your eyes and you give it away
(decide, design to cut from the clouds)
When the people you love get lost in the shuffle
(when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts)
Pull your punches and burn with your cigarettes
Pulled like a punch and burnt like a cigarette?
