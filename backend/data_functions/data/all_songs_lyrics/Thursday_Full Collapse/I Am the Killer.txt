I Am the Killer Lyrics
Tuesday wakes up silent
And there aren't enough pills to sleep
(Cut out)
Like a miswired shortwave radio
It's over, but nothing can change to make this right
(Can you cut it?)
When you live in a nightmare
It's written all over your face

And in the short time
You're never the same again
The distance is streamlined
Between decision and defense

Disorient the senses
Loss of identity
No one to trust
No one to trust

(Life runs through this blade)
I am no killer
But I still hide my face
In the coming days
I wake up every morning
From the same dream
(Kill it)
But you can't change the letters when the ink dries
I woke up on the sidewalk and everything just changed
(Kill it)
Now the lights are blinking, but I can't see anything

(Life runs through this blade)
I am no killer
But I still hide my face
In the coming days
(Life runs through this blade)
I am no killer
(Sign still points north)

Everything's falling apart
Everything's falling apart
Everything's falling apart
Crumpled paper, crushed tin cans
Broken bottles
Paper scraps
We're all the same
We're all the same
Paper scraps
We're all the same
And we're all the same
We all look the same
(We all look the same)
(We all look the same)
I am the killer
And in the short time
You're never the same again
The distance is streamlined
Between decision and-
(Setting the way, never forget, never)Embed
