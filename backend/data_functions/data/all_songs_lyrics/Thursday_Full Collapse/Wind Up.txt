Wind Up Lyrics
Just ahead I see you winding up
And you're dressing this a color on the edge of fire
Until these tightened strides
They march in time again
I don't know where I will go
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know if I will cut through
I don't know
I don't know
If my heart will beat without you
(Guiding it)

Winding up
Leading me
Winding up to explode

It's the sound of your racing heart
That beats in time with every start
Reaches up and across the sky
It makes you want to rise
Falling to pieces
I can't let go
Tearing apart your lies
Wanting to live
It's the sound of your shotgun pulse
Beating over and over in your silent halls
It's a thought that keeps us alive
It makes us want to try
Falling to pieces
I can't let go
Tearing apart your lies
I want to live
(A scream to guide me through my life)
Winding up
Leading me
Winding up to what you can not unwind
This side of you and if it's taken away
You won't know what to do
You're stretching to meet expectations that you will never reach

And now it's far too late
And now it's far too late
Far too late
To ever leave this cold
Giving up
Marching in time with their drums
I'm letting go
(Of everything I once loved)Embed
