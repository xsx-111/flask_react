Cold Ethyl LyricsOne thing I miss
Is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss
We met last night
Making love by the refrigerator light
Ethyl, Ethyl, let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl, Ethyl, come and freeze me with your charms
One thing, no lie
Ethyl's frigid as an Eskimo Pie
She's cool in bed
And she ought to be, 'cause Ethyl's dead
Ethyl, Ethyl, let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl, Ethyl, come and freeze me with your charms
Come on, Cold Ethyl
Freeze me, babe
One thing, it's true
Cold Ethyl, I am stuck on you
And everything is my way
Ethyl don't have much to say
Ethyl, Ethyl, let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl, Ethyl, come and freeze me with your charms
Come here, Cold Ethyl
What makes you so cold?
Ooh, so cold...ooh...
Cold Ethyl, Cold, Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl, Cold, Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl, Cold, Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl, Cold, Cold Ethyl
If I live till ninety-seven
You'll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven
‘Cause you're cool, you're ice
Cold Ethyl, you're my paradiseEmbed
