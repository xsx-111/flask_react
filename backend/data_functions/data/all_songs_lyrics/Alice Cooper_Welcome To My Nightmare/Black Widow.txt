Black Widow Lyrics
These words he speaks are true, we're all humanary stew if
We don't pledge allegiance to The Black Widow
The horror that he brings, the horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings, the Black Widow
Our minds will be his toy
And every girl and boy will learn to be employed by the Black Widow
Love me, yes, we love me, love him, yes, we love him
Love me, yes, we love me, love him, yes, we love him
He sits upon his throne and picks at all the bones of his
Husbands and his wives he's devoured
He stares with a gleam, with a laugh so obscene
At the virgins and the children he's deflowered
Love me, yes, we love me, love him, yes, we love him
Love me, yes, we love me, love him, yes, we love him

Our thoughts are hot and crazed, our brains are webbed in haze
Of mindless senseless daze, the Black Widow
These words he speaks are true, we're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to the Black Widow
