Cold Ethyl (Alternate version) LyricsAh, One thing I miss is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss
We met last night making love by the refrigerator light
Ethyl Ethyl come and squeeze me in your arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charm
One thing, no lie, Ethyl frigid as an eskimo pie
An` she's cool in bed, well she oughta be 'cause Ethyl's dead
Ethyl, Ethyl come and squeeze me in your...
Ethyl, Ethyl come and freeze me in your arms
One thing, it's true, Cold Ethyl I am stuck on you
And everything is my way, Ethyl don't have much to say
Ethyl, Ethyl come and squeeze me in your charms
Ethyl, Ethyl come and freeze me with your arms
Come here Cold Ethyl
What makes you so cold?
Ooh so cold
Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl
Cold Cold Ethyl
If I live 'til ninety-seven
You'll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven
'Cause you're cool
You're ice
Cold Ethyl
You're my paradiseEmbed
