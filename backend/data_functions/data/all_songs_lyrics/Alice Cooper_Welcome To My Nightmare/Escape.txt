Escape LyricsPaint on my cruel or happy face
I hide me behind it
It takes me inside another place
Where no-one can find it
Escape
I get out when I can
I escape
Anytime I can
Yes, I'll escape
I'm crying in my beer
Come on, let's escape
Just get me out of here
Don't get me wrong, don't get me right
I'm not like you are
When I get home from work at night
I'm blacker and bluer
So I escape
I get out when I can
Yeah, I escape
Anytime I can
Letâ€™s all escape
I'm crying in my beer
Escape
Just get me out of here
Where am I running to?
There's no place to go
Just put on my makeup
And get me to the show
Yeah
Escape
Yeah
What are ya waiting for?
My doctor said just come around
And you'll be taken care of
And while he ran my problems down
I stole his mascara
That's how I escape
I get out when I can
I escape
Any way I can
I escape
I'm crying in my beer
Let's escape
Just get me out of here
Escape
Let's get out while we can
Escape
Any way we can
Come on let's escape
Nobody wants us around here anyway
Escape
What are we waiting for?
Escape
Escape
Escape
Come on outta there, let's escape
Escape
Escape
Escape
