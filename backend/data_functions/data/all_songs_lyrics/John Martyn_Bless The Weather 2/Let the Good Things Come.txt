Let the Good Things Come LyricsI wish I had walked down, every road I ever set my eyes upon
I wish I could take care, of every dream I ever set my heart upon
I wish I could step free, of every weight I ever leaned my weight upon
Lay low, let the good things come
Lay low, let the good things come
Wish I could walk out, of every scene of every game I ever played
I wish I could move on, from every place in every town I ever stayed
I wish I could let go, and hold on to anything I wanted to
Let go, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come;
Lay low, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come
I wish I could see you, and bear the times and long the days to waste away
I wish I could be you, and see the world another way, another way
I wish you could get through, to every face and every friend I ever knew
Let go, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come
Lay low, let the good things come...Embed
