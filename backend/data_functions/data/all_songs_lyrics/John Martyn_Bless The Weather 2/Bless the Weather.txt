Bless the Weather LyricsTime after time, I held it
Just to watch it die
Line after line, I loved it
Just to watch it cry
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you home
Wave after wave, I watched it
Just to watch it turn
Day after day, I cooled it
Just to watch it burn
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you home
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away
Pain after pain I stood in
Just to see how it would feel
Rain after rain I stood in
Just to make it real
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the day you go away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away
Time after time, I held it
Just to watch it die
Line after line, I held it
Just to watch it cry
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you awayEmbed
