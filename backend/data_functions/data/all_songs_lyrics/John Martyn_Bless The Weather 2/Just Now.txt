Just Now LyricsSearching back through the friends I've known
Sometimes sad for the way it's grown
Ranging up and ranging out
And trying to change my ways about
There's a place in the leaf, a place in the bow
I've found a place for me
Just now, just now
Just now
Moving on with every word
Moving with all the words I heard
Turning the wheel as fast as I can
Turning the wheel to make me a man
There's a man in the moon, a man in the sea
Growing strong, there's a man in me
Just now just now
Just now
No behind and no before;
There's no need to worry any more
Happy then, happy now
There's always a way to get happy somehow
Friend on the road, friend in the home;
A better friend than I've ever known
Just now, just now
Just now...
Searching back for the friends I've known
Sometimes sad for the way it's grown
Changing up and ranging out
And trying to change my ways about
There's a place in the leaf, a place in the bow;
I've found a place for me
Just now, just now
Just now, just now...2Embed
