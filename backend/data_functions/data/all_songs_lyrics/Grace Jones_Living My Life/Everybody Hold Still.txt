Everybody Hold Still LyricsI knew I shouldn't have left the appartement
I knew I should've stayed in watching TV
If I'd looked at the moon
And looked at my stars
I wouldn't be in this mess I'm in right now
I should've known when my car would not get started
It should've clicked when indecision read its question mark
If I'd ran back for the phone
But instead I let it ring
I wouldn't be in this mess I'm in right now
Everybody hold still
Nobody gets hurt
I could've left all my cash and talen a credit card
I should've saidf 'Don't wear no jewelery you're looking fine'
If I'd ran back for the phone
But instead I let it ring
I wouldn't be in this miss I'm in right now
Everybody hold still
Nobody gets hurt
Please don't take all of my money mister
Don't take my money all money, money
Everybody hold still
Nobody gets hurtEmbed
