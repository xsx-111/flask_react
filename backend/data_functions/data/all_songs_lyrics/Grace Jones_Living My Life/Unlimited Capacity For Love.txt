Unlimited Capacity For Love LyricsThe end's not in sight, it's gone way too far
This could turn out another unwinning war
It wasn't inherited, certainly not a joke
So many human hearts, hanging in hope
Unlimited capacity for love
Unlimited capacity for love
And now I must add another to love in my life
It's one thing to say, to do is another. If I'm
Capable of adapting without pressured expense
In a schizoid society in a classic moral sense
Unlimited capacity for love
Unlimited capacity for love
How young I am now, stop counting the weeks
We're safe from the void, where they're still counting sheep
Put the phone to the floor, you'll hear my heart beat
Some people get married, but I'll never cheat
Unlimited capacity for love
Unlimited capacity for love
The end's not in sight, it's gone way too far
This could turn out another unwinning war
It wasn't inherited, certainly not a joke
So many human hearts, hanging in hope
Unlimited capacity for love (repeat, fade)Embed
