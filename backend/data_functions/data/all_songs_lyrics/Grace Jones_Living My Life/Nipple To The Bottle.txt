Nipple To The Bottle LyricsColour and warmth came into your world
It makes me crazy
When you don't get what you want
You scream and you shout
You're still a baby
Don't give me a line
Keep the lid on the bottle this time
I'm still a lady
I won't do it tonight
I won't do it tonight
No way baby
I won't give in and I won't feel guilty
Rant and rave to manipulate me
From the nipple to the bottle
Never satisfied
From the nipple to the bottle
Now the cow must die
Power and wealth surrendering myself
It ain't easy
Embarassing my store by opening up my door
When it's breezy
You showed me your force
Exaggerated stamina and energy
No place for that
No place for that
It's not that easy
I won't give in and I won't feel guilty
Rant and rave to manipulate me
From the nipple to the bottle
Never satisfied
From the nipple to the bottle
Now the cow must die
You ain't gon get it, I ain't gon give it
You ain't gon get it, I ain't gon give it
Colour and warmth came into your world
It makes me crazy
When you don't get what you want
You scream and you shout
You're still a lady
Don't give me a line
Keep the lid on the bottle this time
I'm still a lady
I won't do it tonight
I won't do it tonight
No where baby
I won't give in and I won't feel guilty
Rant and rave to manipulate me
From the nipple to the bottle
Never satisfied
From the nipple to the bottle
Now the cow must die
I ain't gon give it, you ain't gon get it
If I don't give it, how you gonna get it?
I ain't gon give it, you ain't gon get it
If I don't give it, how you gonna get it? (fade)1Embed
