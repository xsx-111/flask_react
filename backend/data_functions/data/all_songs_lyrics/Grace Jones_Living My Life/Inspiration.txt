Inspiration LyricsI'm hoping to find a new source of information
I'll step off the line
I've been searching for some inspiration
The thing I wrote off as false came true
Another gift of mine with love from me to you
Don't be intimidated, I don't want to be the first one
It's a problem calculated
I've been searching for some inspiration
The thing I wrote off as false came true
Another gift of mine with love from me to you
Stop it now I've been killing myself
I've been willing myself
To give back all what he gave
Another turnstile bare to the bone turning alone
Hope he's turning in his grave
My source of satisfaction from laying it on the line
You could be the one too
I've been searching for some inspiration
The thing I wrote off as false came true
Another gift of mine with love from me to you
Stop it now I've been killing myself
I've been willing myself
To give back all what he gave
Another turnstile bare to the bone turning alone
Hope he's turning in his grave
I'm hoping to find a new source of information
I'll step off the line
I've been searching for some inspiration
Searching for some inspiration. (fade to end)Embed
