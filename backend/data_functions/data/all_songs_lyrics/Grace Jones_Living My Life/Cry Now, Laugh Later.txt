Cry Now, Laugh Later LyricsCry now, Laugh later
It's time now to return the favor
Cry now, laugh laugh later
I dont know why I'm laughing
I'm still wet from the rain
I dont know why I'm laughing
I'm still spotted from the stain
I dont know why I'm laughing
I'm burning from the flame
I dont know why I'm laughing
Theres a storm running through my veins
Cry now, laugh later
Cry now, laugh later
Sign out, I'll see you later
Time now to return the favor
You know I ain't lying
Its so unreal on the other side
I'll tell you why I'm crying
Dad's ten grand on a 4 wheel drive
I thought they wanted money
Two thieves as they were passing by
They tied me up so lonely
And took the car out from under my eyes
Cry now, laugh later
Cry now, I'll get you later
I'm just too tired now to return the favor
Cry now laugh later
I dont know why I'm laughing
Immigration breathing down my back
Ain't got no money for a pay off
Stay in jail until they send me back
I dont know why I'm laughing
I'm still hurting from the pain
A foreigner in this hell hole
He ain't never gunna touch me again
Cry now, laugh later
It's time now to return the favor
You'e got me crying now
I'll laugh at you later
Time now to return the favor
I dont know why I'm laughing
I'm still wet from the rain
I dont know why I'm crying
I'm still spotted from the stain
You know I ain't lying
Im burning burning up from the flame
I dont know why I'm laughing
I've got the storm running through my veins
Cry now, laugh later
Baby got to sign out return later
Just too tired now to return the favor
Cry now, laugh later...Embed
