Hey Sandy Lyrics
Jupiter or Thor is perfect. We need Atlas for our long-distance stuff. The Titan will be even better. They shouldn't have cancelled Navaho. Wait till you see our submarines with Polaris⁠—
Attention, all personnel, this is CBTS, phase vehicle pre-count operation will start on my mark in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Hey smilin' strange
You're lookin' happily deranged
Can you settle to shoot me?
Or have you picked your target yet?

Hey Sandy (Ai, ai, ai, ai)
Well, does your dog bite? (Ai, ai, ai, ai)
Hey Sandy

Four feet away
End of speech is the end of the day
But we was only funnin'
But guiltily I thought you had it comin'

Hey Sandy (Ai, ai, ai, ai)
Well, does your dog bite? (Ai, ai, ai, ai)
Hey Sandy

(Ai, ai, ai, ai) Hey Sandy
Well, does your dog bite?
(Ai, ai, ai, ai) Hey Sandy
(Ai, ai, ai, ai) Hey Sandy
Well, does your dog bite?
(Ai, ai, ai, ai) Hey Sandy
