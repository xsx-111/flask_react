Recently
Recently
I acted cool, I asked around
But you could not be seen
I was desperate, indifferent
To what everyone thought
You walked in, I clicked on
You could not refuse
It has to be, we know it now
So get the rocket, light the fuse
Cause recently I kissed you
It's like a dream come true
Recently you're liking me
And I'm really liking you
Never apart, we go around
Siamese, in crazy love
I learned your quirks and called your work
What did I do before you?
Because recently I needed to be
With you all the time
And recently some jealousy
Has creeped into my mind
Recently I noticed
That it's weird to be alone
And recently my friends
They never call me anymore
Recently I'm happier
Being by myself
Recently I'm all alone
But I'm not lonely (Recently)
I'm not lonely (Recently)
I'm not lonely (Recently)
I'm not lonely (Recently)
I'm not lonely (Recently)1Embed
