Saturnine Lyrics
There's only roses in here, you're dissatisfied
It's like a candy store, you're dissatisfied
You want everything, you're dissatisfied
You get everything, you're dissatisfied

Make it mine, all mine, all mine
Here's a double dare
Take home plate if you can
But there won't be anyone there

I see sunshine, you'll be saturnine
I see sunshine, you'll be saturnine

You've got a Hollywood star
Then you freak out
In your Shangri-La
Where you freak out
You got the whole nine yards
But you freak out
Yeah, you freak out

Make it mine, all mine, all mine
Here's a double dare
Take home plate if you can
But there won't be anyone there
I see sunshine, you'll be saturnine
I see sunshine, you'll be saturnine

You can't see the sweet things
You always see the bad

I see sunshine, you'll be saturnine
I see sunshine, you'll be saturnine

You'll be saturnine
You'll be saturnine
