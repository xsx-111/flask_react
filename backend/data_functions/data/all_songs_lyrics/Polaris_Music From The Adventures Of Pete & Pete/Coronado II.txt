Coronado II LyricsIt's kind of a low blow
Not the one I got, but the one you gave
It's really too soon to know
How much of you will there be left for me to save?
Well, he's a scalawag
I have another friend that he did the same thing to
And then he brags
He'll kiss and tell me, kiss and tell me, everytime you do
Monte Carlo
Coronado II
The San Diego Zoo
Or a hundred nights with you won't change my mind
You gonna shine in Chinese (Shiny shine)
Gonna shine in France (Shiny shine)
Shine in Pretoria (You gonna shiny shine)
(Shine around the world)
You're gonna shine almighty shine
You're gonna shine almighty shine
You rang, she called early
You were laughing, and she was asking "Can we still be friends?"
And you like to think some times you're near me
To your Never-Neverland, where the stories never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever end
At Monte Carlo
Coronado II
The San Diego Zoo
Or a hundred nights with you won't change my mind
At Monte Carlo
Coronado II
The San Diego Zoo
Or a hundred nights with you won't change my mind
Won't change my mind
Won't change my mindEmbed
