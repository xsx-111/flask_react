Ashamed of the Story I Told Lyrics
Was it the nothing I said
It's so attractive to be so silent
It keeps the mystery on and it seems
It keeps you hanging on me

Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
There's one big question
I don't know why you must repeat it

Maybe I care a little
Perhaps I'm ashamed of the story I told
But you were so eager
Was it so bad for me to say what you wanna hear

Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
There's one big question
I don't know why you must repeat it

And you'll feel better if I don't speak
And you'll feel better if you don't speak
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
There's one big question
I don't know why you must repeat it
Another letter from home
I don't know why I even read it
There's one big question
I don't know why you must repeat itEmbed
