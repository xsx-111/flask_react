Summerbaby LyricsSummerbaby, come on baby, show me the town
I didn't know that you'd be such a short visit
Once a year I noticed that you're not around
Mama says you went when you were exquisite
If you seen all I done
I'm alone I do things nobody knows
We were all wondering where you came from
Last night we were hypothesizing that you were an angel
Sometimes it feels like you're looking down
From a place up where angels are found
If you seen all I done
When I'm alone I do things that nobody knows
Every drop of sex, every little mess I've made
I was around, I was around
I was around
(nobody knows, nobody knows)
I was around
(nobody knows, nobody knows)
I was around
(nobody knows, nobody knows)
I was around
(nobody knows, nobody-)
Do you see a lot of angels up there like you?
Wolfgang and Vincent van Gogh
Have you seen Josephine?
Someone from town like Marshall Brown?
Or someone you know?
If you seen all I done
When I'm alone I do things nobody knows
Every drop of sex and every little mess I've made
I was around, I was around, I was around
I was around
(nobody knows, nobody knows)Embed
