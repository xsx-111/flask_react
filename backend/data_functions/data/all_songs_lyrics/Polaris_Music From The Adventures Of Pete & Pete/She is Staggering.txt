She is Staggering LyricsAre you crazy man
You didn't notice her
You must be blind
Cause all I do now
Is think about how
She will be mine
I couldn't stand up
I couldn't sit down
One look at her and I stumble around
One look at her
I get irrational
She ties my tongue
I saw her downtown
On a cloudy day
She brought the sun
She's not a part of the scene
She don't socialize
She does her own thing
She's ahead of her time
Just the right speed
She is staggering
I couldn't stand up
I couldn't sit down
One look at her and I stumble around
She is staggering
She is staggering
She's uncommonly heavenly
She is so rare
She's beautiful
Exceptional
But she doesn't care
I couldn't stand up
I couldn't sit down
One look at her and I stumble around
I couldn't get to sleep
Man, and I couldn't eat
She's all that I want
She is all that I need
She is staggering
She is staggering
She is staggering
She is staggering1Embed
