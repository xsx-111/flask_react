Ivy Boy Lyrics
Holy Holly
She don't approve at all
She thinks that she's a pony
Prancing in the front hall
She sleeps with a saddle on
Gets up and rides at dawn
Nobody knows what's wrong
But she can't keep her trousers on

Humpty Mulumpty
She's all better now
She thought that she was somebody else for a while
A house at the North Pole
She went for her daily stroll
Wearin' a wig and a mink stole
She's the daughter of rock and roll

Ivy boy
He couldn't be trusted
Even his face was an alias
Tried to be like Monty Hall
Living like a rubber ball
Found himself in Montreal
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at all
Ivy couldn't deal at allEmbed
