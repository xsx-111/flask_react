As Usual LyricsAnd it's coming round to run away or disappear
And it's coming round to run away or disappear
Try climbing up those frozen stairs
I'm standing here, and nobody cares
They're all there and all they see is nothing new
'Cause nothing sparkles like it did when I knew you
Walk around, as usual
All alone, as usual
It's getting late, as usual
I can't go home
I just won't leave my little room
What's the point, they'll be wearing blue
One man parade pull down my shades and lock the door
It's better blue for them to see, there to take the veil
Walk around, as usual
All alone, as usual
It's getting late, as usual
I can't go home, as usual
And it's coming round to run away or disappear
And it's coming round to run away or disappear
I can't find a sympathetic ear
Another day feels like another year
In a world forgetting, by a world forgotten
In a world forgetting, by a world forgotten
In a world forgetting
Walk around, as usual
All alone, as usual
It's getting late, as usual
I can't go home, as usual
Walk around, as usual
All alone, as usual
It's getting late, as usual
I can't go home, as usual
And it's coming round to run away or disappear
And it's coming round to run away or disappear
And it's coming round to run away or disappear
And it's coming round to run away or disappearEmbed
