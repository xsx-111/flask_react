Everywhere LyricsI put your photograph away
I can't look at you today
I put your letters upstairs
But it's no good because you're everywhere
I can try to hide
But why waste my time
You left your glasses behind
And somebody said you were doing fine
I play a game that you're not there
But it's no good because you're everywhere
I can try to hide
But why waste my time
Center round of you
Everything I do says you're everywhere
Everywhere
I hear a song that you sang
It hits my head like a circus train
I cried out and you were there
You were there because you're everywhere
I can try to hide
But why waste my time
Center round of you
Everything I do
I can try to hide
But why waste my time
Center round in me
Everything I see says you're everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
