Waiting for October Lyrics
They're playing in Central Park
Chai Chong Lim is shouting at the gate
Billy didn't tell you everything
Or did he mention the magic date
Well I figured it out from a fig tree
It's the chosen fruit of the devil himself
Now you've been bad for 50 years
And now it looks like Daddy's taking off his belt

Waiting for October
I cross my fingers
Cross my heart
And  hope to die
Waiting for October
I'm in the book
And I'll be learning how to fly

He's coming down but he's not alone
He's gonna bring an army of saints
And he's taking all his brides home
And then destroying what remains
Waiting for October
I cross my fingers
Cross my heart
And  hope to die
Waiting for October
I'm in the book
And I'll be learning
To be waiting
To be waiting

Hoping that the end
Will start it all again

And that's when human history will die
I said Nelson he was so right about the date
Cause it all ends in 1999
And commences on the 28th, the 28th, the 28th

Waiting for October
I cross my fingers
Cross my heart
And  hope to die
Waiting for October
I'm in the book
And I'll be learning how to fly
Waiting for October
I cross my fingers
Cross my heart
And  hope to die
Waiting for October
I'm in the books
And I'll be learning how to fly

Hopin' that the end
Will start it all againEmbed
