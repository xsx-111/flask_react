Israel LyricsYou realize, if you're happy
Jesus sends you straight to Hell
Israel, Israel
And should you dare enjoy your body
Here tolls Hades' welcome bell
Israel, Israel
You've found a middle-course existence
We're all bones and flesh and shell
Israel, Israel
I can't answer for what armies do
They are not you, they are not you, they are not you
In other climes, they bitch and whine
Just because you're not like them
Israel, Israel
The sky is dark for many others
They want it dark for you as well
Israel, Israel
Earth is just one big asylum
And explodes a prison cell
See us squirm in our own damaged spell
You were born as guilty sinners
Before you stood upright, you fell
Put the fear of many gods in Israel
Nature gave you every impulse
Who are virgin priests to tell
Who, how to love, how to live?
Israel
And they who reign abuse upon you
They are jealous of you as well
Love yourself as you should, Israel1Embed
