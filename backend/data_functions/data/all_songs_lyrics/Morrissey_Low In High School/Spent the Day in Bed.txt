Spent the Day in Bed Lyrics
Spent the day in bed
Very happy I did, yes
I spent the day in bed
As the workers stay enslaved
I spent the day in bed
I'm not my type
But I love my bed
And I recommend that you

Stop watching the news
Because the news contrives to frighten you
To make you feel small and alone
To make you feel that your mind isn't your own

I spent the day in bed, it's a consolation
When all my dreams are perfectly legal
In sheets for which I paid, I am now laid
And I recommend to all of my friends that they

Stop watching the news
Because the news contrives to frighten you
To make you feel small and alone
To make you feel that your mind isn't your own
Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish, do as I wish

I spent the day in bed
You can please yourself, but
I spent the day in bed
Pillows like pillars
Life ends in death
So, there's nothing wrong with being good to yourself
Be good to yourself for once!

And no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No emasculation, no castration
No highway, freeway, motorway
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train6Embed
