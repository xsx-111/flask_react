Who Will Protect Us from the Police? Lyrics
Say, Daddy, who will protect us from the police?
Say, Daddy, who will protect us from the police?
"Baby, God will, baby, God will
Baby, God will, baby, God will"
Say, Daddy, who will protect us from the police?
Say, Daddy, who will protect us from the police?
"Baby, God will, baby, God will
Baby, God will, baby, God will"

Say, Daddy, there are flames high in the sky tonight
There are tanks on the street attacking free speech
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must be killed for what we believe

Say, Daddy, I'm sorry, I just cannot believe you
Say, Daddy, I'm sorry, I just cannot believe you
What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?
"Baby, please run, you were right all along
Baby, please run, baby, please run"
Venezuela, Venezuela
Venezuela, Venezuela, VenezuelaEmbed
