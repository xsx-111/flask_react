Vomit Coffin Lyrics
Oh, vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my chest
I feel like coughing

Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin, oh

Queasy green
Rotten scoff
Vomit cough

And when I declared to my design
Like Frankenstein's monster:
"I am your father, I am your god
And you the magic that I conjure"
The thankless swine
The blasphemous jerk
My creature had no love for me
Which made me berserk
I am covered in vomit
I am coated in sick
I have no name and no place
This is no way to live

So I took over my creation
The spew coated protein
I plugged myself in
And became one with machine

I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my neck
I feel like death

Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

Filthy green
Rotten scoff
Vomit vomit vomit vomit
Vomit vomit vomit vomit cough2Embed
