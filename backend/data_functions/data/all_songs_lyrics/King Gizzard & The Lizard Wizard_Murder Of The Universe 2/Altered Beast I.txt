Altered Beast I Lyrics
I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

Take a peek
If you would dare
Half made of man
Half of bear

He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

I think I see
An altered beast by the creek, oh

Altered face
And altered skin
Altered horde
Of altered kin

He came from underneath
I met an altered beast
I think I see
An altered beast in my dreams

In a dream, you can wake in your bed without pain
But know with conviction, it's here you'll remain

I met an altered beast

With an unsteady gait, the critter moves forth
Feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth
And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread
As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head
And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain
And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain
Closer he comes, making dust out of stone
Forsaken you are, and what's more, all alone

I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

I met an altered beast2Embed
