Altered Beast III Lyrics
I know I see
An altered beast
By the tree

Find a place to hide
Where I could steal a peep
Look to the sky
And I see angels weep

And he said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

Hair on my skin
And I'm feeling beastly
Feel it trickle in
A new life in me
And I said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you're deformed
Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn

I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
And I'll take you to my altered world
I am an altered beast!1Embed
