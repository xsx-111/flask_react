Cicely LyricsMusk rose, plume-dame, violet
Charger weed, nettle, needle furze, sedge
Now gillyflower, chamomile, lavender
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
The pick are in bloom
So sweet, so lovely
Tell me what is one to do
To find you
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
Fields dressed and home
A man has May
(The musk rose, plume-dame, violet)
He’s got time enough for love
A man has May
(Charger weed, nettle, needle furze, sedge)
Am I really sure I’m alone
Well I really don’t know
(Now gillyflower, chamomile)
So I gave the trebled bone
But he once was a trout
How many?
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
(So I gave the trebled bone)
(But he once was a trout)
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
The dream are in bloom
So sweet, so naturally
Tell me what is one to do
To find you
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe
The way that you lose
Does anyone proud
You’re younger than Cow was, was
When I’d like to make out
When any of you guys leaves, you
Just hear the word, proud
There can’t be no doubt
Of when I’d love to make out
Violet’s stone
(Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe)
Is covered with snow
Violet’s stone
(Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe)
Is covered with snow
Violet’s stone
(Elder, king-cup, orchis, sloe)
Is covered with snowEmbed
