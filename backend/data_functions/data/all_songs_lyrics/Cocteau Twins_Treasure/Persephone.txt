Persephone LyricsHey, Bear does dances on my flame
Hey Badger, keep and sell most what Iâ€™ve got
Is what it says
Is what it says
Is what it says
Is what it says
Paper chase is on
These are our mad dreams
Boar, you are God
But a rapid fall
All your chaleur
By your chinstrap
Paper chase is on
These are our mad dreams
Paper chase is on
(Hey)
These are our mad dreams
Boar, you are God
(Bear does dances on my flame)
But a rapid fall
All your chaleur
(Boar, you would wander)
By your chinstrap
Paper chase is on
(Ever for a chance)
These are our mad dreams
Of virgin tail
Of virgin tail
Of virgin tail
A virgin dies
Paperweight means
(Paperweight)
Means a paper chase
For a timepiece
(Means a paper chase)
Never changes pace
Paperweight means
(For a timepiece)
Means a paper chase
For a timepiece
(Never changes pace)
Never changes pace
Is what it says
Is what it says
Is what it says
Is what it says
Is what it says
Is what it says
Paperweight means
Means a paperchase
For a timepiece
Never changes pace
(Is what it says)
Paperweight means
Means a paperchase
For a timepiece
Never changes pace
(Is what it says)
Paperweight means
Means a paperchase
For a timepiece
Never changes pace
(Is what it says)
Paperweight means
Means a paperchase
For a timepiece
Never changes pace
Paperweight means
Means a paperchase
For a timepiece
Never changes pace
You are
You are
You are
You are2Embed
