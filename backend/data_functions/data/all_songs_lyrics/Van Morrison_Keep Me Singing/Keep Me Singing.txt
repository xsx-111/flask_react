Keep Me Singing LyricsGoing down to the corner
Where the homeboys welcome me back
No feeling of isolation here
Well I guess I must be on the right track
Little things that count in life
Just to know my people got soul
Sam Cooke singing 'That's Where It's At'
And 'Let The Good Times Roll'
Keep me singing, while I'm winning
Waiting on my change to come
Keep me singing, it's a new beginning
When the day is done
Way up on the hillside
Watching all the boats go by
Well I got to go way back in my memory bank
See how it ought to be now
Head on down the roadside
Well I'm singing, playing my songs
Doing just what I know how to do
Right here where I belong
Keep me singing, while I'm winning
Waiting on my change to come
Won't you keep me singing, it's a new beginning
When the day is done
Keep me singing, got to be winning
Waiting on the changes to come
Keep me singing, it's a new beginning
When the day is done
Keep me singing, while I'm winning
Waiting on my changes to come
Keep me singing, it's a new beginning
When the day is doneEmbed
