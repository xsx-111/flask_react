Let It Rhyme LyricsPut another coin in the wishing well
Tell everybody got to go to Hell
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine
You'll be mine
Put another coin and make a wish
Put a spell on you and make it stick
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine
Too much water flowing underneath the bridge
Watch the world go by, contemplate what is
Throw another coin and let it shine
Baby be my Valentine
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine
You'll be mine
Too much water flowing underneath the bridge
Let the world go by, contemplate what is
Throw another coin and make a wish
Put a spell on you and make it stick
Let it rhyme
In time, you'll be mine
You'll be mine, you'll be mine, in time
You'll be mine, in time
Let it rhyme
Let it rhyme
Can you meet me at the wishing well?Embed
