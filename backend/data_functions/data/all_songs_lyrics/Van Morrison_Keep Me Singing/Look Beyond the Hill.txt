Look Beyond the Hill LyricsWhen your troubles are a burden let your mind be still
Wait until the clouds start moving way beyond the hill
Can't you see the sky is bluer up upon the ridge
Just don't let the green grass fool you, look beyond the hill
Sometime it don't rhyme, seem to have your fill
Got to get your house in order in line with your will
Tomorrow is another day to go in for the kill
You can have a change of heart now
Look beyond the hill
You've got to look beyond the hill
You've got to look beyond the hillEmbed
