Every Time I See a River LyricsHaven't heard your voice in quite a while
Haven't seen you dance or seen you smile
I can go days where nothing is wrong
But it just doesn't last very long
Every time I see a river
Every time I heard a train
Every time I hear a sad song
It reminds me of what we had then
Every time I see a river
Feels like I'm back in love again
My life seems together and I'm doing just fine
But I remember when I was oyurs and you were mine
I don't need your picture on the wall
I don't need anything at all, but...
Every time I see a river
Every time I hear a train
Every time I hear a sad song
It reminds me of what we had then
Every time I see a river
Feels like I'm back in love again
I just can't stand the pain
Haven't heard your voice in quite a while
Haven't seen you dance or seen you smile
I can go days where nothing is wrong
It just don't last for very long
Every time I see a river
Every time I hear a train
Every time I hear a sad song
I remember what we had then, what we had then
Every time I see a river
Feels like I'm back in love again
I just can't stand it no more
Can't stand it no more
Every time I see a river
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running
Running and running and running and running and running and running
Running away every time I see a river
Can't stand the pain
Feel like I'm back there again
Every time I see a riverEmbed
