Share Your Love with Me LyricsWell it's an ill wind
That blows no good
And it's a sad heart
That won't love like it should
And oh how lonesome you must be
And it's a shame
You don't share your love with me
And it's a heartache
When love is gone
And it's bad, even sad later on
There's no one blinder than
He who just won't see
And it's a shame
You don't share your love with me
I can't help it, oh no
If she's gone
I must try to forget and you must live on
Well it's a good thing to love someone
But as bad, even sad when it's not returned
Lord, and oh so lonesome you must be
And it's a shame
If you won't share your love with me, yeah
I can't help it no, no
I she's gone
You must try to forget
You must live on
And it's a blind fool that doesn't want to see
And it's a shame
If you don't want to share your love with me
And its a shame
If you don't want to share your love with me
Lord, and it's a shame
If you don't want to share, share your love with me
Yeah, share your love with meEmbed
