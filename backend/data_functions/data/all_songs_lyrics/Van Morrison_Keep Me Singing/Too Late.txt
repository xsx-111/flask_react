Too Late LyricsWell it's too late for sorrow, for sorrow, well it's too late
And it's too late for tomorrow, for tomorrow just can't wait
Well it's too late for crying in the rain
Well it's too late to start all over again, can't complain
But it's not too late for Wednesday in your garden and whoops
I beg your pardon, please don't hesitate
Well it's too late for crying in the rain
It's too late to start all over again, so refrain
But it's not too late for Wednesday in your garden and whoops
I beg your pardon, just don't hesitate
Well it's too late for sorrow, for sorrow, baby it's too late
And it's too late for tomorrow, for tomorrow
Tomorrow just can't wait
Tomorrow just can't wait
Tomorrow just can't wait
Tomorrow just can't waitEmbed
