Day Nineteen: Disclosure Lyrics My good friend, I hope you hear my voice
I must alleviate this ache
I thought about this and found I have no choice
I have to tell you this for conscience sake
I felt alone, forsaken and afraid
Out of work and out of love
I needed someone to ease some of the pain
She was there for me when times were rough
 My sweet love, my heart belongs to you
But I was lonely and the need for passion grew
You were never here, and even when you were
Most of my words would go unheard
 I'd be there to comfort her
 We'd shared our distress
 But we were never in love
 Can you forgive us?
 My good friend, well maybe I am wrong
I think you saw us on that day
I want you to know, she loved you all along
I hope that this will help you in some way
 My sweet love, my heart belongs to you
But I was lonely and the need for passion grew
You were never here, and even when you were
Most of my words would go unheard
 I'd be there to comfort her
 We'd shared our distress
 But we were never in love
 Can you forgive us?
 Don't be afraid, her heart belongs to you
 Don't be afraid, don't keep her waiting
 It's time to rise, and tell them what you feel
 You have to let them know
 Here the dream ends, this is real
 I'll be there to comfort her
 I know you will be!
 I'll come back to life
 I know that you can!Embed
