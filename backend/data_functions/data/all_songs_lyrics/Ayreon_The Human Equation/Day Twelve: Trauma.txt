Day Twelve: Trauma Lyrics Think hard, you are lying here in a hospital bed
Disregard the emotions inside your head
Concentrate on the real world beyond your mind
It's not to late to leave your burdens behind
 We won't let you go
Take you down below
Dark crypts of your soul
Locked inside your head...
You're better off dead
 Locked away, she lives in isolation
It's been that way, since he has gone
She been through life of depravation
She depends on you, her only son
 She won't let you go
Keep you down below
Dark crypts of your soul
Locked inside your head
You're better off dead
 Where are you, can't you hear her calling?
Nothing you can do, you have no time
There is no one there, to catch her now she's falling
Why should you care, you are doing fine
 She won't let you go
Keep you down below
Dark crypts of your soul
Locked inside your head
You're better off dead
 Now she's at rest, she finally found her peace
There's no need to blame yourself
You must let go, or the pain will never cease
It's time to crawl out of your shell
Your mother died, the day your father left
A part of you died as well
Feelings of guilt will haunt you 'til the end
You must fight hard to break this spell
But it hurts...
 You hear her voice, from beyond her grave
"Where were you son, when I needed you
Is this your thanks for all the warmth I gave
Did you forget what I been through?"
You hear his voice, cold and merciless
"You worthless fool, you let her die!"
And deep within yourself, you must confess
Your ways cannot be justified
 By now you realized, you have to be
Relentless to survive
Repress your memories
Bury all emotions and thrive!
It's your life!
 Now she's at rest, she found her peace
 You hear her voice, from the grave
 You must let go or the pain won't cease
 Is this your thanks for all I gave"
 A part of you died as well
 You worthless fool, you let her die"
 It's time to crawl out of your shell
 Your ways cannot be justified
 By now you realized, you have to be
Relentless to survive
Repress your memories
Bury all emotions and thrive!
It's your life!Embed
