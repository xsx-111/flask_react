Day Thirteen: Sign Lyrics Faith has come to warn
That you far too long forsaken her heart
Move to the truth
Breathe the sunlight burning in her open arms
Break the chains that
Bind you to a past that feeds this bitter days
Seize your only chance
Follow the stars that beckon you through blackened skies
 Can you feel me touch your aching heart
I can sense how much you're missing me...
Give me a sign, show me you're there
I am sure you'll find a way back to me
 I can't believe I turned so vile
How could I've ignored her smile?
She was always there to ease my pain
I am so ashamed
I wonder why she stayed with me
How she endured my vanity
I wish I could go back and mend my ways
Is it too late?
 Can you see, I swear it's true, a teardrop trickling down his cheek?
 Yes, indeed, I see it too, could it be he's hurting inside?
 Don't you think we should be glad he feels anything at all?
 It could well be he cries because of us
 Does it matter why he cries?
 What's going on in his mind?
 Has he given us a sign?
 Can you see, I swear it's true, him clenching his right hand into a fist?
 Yes, indeed, I see it too, could it be that he's raging inside?
 Don't you think we should be glad he has any thoughts at all?
 It could well be he angry because of us
 Does it matter if he is?
 What's going on in his mind?
 Has he given us a sign?Embed
