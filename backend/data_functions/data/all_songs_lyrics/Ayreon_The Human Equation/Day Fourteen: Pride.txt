Day Fourteen: Pride Lyrics I have always been creative, I don't understand
Aspired to be an artist, not a business man
 You need to show your old man you're in control
To be successful, you'd sell your own soul!
 I've always been respectable, I don't understand
I tried to be compassionate, I'm not a ruthless man!
 You need to show them you're superior, you lead the field
No one opposes you, all man must yield!
 I've always been affectionate, don't understand
I really love her, I'm not a heartless man!
 You have no time for commitments, they get in the way
Get down to business, there's no time to play!
 You can still change, and right what is wrong
 But can you swallow me, or am I too strong?
 You have to get back now, it's not too late
 It's not like you to resign to your fate
 The loved ones are waiting, break out of your cage
 You have the power, give in to your rage
 Listen to Pride now, for once now he's right
 Listen to Reason, let us be your guideEmbed
