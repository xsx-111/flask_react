Day Eleven: Love Lyrics
Friday night, I had a few
There she was, out of the blue
Thunderstruck, nailed to the floor
I couldn't move, couldn't talk
Anymore

Of all these guys it's you she desires
Secretly her heart is on fire
Waiting for you to ask her to dance
Go ahead, make your move
Now's your chance

Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how

Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin!

There I was, nervous and shy
Struck with awe as I caught her eye
I mustered up courage and walked her way
Figuring out what to do
What to say
Her heart sings as she sees you come near
The music fades, the crowd disappears
She weeps in silence as you pass her by
And she's wondering why
Oh why

Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how

Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin!

Remember your father, well you're just like him
Nothing but violence and fury within
Remember your mother, so lonely and sad
This will be her fate if you treat her as bad

You're afraid she might turn you down
All your hopes, dashed to the ground
Nobody loved you, nobody will
Why should you even try
But still
Friday night, I had a few

There was no need to talk

There she was, out of the blue

We just started to walk

Hand in hand, we took the floor

And we danced, and we danced, and we danced

I could move, I could talk â€“
Even more

Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how
Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin!

Remember your father, well you're just like him
Nothing but violence and fury within
Remember your mother, so lonely and sad
This will be her fate if you treat her as badEmbed
