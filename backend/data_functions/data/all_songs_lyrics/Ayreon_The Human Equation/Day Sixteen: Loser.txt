Day Sixteen: Loser Lyrics
Look at you, lying there, defenseless and alone
See I am no fool, I always knew you wouldn't make it on your own
'Cause you're just like your mother, well, where is she now?
You'll end up like her soon, 6 feet under ground
Loser

I came here to watch you bleed, oh how I love to gloat
If you had any balls at all, you'd grab me by the throat
You don't even look like me, (hah), not even close
You're an aberration, some freak I suppose
Loser



I had my fun, I'm going back to the place I don't call home
There's no one there who waits for me
But you won't hear me moan
My ex-wives all sue me, and with half my kids in jail
I'll still come out laughing, because me? I never fail
Loser

Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Killing it from afar, go tell it in a bar
You're killing it from afar my father
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Killing it from afar, go tell it in a bar
You're killing it from afar my father
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never
Killing it from afar, go tell it in a bar
You're killing it from afar my fatherEmbed
