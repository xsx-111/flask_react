Day Ten: Memories Lyrics(Best Friend) It's been 10 days
It shouldn't last this long
The doctors' mystified
Nothing's physically wrong...
(Wife) But maybe inside his head
He's struggling to survive
Would it help if we talk to him?
Bring him back to life...
(Best Friend and Pride) Do you remember that time
We were showing off our brand new flashy bikes?
(Wife and Love) You looked so fine
Until you both fell over and then started to cry!
(Best Friend and Pride) Do you recall that day
Fearlessly we climbed the highest tower?
(Wife and Love) Then you became afraid
Too scared to climb down you stayed up there for hours!
(Best Friend and Pride) Do you remember that time?
(Wife and Love) Do you recall that day?
(Wife and Love) Do you remember that time
Alone at last, naked by the fire?
(Best Friend and Pride) Then all your friends came by
They rushed in the room and you had no time to hide
(Wife and Love) Do you recall that day
You proposed to me, fell down to your knee?
(Best Friend and Pride) You didn't know what to say
So she knelt down too for she thought you'd lost your keys!
(Wife and Love) Do you remember that time?
(Best Friend and Pride) Do you recall that day?
(Passion) Can you see her light
Shining through the black
She's reaching out to you
What's holding you back?
(Reason) Can you feel her warmth
Glowing on your skin
Don't repress the memories
Let them all in...Embed
