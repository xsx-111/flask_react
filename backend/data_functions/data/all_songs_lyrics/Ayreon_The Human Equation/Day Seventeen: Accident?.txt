Day Seventeen: Accident? Lyrics You're driving home, It's one PM
You cannot function, you're a broken man
Your past is catching up with you
Only her tenderness can help you through
You see her smile, at another man
 Did you see me smile at another man?
It was only us, please understand...

You see him hold her, in his arms
 Did you see him hold me in his arms?
We needed warmth, we meant no harm...
 Love left you, without me you're all alone!
 Tears of sorrow fill your eyes
Your cold and wretched life flashes by
Is that your father standing there?
You turn the wheel, you no longer care...
You saw her smile at another man
 Did you see me smile at another man?
It was only us, please understand...
 You saw him hold her, in his arms
 Did you see him hold me in his arms?
We needed warmth, we meant no harm...
 Love left you, without me you're all alone!
Love wrecked you!
 You saw her smile at another man
Now you finally understand
He held her in his arms
You've nothing left, it's gone to far...
 Your memory begins to clear
Now you see what brought you here
You try to open up your eyes
But the doubts will leave you paralyzed
 I smiled at another man
Please understand...
He held me in his arms
We meant no harm...
 Love left you, without me you're all alone!
Love wrecked you, I am the oldest friend you known!Embed
