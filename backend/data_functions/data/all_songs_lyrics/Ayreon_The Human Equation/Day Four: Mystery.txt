Day Four: Mystery Lyrics(Best Friend) No, I can't seem to figure out what happened
On the brightest hour of day, no car in sight
No, I can't seem to accept these strange conditions
No matter what they say, it doesn't feel right
(Wife) Do you think he's seen it?
(Best Friend) I don't think he did
(Wife) Do you think he knows it?
(Best Friend) I don't think he knows
(Wife) Do you think he's been there?
(Best Friend) I don't think he was
(Wife) Do you think he'll die?
(Best Friend) I don't think he will
(Wife) No, could it have been a moment of distraction?
A creature on the road, a plane in the air...
(Best Friend) Do you think he's seen it?
(Wife) I don't think he did
(Best Friend) Do you think he knows it?
(Wife) I don't think he knows
(Best Friend) Do you think he's been there?
(Wife) I don't think he was
(Best Friend) Do you think he'll die?
(Wife) I don't think he will
(Wife and Best Friend) No, will we ever understand what happened
Will the mystery be unveiled, or die with him?
(Best Friend) Do you think he's seen it?
(Wife) I don't think he did
(Best Friend) Do you think he knows it?
(Wife) I don't think he knows
(Best Friend) Do you think he's been there?
(Wife) I don't think he was
(Best Friend) Do you think he'll die?
(Wife) I don't think he will
(Passion) Do you think you've seen it?
(Me) I don't think I did
(Pride) Do you think you know it?
(Me) I don't think I know
(Love) Do you think you've been there?
(Me) I don't think I was
(Agony) Do you think you'll die?
(Me) I don't know!Embed
