Day Five: Voices Lyrics(Pride)
I hear voices, they are talking about you
Can you hear them, do you know what they mean?
Try to remember, what have you been through
What do you know and what have you seen?
I can read the thoughts they are conveying
So intense, can you feel them too?
I can't believe it's true what they're saying
You're far too strong, it couldn't happen to you
(Me)
But what if there's truth in the words that they speak
What do they signify?
(Pride)
You worry too much
(Me)
And what are the questions to answers I seek
What will they clarify?
(Pride)
Yeah, you're losing your touch
(Me)
Help me out, this means nothing to me...
(Reason)
Who are these voices, where do they come from?
Should we try to understand?
Mere illusions, hallucinations?
They might be vital, to our plan
(Love)
They sound familiar
They must be here to help you
All this confusion's tearing you apart
You must be patient, time is the healer
Open up and let them in your heart
(Fear)
Their guilty sighs
I think you understand it all
You were afraid to live, now you're afraid to die...
You fool yourself
You rose so high, you were bound to fall
Longing for the truth, you lived a lie...
(Reason)
I am convinced now, they are essential
They must be our way out of here
(Love)
Listen and learn, let your heart lead you
And you will find the solution's near
(Fear)
Their guilty sighs
I think you understand it all
Long for the truth, you lived a lie...
(Pride)
If they are right, we'll fight for survival
Look to the future, but learn from the past
Confront the danger, face up to your rival
Take a deep breath, we have to move fast
(Me)
I think there is truth in the words that they speak
What do they signify?
(Pride)
You worry way too much
(Me)
I will find the answers to questions I seek
What will they clarify?
(Pride)
You're losing your touch
(Me)
Help me out, this means nothing to me...Embed
