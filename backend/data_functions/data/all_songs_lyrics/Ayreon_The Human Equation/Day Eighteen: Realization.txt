Day Eighteen: Realization Lyrics Now you know the truth, what will you do?
 I still can't believe it's true...
 You better believe it, and make them pay!
 There has to be another way...
 You cannot take this lying down!
 I cannot stand up, can you show me how?
 You must forgive them and open your heart
 It's all my fault, it tears me apart!
 It would have been better if you would have just died!
 No, I've got to win this fight!
 Can you face them after all you did?
 I gotta reveal the feelings I hid
 See him fight, he's all on his own...
 I need your help, can't do it alone!
 Listen to me, can you hear me shout?
 Let me out!Embed
