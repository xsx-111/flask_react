Day Two: Isolation Lyrics
I can't move, I can't feel my body
I don't remember anything
What place is this, how did I get here?
I don't understand, what's happening
Am I alone?

You've been deserted, everyone has left you
You know it's always been that way
Those frantic years, the people you've neglected
Now the time has come to pay
You're alone
No one here is dancing to your tune

Is this a dream or is it real?

Sometimes the dream becomes reality

But I don't know what to feel
Then I will guide you through this haze

But who are you, why are you here?

I am you and you are all of us

I can't think, my mind ain't clear

Then I will free you from this maze

Can't you feel it burn
Deep down inside?
Won't you ever learn?
Don't try to hide!
Can't you feel that fire
Scorching your soul?
A wounded man's desire
Out of control
I can't believe you're giving up
That's not your way
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay
You've always had complete control
Never thinking twice
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as ice

You're all delusions of my mind

And so we are, we're all a part of you

Am I a part of some design?

The one design is in your head

How can it be, you look so real

We are as real as you imagine us
I can touch you, I can feel

Then take my hand and follow me

Can't you feel it burn
Deep down inside?
Won't you ever learn?
Don't try to hide!
Can't you feel that fire
Scorching your soul?
A wounded man's desire
Out of control

I can't believe you're giving up
That's not your way
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay
You've always had complete control
Never thinking twice
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as ice

Close your eyes, listen to your heart beat
Surrender to its soothing pulse
Silence the cries, gentle and carefree
Good or bad, true or false
You're not alone
You'll find me here whenever they oppose you
I am the strongest of them all
No need to fear these feelings that enclose you
I'm here to catch you when you fall
You're not alone
I am here, dancing to your tune


Can't you feel it burn
Deep down inside?
Won't you ever learn
Don't try to hide
Can't you feel that fire
Scorching your soul?
A wounded man's desire
Out of control

I can't believe you're giving up
(I can't believe)
That's not your way
(No)
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay
(To make you pay)
You've always had complete control
Never thinking twice
(No, never twice)
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as iceEmbed
