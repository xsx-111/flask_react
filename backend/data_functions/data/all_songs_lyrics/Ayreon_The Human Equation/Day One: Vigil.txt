Day One: Vigil Lyrics
Did he open up his eyes?
Did he try to touch my hand
Or is my mind playing tricks on me?
Do you think he hears us cry?
Does he understand
We are here by his side?

Why are you so concerned?
Do you really care
Or do you feel responsible?
Now the tide has turned
Won't you try to clear the air?
Let your conscience be your guide...Embed
