Day Three: Pain Lyrics
I am pain
I am real, I'm not a dream
I'm the chain around your neck as you scream
Surrender now
You can't beat death at his ruthless game
Make your bow
Hang your head in shame

I can't believe there is no way out

You'll find you are wrong

You fill me with doubt

You were never that strong

I am pain
I am the wound that never heals
It's all in vain
No compromise, no deals...
I can't believe this is the end

It's written in stone

Where are my friends?

You have always been alone!

(Pain!)
We lead
We hide as the pain leaves the rage inside
(Emotion personified alpha)
Being here, welcomed by... a sane mind

A travelled lie

I am pain
I am the end, I am your wraith
Nothing remains
I'm the loss of hope and faith
I can't believe there is no way out...

You'll find you are wrong

You fill me with doubt...

You were never that strong

(Pain!)
We lead, we hide as the pain leaves the rage inside
(Emotion personified alpha)
Being here, welcomed by... a sane mind
A travelled lie
All the time, I had waited with
Rage
All the time, I was promised my
Salvation
I can't accept this, we will find a way
Out of this cesspool of doom and dismay
Beyond this dejection there's beauty and grace
A glorious future we long to embrace

(Pain!)
All the time, I had waited with
Rage
(Emotion personified alpha)
All the time, I was promised my
Salvation

(Pain!)
All the time, I had waited with
Rage
(Emotion personified alpha)
All the time, I was promised my
Salvation1Embed
