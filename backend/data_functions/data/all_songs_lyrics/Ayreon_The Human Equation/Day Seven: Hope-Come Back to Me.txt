Day Seven: Hope/Come Back to Me Lyrics
Let me take you back
To the time when we were chasing all the girls
Two maniacs
Indulging in the pleasures of this world
So much to see, so much to live for
Questions to answer, places to go
So much to be, so much to care for
Deep down inside I think you know
You are free
Come back to me
Look ahead and see
There are still so many borders we could cross
Just you and me
Making up for all the time that we have lost

So much to see

He may be right

So much to live for
I've got to fight

Questions to answer

I will pull through

Places to go

Take me with you

So much to be

I will not break

So much to care for

I must awake
Deep down inside I think you know

I think I know

I am/You are free

Come back to me!
Aaaah, aaaah come back to me

There's no way out, my whole world is black!

Aaaah, aaaah come back to me

I try to shout, something's holding me back!Embed
