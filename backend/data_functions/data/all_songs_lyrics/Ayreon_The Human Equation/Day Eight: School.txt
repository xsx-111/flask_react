Day Eight: School Lyrics(Fear)It's time to leave your sheltered cage
Face you deepest fears
The world is against you
You're fighting back the tears
(Me)All the kids were watching me
I felt very small
I could hear the laughter
As I stumbled down the hall
(Rage)(human) Seeking to find, deep in the trauma as it leaves you behind
(human) Bleeding it gone into the profit of the competition
(human) Loving today, all of the feelings are they going away
(human) Ending it now, I'd rather hear about the where and the how
(Agony)The bigger boys they beat you up
Out here you cannot hide
No friends to help you
No father at your side
(Me)I swore that I'd get back at them
But I was just a kid
One day I'd show them
I wouldn't rest until I did
(Rage)(human) Seeking to find, deep in the trauma as it leaves you behind
(human) Bleeding it gone into the profit of the competition
(human) Loving today, all of the feelings are they going away
(human) Ending it now, I'd rather hear about the where and the how
(Pride)You've got to prove you are not like the rest
(Reason)There's no need if you know you're the best
(Pride)That's not enough, let the other kids know
(Reason)What's the use, go with the flow
(Pride)Be a man, give into hate
(Reason)You better learn to communicate
(Pride)Better to learn to protect yourself
(Reason)That's not the way to get out of this hell
(Pride)See that kid, wipe the smile off his face
(Reason)He's just like you, feeling out of place
(Pride)I don't care, let's show him who's boss
(Reason)That's not the way to get your message across
(Pride)Be a man, give into hate
(Reason)You better learn to communicate
(Pride)Better to learn to protect yourself
(Reason)That's not the way to get out of this hell
(Passion)Don't rack your brain, let it all go
Savour the moment and feel your blood flow
(Me)Then I got back at them
Still acting like a kid
Then I showed them
But when I had, I could not quit...
(Rage)(human) Seeking to find, deep in the trauma as it leaves you behind
(human) Bleeding it gone into the profit of the competition
(human) Loving today, all of the feelings are they going away
(human) Ending it now, I'd rather hear about the where and the howEmbed
