Day Six: Childhood Lyrics(Agony) You're alone in your bedroom
Hiding from the world, staring at the ceiling
(Me) Mother said "he'll be home soon"
But he never was, and I knew how she was feeling
(Fear) You always let him down; "you'd never be like him"
He'd always break you, never let you win
No matter what you said, he'd always disagree
You swore that one day you would be
... better than him... one day you'd win
(Agony) You're hiding out in the cellar
Aching and ashamed, covering up the bruises
(Me) And then he would tell her
How I tripped and hurt my head, how I'd always be a loser
(Fear) You always let him down; "you'd never be like him"
He'd always break you, never let you win
No matter what you said, he'd always disagree
You swore that one day you would be
... better than him... one day you'd win
(Agony) You're all alone in your bedroom
How could you learn to care, when nobody cares for you
(Me) Mother said he'd be home soon
But he never came, as for me... he didn't have to...Embed
