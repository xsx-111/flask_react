Jumping Fences LyricsLazy man who can't find his words
All caught up inside his head
He is there with you, he is there with you
And when he can't speak from too much wine
You're always there with his line
When he wants to go home
You know the jolly show must go on
But he sees me on you
And you on summer buzz and summer heat
But I don't know
For go to the picture show today
We're living day by day
And we both know
That this world can make no sense
When you've jumped everybody's fence, yeah
We're living aimlessly
And we both know
That this world can make no sense
When you've jumped everybody's fence
And you know we can, yeah
(We're living aimlessly and we both know that this world)
You know we can, yeah yeah
Yeah, you know we can5Embed
