NYC-25 LyricsHere we go around the world
We spin around on the turnstiles we create
Here we are in caravan
Blinders up high we're the dreamers
Don't forget you're the only one (you're the only one)
You hold your kite on a string
Don't sleep too long 'cause everything you need is right here
Don't sleep too long, pleasant dreams but please
Don't sleep too long, everything you need is right here
Don't sleep too long, pleasant dreams but please don't sleep too long
Here we are in Candyland
One million dreams are realizing everyday
Here we are in Apple Corps
Four million feet walk right by me everyday
Here we are in old New York
Ten million eyes stare right through me
Don't forget you're not the only one (not the only one)
Who turned your life all around
Don't sleep too long 'cause everything you need is right here
Don't sleep too long, pleasant dreams but please
Don't sleep too long, everything you need is right here
Don't sleep too long, pleasant dreams but please don't sleep too long
Pleasant dreams but please don't sleep too long2Embed
