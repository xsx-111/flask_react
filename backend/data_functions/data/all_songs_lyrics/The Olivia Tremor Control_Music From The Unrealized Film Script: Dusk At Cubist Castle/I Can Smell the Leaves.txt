I Can Smell the Leaves LyricsAutumn is here
I can smell the leaves
Little by little it gets colder
Take the bus downtown
Ride a bike to the park
With your trip
People everywhere
Immediate processors
Writing books and climbing stairs
Just a few hours
The sun goes down
All the people hanging around go back home
Or stay downtown
Autumn is here
I can smell the leaves
The color of fire
I look at the trees grow olderEmbed
