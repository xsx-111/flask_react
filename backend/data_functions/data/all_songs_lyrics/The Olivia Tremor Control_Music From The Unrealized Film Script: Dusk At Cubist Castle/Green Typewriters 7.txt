Green Typewriters 7 LyricsWhat I need is space, and lots of it
Tons and tons of rooms, and lots of them
I'll paint them green and red
And thirty six colors to custom mix
A collection of rugs with tons of tiny tassles
Sharp lines, decorative designs
A place to harmonize away from conventional life
A place to radiate, a place to be just me
Return again and again to the giant day inside of my head
Tons and tons of ideas that never take off
It causes the untime
It's all on a different level
And there's so many
The stages are set
Everything is ready
Let the future come
Let the future linger on...1Embed
