Memories of Jacqueline 1906 LyricsThe way we go
The only way we know
Where you going to?
I've thought of the best of times, Jacqueline 1906
The skyline
Storms and rainy thoughts, no time for shelter
But remember the best of times
Right now is when we break the static
With our themes of liberation
Conquer all that we can
Conquer all that we can
Conquer all that we can
Planet disaster, no time for shelter
But remember the best of times, jacqueline 19061Embed
