Can You Come Down With Us? LyricsCan you come down with us?
(Can you come down with us?)
Can you believe with us?
(Can you believe with us?)
When the warm air comes
(When the warm air comes)
We'll drink the ocean tonight
No time to fuss, no time to fight now
All those people need a place to go
Can you come down with us?
(Can you come down with us?)
Can you believe with us?
(Can you believe with us?)
When the warm air comes
(When the warm air comes)
We'll drink the ocean tonight
No time to fuss, no time to fight now
All those people need a place to goEmbed
