Spring Succeeds LyricsI spring up from the ground
I stretch myself up
And have a look around
This whole world
Carry me like the wind
Cause i'm a seed to be thrown
When you hear the sound you'll know
Take a little time for yourself
I'm swaying here beneath the climb
Fish sign daisy
Breaks the earth
And grows beside me
When you hear the sound you'll grow
And take a little time for yourself
When you hear the sound you'll glow
And take a little time for yourselfEmbed
