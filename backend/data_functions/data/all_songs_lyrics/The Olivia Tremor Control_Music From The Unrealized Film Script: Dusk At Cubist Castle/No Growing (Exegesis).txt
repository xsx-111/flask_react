No Growing (Exegesis) LyricsIf I should discorporate
Trying to illuminate the lines of my time
Please tell the here and now
Present the case somehow
And open up their lines
There is no growing
In knowing where you're going
Without the light inside
What do you do when the magic's gone?
What do you do when the magic's gone away?
There is an ideal and I'm going to reach for it
There is an ideal and I'm going to try
Open up your heart, open up your heart
There is no growing in knowing where you're going
Without the light inside, without the light inside
Without the light1Embed
