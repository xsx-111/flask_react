Green Typewriters 1 LyricsA milion ribbons and floating stars
The night sky fades
Perception is an ocean
Your days are like an eternity
Hey, it's been so long, I'm out on the lawn
Watching a hundred typewriters soaked in green paint
When you wake me up in the world of blue
And the stars are sinking low and the sunshine is in view
Hey, it's been so long, I'm out on the lawn
Watching a hundred typewriters soaked (soaked!) in green paint
(Hey, it's been so long, I'm out on the lawn...)
When you wake me up in the world of blue
And the stars are sinking low and the sunshine is in view1Embed
