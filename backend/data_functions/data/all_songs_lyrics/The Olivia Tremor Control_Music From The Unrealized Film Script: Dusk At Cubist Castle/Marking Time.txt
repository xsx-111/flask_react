Marking Time LyricsMarking time through the day
Did you ever see the light inside my window?
Marking my words as I always do
Still find it hard enough to say
I can't hide, oh, I can't hide, oh, I can't hide
I can't hide, oh, I can't hide, I can't hide
I can't hide, oh, I can't hide, oh, I can't hideEmbed
