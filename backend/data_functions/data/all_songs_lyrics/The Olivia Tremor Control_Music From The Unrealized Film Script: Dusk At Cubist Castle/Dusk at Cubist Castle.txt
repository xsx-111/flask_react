Dusk at Cubist Castle LyricsDusk at cubist castle
Dreams of the old wake up the new
You can find me out there
Among the grass and the animals i knew
In my head all day
It rained a lot
But the dream that's out there
Doesn't make much sense to me
Dusk at cubist castle
All the clouds are in past tense
All the kingdom is in fragments
And these paintings don't make sense1Embed
