Define a Transparent Dream LyricsWork over the surface and into the distance
Constantly showering me with decision
Define a transparent dream
Dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream
Define a transparent dream
Dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream
Feel the atmosphere breathe with life
Model portrait heads of Gertrude Stein
Define a transparent dream
Dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream
Define a transparent dream
Dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream dr-dr-dr-dream
So it's back and forth again
Dreaming on the doorstep
The always red society
Comes to visit me
Well I'm dreamin' of a sunset
Juice and coffee in the morning
After staring at the stars all night
The always blue society
Wraps rings around the sun
Saturn too
All night
Night
