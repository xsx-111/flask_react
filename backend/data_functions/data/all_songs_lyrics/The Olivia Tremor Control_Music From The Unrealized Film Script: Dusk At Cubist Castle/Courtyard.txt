Courtyard LyricsHere's your ticket, you better believe
(better believe it's true)
Long live the life we led at 210
(two one ooh that's you)
We're on a journey so you'd better run
Try to get to your train on time
I'm always going back
Always going back to
Always going back to where you are
Down in the courtyard
Is where you'll find me
Going back to where you are
And there's nothing that I can tell you
That you don't already know
That you don't already know my dear
I might get away from these 4 walls
(I might fly away)
I might escape from what's holding me
(I might run away)
Here in apple town is where i called you
Here is where i called you for advice
I'm always going back
Always going back to
Always going back to where you are
Out in the turning tide
That's where you'll find me
Going back to where you are
And there's nothing that I can tell you
That you don't already know
That you don't already know my dearEmbed
