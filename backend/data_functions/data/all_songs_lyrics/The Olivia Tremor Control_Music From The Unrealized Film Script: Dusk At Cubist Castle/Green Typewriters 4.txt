Green Typewriters 4 LyricsWake up, feeling like you wanna be down
Well don't be, there's time for everything
Just look around
I don't wanna die inside anymore
I don't wanna hear that song anymore
Wake up, it's what the world should do
And look around, slow down, there's time for everything
Just look around
I don't wanna die inside anymore
I don't wanna hear that song anymoreEmbed
