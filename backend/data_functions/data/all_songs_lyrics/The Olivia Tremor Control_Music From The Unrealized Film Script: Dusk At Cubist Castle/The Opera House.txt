The Opera House LyricsWe're at the movies
Watching some people move their mouths
And a religious figure
Who's not really a religious figure
'Cause he's an actor
We feel okay
Which is how we feel most of the time now
Nothing can't be done without the willingness
To succeed
Let's go to the opera
Since all of our favorite memories have failed us
You make the choice, you make the choice
You make the choice, you make the choice
Historic properties, historic places
The next generation
Lost in a sea of faces
There's no hope for generating electricity
No sidewalks, I just need some kicks
You make the choice, you make the choice
You make the choice, you make the choiceEmbed
