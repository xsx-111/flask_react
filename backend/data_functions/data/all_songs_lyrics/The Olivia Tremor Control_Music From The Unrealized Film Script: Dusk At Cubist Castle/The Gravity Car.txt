The Gravity Car LyricsI peeked inside of your gravity car
It won't go far with marbles found in a barnyard
I saw the distance between us and felt
For once in my life i believe what i'm saying
I peeked inside of your gravity car
Through open fields past the graveyard
I guess i'm wrong when i say we won't get far
Look where we are nowEmbed
