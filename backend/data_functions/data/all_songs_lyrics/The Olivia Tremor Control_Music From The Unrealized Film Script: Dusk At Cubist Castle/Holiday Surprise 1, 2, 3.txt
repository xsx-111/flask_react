Holiday Surprise 1, 2, 3 LyricsSpending my last dollar on a hotel and a restaurant
Sky looks gray but the sky inside is a mighty great one
Don't worry
Don't worry
Taking the time to waste your sunny day
Taking the time to waste your sunny day
Holiday surprise and a bright one at that
It's a holiday to last even though we spent the last year
In a dream, in a dream
Taking the time to waste your sunny day
Taking the time to waste your sunny day
Imitating you
Your image floats two feet above the ground
I sit down in my seat and wait to take off
I can't wait for the oxygen to get thin
I twist around in my seat
I'm flying like a star, a star taker
Taking light from the sky
Teasing all the people with pictures of you
Cause it's a holiday surprise
Ooo-ah
Remember the beliefs we had back then
Said we'd never change our minds
But all went thin again
All the dreams were just dirty plans
Well please, please
Don't you ever change your mind
Conflict in our heads makes us see
Without the death that we're used to
All of the problems in our way
Make it so very hard to say
Well please, please
Don't you ever change your mindEmbed
