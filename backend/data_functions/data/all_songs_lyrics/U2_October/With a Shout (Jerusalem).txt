With a Shout (Jerusalem) LyricsOh, where do we go
Where do we go from here?
Where to go?
To the side of a hill
Blood was spilt
We were still looking at each other
But we're going back there?
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Shout, shout, with a shout
Shout it out, shout
Shout it out
I want to go, to the foot of Mount Zion
To the foot of He who made me see
To the side of a hill blood was spilt
We were filled with a love
And we're going to be there again
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Shout, shout, with a shout
Shout, with a shoutEmbed
