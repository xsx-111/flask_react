Down Lyrics
Let's get drunk, you can drive us to the harbor
Wish upon a star but do you know what stars are?
Balls of fire burning up the black space
Falling from the landscape, exploding in the face of God
Let's get crazy, talk about our big plans
Places that you're going, places that I haven't been
Build my walls up, concrete castle
Keep this kingdom free of hassle, yeah
Yeah

Yeah
Yeah

But I hear a sound echo in the emptiness all around
But you can't change this loneliness
Look at what you've found, I've fallen down

Taste the saline rolling down your cheekbone
Tell me that you're alone, tell me on the telephone
Feel your heart, it breaks within your chest now
Try to get some rest now, sleep's not coming easy for awhile
Child
Child
Yeah


Down
Down
Down
Down

Look at what you've found, I've fallen downEmbed
