This Broken Heart LyricsYou woke up in pieces
From making these changes
And holding me ransom
Won't write you an anthem
On the outside, I'm trying
'Cause inside, I'm dying
This broken heart was stronger then
Now I can't stand to part with this
This broken heart
You took me for granted
Now I've changed, you haven't
It won't be so easy
To sell me this feeling
This broken heart was stronger than
The words I wish you never meant
This broken heart
Can't make this right
You can see on my face that I'm not gonna be alright
Not tonight
You can read all my letters
But that won't mean things are fine
Not this time
'Cause you gave away
All the secrets of you and I
This broken heart was stronger then
Now I can't stand to part with this
This broken heart was stronger than
The words I wish you never meant
This broken heartEmbed
