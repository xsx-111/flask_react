Break Myself LyricsI'm on fire
And the day is feeling hopeless
You'd see me burning, but the burning's turning smokeless
Soon I won't feel at all
No
It's electric, the neon hurt inside your phone call
The layered sadness and the madness it revolves
Bringing down the walls where you found love
No
Well, I'm willing to break myself
To shake this hell from everything I touch
I'm willing to bleed for days, more reds and grays
So you don't hurt so much
And now I'm static
As your sky is turning purple and gray
I'm learning that the further that I crawl
The farther that I fall, is that okay?
No
And you're in pieces
As your world becomes a rainstorm
You've got no shelter, I'm a thousand miles away
You won't survive the day
You say you're leaving
You say you're leaving
Well, I'm willing to break myself
To shake this hell from everything I touch
I'm willing to bleed for days, more reds and grays
So you don't hurt so much
So you don't hurt so much
Never again will I fire this gun
No, never again you're the only one
Never again, but you're already gone
I'm willing to break myself
I'm not afraid
I'm willing to break myself
I'm not afraid
I'm willing to break myself
I'm not afraid
Well, I'm willing to break myself
To shake this hell from everything I touch
I'm willing to bleed for days, more reds and grays
So you don't hurt so much
So much
So much
So much
So muchEmbed
