The Runaway Lyrics
If you ran to the end of the earth
I would catch you and you would be safe
If you fell down the well
I would bring you the rope and take all of the pain

All the pain, all the pain
That you hide from me every day

If you're missing, I will run away
I will build a path to you
If you're missing, I will run away
Cause I find myself in you

If I woke up alone
I won't stop 'til I find you and you are with me
Cause by now I know you better than you know yourself
And I know what you really need
What you need, or I need
But either way, this is where you should be
Or I'll bleed so much that you won't believe

You better not, you better not run
You better not, you better not run

If you're missing, I will run away
I will build a path to you
If you're missing, I will run away
I will find you
I will find you
I will find youEmbed
