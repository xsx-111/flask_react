Me And The Moon Lyrics
It's a good year for a murder
She's praying to Jesus, she's pulling the trigger
There's no tears, cause he's not here
She washes her hands, and she fixes the dinner
But soon they'll be coming to rush her away
No one's so sure if her crime had a reason
Reasons like seasons, they constantly change
And the seasons of last year like reasons have floated away
Away with this spilt milk
Away with this dirty dish water, away
Seventeen years, and all that he gave was a daughter

"It's me and the moon," she says
And I got no trouble with that
But i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die
"It's me and the moon," she says

And it's over, but it just started
The blood stained the carpet, her heart like a crystal
She's lucid and departed
A life left behind, she can find in her mind gone away
Away with these nightmares
Away with suburbia
Shake down away, you marry a role
And you give up your soul 'til you break down

But what do you say we go for a ride?
What do you say we get high?
But i'm so tired of days that feel like the night
"It's me and the moon," she says
And I got no trouble with that
But I am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die
I am a butterfly, I am a butterfly, I am a butterfly1Embed
