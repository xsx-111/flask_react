21 and Invincible Lyrics
Some days go by
I wish I were famous or maybe religious
So I could go to heaven just like you
I could have a big house, complain about taxes
And pay off my exes, ain't that livin'
No one makes fun of me cause I can't stand up for myself

Woah, 21 and invincible
Woah, can't wait to screw this up
Woah, 21 and invincible
I'm in power for the hour
I guess today's gonna blow us away

I've got a girlfriend
She tells me she needs me and she loves me
We'll probably get married, oh no
And everyone will bite their tongues so hard they bleed
When my mom hears this song she'll tell me I'm crazy
And she'll say to me, "Son, you're much too young
Go have some fun, don't waste your youth like I did."

And it's been autumn since the day that I met you
If I hit bottom, must I crawl out alone?
And I don't wish to know the secret to summer at all

Woah, 21 and invincible
Woah, can't wait to fuck this up
Woah, 21 and invincible
I'm in power for the hour
I guess today's gonna blow us awayEmbed
