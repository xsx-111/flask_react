Only Ashes Lyrics
Piece by piece and bit by bit
I'll break this down for you real slow
But I can't whisper all of this
And I can't seem to let this go

So I'll watch the matches turn to ashes
I'll watch the matches turn to ashes

I can tell as you turn
I smell the sulfur so clear
And fire's a beautiful sound
And the wings that you burn turn to ashes, my dear
And ashes just fall to the ground
Yeah, we're only ashes

Part by part and inch by inch
You'll have your mile when it's through
Incinerate what's left of this
And torch the part of me that's you

So I'll watch the matches turn to ashes
