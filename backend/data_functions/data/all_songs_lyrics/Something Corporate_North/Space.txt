Space Lyrics
Home, is this a quiet place where you should be alone?
Is this where the tortured and the troubled find their own?
I don't know, but I can tell this isn't you, your cover's blown
Oh no, don't you dare hang up this phone

Hey!
Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

In this place, a lonely escapade in outer space
There's no antidote for irony, you say
That you have when you know that you don't
And you say that you can when you know that you won't

Hey!
Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

Hey!
Give me space but I can't breathe
Give me space but I can't sleep
Give me just one inch, I swear that's all I need
These padded walls and TV screens
Sometimes they make me want to scream
Ah-eh-eh!

Hey!
Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

Hey!
Give me space but I can't breathe
Give me space but I can't sleep
Give me just one inch, I swear that's all I needEmbed
