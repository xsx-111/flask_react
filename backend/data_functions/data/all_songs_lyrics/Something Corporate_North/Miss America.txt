Miss America LyricsAnother lonely night in Amersterdam
And stars are coming out in waves
I miss my Miss America in Park Hotel
But I'm too stoned to call it a day
And when everything you wanted
Is to hide behind your eyes
And I'm locked in my hotel room
Turning over our goodbyes
I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it
Another lonely night in Amsterdam
And water's moving through the sound
The blood is boiling in my veins
And the food I can't keep down
And I don't care if you don't love me
And I don't care if you don't change
I could live inside the shadow that I cast for you
And the myth that you would stay
And I'll be home before the morning comes
You won't have to be alone
I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it
You don't have to see me this way
Cause this way I'm okay
I will write this down, I will write this down
Oh love, I'm tangled up, again
Oh love, when does this twisting end?
When does this twisting end?
I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it
You won't have to see me this way
Cause this way I'm okay
I will write this down for you
So you can read itEmbed
