Unravel LyricsWhile you were away my heart comes undone
Slowly unravels in a ball of yarn
The devil collects it and with a grin
Our love in a ball of yarn
You'll never return it
When you come back we'll have to make new love
You'll never return it
When you come back we'll have to make new love
You'll never return it
While you were away my heart comes undone
Slowly unravels in a ball of yarn
The devil collects it and with a grin
Our love in a ball of yarn
You'll never return it
When you come back we'll have to make new love
You'll never return it
When you come back we'll have to make new love
You'll never return it
New love ohhhhEmbed
