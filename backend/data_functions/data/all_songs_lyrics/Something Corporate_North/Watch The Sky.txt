Watch The Sky Lyrics
I'm lost at sea
The radio is jammed, I bet they won't find me
I swear it's for the best
And then your frequency is pulling me in closer till I'm home
And I've been up for days, I finally lost my mind
And then I lost my way, I'm blistered but I'm better
And I'm home

I will crawl
There's things that aren't worth giving up I know
But I won't let this get me
I will fight
You live the life you're given with the storms outside
Some days all I do is watch the sky

This room's too small (it's too small)
It's only getting smaller
I'm against the wall (against the wall)
And slowly getting taller
Here in Wonderland
This guilt feels so familiar
And I'm home
I will crawl
There's things that aren't worth giving up I know
But I won't let this get me
I will fight
You live the life you're given with the storms outside
Some days all I do is watch the sky
Some days all I do is watch the sky

And I think I, I could use a little break
But today was a good day
And I think I, I could use a little break
But today was a good day
And it's a deep sea, in which I'm floating
And still I sink to think that I must

Crawl, there's things that aren't worth giving up I know
When you can't bear to carry me
I'll fight
You live the life you're given with the storms outside
And some days all I do is watch the sky

Today was a good day
Today was a good dayEmbed
