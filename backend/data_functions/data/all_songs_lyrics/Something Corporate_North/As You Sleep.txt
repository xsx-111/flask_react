As You Sleep Lyrics
Close your eyes
And I will be swimming, lullabies fill your room
And I will be singing, singing to only you
Don't forget I'll hold your head
Watch the night sky fading red

But as you sleep and no is one listening
I will lift you off your feet
And keep you from sinking
Don't you wake up yet
'Cause soon I'll be leaving you
But you won't be leaving me

In the car
The radio keeps me searching for your star
A constellation of frustration
Driving hard
Singing my thoughts back to me
Like watching heartache on TV


Don't forget I'll hold your head
Watch the night sky fading red
