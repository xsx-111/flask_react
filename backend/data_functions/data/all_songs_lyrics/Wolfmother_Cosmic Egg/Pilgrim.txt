Pilgrim LyricsHey there gypsy, walk without a sound
See those people try to put you down
She's got wisdom inside her hand
For no good reason ever could be found
With all the people living in this town
Searching for wisdom inside the sand
She's got hands that go inside my mind
She's got hands that go inside my mind
This time I think I'm feeling fine
Somehow they seem, seem to get around
Giving the message of the underground
She's got that wisdom inside her hand
She's got hands that go inside my mind
She's got hands that go inside my mind
I think I'm feeling fine
With the thoughts that you have or that you find
It can confuse you some of the time
It's like you're chasing smoke into the night
Somebody changing to the call of the wild
She's got hands that go inside my mind
I think I'm feeling fineEmbed
