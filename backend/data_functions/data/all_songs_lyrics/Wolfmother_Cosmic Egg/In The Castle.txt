In The Castle LyricsWould you like to walk into the kingdoms of the sun?
We can walk into the fields and see where it begun
She could be the answer to your anything
She could take you anywhere that you have never been
Stagger alone into the crowd, could not define
She's sitting down beneath the crowd drinking her wine
All alone, the answer to everything
All alone, it's another way out
I'm only looking for a way out
And I've been looking for a way out
Would you like to walk into the kingdoms of the sun?
We can walk into the fields and see where it begun
She could be the answer to your everything
She could take you anywhere that you have never been
Stagger alone into the crowd, could not define
She's sitting down beneath the crowd drinking her wine
All alone, it's another way out
All alone, it's another way out
And I've been looking for a way out
And I've been looking for a way out
Would you like to go into the kingdoms of the sun?Embed
