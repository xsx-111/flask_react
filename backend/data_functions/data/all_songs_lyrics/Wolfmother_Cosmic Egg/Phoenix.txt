Phoenix LyricsVerse 1:
Illumination inside of you
Simplicity is in all we do
Like a landslide falling beneath you
Look to the future is all we can do
Chorus:
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning light
Verse 2:
Highly recommended by someone
With an inclination to enjoy
Misinterpret such a simple life
With one eye to satisfy
Chorus:
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning light
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning light
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning lightEmbed
