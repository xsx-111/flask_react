California Queen Lyrics
Slipped off into the slip stream
She's looking for the summer dream
Came down from the mountain
To find another machine
Running down all the byways
Listen to all that she says
Couldn't see very far

Find out all that you are
My California Queen

Fully air-reconditioned
Self-made man machine
With a homemade hydroponic

Way to find out what it means
My California Queen

Standing in front of the rainbow
Could you tell me where do all the people go?
Rising from the mystic haze
Standing in front of all creation
With all their mystic ways
They seem to control the days
Somebody got to get behind it

To find out all that it means
My California Queen
Oh, tell me what it means
My California Queen

Standing in front of the rainbow
Could you tell me where do all the people go?
Rising from the mystic haze
Standing in front of all creationEmbed
