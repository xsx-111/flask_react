In The Morning Lyrics
When you wake up in the morning
And look into her eyes
And everything you're dreaming of
Is far beyond the skies
I believe we're going on
Into the open void
Far across the sky
Never wondering why

Oh, my little girl
Look into the other side, you'll find the time

Everybody's got a story
Everybody's got their own
Do you feel any better
When you find you're not alone?
As you lay on down
And look into the sun
And you see somebody that reminds you
Of where you're coming from

Oh, my little girl
Look into the other side and you'll find you've begun
Never have I felt like this before
Though sometimes well I've seen an open door
Just like a stone until it's thrown
Listen to the tone where the truth can make itself known
Said the sun to the mountainside
You will never find 'til you try
All their words cut like a knife
You're gonna have to stand up sometime

Wondering how did it all
Ever turn out this way?
Even those who stand so tall
Can no longer say
Anytime you've fallen down
Anytime you're far away
May you never need to justify
Everybody's got their own way

Look into the other side and you'll find you've begun

Never have I felt like this before
Though sometimes well I've seen an opening door
And everywhere you look, when you look into the book
Well, I can't believe that you've never been here before
Said the sun to the mountainside
You will never find 'til you try
All their words cut like a knife
You're gonna have to stand up sometimeEmbed
