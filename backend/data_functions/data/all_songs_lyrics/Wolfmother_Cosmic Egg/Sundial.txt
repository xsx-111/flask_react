Sundial Lyrics
In time you will find
Many things found in the ordinary
Could it be what you see
Many things are extraordinary?
Every time when I look at you
Well, I seem to find another thing behind the story
Every time when I look at you
Well, I seem to find another dream behind the glory

And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders
How could you see nothing at all?
The sundial wonders

Took a walk in the park
I work another round in the after hour
Sometimes people like
To take away all of your love and power
Every time when I look into
Well, I seem to find another scene behind the story
Every time when she looks at you
Well, I seem to find another dream behind the glory
And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders
How could you see nothing at all?
The sundial wonders
And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wondersEmbed
