Violence Of The Sun LyricsLook into the sky, never wondered why
The violence of the sun
See all the little games of, think they all fall apart
Of what they have become
Could you see another way?
Oh, I don't need to say
Well, I've seen another way
And I need to explain
Look into her eyes, see it's a colored sky
What we have become
All the little children, playing the game of life
The violence of the sun
Well, I seen your other way
Out of everything I say
Well I've seen another way
When I look into your eyes I see your heart
May you never believe me
Well, I woke up and tried to see me
Well, you gotta know, what you gotta say
Baby, I need loveEmbed
