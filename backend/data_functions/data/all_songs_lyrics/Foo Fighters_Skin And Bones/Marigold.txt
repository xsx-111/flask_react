Marigold LyricsHe's there in case I won it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's scared in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
Chorus:
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
He's there in case I won it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's there in case I won it all
He's scared 'cause I want
(chorus)
He's there in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's there in case I won it all
He's there 'cause I won
(chorus)Embed
