Adelaide Lyrics
You're repeating me lines that you think I wanna hear
But I don't wanna hear anymore
As if sorry is any consolation
For what it's worth, you're stringing me along
Sh-sh-shouldn't need anyone
Shouldn't need anyone
Just scared of being alone
But by the time you figure this out
And I'm already gone

Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene

You keep giving me signs that you think I wanna see
But you're nothing like you seem
Hide behind your half smile
But the truth is so undeniable
Sh-sh-shouldn't need anyone
Shouldn't need anyone
Just scared of being alone
But by the time you figure this out
And I'm already gone
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene

Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
Some things in life are unforgettable
Like love, loss, lies and us and woh ohh
Some things in life are undeniable
Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
Some things in life are unforgettable
Like love, loss, lies and us and woh ohh
Some things in life are undeniable

Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a sceneEmbed
