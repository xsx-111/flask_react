Dismantle.Repair. Lyrics
One last glance from a taxi cab
Images scar my mind
Four weeks've felt like years
Since your full attention was all mine
The night was young and so were we
Talked about life, God, death, and your family
Didn't want any promises
Just my undivided honesty

And you said
"Oh, oh, things are gonna change now for the better (and)"
"Oh, oh, things are gonna change. Oh, they're gonna change"

I am the patron saint of lost causes
A fraction of who I once believed
(Change)
Only a matter of time
Opinions I will try and rewrite
If life had background music
Playing your song
I've got to be honest - I tried to escape you
But the orchestra plays on
And they sing
"Oh, oh, things are gonna change now for the better (and)"
"Oh, oh, things are gonna change"

Hands like secrets are the hardest thing to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me
Hands like secrets are the hardest thing to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me

Give me time to prove
To prove I want the rest of yours (Prelude)
Call this a prelude to a lifetime of you
It's not that I hang on every word
I hang myself on what you repeat
Its not that I keep hanging on
I'm never letting go

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me
Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me
Save me from myself
Save me from myself
Help me
Save me from myself
Save me from myself

Oh, oh, things are gonna change now for the better
Oh, oh, things are gonna change

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me
Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me
Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me
Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, (Repair) you dismantle me, you dismantle me1Embed
