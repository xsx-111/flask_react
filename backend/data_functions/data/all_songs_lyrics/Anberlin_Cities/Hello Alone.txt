Hello Alone Lyrics
Is this where the interstate ends?
In coastal towns like this
Waiting for my world to cave under
We seem to invent ourselves
In places left unknown
If hope could only find me out

Is this the end of everything we know?
This is the end of everything I am

Is anybody out there? Hello, hello
Broken hearts like promises
Are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there? Alone, Alone
Because the coldest winters thrive

Depression is the unholy ghost
In the coastal town ahead
Though I know a thousand names
I seem my only friend

I've got the gun, all I need is ten cents for the bullet
I feel helpless, sleeping at best. Waiting for your return
Are you ever coming home?
Is anybody out there? Hello, hello
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there? Alone, alone
Because the coldest winters thrive on broken homes. (Broken Homes)

Does anybody, (does anybody)
Do they ever listen, (Do they ever listen)
Does anybody, (does anybody)
Care at all?
Do they care at all? Do they care at all?
Do they care at all? Do you care at all?
Do you care at all!?

Is this the end of everything we know?
This is the end of everything I am

Is anybody out there? Hello, hello
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there? Alone alone
Because the coldest winters thrive on broken homes
Is anybody out there? Hello, hello
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there? Alone alone
For lesser known
I'm here and there's hope. There's hopeEmbed
