Godspeed Lyrics
Burning down Neverland (scatter the ashes)
White lines, black tar, the matches
Is this another death by misadventure?
Tell me what you got, what you really got (Hey! Hey!)
We'll rest in our graves
Lexington, course your veins
Sleepers can't just wake the dead
When needles and lovers collapse on guilty beds

Fall asleep (Don't fall asleep)
Don't fall asleep
(They lied when they said that the good die young)

They lied when they said the good die young
Whoa-oh-hoa-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight

Burning down bridges now (Scatter the ashes)
Godspeed to all you're after
Is this a life left just to remember?
Tell them who you were, who you really were (Hey! Hey!)
Kill yourself slowly over time (Over time)
Fashion statement suicide (Suicide)
She's asleep in the Chelsea hotel
Bad turns to worse and the worst turns into Hell
Fall asleep (Don't fall asleep)
Don't fall asleep
(God save the eyes that dim tonight)

They lied when they said the good die young
Whoa-oh-hoa-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight

Whoa-oh-hoa-oh

They lied when they said the good die young
Whoa-oh-hoa-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight
They lied when they said the good die young
Whoa-oh-hoa-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonightEmbed
