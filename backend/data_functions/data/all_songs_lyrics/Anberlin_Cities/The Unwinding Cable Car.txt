The Unwinding Cable Car Lyrics
Your motive, unstable
You're like an unwinding cable car
Listening for voices, but it's the choices that make us who we are
Go your own way, even seasons have changed
Just burn those new leaves over
So self-absorbed, you've seemed to ignore
The prayers that have already come about

This is the correlation of salvation and love
(Don't drop your arms)
Don't drop your arms, I'll guard your heart
With quiet words I'll lead you in
Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la
Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la

Backing away from the problem of pain you never had a home
You've been misguided, you're hiding in shadows for so very long
Don't you believe that you've been deceived
That you're no better than
The hair in your eyes, it never disguised
What you're really thinking of

This is the correlation of salvation and love
(Don't drop your arms)
Don't drop your arms, I'll guard your heart
With quiet words I'll lead you in
This is the correlation of salvation and love
(Don't drop your arms)
Don't drop your arms, I'll guard your heart
With quiet words I'll lead you in
You're so brilliant, don't soon forget
You're so brilliant, grace marks your heart
You're so brilliant, don't soon forget
You're so brilliant, grace marked your heart
You're so brilliant (This is the correlation)
Don't soon forget (Between salvation and love, don't drop your arms)
You're so brilliant (I'll guard your heart)
Grace marked your heart (With quiet words I'll lead you in and out of the dark)
Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la
(Don't drop your arms)
Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la

This is the correlation of salvation and love
(Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la)
(Don't drop your arms)
Don't drop your arms, I'll guard your heart
(Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la)
With quiet words I'll lead you in
This is the correlation of salvation and love
(Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la)
(Don't drop your arms)
Don't drop your arms, I'll guard your heart
(Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la)
With quiet words I'll lead you inEmbed
