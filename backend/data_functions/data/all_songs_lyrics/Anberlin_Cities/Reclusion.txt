Reclusion Lyrics
There's someone inside me
That softly kills everyone around
They don't know they're dead to me cause
Intent never makes a sound
All along they've found I've strangled
Lovers who've learned from slower hands
In these eleven minutes I could teach you what I am

You're sick
Sick as all the
Secrets that you deny
Sins like skeletons are
So very hard to hide
You're sick
Sick as all the
Secrets that you deny
Sins like skeletons are
So very hard to hide

There's an art in seclusion
Production in repression
If a stranger turns up missing
This song is my confession
Tell the tales of the trail of dead
Lovers learned from slower hands
Losing self in myself
And my demons make demands
You're sick
Sick as all the
Secrets that you deny
Sins like skeletons are
So very hard to hide
You're sick
Sick as all the
Secrets that you deny
Sins like skeletons are
So very hard to hide

You're suffocating me
So very hard to breathe
My mask is growing heavy
But I've forgotten who's beneath

You're sick
Sick as all the
Secrets that you deny
Sins like skeletons are
So very hard to hide
You're sick
Sick as all the
Secrets that you deny
Sins like skeletons are
So very hard to hide1Embed
