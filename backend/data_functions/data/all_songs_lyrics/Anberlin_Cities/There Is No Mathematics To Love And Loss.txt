There Is No Mathematics To Love And Loss Lyrics
If you're leaving, leave the cigarettes
You've already got the lighter and the keys
She packs her boxes
He knows that she's serious
Not by the look in her face but by the lack of rings
Words lost their meaning long ago
Right around the time when she let him know

Oh oh oh oh ohoh oh oh

Have you ever heard a word?
Rather be lonely in love, than alive with you and dead
Have you ever heard a word?
Hear me out this time (Hear me out this time)
Have you ever heard a word?
Rather be lonely in love, than alive with you and dead
Have you ever heard a word?
Hear me out this time (Hear me out this time)

There is algebra in gasoline
Burning pictures, pages and photographs
Fire can make a conscience clean
(Strike the match, we'll see, Strike the match we'll see)
Rolls the window down, calls his name and pulls away
Rethinks every word he's said in disarray
Watched their house burn and in turn
(What made it home, drive away, What made it home, drive away)
Have you ever heard a word?
Rather be lonely in love than alive with you and dead
Have you ever heard a word?
Hear me out this time (Hear me out this time)
Have you ever heard a word?
Rather be lonely in love than alive with you and dead
Have you ever heard a word?
Hear me out this time (Hear me out this time)

Where does one start
To pick up pieces
Of a gasoline heart?
When all he has is driving away

Have you ever heard a word?
Rather be lonely in love than alive with you and dead
Have you ever heard a word?
Hear me out this time (Hear me out this time)
Have you ever heard a word?
Rather be lonely in love than alive with you and dead
Have you ever heard a word?
Hear me out this time (Hear me out this time)Embed
