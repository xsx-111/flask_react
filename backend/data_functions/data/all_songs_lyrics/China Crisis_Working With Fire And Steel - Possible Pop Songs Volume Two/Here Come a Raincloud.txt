Here Come a Raincloud LyricsWatching the rainclod take over me
Watching my people
What do I see?
Nothing but hardship
The poorer we are
We're living in danger of going too far
So here I am
Can you understand?
So much to lve for
In so ittle time
So many places
All I have seen
Watching the sunrise
They dream and they dream
So here I am
Can you understand?
So much to lve for
In so ittle time
Watching the raincloud
Take over me
Watching the sunset
The end of a dream
So here I am
Can you understand?
So much to lve for
In so ittle timeEmbed
