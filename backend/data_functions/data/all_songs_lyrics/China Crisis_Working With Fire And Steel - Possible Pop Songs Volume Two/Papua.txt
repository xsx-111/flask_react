Papua LyricsIn another time in another place
Carry the flag a picture of disgrace
South pacific soldier mountain-moving men
Children turn away
Just before the blast
Falling to the floor
And praying for the last time
Time to remember and lay another wreath
Blowing down kisses to my lover dead beneath
South pacific sailor movie-making men
Children turn away
Just before the blast
Falling to the floor
And praying for the last time
High above the church tower paint my house black
Move out to the country and never lookin back
South pacific soldier mountain-moving menEmbed
