Hanna Hanna LyricsHanna Hanna, she sing
Mixed emotion and a garden strange
Hanna Hanna, she sing
We're living on a catwalk, catwalk
And swimming with the sharks
Tape record her and telephone
Conversations in pyramids alone
Why should I stop to think what they're about
Why should I stop, stop to think what they're about
We're living on a catwalk, catwalk
And swimming with the sharks
Biting into poison, poison
In a city all full of fucking sharks
She sing
A guitar plays
In a garden strange
Hanna Hanna, she dream
Mixed emotion and a garden strange
She never there, she never there
Hanna Hanna, she dreamEmbed
