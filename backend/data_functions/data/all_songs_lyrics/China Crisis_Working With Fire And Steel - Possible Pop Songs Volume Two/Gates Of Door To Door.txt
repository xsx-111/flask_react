Gates Of Door To Door LyricsShe, sleep, dreams of childhood
Waiting in the fields
First love kept secret
Hide behind the tree
She dreams of childhood
And I dream of her
She, sleep, dreams of leaving
Drives past her friends
The rain fell so heavy
She could not see me there
She dreams of leaving
And I dream of herEmbed
