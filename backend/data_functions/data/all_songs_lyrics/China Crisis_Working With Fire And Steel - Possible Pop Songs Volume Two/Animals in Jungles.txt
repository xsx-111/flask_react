Animals in Jungles LyricsRattlesnakes into water
And when they bite, bite I bleed
We're animals in jungles
We're animals
I could go, I could go swimming
I nearly had
I nearly had a goodtime
I could go, I could go swimming
I nearly had
I nearly had a goodtime
I nearly had her
Tropical freedom, my heaven explained
And dolphin love, the ocean wave
We're animals in jungles
We're animals
I could go, I could go swimming
I nearly had
I nearly had a goodtime
I could go, I could go swimming
I nearly had
I nearly had a goodtime
I nearly had her
Summer lawn
And party fun in high rise flats
We're animals in jungles
We're animalsEmbed
