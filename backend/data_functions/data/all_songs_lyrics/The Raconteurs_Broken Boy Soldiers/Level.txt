Level Lyrics
My baby's on the level
I try to read her mind
She's on the straight and narrow
I'm guessin' all the time
But I can't see the road
If I'm lookin' at the signs
I'm carryin' a load
And steppin' out of line

My baby's on the level (My baby's on the level)
I try to read her mind (I try to read her mind)
She's on the straight and narrow (She's on the straight and narrow)
I'm guessin' all the time (And I'm guessin' all the time)
Oh, well, how can I see the road? (How can I see the road?)
If I'm lookin' at the signs (If I'm lookin' at the signs)
I'm carryin' a load (I'm carryin' a load)
And steppin' out of line8Embed
