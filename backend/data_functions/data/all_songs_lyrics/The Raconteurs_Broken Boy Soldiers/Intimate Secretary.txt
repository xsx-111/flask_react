Intimate Secretary Lyrics
I've got a rabbit, it likes to hop
I've got a girl and she likes to shop
The other foot looks like it won't drop
I had an uncle and he got shot

Is this greeting the type that's meant for me?
Are you part of this kakistocracy?

This ringing in my ears won't stop
I've got a red Japanese teapot
I've got a pen but I lost the top
I've got so many things you haven't got

This fellow's craft is just not for sharing
He's not an intimate secretary

I've got a rabbit, it likes to hop
I've got a girl and she likes to shop
The other foot looks like it won't drop
I had an uncle but he got shot
Then on rubble of scummest malarkey
Down with luck we'll see Ecclesiarchy
That fellow's craft is just not for sharing
He's not an intimate secretary

The exarchy's inspector inquisitor (The ringing in my ears won't stop)
The demockery illustrious master (I've got a red Japanese teapot)
Are you part of this kakistocracy? (I've got a pen but I lost the top)
Is this greeting the type that's meant for me? (I've got so many things you haven't got)1Embed
