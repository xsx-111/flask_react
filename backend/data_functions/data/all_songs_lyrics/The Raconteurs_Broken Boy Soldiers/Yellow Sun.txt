Yellow Sun Lyrics
Yellow sun is shining in the afternoon
I'd really like to tell you but I feel it's too soon
My actions are dictated by the phase of the moon
The phase of the moon
The sun it isn't hiding when it sets on you
It's not a coward like me and I know but it's true
Waiting for the darkness now is all I can do
It's all I can do

And if the sun should follow us into your room
Then the courage will be robbed from me to tell you the truth
The setting sun's the only thing that's shining on you
That's shining on you

You're making me hungry
But what's really funny is it's not sunny anymore

And when I finally told you when the sun has gone
You're laughing cause I thought I was the only one
And the only thing that's left for me is the rising sun
The rising sun
You're making me hungry
You're making me hungry
But what's really funny is it's not sunny anymore
You're making me hungry
You're making me hungry
But what's really funny is it's not sunny anymore

It's not sunny anymore, it's not sunny anymore
It's not sunny anymore, it's not sunny anymore
It's not sunny anymore, it's not sunny anymore
It's not sunny anymore, it's not sunny anymore
It's not sunny anymore, it's not sunny anymore1Embed
