In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion Lyrics
Through vast valleys I wander to the highest peaks
On pathways through a wild forgotten landscape
In search of God, in spite of man
'Til the lost forsaken endless
This is where I choose to tread

Fall, so shall we fall into the nihil?
The nothingness that we feel
In the arms of the pale
In the shadow of the grim
Companion who walks with us

Here is the landscape
(Where is the God?)
Here is the sun
(Has he fallen...)
Here in the balance of the earth
(And abandoned us?)
As I'm stalked by the shadow of death's hand
The fire in my heart is forged across the land

Here at the edge of this world
Here I gaze at a pantheon of oak, a citadel of stone
If this grand panorama before me is what you call God
Then God is not dead

I walked down to a river
And sat in reflection of what had to be done
An offering of crimson flowed into the water below
A wound of spirit from which it floated and faded away
Like every hope I've ever had
Like every dream I've ever known
It washed away in a tide of longing, a longing for a better world
From my will, my throat, to the river, and into the sea
Wash away, fade away


Here is the landscape
(Where is the god?)
Here is the sun
(Has he fallen...)
Here at the edge of the earth
(To ruin?)
As I'm stalked by the shadow of death's hand
My heathen pride is scarred across the land2Embed
