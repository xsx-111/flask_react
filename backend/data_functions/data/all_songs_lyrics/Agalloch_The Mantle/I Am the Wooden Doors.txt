I Am the Wooden Doors Lyrics
When all is withered and torn and all has perished and fallen
These great wooden doors shall remain closed
When the heart is a grave filled with blood
And the soul is a cold and haunted shall of lost hope

When the voice of pride has been silenced
And dignity's fires are but cinders
Their grandeur shall remain untainted

It is this grandeur that protects the spirit within
From the plight of this broken world
From the wounds in her song

I wish to die with my will and spirit intact
The will that inspired me to write these words
Seek not the fallen to unlock these wooden doorsEmbed
