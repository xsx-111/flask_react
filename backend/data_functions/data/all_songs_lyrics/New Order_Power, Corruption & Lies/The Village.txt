The Village Lyrics
When a new life turns towards you
And the night becomes the day
We shall remain forever
Everyone who meets this way

Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours, ooh oh

When the rain falls to the sea
They'll be waiting for you and for me
And the sky reflects our image
Trying to sleep right through our lives

Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth, ooh

I am still here two days later
Same place, same time
And I'm stuck here two years too long
Same place, the wrong time
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The sun, the sea and the hours

Their love died three years ago
Spoken words I cannot show3Embed
