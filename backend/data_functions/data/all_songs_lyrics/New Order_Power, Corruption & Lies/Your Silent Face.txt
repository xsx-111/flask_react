Your Silent Face Lyrics
A thought that never changes remains a stupid lie
It's never been quite the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no colors, just silence

Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care


Sound formed in a vacuum may seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no lyrics, just nothing

The sign that leads the way
The path we can not take
You've caught me at a bad time
So, why don't you piss off?7Embed
