5 8 6 Lyrics

I see danger, danger, danger
All on the corner sent by me
Shadows the ways
Straight away you ran from me

Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling

I hear silence
I hear silence in my heart
From a distance
Turn your back and run from me

Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
When it happens
You will be no friend of mine
Take the first chance
When I am no longer free

Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling

In the future
When you want me in your heart
I won't be there
If you call out in the dark

Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Oh yes, I heard you, heard you, heard you, heard you calling

Can you hear me deep inside?
From these feelings I can't hide
Can you hear me deep inside?
From these feelings I can't hide
Oh, can you hear me deep inside? (Can you hear me calling you?)
From these feelings I can't hide (Can you hear me calling you?)
Can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me calling you?3Embed
