Carnage Lyrics
I always seem to be saying goodbye
And rolling through the mountains like a train
My uncle's at the chopping block turning chickens into fountains
I'm a barefoot child watching in the rain
That stepped into this song
Taken a bow and stepped right out again
I'm sitting on the balcony
Reading Flannery O'Connor with a pencil and a plan
This song is like a rain cloud that keeps circling overhead
Here it comes around again

And it's only love with a little bit of rain
And I hope to see you again

A rain deer frozen in the headlights steps back into the woods
My heart it is an open road where we ran away for good
Look over there, look over there
The sun, a barefoot child with fire in his hair
And then a sudden sun explodes
It was you, it was you and only you

And it's only love driving through the rain
Rolling down the mountains like a train
It's only love and it comes on like a train
Rolling down the mountains in the rain2Embed
