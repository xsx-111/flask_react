Old Time Lyrics
Wide black trees and a field of froth
Bird fly low and you and me and the car are lost
Took a wrong turn somewhere
Into the old time, into the old time, for sure
The trees are black and history
Has dragged us down to our knees
In a cold time
Ah, everyone dreams have died
Wherever you are, darling, I'm not that far behind
I'm not that far behind

By the side of the road is a thing with horns
That steps back into the trees and a child is born
Upon this trembling earth, displays each day
Thrown across the hallucination of your hair
A strip of ordinary sun, a biblical sun
A colonial sun, an enlightened sun
The same sun made always glorious at your head
Well, stopping at a motel and go jumping into bed
Just like the old time
Yeah, wherever you are, darling, I'm not that far behind

A lunatic beauty and a watery moon
You're melting by the motel swimming pool
By the Time I Get to Phoenix on the radio
Her moon to my shooting star
And I'm throwing my bags in the back of the car
Just like the old time, just like old time, baby
And I'm not coming back this time
Ah, like the old days, darling
Like the old days, I'm not coming back this time
Like the old days, darling, like the old days
I'm not coming back this time
Like the old time, like the old time
Wherever you are, darling, I'm not that far behindEmbed
