White Elephant Lyrics
The white hunter sits on his porch
With his elephant gun and his tears
He'll shoot you for free if you come around here
A protester kneels on the neck of a statue
The statue says "I can't breathe"
The protester says "Now you know how it feels"
And he kicks it into the sea

I am a Botticelli Venus with a penis
Riding an enormous scalloped fan
I'm a sea foam woman rising from the spray
And I'm coming to do you harm
With a gun in my pants full of elephant tears
And a seahorse on each arm
With my elephant gun of tears I'll shoot you all for free
If you evеr think about coming 'round here
I'll shoot you in the fucking facе
If you think of coming around here

I'm an ice sculpture melting in the sun
I'm an ice sculpture with an elephant gun
I'm an ice sculpture made of elephant-sized tears
Raining gas and salt upon your heads
The president has called in the Feds
I've been planning this for years
I'll shoot you in the fucking face
If you think of coming around here
I'll shoot you for just for fun
I'm a statue lying on my side, in the sun
With the memory of an elephant
Evaporating before your eyes
And becoming a great grey cloud of wrath
Roaring my salt upon the earth
I will shoot you all for free if you so much as look at me
A time is coming
A time is nigh
For the kingdom
In the sky
Don't ask who
Don't ask why
There's a kingdom in the sky
We're all coming home
For a while
A time is coming
A time is nigh
For the kingdom in the sky
We're all coming home
For a while
A time is coming
A time is nigh
For the kingdom in the sky
We're all coming home
In a whileEmbed
