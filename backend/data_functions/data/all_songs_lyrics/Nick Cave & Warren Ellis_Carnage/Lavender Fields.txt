Lavender Fields Lyrics
I'm travelling appallingly alone on a singular road
Into the lavender fields that reach high beyond the sky
People ask me how I changed, I say it is a singular road
And the lavender has stained my skin and made me strange
The lavender is tall and reaches beyond the heavenly cover
I plough through this furious world of which I'm truly over

And sometimes I hear my name, oh where did you go?
But the lavender is broad and it's a singular road
Once I was running with my friends
All of them busy with their pens
But the lavender grew rare, what happened to them?
Sometimes I see a pale bird wheeling in the sky
But that is just a feeling, a feeling when you die

Where did they go?
Where did they hide?
We don't ask who
We don't ask why
There is a kingdom in the sky
There is a kingdom in the sky
We walk and walk
Across the hills
We walk and walk
Through lavender hills
Where did they go?
Where did they hide?
We don't ask when
We don't ask why
There is a kingdom in the sky
There is a kingdom in the sky
Where did they go?
Where did they hide?
We don't ask who
We don't ask why
There is a kingdom in the sky
There is a kingdom in the skyEmbed
