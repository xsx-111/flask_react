Hand of God Lyrics
There are some people trying to find out who
There are some people trying to find out why
There are some people who aren't trying to find anything
But that kingdom in the sky
In the sky

I'm going to the river where the current rushes by
I'm going to the river where the current rushes by
I'm gonna swim to the middle where the water is real high
Hand of God coming from thе sky
Hand of God coming from the sky
Gonna swim to the middle and stay out thеre for a while
Way down low, way down low
Let the river cast its spell on me
Let the river cast its spell on me
(Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God, hand of God
Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God, hand of God)

Singing boy sitting on the bridge
Singing boy sitting on the bridge
Throwing pennies off the edge, peasants working in the fields
Keep their heads way down low, way down low
Don't want to let on what they know
(Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God)
Way down low, way down low
(Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God)
Grab those pennies, count them, ten
Grab those pennies, count them, ten
Hand of God, never come back up again
Let the river cast its spell on me
(Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God
Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God)
Near a body of water flowing across the bed
Near a body of water spread across the hotel bed
Gonna swim to the middle, never come up again
Let the river cast its spell on me
Let the river cast its spell on me
(Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God, hand of God
Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God, hand of God)
Going to the river where the current rushes by
Going to the river where the current rushes by
Gonna swim to the middle, stay out there a while
(Hand of God, hand of God, hand of God)
Let the river cast its spell on me1Embed
