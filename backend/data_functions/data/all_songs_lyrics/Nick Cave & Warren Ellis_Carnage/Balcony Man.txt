Balcony Man Lyrics
What am I to believe?
I'm the balcony man
When everything is ordinary until it's not
I'm the balcony man
I'm two hundred pounds of packed ice
Sitting on a chair and in the morning sun
Putting on my tap dancing shoes, oh my lap dancing shoes
In the morning sun

I'm the balcony man, I'm Fred Astaire
You think you have a plan until I hit the stairs
I'm two hundred pound bag of blood and bone
Leaking on your favourite chair
I put on my lap dancing shoes in the morning sun

And this morning is amazing and so are you
This morning is amazing and so are you
This morning is amazing and so are you
In the morning sun

What am I to think on this balcony, Fred?
Where everything is amazing that stays in bed
I'm a two hundred pound octopus under a sheet
Dancing round your world with my hands and feet
And this much I know to be true
Yeah, this much I know to be truе
And this much I know to be true
Yeah, this much I know to bе true
This morning is amazing and so are you
This morning is amazing and so are you
This morning is amazing and so are you
This morning is amazing and so are you
This morning is amazing and so are you
This morning is amazing and so are you

You are languid and lovely and lazy
And what doesn't kill you just makes you crazierEmbed
