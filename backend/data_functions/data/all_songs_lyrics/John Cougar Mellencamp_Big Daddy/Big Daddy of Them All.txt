Big Daddy of Them All Lyrics
You used to raise your voice so that it could be heard
Used to shout out your orders and your word was the final word
Do as I say and not as I do
They've taken your picture off the wall
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?

You used to chase your women right into your home
You used to tell them you loved them over the telephone
Now they all see through you and you're sinking like a stone
No one knocking at your door, no one calls
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?

You're sad and disgusted is what you've grown up to be
Bet you had no idea what your dream would turn out to be
But when you live for yourself, hell, it's hard on everyone
But you did it your way and man you did it all
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?

Now you did it your way and man you did it all
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?Embed
