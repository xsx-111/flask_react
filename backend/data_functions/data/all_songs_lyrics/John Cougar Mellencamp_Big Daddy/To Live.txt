To Live LyricsSometimes fly a little high
Then you know better dig yourself
Sometimes get a little lost
Then you know you got to find yourself
Happens to everyone and Lord, I don't know why
I want, I want
I need, I need
I want, I want to live
To see it all
Laugh, touch it all
Sometimes we say silly things
And act like two little kids
Like the tail wagging the dog
We both get hurt by what was said
That's okay, that's allright with me
I'd rather fight with you than lay down and die
I want, I want
I need, I need
I want, I want to live
To see it all
Laugh, touch it all
I want, I want
I need, I need
I want, I want to live
To see it all
Laugh, touch it all
To live, to see it allEmbed
