Let It All Hang Out Lyrics
No parking by the sewer sign
Hotdog my razor broke
Water dripping up the spout
Hey I don't care
Let it all hang out

Hanging from a pine tree by my knees
Sun shining through the shade
Nobody knows what it's all about
It's too much man
Let it all hang out

Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out

Saw a man walking upside down
My TV's on the blink
Make Galileo look like a boy scout
Sorry about that
Let it all hang out

Sleep all day and drive all night
Brain my numb can't stop now
Ain't no doubt
Keep an open mind
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out

Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo
Yeah yeah yeah
Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Raining inside a big brown moon
How's that mess your baby up leg
Eating a Reuben sandwich with sauerkraut
Don't stop now woman
Let it all hang out

Man in the straw house
Sure don't know what he's talkin' about
Don't leave me standing on the front porch, baby
Makes me feel like I'm selling something
Ask me in
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang outEmbed
