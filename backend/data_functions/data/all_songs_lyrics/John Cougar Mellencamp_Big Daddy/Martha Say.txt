Martha Say Lyrics
Martha say she don't need no
Stinking man making no decisions for her
She don't need his money
She don't need him between the sheets
She ain't gonna sleep on the edge of the bed for no stinking man
And that's the way she lives 'cause I saw her last night
Pouring water on a drowning man in the moonlight
Saying

Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother
Hi-de-hi-de-hey now, Martha
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, sister
Say what, hey you, look out, Martha

Martha say she don't need no
Revolver to shoot some idiot down
She can do it with her eyes
She can do it with her smile
She can do it with a conversation just walking down the hall
Man, now ain't that the truth 'cause I saw her take a bite out of
Some macho dude laying some corn ball line on her last night
Saying
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother
Hi-de-hi-de-ho now, Martha
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, sister
Say what, hey you, look out, Martha


Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother (Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother)
Hi-de-hi-de-ho, sister (Hi-de-hi-de-hi, yeah)
Hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-ho, yeah)
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, Martha
Say what, look out, shake it up Martha

Martha say say she ain't changin'
No nothin' for nobody for no damn good reason
It's the way that she wants it, it's the way that she gets it
Well, the girl loves playing hardball
It leaves me in a no win situation
Saying

Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother
Hi-de-hi-de-ho now, Martha
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, sister
Say what, look out, Martha
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother
Hi-de-hi-de-ho now, Martha
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, sister
Say what, hey you, look out, Martha
Martha say she don't need no
Stinking man making no decisions for herEmbed
