Void in My Heart Lyrics
There's a void in my heart
I can't seem to fill
Been a parent, had three children
And a big house on the hill
Hundred dollar in my pocket
And it didn't, didn't buy a thing
Now there's a void in my heart
And a hole in my dreams

Well I poured miles of concrete
And strung wire for telephones
Dug ditches when I was a young boy
When I first left my parents' home
Sang my songs for millions of people
Sang good and bad news
Now there's a void in my heart
And a fire at my fuse

Well I did everything just like they said
So I could find happiness
Went to school and got a college degree
And at my job I did my best
As I sit alone tonight
I see a billion people just like me
With a void in their hearts and running from eternity
There's a void in my heart I can't seem to fill
I do charity work when I believe in the cause
But my soul it bothers me still
Hey, Lord, you made me like I am
Can You heal this restlessness?
Will there be a void in my heart
When they carry me out to rest?Embed
