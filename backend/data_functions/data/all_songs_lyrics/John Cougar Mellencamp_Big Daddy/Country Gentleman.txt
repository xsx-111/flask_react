Country Gentleman LyricsCountry gentleman walked a crooked mile
Got our money in his pocket
Did it all with a very handsome smile
Now, he's livin' it up in a great big office
He ain't a-gonna help no poor man
He ain't a-goona help no poor man
He ain't a-gonna help no poor man
He's just gonna help his rich friends
He ain't a-gonna help no women
He ain't a-gonna help no children
He's just gonna help his rich friends
Country gentleman, we see him on T.V.,
Glad handin' folks and chattin' to the nation
We never knew what really to believe
Just word upon slogan with emotional connection
He ain't a-gonna help no poor man
He ain't a-gonna help no children
He ain't a-gonna help no women
He's just gonna help his rich friends
And in the papers all we'd ever read is
So and so big-shot signed his resignation
Now, country gentleman he wants us to believe
That he's kind and honest with the best intentions
He ain't a-gonna help no poor man
He ain't a-gonna help no children
He ain't a-gonna help no women
He's just gonna help his rich friends
Country gentleman, now there's a bird that flew
High above his nation, prayed on its weakness
Picked our bones and threw it in his stew
Thank God he went back to California
