Mansions in Heaven LyricsThe old paper mill stinks up the beaches
As I walk along the ocean shore
I'm just a plain man, thoughts full of creases
Haven't accomplished much, but I dream of more
Mansions in heaven, I see myself walking with the King
The angels are descending to wrap me up in red velveteen
I don't control much of my home life
I'm not an old man but I'm not young anymore
Haven't kept in contact with any of my good friends
So I live with strangers and sleep on another man's floor
Mansions in heaven, I see myself walking with the King
The angels are descending to wrap me up in red velveteen
As I pack my suit bag 'cause soon I'll be leaving
Going back to the earth which is where I come from
Withstood the heartache
Kept on believing
It ain't winning or losing
Just the singing of the song
Mansions in heaven, I see myself walking with the King
Mansions in heaven
The old paper mill stinks up the beaches
As I walk along the ocean shoreEmbed
