Theo and Weird Henry LyricsHenry worked at Sears or somehwhere
Theo did, too
They both got themselves a van together;
Nineteen seventy-two, Ford
Drove around all night long playing music very, very loud
Big noise, all the time;
Little legends in a little town
Moments of time they shared together
Moments of time between two friends
Standing on street corners with shirts unbuttoned
There was a moment in time they swore they were friends to the end
Couple of wild boys
They told me they could hear the grass grow
Theo used to say, hey Henry, man
I'm screwin' this cat
You're just holdin' it
I never knew what they was talking about
But they laughed like they both thought it was funny
Theo and weird Henry went chasing after something
And neither one of them believing in nothing
Moments in time they shared together
Called themselves the "He-man women lovers club,"
Throwin' pop bottles against the wall just to get some attention
There was a moment in time they swore they were friends until the end
Theo's out there living it up doing a little earth shaking -somewhere
Henry sent a postcard from a better place
But I can see them both sitting there laughing and breathing
I can still see that smile on weird Henry's face
Moments in time they shared together
Moments in time between two friends
Dancing on that old van with their shirts wide open
That was a moment in time they swore they were blood brothers until the endEmbed
