Pop Singer Lyrics
Never wanted to be no pop singer
Never wanted to write no pop songs
Never had no weird hair to get my songs over
Never wanted to hang out after the show
Pop singer of pop songs

Never wanted to have my a-picture taken
Now who'd want to look into these eyes?
Just want to make it realâ€”good, bad or indifferent
That's the way that I live and the way that I'll die as a
Pop singer of pop songs
Pop singer of pop songs

Pop singer

Never wanted to be no pop singer
Didn't wanna write no pop songs
Never wanted to have a manager over for dinner
Never wanted to hang out after the show
Pop singer of pop songs
Pop singer writing pop songs
Never wanted to be no pop singer, pop songs
A pop singer
Never wanted to write no pop songsEmbed
