No Sky Lyrics
See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around
See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around

Could you?
Could you keep a secret from me, yeah?
Could you?
Could you keep a secret from me, yeah?

See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around
See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around

When I'm alone, I can see no sky
When I'm alone, I can see no sky
When I'm alone, I can see no sky

Could you?
Could you keep a secret from me, yeah?
Could you?
Could you keep a secret from me, yeah?Embed
