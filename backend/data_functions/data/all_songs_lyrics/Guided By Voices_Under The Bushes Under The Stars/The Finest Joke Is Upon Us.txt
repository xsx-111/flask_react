The Finest Joke Is Upon Us Lyrics
Mother, feeling your hand, eye
Believe you and I did then
And mother, release every bad seed
The geese are leaving the trees

Exposed to winter's cold
They waited too long
But we too exaggerated and now take the cake away
It's a long song and I can't play it so
Give me a grip now, collector of bones

Worlds of smoke
Distorted mirror broken, paradise is open but I choke
One of these days when I see through the smoke
There'll be the day I get the joke


Exposed to winter's cold
They waited too long
But we too exaggerated and now take the cake away
It's a long song and I can't play it so
Give me a grip now, collector of bones
Worlds of smoke
Distorted mirror broken, paradise is open but I choke
One of these days when I see through the smoke
There'll be the day I get the jokeEmbed
