Underwater Explosions Lyrics
Once she was down and she opened
A crate of secrets darker than she
Underwater explosions
Curtains rippling obviously

She can breathe
Since I’ve been tired, she can breathe
And the shocks are bound to please
And she points to me
To insist
On facing the salt and it stings
And certainly that changes things
And she points to me

Cups painted orange and sunburst
Lined up side by side, keeps them so clean
Brightly they shine in the starlight
Darker places I’ve never seen

She can breathe
Since I’ve been tired, she can breathe
And the shocks are bound to please
And she points to me
To insist
On facing the salt and it stings
And certainly that changes things
And she points to me
Sometimes passes through me
And the sound will carry you on
And the sound will carry you onEmbed
