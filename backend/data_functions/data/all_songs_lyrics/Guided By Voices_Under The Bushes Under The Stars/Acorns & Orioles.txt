Acorns & Orioles Lyrics
Over the summer, somehow awaiting
Sometimes craving
And I gave it all away, let my mind slip away
Kept everyone away

I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything

I am the minister, and the impostor
You said I'm on my own
But I am not alone, you are the militant
Fighting to bring me home

I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything

I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I can't tell you anything you...Embed
