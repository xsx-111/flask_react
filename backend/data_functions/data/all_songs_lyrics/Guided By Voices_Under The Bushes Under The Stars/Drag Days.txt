Drag Days Lyrics
Drag days are not so  bad but move too slow
I file them, I want them not to linger so

Now we come to drag days
Now we come to drag days

Fake capes, baby, they're too hard to wear
Put them on and everyone will stare

We have come to drag days
We have come to drag days

We escape them sometimes
And the feeling is different, more intensified
We escape them within the walls
Of our fidgety hearts where we hide

Way on out beyond the factory yards
Up and over the security guards
We have come to drag days
We have come to drag days

We escape them sometimes
And the feeling is different, more intensified
We escape them within the walls
Of our fidgety hearts where we hide

They will turn around
They will turn around
They will turn around
They will turn around
They will turn aroundEmbed
