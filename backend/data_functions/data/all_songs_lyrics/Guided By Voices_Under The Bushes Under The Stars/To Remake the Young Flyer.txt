To Remake the Young Flyer Lyrics
To remake the young flyer
Yes, we must define his high desire
Stand erect and not detect
The anything that we could not admire

From a long line of highmen
Number one, is that the one to send?
To restore all the trial
This and then the national pride, so proud

A question to the lunatic
Does your days seem like nights?
Do your world go together?

Gallant men dash forth, he takes his place
He ends the laughter of the slaughter daughters
Takes his softness from his hand and goes

To remake the young flyer
Yes, we must define his high desireEmbed
