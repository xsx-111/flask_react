Big Boring Wedding Lyrics
I have entered a shiny new realm
A very different and very spoiled world
It’s with great pleasure I introduce myself
To call and thank you for such delicious pie

The irony's sweet, the bird is paralyzed
With one good finger you try me on for size
It’s hard to imagine that you just want to leave
With yellow photos, pocket-sized

Revealing mobility, your psychedelic eye
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind
With nowhere left to go

Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah, the chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah, the chicks are back

The chandelier is spinning and shaking
The fireball is already waking
Revealing mobility, your psychedelic eye
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind
With nowhere left to go

Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah, the chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah, the chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah, the chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah, the chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah, the chicks are backEmbed
