Your Name Is Wild Lyrics
Time to say to you, my child
Your name is Wild
And if you call me in, I'll change the color
Your name is Wild
And I'll be taking you soon now
To read the orange signs
And I say now to you, "So what?"
The useless fade in time
You chose me to read you no lies
Hooray for the day
And I'll pray for the angels to keep you, my child
You are safer now
God knows it, too

Time to say to you, my child
Your name is Wild
And if you call me in, I'll change the color
Your name is Wild
And I'll be taking you soon now
To read the orange signs
And I say now to you, "So what?"
The useless fade in time
You chose me to read you no lies
Hooray for the day
And I'll pay the angels to keep you, my child
You are safer now
God knows it, tooEmbed
