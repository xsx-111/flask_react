Look at Them Lyrics
It's crippling
Never really knowing
We're huddling where it's always nice

And plus there is a flame
A flame that should be hot
In spite of being small and being still
Following wherever you will

Look at them
Theyâ€™re sensitive
And they inch out, look at them

And plus there is a flame
A flame that should be hot
In spite of being small and being still
Following wherever you willEmbed
