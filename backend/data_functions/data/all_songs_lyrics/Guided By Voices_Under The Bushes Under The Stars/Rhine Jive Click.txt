Rhine Jive Click Lyrics
Crowded gymnasiums, no shortage of knockouts
And a country dance sellathon
Overworked spines, all efforts considered
Ooh
Ooh

But not before the prize is posted
The king-sized electric institute
Is proud to prevent
"Dazzling Rhine Jive Click and His Up-and-Coming Bombardiers"
Al-fucking-right!
Hottest axe in a million yearsEmbed
