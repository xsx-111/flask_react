Redmen and Their Wives Lyrics
Fall out of bed
They're issuing lives for redmen and their wives
Offering hands
And twiddling thumbs for dreams that never come
Often said
"You better not look away, you'll lose the day"

The way I see it, it's already lost
"So then be it," they say

They're sharpening knives
And primitive lives for redmen and their wives
Breadwinner and klutz
And losing it all before the one eye shuts

Well, I see it as paying the price
Nobody feels it these days

Well, I'd like to go and kiss them away
Well, I'd like to know another way
Did you notice that they're taking back lives
From redmen just to
Give them time to find the light
In all the things that bind with fright?
A killer's waking up this time
To rob us clean and leave us blind
We'll never see it shine, we'll never find the time
We'll never see it shine, we'll never find the time
