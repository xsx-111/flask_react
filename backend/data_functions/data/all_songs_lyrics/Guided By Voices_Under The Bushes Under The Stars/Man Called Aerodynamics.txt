Man Called Aerodynamics Lyrics
Find deep within your memory coat
A cricket bag you ate from
Its sweet smiling apology, acceptance awaits you
Don't be afraid to cherish it

Look it up in the bookmobile
Look it up in the gun rack
In the magazine rack, and the map

For it is only after the fence comes down
That the cartoon bubble explodes
And the new party begins

Invitation only, and still in a senator's suitcase
Let them out and dance for the ant god
Like scary magnets to pounce upon command
Upon the man, the man called AerodynamicsEmbed
