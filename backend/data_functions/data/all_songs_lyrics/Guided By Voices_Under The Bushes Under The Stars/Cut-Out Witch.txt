Cut-Out Witch Lyrics
Do you suppose she could change your life?
If she could, then I wish she would
Do you suppose she could save my life?
If she could, then I think she should

It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
Silver threads for her hands, need another stitch
Cold needles in her eyes, then we realize
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch

I wish she'd change this wrong into a right
Say pretty please and I think she might
'Cause if she won't, you will fall and bust
And turn to dust, so I think she must

It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
Silver threads for her hands, need another stitch
Cold needles in her eyes, then we realize
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch

Do you think she can change your life?
Do you think she can change your life?
Do you think she can change your life?
Yeah, do you think she can change your life?Embed
