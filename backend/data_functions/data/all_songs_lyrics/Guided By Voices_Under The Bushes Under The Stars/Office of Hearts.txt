Office of Hearts Lyrics
Roll out the painkillers, we'll have a killer wig-out
Sleepy boys don't look, it's not in the gazette
Or a statistical occurrence, it's octopus caveman
Drinking with the enemy, he's got a girl on every arm

He sits down and circulates
In the office of hearts, he's case-closed middleman
In the office of hearts, he'll steal you away


He sits down and circulates
Come feel the softest parts in the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate
Come feel the softest parts in the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate
Come feel the softest parts in the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate
Come feel the softest parts in the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate
Come feel the softest parts in the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate
Come feel the softest parts in the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate...Embed
