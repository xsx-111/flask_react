Take to the Sky Lyrics
You can do the balloon
Escorted or thwarted by the loon
"Take to the sky!" said the Chinaman's monkey
And you climbed like Einstein
Through the fleshy folds of history's underbelly
And your artwork was unusual
And your scientific program's phenomenal

Take to the sky

My, my inferior
My inferior ranking has been…
I see the coolest…
I choose that directionEmbed
