Lord of Overstock LyricsStraight to the lord of overstock
Who spoke for the millionth turn
Don't be late, for the superdeal will save you a lot
And take every cent you earn
Following tips, his overfed rats
Said, "Trust in the king of overstock
Invest in his wisdom and learn
There's less to go around if everyone counts
But if you've got the money to burn
Then you will be in always good faith
For what you are worth in heaven on earth"Embed
