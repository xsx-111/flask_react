Bright Paper Werewolves Lyrics
Come on, polluted eyeballs
Stop scouting out the field
Jump up, bright paper werewolves
And everybody everywhere
Anyone can scratch
And anyone can win
So bring out another batch

They want to get out of here, but they can't find the exits
They cling to the cinema and they canâ€™t find security
Then they finally got recognized
So they left in obscurity and miseryEmbed
