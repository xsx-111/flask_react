Lost Lyrics
- “Are you lost?”
- “Yes.”
- “Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can’t even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, five times more, perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.”
My eyes were jaded
So close to the centre I could not see
But now they are fixed
And glaring at the sacrifice to be made

“I would remind you that scripture tells us, that blessed are the peacemakers. Yet it takes a lot of doing to make peace. It takes a good deal of hard work, building like a mighty cathedral stone by stone block by block.”
“And I sometimes wonder….”
Now that I'm aware of the cycles
I pray that I can deal
Now that I have shown you these cycles
I pray that you can feel
In and out of the stray
Taking the bait
Feeling compelled to obey, betray
The isle of await

“Bewitched… destroyed… abandoned… like someone left for dead… suicide… until a dream begins… in the dream the destroyer is destroyed… now with such simplicity… such clarity… everything falls into place… the destroyer is destroyed… so powerful… control”
Running scared from their thought
Thinking I can summon some ancient truth before wrong
Seeking my nature, our nature with fear of being caught
Or have we been like this all along
Or have we been like this all along
The dawn of birth gives way to men
Age brings dimness to sight as it must
Age brings dimness to sight as it must
Death seals the eyelids on darkness once again
Augmentation of the dust
Or have we been like this all along
Or have we been like this all along1Embed
