Incidental Boogie Lyrics
He left me alone completely
For once I slept deeply
And for this, I thank The Father
But I gotta tell you something that you don't wanna hear
It's the truth and that's never easy to hear
But my new man, well... he ain't that bad
And let me explain to you why...

I do what I want
And I do what I like
Left my hometown
To lie about what no one saw
But I soon found out
I can't expand on my own theme
I needed a partner
To creep in and feel his stead
Life made no sense without a beating, you see?
And life was just too quiet
With no one screaming at me
And then the incidental boogie
Grabbed a hold of me
And I got myself a real man
Who don't hit that hard
So I can still work at my job
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
I'm no closer to free
I'm no closer to free
I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
I'm no closer to free

I still do what I want
And I still do what I like
But now, I got this man to show me that I'm all wrong
He hits me left, he hits me right
All the time, but no marks
No marks, no evidence to see
Don't you know these days I feel so lucky?
To be brutalized means you don't have to think
And life is easy when there is only pain to compete
Life is easy

But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
I'm no closer to free
I'm no closer to free
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
I'm no closer to free
I'm no closer to free
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me
I'm no closer to free
I'm no closer to free
But I wonder what this incidental boogie is really doing for me1Embed
