Rosebud Lyrics
Stop, let's take a moment
You are what you are, I'm no alarmist
One look, if you wanna see
There's a Rosebud for you and one for me

A cage holds you
We've all got one we call home
But in the event of a 9-1-1
Who holds the key is what you need to know

You and you alone, you and you alone
You and you alone, you and you alone
You and you alone, you and you alone
You and you alone
Use those keys and take a drive
Through the back alleys of your mind
Have mercy

You and you alone, you and you alone
You and you alone, you and you alone
You and you alone, you and you alone
You and you alone
Use those keys and take a drive
Through the back alleys of your mind
Have mercy
A cage holds you
We've all got one we call home
In the event of a 9-1-1
Who holds the key is what you need to know

Let's face it
Admit that it's all related
Just try it with eyes closed
You'll make it
It'll hurt, I promise you
What is your Rosebud? You've got to know

The secret won't reach the coast
I see a man in the crowd with a rope
Death arms like a crooked T
No act of telepathy could reveal your Rosebud to me

Let's face it
Admit that it's all related
Don't mess this up now
You'll make it
It'll hurt, I promise you
What is your Rosebud? You've got to know
It'll hurt
It'll hurt
It'll hurt
It'll hurt, I promise you

You and you alone
It'll hurt
You and you alone, you and you alone
It'll hurt
You and you alone, you and you alone
It'll hurt
You and you alone, you and
It'll hurt, I promise you4Embed
