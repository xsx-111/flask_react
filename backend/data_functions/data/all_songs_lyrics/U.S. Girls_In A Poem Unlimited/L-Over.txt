L-Over Lyrics
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love

My lover has no heart
Magic moving blood around that body
He's cool to the touch
I don't see him much
But when I do, he does nothing for me
Persona-driven pleasure
And that's how he gets around
He placed me right before the fire
But I didn't want to
I knew how quickly my skin would burn

Fire on Stone vs. Fire on Flesh
My lover wins the contest
Can you imagine trying to get
Some satisfaction out of a stone?
One would have to wait their whole life and
I resent you for that
A swing and a miss
I weighed all the risks
When I agreed to this charade in the night
My lover, the time has come
I hate to break it to you in this way
Don't ask me
Stop snooping around
Spare me any talk of your future life
I don't know what I'll do without you
Take up worship at some mile's end?
But you said “Betrayal & Pride”
And then you took your time
And now I gotta spell it out for you

O, I'll only say this once
V, I'm very sensitive
E, Everything's a mess
R, I'm repenting that L 'cos it's over
My lover, it's over because

Early is Early, Late is Late
My lover, I got no faith
Can you imagine trying to get
Some satisfaction out of a stone?
One would have to wait their whole life and
I don't got time for that
A swing and a miss
I tried for the hit
I got my thrill
Now get me off of this ride2Embed
