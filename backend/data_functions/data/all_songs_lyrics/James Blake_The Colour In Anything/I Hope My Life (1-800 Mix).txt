I Hope My Life (1-800 Mix) Lyrics
I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind
I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind
I hope my life is no sign of the times
I hope my life is no sign of the times

I've been looking for the golden trees
I don't wanna see the good in all those things (haven't we all, haven't we all, haven't we all...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (haven't we all, haven't we all, haven't we all...)
It's a lot for me to take

Where do we, where do we, where do we...

I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind(where do we, where do we, where do we...)
I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
I hope my life is no sign of the times (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
I hope my life is no sign of the times (where do we, where do we, where do we...)

I've been looking for the golden trees
I don't wanna see the good in all those things (haven't we all, haven't we all, haven't we all...)

Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)

Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it (where do we, where do we, where do we...)
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it3Embed
