Timeless LyricsTimeless, timeless
Timeless, timeless
I can't be selfless
I'm acting my age
You know you slide out when you slide in with graceful shadow
You know you slide out when you slide in with graceful shadow
Timeless
Timeless
Timeless
You know you slide out when you slide in
You know you slide out when you slide in
You know you slide out when you slide in
You know you slide out when you slide in
Timeless
