Noise Above Our Heads LyricsI'll find no peace 'til I know you
'Til I wish you well
'Til I am not the enemy
I'll find no peace 'til I hold my light
Knowing you did right
And your love is everything I need
I'll find no peace 'til I know you
'Til I wish you well
'Til I am not the enemy
I'll find no peace 'til I hold my light
Knowing you did right
I'm here when you don't sleep so well
I hear it every time you fall in love
And every muse who puts on every song
I hear the sound of all the lies
Turn on and off, oh
I deserve someone better than someone like me
Noise above our heads, even in the night
Noise above our heads, even in the night
Especially in the night
All I wanted was to...
We just wanted our own space
And everything you like
Noise above our heads, even in the night
Noise above our heads, even in the night
Especially in the night
We just wanted our own space
And everything we like
I'm here when you don't sleep so well
I hear it every time you fall in love
And every muse who puts on every song
I hear the sound of all the lies
I'll find no peace 'til I know you
'Til I wish you well
'Til I am not the enemy
I'll find no peace 'til I hold my light
Knowing you did right
And your love is everything I need
And your love
I'll halt sleep 'til the...
And your love
I'll halt sleep 'til the...
And your love
'Til I, I'll halt sleep 'til the...
And your love is everything
I'll halt sleep 'til the...
And your love
I'll halt sleep 'til the...
And your love
'Til I, I'll halt sleep 'til the...
And your love
I'll halt sleep 'til the...
And your love
'Til I5Embed
