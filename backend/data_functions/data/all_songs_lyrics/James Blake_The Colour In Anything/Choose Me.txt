Choose Me LyricsI looked into myself like a case with you
You don't weigh me down like you think you do
I'm not looking to hold you down
Have I been unkind to you?
Have I got a cloud in hell of mind?
Down goes the mist
When you keep me at my best
Have I?
Have I, have I?
Have I?
I'd rather you choose me
I know there are places that I can't go with you
Have I?
You say, 'there are always flowers in bloom'
I don't wanna run a ring past you
I'd rather you chose me every day
I'd rather you choose me
I looked into myself like a case with you
Have I?
You don't weigh me down like you think you do
I'm not looking to hold you down
I'd rather you chose me every day
I'd rather you choose me
Down goes the mist
When you need me at the best
I'd rather you chose me
I'd rather you choose me
You don't owe me anything
What could I want back from you?
You don't owe me anything
What could I want back from you?
I will come and pay for it
On any day, on any day you choose
On any day, on any day you choose
I'd rather you choose me every day
Have I?
Have I? Have I?
Have I?
I'd rather you choose me
I know there are places that I can't go with you
You say, 'there are always flowers in bloom'
I don't wanna run a ring past you
I'd rather you chose me every day
I'd rather you choose me
I looked into myself like a case with you
Have I?
You don't weigh me down like you think you do
I'm not looking to hold you down
I'd rather you chose me every day
I'd rather you choose me7Embed
