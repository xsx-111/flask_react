Waves Know Shores LyricsAnd I waited some, and I waited some
You wanna know me like waves know shores
You wanna know me like waves know shores
I'm waiting to see who's mind of gold
Message after message
Message after message
Through your broken turn I hear someone
Who hasn't found what changes them
You wanna know me like waves know shores
You wanna know me like waves know shores
You wanna know me like waves know shores
You wanna know me like waves know shores
Like I know my own self's goals
Like I know my own self's goals
Like I know my own self's goals
Like I know, like I know
All I suggest is
I suggest you love like love's no loss
I suggest you love like love's no loss3Embed
