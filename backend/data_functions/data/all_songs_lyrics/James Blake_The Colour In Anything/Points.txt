Points LyricsI've done so much since
Who better to show it to you
It's sad that you're no longer her
It's sad that you're no longer her
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
But you were made alone
And I was made alone
Now we take our natural road
It's sad that you're no longer her
It's sad that you're no longer her
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer, no longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
From the pull of the rock
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
From the weight of the sky
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her, no longer, no
No longer, no longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her
It's sad that you're no longer her
It's sad that you're no longer her
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her, no longer, no
We're at points
On the tracks we ride
And I know I'll love you for a very long time
Just staying back
Just staying back
Just staying back
I think about mine
Just staying back
Just staying back
Just staying back
When you sing
Please don't think of me
Cause it's way too hard from what I've seen
From what I've seen
From what I've seen
It's sad that you're no longer her
It's sad that you're no longer her
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer
No longer her, no longer, no longer her, no longer, no longer her...3Embed
