I Need a Forest Fire Lyrics
(Another shade, another shadow...)
Hoo
Nice

To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire
(Another shade, another shadow...)
To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire

I'm saved by nature
But it always forgets what I need
I hope you'll stop me before I build a wall around me
We need a forest fire
We need a forest fire
We need a forest fire
We need a forest fire

You're thicker than you think
You know that money bought your name
Caution, swelling, can I repay you with some blame?
To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire
(Another shade, another shadow...)
To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire
(Another shade, another shadow...)
To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire

Stop
Stop before I build a wall around me
Stop before I build a wall around me
Stop before I build a wall around me49Embed
