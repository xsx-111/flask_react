Modern Soul Lyrics
I know crossroads where I see them, see them
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
So I swim to you while I'm sleeping
Through sage green rivers of England

I see the scenery changes, changes
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
When I don't think of you, the willpower
What I didn't see was I was talking to so many people at once
I had no idea I was
I had no idea of the difference between
The way I saw your face and the way it was

Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs

I remember laughing; (because of a few songs) to take that away from you
To take that away from you; (because of a few songs) I remember laughing
I remember laughing; (because of a few songs) to take that away from you (because of a few songs)
To take that away from you; (Because of a few songs) I remember laughing
The smaller the waves;(because of a few songs) you let me down (because of a few songs)
The longer I  (because of a few songs) will defend you
The smaller the waves; (because of a few songs) you let me down (because of a few songs)
The longer I (because of a few songs)  will defend you (because of a few songs)
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I know a crossroads where I see them, see them
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over8Embed
