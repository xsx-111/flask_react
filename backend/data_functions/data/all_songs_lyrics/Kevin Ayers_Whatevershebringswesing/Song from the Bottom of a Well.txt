Song from the Bottom of a Well Lyrics
This is a song from the bottom of a well
There are things down here I've got to try to tell
It's dark and light at the very same time
And the water sometimes seems like wine

I learned some information way down here
That might fill your heart and soul with fear
But don't you worry, no, don't be afraid
I'm not in the magical mystery trade

My imagination begins to purr
As things don't happen, they just occur
Softly crackling electrical smell
There's something burning at the bottom of this well

Sitting here alone, I just have to laugh
I see all the universe as a comfortable bath
I drown my body so my mind is free
To indulge in pleasurable fantasies

There's something strange going on down here
A sickening implosion of mistrust and fear
A vast corruption that's about to boil
A mixture of greed and the smell of oil
This is a song from the bottom of a well
I didn't move here, I just fell
But I'm not complaining, I don't even care
'Cause if I'm not here, then it's not thereEmbed
