There is Loving / Among Us / There is Loving (Medley) Lyrics



Everything you do is true
As long as you believe it
And everything you say is play
And that's how you should treat it
And everyone is high
Until there's something makes them low

That's when you should stay
That's not the time to go
That's when you should stay
And let your love just flow
