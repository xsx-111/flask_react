Oh My Lyrics
Oh my, I really try
But I just don't get anywhere
Yeah, you might say it only seems that way
And I could find something everywhere
And maybe I agree with you
But I'd just like to say this, too (ooh-ooh!)
It's all very fine, if you're really divine
And everybody wants you bad
You can take what you please with the greatest of ease
And nobody will let you be sad

Oh my, the days roll by
I make no connection at all (no, no!)
I drink this wine in the bright sunshine
A-waiting for a star to fall
And I must be like a million souls
Who've got nobody at all
To warm their heart and give them a start
Spinning in the bright blue sky
And the wings of love that could take them above
To places where the penguins fly

But oh my, do I get high
Lady, when I'm next to you
You're so crazy and wild, such a happy child
You make a lot of loving, too (I should say so!)
Oh my, I really try
But I just don't get anywhere
You might say it only seems that way
And I could find something everywhere
And maybe I agree with you
Mmm, but I'd just like to say this, too (ooh!)
It's all very fine, if you're really divine
And everybody wants you bad
You can take what you please with the greatest of ease
And nobody will let you be sad

Oh my, do I get high
Lady, when I'm next to you
You're so crazy and wild, such a happy child
You make a lot of loving, too

You know you doEmbed
