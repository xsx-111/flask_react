Margaret Lyrics
Margaret, you're such a magical child
I found that the first time you smiled
And the more I get to know you
The more I am amazed
To find in someone
Such tender loving ways

And just like everybody sings
When the sunshine makes them high
I sing this grateful love song
From a flower
To a butterfly
From a flower
To a butterfly
From a flower
To a butterfly (to a butterfly)Embed
