Champagne Cowboy Blues Lyrics
Champagne, getting high again
Makes me think of you
Sunshine and this crazy wine
There is loving, too
I don't care how or why

One thing that I think I've learned
Loving must be free
So much energy is burned
In pointless jealousy
I just want to sing for you
Yes I do


Champagne, getting high again
Makes me think of you
Sunshine and this crazy wine
There is loving, too (somewhere)
I don't care how or why
As long as I'm high
Champagne, yeah
Goodbye old horse
Thank you for the use of your body
Hope you had a good time
You got a bit of use out of mine
Goodbye old horseEmbed
