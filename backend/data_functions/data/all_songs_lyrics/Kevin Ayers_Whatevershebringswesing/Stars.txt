Stars LyricsWhat can i give you, girl
Something that you've never had
Something that'll make you glad...
In your heart
What can i show you, girl
Something that you've never seen
Yeah, somewhere that you've never been...
Never been before
What can i tell you
Something that you've never heard;
Can i find a special word
To say what i mean
And, i'm feeling like a million
Sparkling stars;
Floating in the magic of what you are
'cause i'm feeling like a million
Sparkling stars;
Floating in the magic of what you are
What can i give you, girl
I can give my share of time;
That's the only thing that's mine
To give
What can i show you, girl
I can show you all i see
And if you'll believe in me
I won't let you down
What can i tell you
I can tell you anything;
But i know i'd rather sing
Rather sing the song
And, i'm feeling like a million
Sparkling stars;
Floating in the magic of what you are
'cause i'm feeling like a million
Sparkling stars;
Floating in the magic of what you areEmbed
