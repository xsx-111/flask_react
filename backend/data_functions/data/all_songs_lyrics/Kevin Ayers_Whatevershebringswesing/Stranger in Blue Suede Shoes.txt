Stranger in Blue Suede Shoes Lyrics
I walked into this bar and the man refused
He said, "We don't serve strangers in blue suede shoes
We don't give credit and we don't give way
We have to think about what the people might say
You know what I mean?" I said, "Sure, man."

Oh, he gave me a smile that was sickly and wet
And I offered him one of my cigarettes
He took it, afraid that he might appear rude
Then proceeded to sell me some second-class food
Nice guy. Meet 'em everywhere

He said "My oh my, I have suffered too long
And this cigarette seems to be very strong
I don't make the rules, I just get what I take
And I guess every rule was made to break
You can take what you like, it won't hurt me
'Cause I'm just working for the company"
From the green cigarette, he took a long drag
And said "I think I'll pack my travelling bag
I'm tired of cheating and wasting my head
And filling the boss's bags with bread
I want to get out in the sun and rain
And feel the wind on my skin again
The world is large and I've got time yet
And by the way, thanks for that cigarette
Thank you very much"
You know I feel like a new man
Yes I do
I don't know why
I'd just like to say
Thank you very much indeed
It's a beautiful day
I think I'll be on my way right away
I'd like to say
Thank you very much
Yes, I'm getting the hell out of here
Yes, I am
Bye bye
That's the end of the message
Thank you very much
Bye bye
Yes, bye bye!
Bye bye!2Embed
