Whatevershebringswesing Lyrics
I'm looking 'round madly
For something to find
That might give me a front
To put something
Something behind

Just bouncing this ball
Up and down the hall
But it's full of best wishes
And suffocating fishes
And all

So let's drink some wine
And have a good time
But if you really want to come through
Let the good time
Good time have you
It's what you've got to do

You said it was foolish
For me to be sad
But I'm very hungry
And you
You're very well fed
You're such a fat lady
And I'm talking to you
Just for something to do
'Cause I'd much rather kiss you
But I know
I'm gonna miss you again and again
I know I'm gonna miss you

So let's drink some wine
And have a good time
But if you really want to come through
Let the good time
Good time have you
It's what you've got to do
Yeah, let's drink some wine
And have a good time
But if you really want to come through
Let the good time
Good time have you
It's what you've got to do

I sing to the island
That sings in your head
'Cause I know you'd much rather be there
Be there instead
I know you'd rather be there
But you won't find the answer
Even when the wind blows
'Cause the answer, my friend
Is in front
Right there in front of your nose
Everybody knows, it's their nose

So let's drink some wine
And have a good time
But if you really want to come through
Let the good time
Good time have you
It's what you've got to doEmbed
