Fake Mexican Tourist Blues LyricsHey, mister, would you like my sister
Her name is juanita
I think. you'd like to meet her
She's a little bit risky
Drinking always whiskey
But she's really a tiger
Take you right inside her
Hey, mister, got another sister
Her name is dolores
She likes pretty colores;
She's a little bit silly
Eating always chili;
But she's very sexy
Take her home in a taxi
Hey, juanita, juanita banana
Hey, juanita, would you hold my banana;
I'd like it now, I don't mean manana
Hey, brother, what about my mother
She's only just forty
She's especially naughty
She knows a lot a tricks
More than the younger chicks
And if you don't like my mother
I got a very nice brotherEmbed
