Heavy Soul Lyrics
Hear her calling come to me
Thought of her won’t let me be
Go to the valley, climb the hill
Whatever it takes darling, you know I will

Hey now darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling

Hear her calling hurry home
Been so long since I been gone
I won’t get tired won’t go astray
I hear her calling call my name

Hey now darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul
Just my color, just my kind
Got a heavy soul next to mine
Heart's on fire
Get no sleep
Drive all night
No relief

Yeah now darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soul darling
Heavy soulEmbed
