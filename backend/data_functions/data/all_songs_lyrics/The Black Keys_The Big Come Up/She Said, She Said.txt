She Said, She Said LyricsShe said, I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I never was born
I said, who put all those things in your head
Things that make me feel like I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I never was born
She said, you don't understand what I said
I said no no no, you're wrong, when I was a boy
Everything was right
Everything was right
I said, even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Cause you're making me feel like I never was born
She said, she said, she said, she saidEmbed
