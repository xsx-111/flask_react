Busted Lyrics
Well I'm busted, yes I'm busted
But my heart won't let me die
If you feel alright darling
Won't you come around
Won't you come around
'Round, 'Round, 'Round, 'Round

If you love me like I love you
Please won't you let me know
I'll play it all night darling
Walk through my door
Walk through my door
Walk through my door

Door, Door, Door, DoorEmbed
