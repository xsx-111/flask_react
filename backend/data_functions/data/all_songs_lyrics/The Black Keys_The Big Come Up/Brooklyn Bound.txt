Brooklyn Bound Lyrics
Well I hate to leave you, hate to put you down
But that way you love darling
Oh I'm Brooklyn bound
I ain't got no money, no house on that hill
But that way you love darling, no you give me my fare

Well I'm leaving you babe
And say fare you well
Well I'm going out east darling
Hope you burn in hellEmbed
