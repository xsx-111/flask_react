Ladies and Gentleman Lyrics
Well there's a gentleman who's not so gentle
'Cause he's too generous with his chit and his chat
So lately we've been discussing a way to rid this
Disgusting example of ample gossip and gab
All we hear is

Well he's a gentleman who plays a caricature
Of a character he wishes he was
So lately we've been ignoring all his stories as we smile and nod
And let him simply do what he does
So watch out
It's just the way that it goes
It's just the way that it goes
It's just the way that it goes

And everybody's got the same story
We never wanted him here
He showed up anyway
He never would leave us alone
We never wanted him here
He showed up anyway
But maybe that's okay
Well soon this gentleman was barking louder
When his biting harder didn't earn him respect
But lately we've been too proud to admit
That we all might miss him just a bit
Now that he's packed up and left
What did we do?
It's just the way that it goes
It's just the way that it goes
It's just the way that it goes

And everybody's got the same story
We never wanted him here
He showed up anyway
He never would leave us alone
We never wanted him here
He showed up anyway
But maybe that's okay

We never wanted him here
He showed up anyway
He never would leave us alone
We never wanted him here
And now he's gone for good
But maybe we've made a mistakeEmbed
