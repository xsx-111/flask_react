You Owe Me an IOU Lyrics
He was in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, there wasn't much for him to take
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
He'd never change
Tight fisted with his compliments, it didn't seem to bother him
That talk is even cheaper told in bulk
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
He'd never change

And so she yelled at him

You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time

She was in the habit of reapplying makeup
Makeup eaten up by crocodile tears
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
She'd never change
Overtly individual, covertly traditional
She couldn't seem to make up her mind
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
She'd never change

And so he yelled at her

You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time, yeah

Oh, is it real? I don't know
But I'll act as if it is
What's our deal? I don't know
But I'll act as if it is
What I think that it is, if it is
Then this might just work

They were in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, they never quite knew what they had
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder
They'd never change
And so they yelled out loud

You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU, owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU, don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time, yeah
I know what I should get this timeEmbed
