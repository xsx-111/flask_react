Running out of Time Lyrics
Witless, humorous conversation
Has filled me up like an old gas station
I'm wallowing in a pool of gasoline
Self-appointed sheriff of a popular ghost town
I'm open to bribes but I've arrested no one
I'm galloping out to meet my bride to be
She'll woo the saloon then sing us both to sleep

I'm running out of time
Running out of time
Running out of time
I've run out of time

Drop dead gorgeous art history drop out
Thought of her father ought to pay her to clear the whole shop up
She carries her cameras in hand to complete the look
Screenplay player co-writing a screenplay
Cotton candy for the eyes but cotton balls for the brain
He thinks to himself, "Thank God the bar's not too high"
Just look at his face and then you'll see why
Running out of time
Running out of time
Running out of time
Run out of time

Hollywood waiter with a chip on his shoulder
Only break has been his back and yet he's just getting older
He's washing his clothes in a sink of self pity
Retired ball player guest hosting a talk show
Earned a trophy and a wife and twice he's won the lotto
And running away but don't know who from or why
Just look in his eyes and then you'll see why

I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
Run out of time
Running out of time
Running out of time
Running out of time
Run out of
Run out of
Run out of time
Wallowing in a pool of gasolineEmbed
