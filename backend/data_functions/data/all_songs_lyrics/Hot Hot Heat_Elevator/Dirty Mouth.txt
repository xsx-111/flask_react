Dirty Mouth LyricsWash your dirty mouth
Your dirty mouth
Watch your little mouth
Wash your dirty mouth
Your dirty mouth
Watch your little mouth
I don't wanna wait anymore
Wake up cinnamon
They can't get in and that's them at the door
Cuz checkout time is noon and pretty soon it's a quarter to four
I don't wanna wait anymore
Wash your dirty mouth
Your dirty mouth
Watch your little mouth cuz you taste like you're already gone
Small town girls and boys make too much noise so I keep to myself
But acting tough is rough - enough is enough - I feel like hell
Tied up in London, you came undone with a two handed tug
With pieces of a phone, thrown at the door, spread out on the rug
I don't wanna wait anymore
Wash your dirty mouth
Your dirty mouth
Watch your little mouth cuz you taste like you're already gone
Wash your dirty mouth
Your dirty mouth
Watch your little mouth cuz you taste like you're already gone
I gotta say I cannot wait
Not even one more night or day
Why don't you fly and get away
And end this awful holiday
Come and play, come and stay, and end this awful holiday
I gotta say I cannot wait
Not even one more night or day
Why don't you fly and get away and end this awful holiday
Wash your dirty mouth
Your dirty mouth
Watch your little mouth cuz you taste like you're already gone
Wash your dirty mouth
Your dirty mouth
Watch your little mouth cuz you taste like you're already goneEmbed
