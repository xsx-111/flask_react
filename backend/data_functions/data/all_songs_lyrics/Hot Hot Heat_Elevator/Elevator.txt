Elevator LyricsBlame me for the Elevator - I know
You will
It's not me who's the operator but you're
Going down
You'll be sorry when you're singing
All alone
But don't take me up
I'll just fall down once again
Don't take me up
I'll just fall down
Wake me when you're educated - I know
You will
You'll be self-medicated - you're
Spinning round
You'll be there, but no one will even know
Your name
But don't take me up
I'll just fall down once again
Don't take me up
I'll only find my way back down
Don't take me up
It's true I've dabbled at times with confident
Lines
I was half of a man nearly half of the time
In an innocent way, i thought it could stay
With us both on the ground
With us fooling around
Let's just stay on the ground
Let's stay fooling around on the ground
Don't take me up
I'll just fall down like I knew that I would
Don't take me up
I'll only find my way back down
Don't take me up
I'll just fall downEmbed
