Shame on You Lyrics
Shame on you for getting wet
Now who will dry your eyes?
Shame on you for getting wet
How can you act surprised?

Running with scissors wasn't smart
I tripped and cut open your heart
I didn't mean to, but I seem to
Have pushed us back to the start
In the wake of my mistake
I felt your voice starting to shake
Timing couldn't have been worse
For me to be this far away
This far away

Shame on you for getting wet
Now who will dry your eyes?
Shame on you for getting wet
How can you act surprised?

Traveled the world under your spell
Cast on me in a motel
It turned my rainclouds into rainbows
But I couldn't even tell
As days apart turned in to weeks
My memory played hide and seek
While I was playing show and tell
I took your trust and set it free
Set it free

Shame on you for getting wet
Now who will dry your eyes?
Shame on you for getting wet
How can you act surprised?


Shame on you for getting wet
Now who will dry your eyes?

Shame on you for getting wet
Now who will dry your eyes?
Shame on you for getting wet
How can you act surprised?

Running with scissors wasn't smart (Shame on you for getting wet)
I tripped and cut open your heart
I didn't mean to, but I seem to (Now who will dry your eyes?)
Have pushed us back to the start
In the wake of my mistake (Shame on you for getting wet)
I felt your voice starting to shake
The timing couldn't have been worse (How can you act surprised?)
For me to be this far awayEmbed
