Hate LyricsI hate my hair, I hate my clothes
I hate my eyes, I hate my clothes
I never have to  I hate my job
I hate me, put the goddamn sloth
I hate my car, I hate my bank
I hate everything, even what I like
I hate to eat, I hate to drink
I hate to know, I hate to think
I hate my toes, I hate my heels
I hate my  I hate my 
I hate my shoes, I hate my deets
I hate my house, I hate my street
I hate my mom, I hate my dad
I hate thĞµ good, I hate the bad
I hate to laugh, I hatĞµ to cry
I hate you do, I hate you trying
But other than that I can't complainEmbed
