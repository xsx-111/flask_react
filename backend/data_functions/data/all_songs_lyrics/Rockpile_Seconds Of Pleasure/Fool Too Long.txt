Fool Too Long LyricsI should have realized babe a long time ago
When you told me that you loved me but you didn't any more
You ran around with anyone all behind my back
You asked me to forgive you I went and took you back
Well I thought you learned your lesson then
But now I see it happen again
And I've been a fool too long
I had you figured out all wrong
I've been a fool too long
And I ain't gonna be a fool no more
I should have seen the signs babe the writing on the wall
When all those other guys started coming round to call
You told me that you changed but that was just a lie
When you said I was your only I was just another guy
Well if I'm the one who pays the rent
I gotta have one hundred percent
'Cause I've been a fool too long
I had you figured out all wrong
I've been a fool too long
And I ain't gonna be a fool no moreEmbed
