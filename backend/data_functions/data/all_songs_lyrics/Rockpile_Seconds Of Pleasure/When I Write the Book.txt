When I Write the Book LyricsNow I can remember like it was only yesterday
Love was young and foolish like a little child at play
But oh how love has changed - I never dreamed how easily
For now I'm just a shadow of the boy I used to be
Oh yeah
And when I write the book about my love
It will be about a man who's torn in half
About his hope and ambition wasted through the years
The pain will be written on every page in tears
Oh when I write the book about my love
I was a fool to myself when I kept on runnin' around
And I fared little better when I tried settlin' down
Maybe some magic moments have I known but not for long
For all too soon the magic was in a moment gone
And when I write the book about my love
It'll be a heartbreaking story of bad luck in love
When I get down on the pages all I felt
It will make the hardest-hearted of critics' heart melt
When I write the book about my love
When I was young love was fun and I was so happy
I looked so good, and I dressed so snappy
Two-tone shoes on my feet, big old smile on my face
As I moved and grooved all over the place
Now I'm down at heel, my complexion is bad
'Cause my love life is sadder than sad
And when I write the book about my love
It'll be a pop publication, tougher than tough
When I get down on the pages all I missed
It will shoot to the top of the best-sellers list
When I write the book about my loveEmbed
