If Sugar Was as Sweet as You LyricsIf sugar was as sweet as you honey
Sugar just couldn't be bought
(They wouldn't sell it in the stores)
If sugar was as sweet as you honey
Sugar just couldn't be bought
Because you're so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt
All of my life I've suffered with a complex
I didn't think nobody cared
About where I was going or how I was to get there
But then you came and I was spared
'Cause then you came along and showed me I was wrong
And I think I can carry on
If sugar was as sweet as you honey
Sugar just couldn't be bought
(Stick your finger in my coffee)
If sugar was as sweet as you honey
Sugar just couldn't be bought
Because you're so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt
Take all the sugar cane down in Louisiana
Take it to a sugar cane mill
Try to sell some of the finest sugar
It wouldn't change the way that I feel
'Cause in order to find a sugar just like mine
You'd have to search for a long long time
If sugar was as sweet as you honey
Sugar just couldn't be bought
(They wouldn't sell it in the stores)
If sugar was as sweet as you honey
Sugar just couldn't be bought
Because you're so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt
Sugar : if honey was as sweet as you baby
Sugar just couldn't be bought
If sugar was as sweet as you baby
Sugar just couldn't be boughtEmbed
