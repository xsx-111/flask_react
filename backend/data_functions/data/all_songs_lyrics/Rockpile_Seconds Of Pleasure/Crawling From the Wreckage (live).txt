Crawling From the Wreckage (live) LyricsGot out really early from the factory
Driving like a nut in the rain
Don't think I was acting so hysterically
But I didn't see a thing until it came
Man, the drunks were verbal in the takeaway
Beating up the Chinese at the counter
I put a few inside me
At the end of the day
I took out my revenge
On the revolution counter
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
You'd think by now at least that
Half my brain would get the message
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Into a brand new car
In walks Bud with his exploding nose
He'd been giving it maximum today
He shouted, "How the devil
You in trouble I suppose
But all you ever do is run away."
Gunned up the motor into hyper-drive
I wasn't gonna take any of that
Don't get bright ideas about a suicide
'Cause all I ever hear
Is zoom wam bam past me
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
You'd think by now at least that
Half my brain would get the message
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Into a brand new car
Crawling, crawling, crawling from the wreckage
Crawling, crawling, crawling from the wreckage
Crawling, crawling, crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Bits of me are scattered
In the trees and in the hedges
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Into a brand new car
Nothing seems to happen that ain't happened before
I see it all through flashes of depression
I drop my drink and hit some people running for the door
Got to make some kind of impression
'Cause when I'm disconnected from the driving wheel
I'm only half the man I should be
But metal hitting metal isn't all I feel
And everything is good as
It possible could be
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
You'd think by now at least that
Half my brain would get the message
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Into a brand new car
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Bits of me are scattered
In the trees and in the hedges
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Into a brand new car
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling, crawling
Crawling from the wreckageEmbed
