A Knife and a Fork LyricsGirl, you let a knife and fork dig your grave
You eat every kind of food you ain't nothing but a slave
If you don't slacken up your pace
They're gonna throw food in your face
Girl, you let a knife and fork dig your grave
Girl, you let a knife and fork get you down
If you keep this up little girl you won't be around
If you don't change some of your ways
Girl, you're gonna shorten all your days
Girl, you let a knife and fork get you down
Eat, eat, eat: that's your middle name
Oh the way you stuff yourself is a doggone shame
Girl, you let a knife and fork call your hand
You gobble all the food in sight that you can
If you don't change some of your ways
Girl, you're gonna shorten all your days
Girl, you let a knife and fork call your hand
Wearing a size 44
You have to turn sideways to get through the door
Girl, you let a knife and fork dig your graveEmbed
