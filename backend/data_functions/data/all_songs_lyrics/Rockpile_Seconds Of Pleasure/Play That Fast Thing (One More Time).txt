Play That Fast Thing (One More Time) LyricsHangin' out at Frankie's everyone was stoned
The player it was playin' something really gone
Some people they were dancing and some were clappin' hands
And some others were just lyin' close makin' sweet romance
But the hour was growing later and the party had sure been fun
And when Frankie said, "Come on, let's break it up."
Everybody spoke out as one...
"Play that fast thing one more time
It does something to me and it sure feels fine
Play that fast thing one more time
We're gonna be in clover
Don't you dare turn it over
Why don't you play that fast thing one more time?"
All over bar the shouting: the end of another show
A hundred and ten behind 'em, there was forty-four more to go
Oh the people had gone crazy, they'd been jumpin' up and down the aisle
And the memory of their faces how it made them poor boys smile
When somebody said, "Oh come on now. Let's make it to the hotel room."
The doors flew back
In come a pack
Shoutin', "Honey, you spoke too soon."
"Play that fast thing one more time:
It does something to me
And it sure feels fine
Play that fast thing one more time:
You're gonna get some action
If we don't get satisfaction
I said no one leaves the building
Till we play it one more time"
All over bar the shouting: the end of another show
A hundred and ten behind 'em, there was forty-four more of those shows to go
Somebody said, somebody said "Let's make it to the hotel room."
When the doors flew back
In come a pack
And shouted, "Honey, you spoke too soon."
"Play that fast thing one more time:
It does something to me
And it sure feels fine
Play that fast thing one more time
You're gonna get some action
If we don't get satisfaction
I said no one leaves the building
Till we play it one more timeEmbed
