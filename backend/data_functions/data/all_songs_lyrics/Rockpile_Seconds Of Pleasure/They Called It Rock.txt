They Called It Rock LyricsWell, they went and cut the record, the record hit the chart
And someone in the newspaper said it "was art"
Disco Cassanova said "it's heavy on the riff"
The local teeny bopper band was playin' it to death
They called it rock, they called it rock
They called it rock, they called it rock
Well, the telephones are ringing, the boys are getting hot
They're jetting out to Rio and some other sunny spots
Some senoritas say "The singers sound terrific"
Their personal appearances are stopping the shops
They called it rock, they called it rock
They called it rock, they called it rock
Hey long distance its a rock and roll romance
CBS is going to pay a great big advance
Hey Atlantic come on take chance
Arista say they "love you but the kids can't dance to it"
Well, they cut another record, it never was a hit
And someone in the newspaper said it "was shit"
The drummer is a bookie, the singer is a whore
The bass player's selling 'cause he never would have won
They called it rock, they called it rock
They called it rock, they called it rock
Sing it
Hey long distance its a rock and roll romance
CBS is going to pay a great big advance
Hey Atlantic come on take chance
Arista say they "love you but the kids can't dance to it"
Well, they cut another record, it never was a hit
And someone in the newspaper said it "was shit"
The drummer is a bookie, the singer is a whore
The bass player's selling 'cause he never would have won
They called it rock, they called it rock
They called it rock, they called it rock
They called it rock, they called it rock
They called it rockEmbed
