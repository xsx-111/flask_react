Pet You and Hold You LyricsI'm so Little Jack Horner, you're so Little Bo Peep
Let's get together in the lunch hour, but we must be discreet
I'm not the kind that makes the fastest thing 'cause given half the chance
I'd rather pet you and hold you and pet you
Pet you and hold you
Older but no wiser in a military spot
The NCO just told the C-in-C everything I'm not
I wonder why they wonder why I went AWOL
It was to pet you and hold you and pet you
Pet you and hold you
It was to pet you and hold you and pet you
Pet you and hold you
'Cause you got a style that makes me want to stick to it
And you got a smile that just won't quit
And you got a walk that makes me wanna walk with it
And you got a smell like a magnet
Baby I wanna, I wanna, how I wanna
Pet you and hold you
How I wanna pet you and hold you
Pet you and hold you
Can't get away with murder like all those pin-up boys
My middle name spells O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y
I come across about as mean as a mouse but I become a lion
Each time I pet you and hold you and pet you
Pet you and hold you
Each time I pet you and hold you and pet you
Pet you and hold you
I want to pet you and hold you and pet you
Pet you and hold youEmbed
