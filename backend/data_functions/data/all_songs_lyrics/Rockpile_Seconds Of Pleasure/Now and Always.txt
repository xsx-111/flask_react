Now and Always LyricsI close my eyes and count to ten
And wonder why I just don't pack it in
I tell myself it's one of those days
And not for now and always
I face the crowd and punch the wall
And wonder why I just don't end it all
I tell myself it's a passing phase
And not for now and always
There's never anything strong that's louder
And when there's anything on its over
I'd rather anything then but now & always
Now and alwaysEmbed
