Back to School Days LyricsDon’t seem to be no break in the line don’t seem to be no break boys
They ruined my vision screwed up my eyes
I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do boys
I’m going back to schooldays I’m going back to schooldays
I’m going back to schooldays to put them right
They tell me that it was like a film out here
But it’s a real horror show boys
They told me that it was all black and white
There’s so many shades I can see boys
I’m going back to schooldays I’m going back to schooldays
I’m going back to schooldays to put them right
Ain’t nobody wants to know you when you’re down
And everybody wants to lose you when you’re found
Now if I think I might break even I might go home quietly
I’ll marry a rich girl but otherwise
I’m going to raise hell and rightly
I’m going back to schooldays I’m going back to schooldays
I’m going back to schooldays to put them right
Shake it! Whew! Yeah! That’s all right!
Now if I seem just a might confused, don’t give me all of the blame boys
24 years just obeying the rules, no wonder I’m half-insane boys
I’m going back to schooldays I’m going back to schooldays
I’m going back to schooldays to put them right
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I’m going back to schooldays I’m a-going back to schooldays
I’m going back to schooldays to put them right
I’m going back to schooldays I’m a-going back to schooldays
I’m going back to schooldays to put them right
To put them right yeah! to put them right huh!Embed
