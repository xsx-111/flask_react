Guwop Lyrics
I done put twenty up under the SIG
You dig, you dig
You dig
(That boy Cassius)
Ayy
(Wheezy Beats)
Hey

I done put twenty inside the SIG (You dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (You dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (You dig)
I hopped out the coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (You dig, you dig, you dig)
Since I was a youngin I been gettin' dough (You dig, you dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (You dig, you dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (You dig, you dig)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (You dig, you dig, you dig, you dig, hey)

I dig everything that you sayin'
I dig everything that you doin' too
I dig the way that you look at me
You dig the way that I look at you
I just wanna grab on your butt butt
The seat in the Benz, the Chanel Clutch
The FN, it give him a haircut
I roll up a seven of John Dutch
That big booty bounce on the dick and it broke
I don't gotta act like a gangster and she know, dope
My Backwood look like a pole, yeah
My Backwood look like a pole
I sit on clouds of the smoke
I'ma blow pounds of the smoke
Pardon me, pardon my soul
I crack a smile for them folks, ayy
Niggas they eatin' in broad day
In that ho mouth like a Colgate, yeah
Keepin' that cold case, God, please give me that cold case
Man, I don't want no new friends, forgive me for all of my sins
I donâ€™t wanna think about losin', all I wanna do is win win (Hey)
I done put twenty inside the SIG (You dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (You dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (You dig)
I hopped out the coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (You dig, you dig, you dig)
Since I was a youngin I been gettin' dough (You dig, you dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (You dig, you dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (You dig, you dig)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (You dig, you dig, you dig, you dig, hey)

Without the radio it's twenty a show and that's for sure
Get that backend, bitch, we buyin' dope, that's how it go
Black Amigos, 'bout the Freebandz, that .44
I could cook the dope with no stove, pot on the floor (Yeah)
Pull up in that coupe, shit (Skrrt)
Nigga like, "Damn, where the roof went?"
In the streets they call me JAY-Z (Yeah)
Lil' bitch, I got the blueprint (Scooter)
Lil' nigga, I don't want no old hundreds
You know I want them blue strips (Count up)
And I can't fuck you old hoes
I'm ballin' with my new bitch (Yeah)
You dig that? Two hundred thousand worth of chain and that's a fact
Got my name in this rap game by sellin' crack (Jugg)
Rest in peace to OG Double D, you dig that? Slime
I done put twenty inside the SIG (You dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (You dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (You dig)
I hopped out the coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (You dig, you dig, you dig)
Since I was a youngin I been gettin' dough (You dig, you dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (You dig, you dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (You dig, you dig)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (You dig, you dig, you dig, you dig, hey)

Shoot out the coupe (Pew-pew)
Shoot out the roof (Shoot out the roof)
Pull up and smash on her
We don't got to put a bag on her
I took your ho, you dig? (You dig?)
I told her hold the Sig (SIG)
Had big bales, midget (Big bales)
Now you can't say I ain't got millions (Ayy)
Swam with the sharks, water (Splash)
You be law and order (12)
I be gettin' money every mornin', Tom Joyner (Uh)
I heard you gettin' money
But you payin' em niggas extortin' ya (Dig)
You pay for your fame and fortune (Huh)
You pay for your fame and fortune
I am the plug, cordless (Brr)
Pull up with blazers, Portland (Brr)
I pay the neighbors (Cash)
To pick up the dope on they porches (Dope, uh)
I came from nickels, I came from nickels
My niggas don't know you, we do not fuck with you
I've been in the system, I've been in a pickle
You dig me like shovels, I gotta fuck with you
Ayy
I done put twenty inside the SIG (You dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (You dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (You dig)

(Offset)
Hop in the private (Private)
This is a Lambo', not a hybrid (Skrr)
My wrist is a faucet (Watch)
Feed 'em Perkies, I'm the doctor (Doctor)
Draco, hundred round chopper (Grrah)
She got her eyes on me like binoculars (Watching)
Count up this money, it's marvelous (Count it up)
Stall the bitch, I don't call the bitch (Stall her)
You better dig what I'm sayin' (Dig what I'm)
I'ma kill you and your mans (I'ma kill)
Beat down the block like an amp (Beat)
Goin' up like a skateboard on a ramp (Whoa)
Go buy the Rollie and bust it (Bust it, bust it)
Talkin' that tough shit
But you know you not gon' bust shit (Huh, huh)
Look at my fashion
This is a Gucci rugby (Look at it, look at it)
I'm trappin' and rappin'
Still got 'em babies in custody
My diamonds be dancin'
Live in a mansion
My life is lovely (My life is lovely)
Ain't no more loyalty
Knock your ass off, pay the lawyer fee (Pow, pow, pow)
Shit can get ugly, hey

I done put twenty inside the SIG (You dig)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (You dig)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your wig (You dig)
I hopped out the coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (You dig, you dig, you dig)
Since I was a youngin I been gettin' dough (You dig, you dig)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (You dig, you dig)
I want hella Xans, they get me off (You dig, you dig, hey)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (You dig, you dig, you dig, you dig, hey)55Embed
