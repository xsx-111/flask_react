Stormkeeper Lyrics
Ooh, I have love sweeter than lies
Gave you no reason
Not to decide
Say you are leaving
You've got too much pride
It's not love if you have to hide it

Oh woe
Who is the man
Who puts waves on the sand
It's the stormkeeper
Stormkeeper
Liven my life
When I need to survive
Is the storm keeping you warm
Keeping you warm

Ooh I have cried so many times
But only for things
That never were mine
Heaven is sweet
Love is unkind
Thoughts are twisted inside your mind
Oh woe
Who is the man
Who puts waves on the sand
It's the stormkeeper
Stormkeeper
Liven my life
When I need to survive
Is the storm keeping you warm
Keeping you warm

Don't let them tell you
That this love is wrong
Don't let them fool you
That this love can't go on, on...

Oh woe
Who is the man
Who puts waves on the sand
It's the stormkeeper
Stormkeeper
Liven my life
When I need to survive
It's the stormkeeper
Stormkeeper
Who is the man
Who puts waves on the sand
It's the stormkeeper
Stormkeeper
Liven my life
When I need to survive
Is the storm keeping you warm
Keeping you warmEmbed
