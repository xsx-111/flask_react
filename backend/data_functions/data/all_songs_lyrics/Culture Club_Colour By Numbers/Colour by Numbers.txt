Colour by Numbers LyricsWhen I looked in your eyes
Felt the spirit of man
Demanding more than just a smile
Took a chance for a while
Speaking in tongues
That float us down rivers
The past will remind us
All colours we chose
When i told you those lies
Felt the spirit of love
Demanding more than comprimise
Took a chance for a while
Speaking in tongues
That float us down rivers
The past will remind us
All colours we chose
Some people say that the way that we live
Is out of this place
And some people say that the way that we live
Is blinded by fate
All colours we choseEmbed
