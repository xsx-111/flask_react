Black Money Lyrics
Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, yeah)
Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, wo-oah yeah)

Fortunes find you
Cross out every emotion
Standing right behind
A shadow of devotion
Somebody else's life
Cannot be mine

But when you love someone
And they don't love you in return
When you love someone
You've got money to burn

Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, yeah)
Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, wooah)
I believe that
Nothing could come between us
Magic potions
Won't you save them for dreamers
Somebody else's life cannot be mine

But when you love someone
And they don't love you in return
When you love someone
You've got money to burn

Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, yeah)
Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, woah woah, yeah)

Give me some love
But don't waste my time
(Wooah, black money, yeah!)
I'll love you again
But you must be mine
Oh, black money, yeah (Ah, ha ha! Black money, yeah)
Give me some love
But don't waste my time
(Wooah, black money, yeah!)
But when you love someone
And they don't love you in return
When you love someone
You've got money to burn

Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal it, anytime?)

Fortunes find you
Cross out every emotion
Standing right behind
A shadow of devotion
Somebody else's life
Cannot be mine

But when you love someone
And they don't love you in return
When you love someone
You've got money to burn

Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, yeah)
Do you deal in black money
Do you deal in black money (do you deal, wo-oah yeah)
Give me some love
But don't waste my time
(Wooah, black money, yeah!)
I'll love you again
But you must be mine
Oh, black money, yeah (Ah, ha ha! Black money, yeah)
Give me some love
But don't waste my time
(Wooah, black money, yeah!)

Don't waste my time
Oh, yeah
Black money (Black money!)
Oooh, black money, oh (Black money!)
(Black money, yeah!)
(Black money, yeah!)
(Black money, yeah!)
(Black money, yeah!)
(Black money, yeah!)
(Black money, yeah!)
(Black money, yeah!)Embed
