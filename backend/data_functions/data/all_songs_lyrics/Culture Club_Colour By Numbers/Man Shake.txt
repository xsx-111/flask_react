Man Shake LyricsMan shake
Man shake
Man shake
Man shake
I've got this nasty camera
One snap it stole my soul
If you're left feeling lonely
One is the place to go
Now I never bothered
With things I cannot see
And now I've heard the drum track
You're just a basic enemy
Man shake
Man shake
Man shake
Man shake
I've told you out there, up there
A promise you can't see
But with your devil camera
You take your chance with me
Now we're passing strangers
Who knows what we'll be
Tried to re-arrange us
Who would shake your effigy
Man shake
Man shake
Man shake
Man shakeEmbed
