Mister Man LyricsOn the street they're preaching violence
Mister Man is in your head
On the street the midnight cowboy
Needs no gun to shoot you dead
Why do I live the way I do
Ain't it obvious
I'm just a man like you
Mister Man, full of love
Mister Man, full of hate
Got his heart on the trigger
But he pulled it too late
Mister Man is a pilot
Mister Man is a fake
Mister Man's feeling hungry
And he's lying in wait
On the street the lights are fighting
Searching for someone like you
Better find a good messiah
To help the sad and lonely through
Why do I hate the things you do
Yeah
Ain't it obvious
I'm much more black than blue
Mister Man, full of love
Mister Man, full of hate
Got his heart on the trigger
But he pulled it too late
Mister Man is a pilot
Mister Man is a fake
Mister Man's feeling hungry
And he's lying in wait
(Mister Man
Mister Man)
On the street they're preaching violence
Mister Man is in your head
On the street the midnight cowboy
Needs no gun to shoot you dead
Why do I live the way I do
Ain't it obvious
I'm just a man like you
Mister Man, full of love
Mister Man, full of hate
Got his heart on the trigger
But he pulled it too late
Mister Man is a pilot
Mister Man is a fake
Mister Man's feeling hungry
And he's lying in wait
Mister Man, full of love
Mister Man, full of hate
Got his heart on the trigger
But he pulled it too late
Mister Man is a pilot
Mister Man is a fake
Mister Man's feeling hungry
And he's lying in wait
Mister Man, full of love
Mister Man, full of hate
Got his heart on the trigger
But he pulled it too late
