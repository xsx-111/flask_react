We Are All Accelerated Readers Lyrics
I was sick in my mouth
Because of the fear of the scent of an ex-girlfriend
And no more conversations
About what Breakfast Club character you'd be
I'd be the one that dies (No-one dies)
Well, then what's the point?

You should have built a statue, and so I did of you
And you were ungrateful and slightly offended
At the dimensions of it
You said you looked less like the Venus de Milo
And more like your mother in a straitjacket
I think it's great that you're doing fine now
But enough is enough and I've had enough

Since we became accelerated readers
We never leave the house

You should have built a wall
You should have built a wall

And I'm not Bonnie Tyler, and I'm not Toni Braxton
And this song is not gonna save your relationship
Oh, no shit
And this sentimental movie marathon has taught us one thing
It's the opposite of true love is as follows:
Reality
You should have built a wall, not a bridge
(Since we became accelerated readers
We never leave the house)
You should have built a wall, not a bridge

Since we became accelerated readers
We never leave the house
Since we became accelerated readers
We never leave the houseEmbed
