You! Me! Dancing! Lyrics
The beats, yeah, they were coming out the speakers
And were winding up straight in your sneakers
And I'm dancing like every song he spins is Bis
Or like all my dance heroes would if they exist
And yeah, it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
And even if we were, it's not the scene you're thinking of
Just taking props from '90s boy band fashions
All crop tops and testosterone passion

If there's one thing I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me, and there's dancing
It's you, it's me, and there's dancing

Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
But I don't think right now that you care about anything at all
And if only there were clothes on the floor
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing
And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
Every single one of us is twisted by design
And dispatches from the back of my mind
Say, "So long as we're here, everything is alright"
If there's one thing I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me, and there's dancing
It's you, it's me, and there's dancing


If there's one thing I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step
One thing I could never confess
Is that I can't dance a single step

It's you, it's me, and there's dancing
It's you, it's me, and there's dancing

And I always get confused
Because in supermarkets, they turn the lights off when they want you to leave
But in discos, they turn them on
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain
And that's because it is a good idea
And we're just like how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature
We're undeveloped, we're ignorant
We're stupid, but we're happy5Embed
