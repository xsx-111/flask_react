Death to Los Campesinos! Lyrics
Broken down like a war economy
Father, FÃ¼hrer, don't be mad at me
Peasant child, you're into botany
Splitting necks and calling it dichotomy
"Beware", the sign on the door suggests
I'm better off with artificial intelligence
I invented you
I invented you
And I will destroy you

If you catch me with my hands in the till
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper
To smell and pretend like a robot

And if a leopard doesn't change its spots
You can't change my perceptions just from dots to dots
I'll swap the bruising for a bumping sensation
I'll be Ctrl-Alt-Deleting your face with no reservations
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's ignited
Singing, "I'm not finished, I'm not finished, no"
Mistaking cables for veins can be quite misleading
Friction sparks from metal, made it look like bleeding
If you catch me with my hands in the till
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper
To smell and pretend like a robot


If you catch me with my hands in the till
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper
To smell and pretend like a robot
If you catch me with my hands in the till
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper
To smell and pretend like a robot2Embed
