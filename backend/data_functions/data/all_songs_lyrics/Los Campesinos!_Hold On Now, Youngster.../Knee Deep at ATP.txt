Knee Deep at ATP Lyrics
...And every sentence that I spoke began and ended in ellipses
Each of eight fingers gripping what he wrote
Clung on tightly, like parenthesis
And for each correctly used apostrophe
I could feel my heart sink inside my chest in front of me

So, maybe the lining of a winter's coat
Mightn't be the best place to hide a summer secret
You said every photo that you took that festival
Got lost in your camera insurance scam
And though underexposed, I could see from the quality
His K Records t-shirt and you holding his hand
And I know he took you to the beach
I can tell from how you bite on your cheek
Every time the sand falls from your insoles
And when our eyes meet
All that I can read is, "You're the B-side"

They say, "It's not what you like, it's what you're like as a person"
Well, I need new hobbies, that's one thing for certain
"Not what you like, but what you're like as a person"
Well, I need new hobbies, that's one thing for certain4Embed
