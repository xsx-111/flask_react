Sweet Dreams, Sweet Cheeks Lyrics
When the smaller picture is the same as the bigger picture
You know that you're fucked
When you're trading paper cuts for splinters, you're out of luck
Like sharks don't sleep and I don't take my eyes off you
The architecture's shit and my cheeks are all ruddy and bruised

And it hits as hard as a blow to the head
(Trading paper cuts for splinters)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
And sweet dreams, sweet cheeks
Oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow

All these mercy killings have got my conscience spinning over
We've paid off the judges and we're taking advantage
And the building's ornate but it's lacking in soul and character
Pleading our defense in binary and smiley apology montage
We're burning five story buildings laying man traps at the fire exits
Like dignity is equal to desperation and self-effacement
Playing feedback over Tannoy systems
You look desperate, you look pathetic
We're holding on to our own grandeur with careful compliment placement

And it hits as hard as a blow to the head
(Trading paper cuts for splinters)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
It hits as hard as a blow to the head
(Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks
Oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
It hits as hard as a blow to the head
(Trading paper cuts for splinters)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
And sweet dreams, sweet cheeks
Oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow

And it hits as hard as a blow to the head
(Trading paper cuts for splinters)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
It hits as hard as a blow to the head
(Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks
Oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
It hits as hard as a blow to the head
(Trading paper cuts for splinters)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
And sweet dreams, sweet cheeks
Oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow

One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No"
Sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone2Embed
