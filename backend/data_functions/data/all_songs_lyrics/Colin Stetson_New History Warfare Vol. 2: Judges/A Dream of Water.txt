A Dream of Water LyricsThere were those who didn't run
There were those who couldn't take it
There were those who stayed in the city
What was it? Where did it go?
There were those who laid their bodies down
There were those who took our knifes
There were those who kissed the grey skies
There were those who only knew only the sound of their own voices
There were those who knew the rules
There were those who freed their bodies
There were those who couldn't take it
There were others on their own
What was it? What was it?
There were strangers and conmen
There were those who lived in the cross space
There were people lighting candles
There were people going crazy
There were those who walked the beach
What war is that? What time could this be?
There were those who didn't run
There were those who couldn't take it
There were those who stayed in the city
What was it? Where did it go?
There were those who laid their bodies down
There were those who took our knifes
There were those who kissed the grey skies
There were those who only knew only the sound of their own voices
There were those who knew the rules
There were those who freed their bodies
There were those who couldn't take it
There were others on their own
What was it? What was it?
There were strangers and conmen
There were those who lived in the cross space
There were people lighting candles
There were people going crazy
There were those who walked the beach
What war is that? What war is that?
What time could this be?Embed
