Fear of the Unknown and the Blazing Sun LyricsOf all the wires
It was the wires
That were the wires for empathy
That we guard
Beyond
All
The others
Of all the wires
It was the wires
That were the wires for empathy that
We loved beyond all the others
The sound of that much life
Streaming in
Ghosts made of smoke, and paper trees
And dogs travel back and forth between the rocks
Between fear of the unknown and
The blazing sun
Though there is stillness I can feel your heart beat
Though I can't see you I can hear a sound
So tell your secrets to parrots
Through the veil I feel your hand near me
To your lost father and to his father and to his father
Reaching through to the other side
In this conversation itself, just the substitute for
Reaching through to the other side
Whistling
Words, rattle
Reaching through to the other side
Blowing on puffs of air
(I feel it)Embed
