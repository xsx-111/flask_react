The Courage of Others Lyrics
I will never have the courage of others
I will not approach you at all
I was always taught to worry about things
All the many things you can't control

How can they have the courage
Of lords that have long since passed
It’s in their hands
It’s in their heads
It’s been in their blood for many years
It brings them sorrow

In a dark room
He trembles alone
He trembles alone
He trembles alone
He trembles alone3Embed
