Core of Nature LyricsI will wear the sun
Ancient light through these woods
Woods that I walk through alone
I will take my rest
With all creatures who dwell
Under the smallest of green
I’ll remain no more
Than is required of me
Until the spirit is gone
I will long to see
All that waits to be known
And all that will never be known
Into the core of nature
No earthly mind can enter
But I will wear the sun
Bound to others
We’ve seen many things
I will train my feet
To go on with a joy
A joy I have yet to reach
I will let the sounds
Of these woods that I’ve known
Sink into blood and to bone
I’ll remain no more
Than is required of me
Until the spirit is gone
I will long to see
All that waits to be known
And all that will never be known
Into the core of nature
No earthly mind can enter
But I will wear the sun
Bound to others
We’ve seen many things
I will wear the sun
Ancient light through these woods
Woods that I walk through alone
I will long to see
All that waits to be known
And all that will never be known
All that will never be known
All that will never be known
All that will never be known
All that will never be knownEmbed
