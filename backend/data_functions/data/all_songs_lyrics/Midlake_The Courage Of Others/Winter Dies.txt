Winter Dies LyricsAs the spring is made alive the winter dies
And the final cries of creatures are long behind
And full of spirit the village starts again
With one more year for a man to change his ways
I used to feel all things around me stir
Grateful for all I received
Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth
Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun
As the winter dies the earth is brought to life
And a thousand merchant ships sail to find
A worthy village to land and start again
With one more year for a man to change his ways
I used to feel all things around me stir
Grateful for all I received
Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth
Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun
I used to feel all things around me stir
Iâ€™d hear the sound of creatures upon the earth
Grateful for all I received
Though winter cold and spring2Embed
