Bring Down LyricsAll the earthly aims were formed
From the earliest pass that climbs
In my mind
Now the joy has burned out and it’s gone
When the amber skies are filled
Seems the days around are ripe for conquering
Now the joy has burned out and it’s gone
But I don’t know where
Bring down, bring down
All thoughts
Of greatness
And leave all to be
Sound and nothing more
Pray for all to end
And silence be all
Now the joy has burned out and it’s gone
But I don’t know whereEmbed
