Acts of Man Lyrics
If all that grows
Starts to fade
Starts to falter
Oh, let me inside
Let me inside
Not to wake
Let all that run
Through the fields
Through the quiet
Go on with their own
On with their own
Hidden ways

When all the newness of gold
Travels far from
Where it had once been
Worn like the Earth over years
And when the acts of Man
Cause the ground to break open
Oh, let me inside
Let me inside
Not to wake

Great are the sounds of all that live
And all that Man can hold
If all that grows
Starts to fade
Starts to falter
Oh, let me inside
Let me inside
Not to wake

Great are the sounds of all that live
And all that Man can hold
Great are the sounds of all that live, that live7Embed
