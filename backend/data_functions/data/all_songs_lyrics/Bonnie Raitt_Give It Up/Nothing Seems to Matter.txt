Nothing Seems to Matter LyricsSeems like such a long time since I held you my arms
And felt you close and warm beside me
Another night is getting late and I'm alone with just the ache
And the memory of you beside me
Darling, I've never been so blue
I've tried to see it through
There's nothing I can do
I won't make it on my own
So won't you please hurry home
'cause nothing seems to matter without you
Last time I saw you
There was nothing we could say
We knew it was a time for a change
A time to think you said that night
And I lied and said all right
I left you in the morning
I watched you in the window
And Mexico will never be the same
It was time to be apart
But somehow it seems this heart of mine
Will never find a way to live without you
And now I'm out here on the road
And I'm feeling bought and sold
And tonight I just can't but think about you
Darling, I've never been so blue
I've tried to see it through
There's nothing I can do
I won't make it on my own
So darling won't you hurry home
Because nothing seems to matter without you
No, nothing seems to matter without youEmbed
