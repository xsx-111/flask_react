Love Me Like a Man LyricsThe men that I've been seein', baby
Well they got their soul up on a shelf
You know they could never love me
Cause they can't even love themselves
But I need someone to love me
Someone to really understand
Who won't put himself above me
Who just loves me like a man
I never seen such losers
Don't think I haven't tried
Find a man to take me home
Instead of takin' me for a ride
And I need someone to love me
I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man
They all want me to rock them
Like my back ain't got no bone
I want a man to rock me
Like my back bone was his own
Darlin', I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man
I come home sad and lonely
Feel like I wanna cry
I want a man to hold me
Not some fool to ask me why
I know you can
Don't you put yourself above me
You just love me like a man
