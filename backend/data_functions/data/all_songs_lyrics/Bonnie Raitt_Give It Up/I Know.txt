I Know LyricsI know you don't love me no more;
No, no more; and I don't
(don't) wanna be hurted any more
Any more; yeah, yeah
I've loved so hard
Everything I did was no joy; if I can't
Love you right, baby
I don't have to love you at all
I know you don't want me no more, no more
No, no more
And it had to be someone loving you more
Lovin' you more
Ain't no use in me cryin' now all because you have put me down
If you don't want me no more baby
Ain't no use in me hanging aroundEmbed
