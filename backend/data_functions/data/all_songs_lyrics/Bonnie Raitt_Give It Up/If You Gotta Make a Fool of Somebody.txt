If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody LyricsIf you got to make a fool of somebody
If you got to make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me
I'm the one that'll worry
If you got to make a fool of somebody
If you got to make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me
I'm the one that'll worry
Daytime nitetime
Anytime at all
I'll be there waiting
Anytime you call
Just to be near you
You know
That anywhere I'll go
How could you hurt me soEmbed
