Blew (Live In Amsterdam At Paradiso, November 25, 1991) Lyrics
Thank you for your patience

And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't care I would like to lose
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't care I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame, ah

And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't care I would like to lose
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't care I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame, ah

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame, ah

You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anythingEmbed
