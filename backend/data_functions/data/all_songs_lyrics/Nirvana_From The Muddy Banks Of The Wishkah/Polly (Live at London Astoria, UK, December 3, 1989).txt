Polly (Live at London Astoria, UK, December 3, 1989) Lyrics
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, hurt yourself
Want some help, plead myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, hurt yourself
Want some help, please myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
And ask me to untie her
Chase would be nice for a few

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, hurt yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, hurt yourself
Want some help, please myself
Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, hurt yourself
Want some help, plead myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, hurt yourself
Want some help, please myselfEmbed
