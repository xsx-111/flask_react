Spank Thru (Live in Rome, Italy, November 19, 1991) Lyrics
And as the soft pretentious mountains
Gisten in the light of the trees
And the flowers sing in D minor
And the birds fly happily
We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby

I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you only break my heart

I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, I can beat it, masturbate it

I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could

I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, I can beat it, as I beat it
I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever would


I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever couldEmbed
