Negative Creep (Live in Seattle, WA., October 31, 1991) Lyrics
This is out of our reach
This is out of our reach
This is out of our reach and it's grown
This is getting to be
This is getting to be
This is getting to be a drone

I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned
Negative creep
Negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm—

Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl—ahh!

Out of our range
Out of our range
Out of our range and it's crude
Getting to be
Getting to be
Getting to be a drone
Negative creep
Negative creep
Negative creep and I'm stoned!
Negative creep
Negative creep
Negative creep and I'm—

Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl—ahh!


Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl—ahh!Embed
