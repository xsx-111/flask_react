Been a Son (Live In Amsterdam At Paradiso, November 25, 1991) Lyrics
She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns
She should have

Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a son

She should have stood out in the crowd
She should have made my mother proud
She should have fallen on her stance
She should have had another chance
She should have

Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a son

Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a son

She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns
She should have

Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a son, she should have
Been a sonEmbed
