Aneurysm (Live at Del Mar Fairgrounds, CA., December 28, 1991) Lyrics
Come on over, do the twist, aha
Overdo it and have a fit, aha
Love you so much, it makes me sick, aha
Come on over, Shoot The Shit! aha

Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!

Come on over and do the twist, aha
Love you so much, it makes me sick, aha
Overdo it and have a fit, aha
Come on over, Shoot The Shit! aha

Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
Beat me out of me!
[Outro}
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart

Monty Break Lights!
