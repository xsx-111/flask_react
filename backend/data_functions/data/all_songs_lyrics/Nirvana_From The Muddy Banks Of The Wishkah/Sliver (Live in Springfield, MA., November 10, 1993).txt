Sliver (Live in Springfield, MA., November 10, 1993) Lyrics
Mom and Dad went to a show
Dropped me off at grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed
Said, "Please, don't go!"

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone

Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone
Said, "Why don't you stop your cryin'
Go outside and ride your bike!"
That's what I did
I killed my toe!

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone

After dinner I had ice cream
Fell asleep and watched TV
Woke up in my mother's arms

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Wanna be aloneEmbed
