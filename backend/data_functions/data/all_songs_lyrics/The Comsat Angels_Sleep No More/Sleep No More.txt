Sleep No More LyricsIt's late
There's no time left
I can see the city glow
But I'm sure
There must be somewhere
We can go
Lights
Cut through the center
And the darkness hides its shape
And I swear
It almost could be
A different place
But the world
Is covered over
And the stars are shining bright
We will make our escape
Into the nightEmbed
