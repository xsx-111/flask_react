Diagram LyricsHere is expectation
Here is the dream
This is the way things should have been
And it's so sad, so sad, so sad
About the way things are
So sad, so sad, so sad, so sad
See his face
See his eyes
Full of trust
So unwise
Built it up
Much too high
So unwise
So unwise
Here is anticipation
But no defense
How I hate his innocence
See his face
See his eyes
Full of trust
So unwise
Built it up
Much too high
So unwise
So unwise
And it's too bad, too bad, too bad
About the way things are
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too badEmbed
