Restless LyricsThe day is winding slowly backwards
I'm trying to remember something she said
But no sense remains
She has chased it all away
Sometimes these things are so hard
To say
But maybe tomorrow
We'll talk again
'Cause there's no sense today
She has chased it all away
She's here then she's there
And it's all up in the airEmbed
