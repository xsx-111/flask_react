Dark Parade Lyrics
He looks up
Straight ahead
There's something there
Now itâ€™s gone
Is it a bird
Or an aeroplane?
Just like a thought
It's there
Then it's gone

Over sea
And over sand
In the deserted heart
Of a desert land
Rotor blades
Like charred palm trees
Signify
No success
No release
No release
No release
No release

Is it eight
Or is it nine
Who fall in
For the very last time?
There is no rest
No release
At the oasis
These men
Reduced to this
The darkest parade
Parade
Parade
Parade
The darkest parade
Parade
Parade
Parade
The darkest parade
Parade
Parade
Parade
Parade
