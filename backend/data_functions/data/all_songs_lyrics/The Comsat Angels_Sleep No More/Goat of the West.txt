Goat of the West Lyrics
He's just played his biggest part
His country took him to his heart
The latest episode on the world wide screen
And it's the worst one I've ever seen

It's so funny
Did you see what happened?
It's so funny
But I'm not laughing

He has lost his winning smile
He has to show he's human too
I think we'll have to wait for a long time
'Cause I just don't believe it's true

It's so funny
Did you see what happened?
It's so funny
But I'm not laughing

And I don't believe it
And I don't believe it
And I don't believe itEmbed
