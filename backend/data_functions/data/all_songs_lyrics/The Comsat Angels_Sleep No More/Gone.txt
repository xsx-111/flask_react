Gone LyricsSo tired, so soon
What happened to you
What happened to you
You got lost
Somewhere between
There and here
Somewhere between
So far, so near
You got lost
Somewhere between
What happened to you
Someone has been removed
What happened to her
What happened to her
She got lost
Somewhere between
There and here
Somewhere between
So far, so near
She got lost
Somewhere between
What happened to her
You used to be so young
You used to be so young
It was going to take so long
But it has almost gone
What is his name
What is his name
What is his name
What is his name
What is his name
What is his name
What is his name
What is his name
What is his nameEmbed
