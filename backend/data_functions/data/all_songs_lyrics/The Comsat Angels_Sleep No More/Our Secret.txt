Our Secret Lyrics
Every boy and every girl
All round the world
Lives in hope
One world at one time
One world only
That's the secret

They will never
They will never
They will never give it up
They will never
They will never
They will never give it up

It's a secret but
It's not holy
It's in the blood
It's in the atmosphere

We will never
We will never
We will never give it up
We will never
We will never
We will never give it up
We will never
We will never
We will never give it up
We will never
We will never
We will never give it up
We will never
We will never
We will never give it up
We will never
We will never
We will never give it up
We will never
We will never
We will never give it up
We will never
We will never
We will never give it upEmbed
