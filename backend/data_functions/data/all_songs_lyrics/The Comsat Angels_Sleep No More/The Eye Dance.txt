The Eye Dance Lyrics
Was it my imagination
Working over time again?
Or did we make a strange connection
Just then?
Some things are never spoken
Some things are never done
But if we could forget our manners
Just once

If I asked you what would you do
Would you think it over?
We see stranger things every day
Would you think it over?

Something's changed in your expression
Maybe I should explain
'Cause it could be my imagination
Again

If I asked you what would you do
Would you think it over?
We see stranger things every day
Would you think it over?
Would you think it over?Embed
