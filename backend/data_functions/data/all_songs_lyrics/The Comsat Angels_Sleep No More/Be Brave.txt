Be Brave Lyrics
Can you hear it whispering?
Can you hear it whispering?
At the back of everything
Can you hear it whispering?

Out of the dark, into the light
Looking for a way around it
When it calls, we won't hear
We will shout and we'll drown it out

At the back of everything
Like a constant threat
Can you hear it whispering?
Can you hear it whispering?
At the back of everything

Out of the dark, into the light
Looking for a way 'round it
When it calls, we won't hear
We will shout and we'll drown it out

So we sit around
And we make a joke
About the way things are
And how it won't get anything
And how it won't get anything
And how it won't get anything
And how it won't get anythingEmbed
