Going Away to College Lyrics
Please take me by the hand, it's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed, I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me, and I won't forget you
"I'll write you once a week," she said

Why does it feel the same to fall in love or break it off?
And if young love is just a game, then I must've missed the kickoff
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything, but I'd go through Hell for you, and

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times she kissed me after class, and
She put up with my friends, I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place but you're so beautiful

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place but you're so beautiful9Embed
