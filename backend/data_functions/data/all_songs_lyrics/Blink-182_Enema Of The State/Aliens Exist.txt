Aliens Exist Lyrics
Hey Mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories
As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb

What if people knew that these were real?
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say
"What you hear is all hearsay"
Wish someone would tell me what was right

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

I am still a skeptic, yes, you know me
Been best friends and will be 'til we die
I got an injection of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies, alright
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

Dark and scary, ordinary
Explanation, information
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Where's my mother? Bio-father?

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
