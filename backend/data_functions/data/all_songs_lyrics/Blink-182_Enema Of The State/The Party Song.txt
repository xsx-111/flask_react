The Party Song Lyrics
Here you go, motherfuckers!

Do you wanna come to a party?
My friends picked me up in a truck at 11:30
This thing's at a frat house, but people are cool there
Reluctant, I followed, but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I payed my three in and the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila and we headed into the party

And then, in the backyard, some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame, all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game, I wished I would've stayed
In my bed back at home, watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn, or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from Anywhere State
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party

And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She wasn't wearing underwear
At least I prayed that
She might be the one
Maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night, I learned some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And some girls try too hard to impress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With the way that they dress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With those things on their chests
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And the things they suggest to me
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)

I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping, the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with the wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup, her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her, but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party

So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear
And you'll discover
This girl's not the one
And she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run
Because you'll find out that some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And some girls try too hard to impress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With the way that they dress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With those things on their chests
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And the things they suggest to me
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)

(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard6Embed
