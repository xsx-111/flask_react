Mutt Lyrics
He pauses shaving, and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds

He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out every day, she goes every way
Oh yeah, they don't even care at all

She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often, they've typically
Been starved for attention before

She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt

He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight
Oh yeah, they don't even care at all

She's open, waiting for more
(She's open, waiting for more)
And I know he's only looking to score
(He's only looking to score)
And it is way too unhealthy
Often, they've typically
Been starved for attention before

She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often, they've typically
Been starved for attention before5Embed
