Dysentery Gary Lyrics
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation, worth another night in jail

He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights

Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag

So all you little ladies, be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache, wanna make a deal

Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl will chose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took her and ran away, and
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights

Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag

Fuck this place, I lost the war
I hate you all, your mom's a whore
Where's my dog? 'Cause girls are such a drag11Embed
