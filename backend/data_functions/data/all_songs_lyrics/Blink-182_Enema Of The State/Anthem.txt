Anthem Lyrics
Home show, mom won't know
Run out the back door,  he's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob, I think he humped the dog

But good things come to those who wait, 'cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key, instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run, wish my friends were twenty-one

White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick?
Better call their fathers, sleeping with your daughters

But good things come to those who wait, 'cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key, instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run, wish my friends were twenty-one

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall, too bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom-dad slave drive song
I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
Turn low, the radio
I think I hear my dad yelling at the band

But good things come to those who wait, 'cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key, instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run, wish my friends were twenty-one

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall, too bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom-dad slave drive song
I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb3Embed
