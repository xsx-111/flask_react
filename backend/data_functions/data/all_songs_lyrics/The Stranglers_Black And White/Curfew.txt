Curfew LyricsThe enemy has cut down all the power
London south of The Thames s invaded
Westminster is raised down to the ground
The Government Has Fled
The Government Has Fled
The Government Has Fled for Scotland today
It Becomes Black And White
Is It True What They Say?
They Turn The Day Into Night
Black And White Becomes
The Government has fled into thin air
What's Left Of Our Troops Has Joined The Scots
To Form In defense across the North
Stay In Your Homes
Stay In Your Homes
Be Off The Streets By Nightfall
It Becomes Black And White
Is It True What They Say?
They Turn The Day Into Night
Black And White Becomes
Germany Failed To Protect All Borders
Had Grown Soft With The American Dream
The Men From The Steppes Delivered Their Vacuum
A New Kind Of freedom
Freedom's A Chain
Maybe I'll Find Love When There's Nothing To Do
It Becomes Black And White
Is It True What They Say?
They Turn The Day Into Night
Black And White BecomesEmbed
