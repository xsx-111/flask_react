Do You Wanna? LyricsDo you wanna marry a lumberjack?
Do you wanna freeze to death?
Do you wanna be a beauty queen
And rule the kingdom?
Let out all the prisoners
Cause that's a jubilee
Do you wanna marry a company director?
Do you wanna go to work?
Do you wanna be a beauty queen
And rule the kingdom?
Let out all the prisoners
Cause that's a jubilee
Do you wanna marry money?
Do you wanna use your body?
Do you wanna stay at home
On the range?
Do you wanna blow your mind?
Do you wanna blow your hymen?
Do you wanna blow exams?
Do you wanna fix my muffler?
It's got a hole in itEmbed
