Threatened LyricsI don't think things can be (Malfunction malfunctioning)
Pretty or ugly (Malfunction malfunctioning)
All that you can say (Malfunction malfunctioning)
Is if your existence is not threatened in any way (Malfunction malfunctioning)
You are quite safe with me (Malfunction malfunctioning)
I've got my very own philosophy (Malfunction malfunctioning)
All that you can say (Malfunction malfunctioning)
Is if your existence is not threatened in any way
Threatened in any way
Threatened in any way
Threatened in any way
Threatened in any way
Man killed by industry
Man killed by luxury
Man killed by falling tree
Man killed by sanity
Bring me a piece of my mummy
She was quite close to meEmbed
