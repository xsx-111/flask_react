In the Shadows LyricsWhen you're walking on the streets at night
You turn around and die of fright
What's that in the shadows?
What's that in the shadows?
Walking down the streets at night
Turn around and you can die of fright
Walking on the streets at night
Turn around and die of fright
What's that in the shadows?
What's that in the shadows?
Is it a dog?
Is it a cat ?
Is it a dog?
What do you think of that?
When you're walking on the streets at night
Turn around and die of fright
What's that in the shadows?
What's that in the shadows?
Is it a dog?
Is it a cat ?
Is it a dog?
What do you think of that?
When you're walking on the streets at night
Moving, shiny, bright
Walking on the night
When you're walking on the streets at night
Look around you
Look around you
When you're walking on the streets at night
When you turn around and die of fright
Who's there in the shadows?
What's that in the shadows?
What's that in the shadows?
Look around youEmbed
