Toiler on the Sea LyricsI had a woman ship
I took her overseas
She left her hold unlocked
I had to find a dock
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
We didn't use cruel words
To navigate cruel seas
The wind was biting hard
At times I had to scream
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
And when we reached the land
We went aground on the rocks
Became a wreck in the sand
Became a home for a flock
We ventured overland
Fought with the aliens
The young ones used their hands
Pointed the way to a flock
A flock of seagulls!
A flock of seagulls!
Then we retraced our steps
Rebuilt the woman ship
I took her back up north
I lost her in the fog
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler
I was a toiler
I was a toiler
On the sea
On the sea
I was a toiler
I was a toiler
On the sea
I was a toiler
A toiler
A toilerEmbed
