Shut Up LyricsYou've been nashing all through the night
I didn't wanna listen anyway
Conversation ain't that right
I know what your about to say
I said shut up
Shut up shut up
Shut up don't ya
Shut up shut up
Shut up shut up don't ya
I'm gonna have to leave you here
You can argue with yourself all night
I've gotta lotta things to do
I told you to get out of sight
I said shut up shut up shut up shut up don't ya
Shut up shut up shut up shut up
Don't ya
