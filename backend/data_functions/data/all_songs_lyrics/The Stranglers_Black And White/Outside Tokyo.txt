Outside Tokyo LyricsSomewhere outside Tokyo
Invented time
Someone in a factory
Invented time
If people wanted proof to
Carry on they'd like to buy one
50 million watches with a
Strap to sell
50 million watches with a
Strap to sell
If people wanted proof to
Carry on they'd like to buy one
If they should ever sell out
That would be the end of (time)
Be the end of (time)
Be the end of timeEmbed
