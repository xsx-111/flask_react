Tank LyricsI can sign for 1, 2, 3 or 4
Get three weeks off in a year or more
Save up and get my very own SLR
'Cos I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Can you see the bullet's high velocity?
It can blow a man's arm off at the count of three
If I get my hands on one of those
I'm something to watch out for
I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can
Yes I can
Don't care whereabouts they send me now
Send picture postcards for my ol' mother and father
So when I come home they'll have someone to be proud of
I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can drive (drive) my very own tank
Yes I can- move! (hey!)Embed
