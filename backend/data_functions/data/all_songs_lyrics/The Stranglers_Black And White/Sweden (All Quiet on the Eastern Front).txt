Sweden (All Quiet on the Eastern Front) LyricsLet me tell you about Sweden
Only country where the clouds are interesting
Big brother says it's the place to go
Too much time to think, too little to do
Too much time to think, too little to do
Too much time, too little to do
'Cos it's all quiet on the Eastern front
Fluctuations at a minimum
Hypochondriac tombstone
Sense of humour's gone astray somewhere
Too much time to think, too little to do
Too much time to think, too little to do
Too much time, too little to do
'Cos it's all quiet on the Eastern front
Cumulus nimbus floats by
Fluctuations at a minimum
Hypochondriac tombstone
Big brother says it's the place to go
It's all quiet on the Eastern front
(All quiet on the Eastern front)
It's all quiet on the Eastern front
(All quiet on the Eastern front)
It's all quiet on the Eastern front
It's all
