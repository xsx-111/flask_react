Death and Night and Blood (Yukio) LyricsDeath and night and blood
Death and night and blood
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
When I saw that sparta in his eyes
Young death is good
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
And we decided that to die there was no greater love
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
Hey little baby don't you lean down low
Your brain's exposed and it's starting to show
Your rotten thoughts yeuch
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
I was attracted to a night torchlight parade
And there I came
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
Home is a black leather jacket fitting sweetly to my brain
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
Death and night and blood)
Death and night and blood)
Hey little baby don't you lean down low
Your brain's exposed and it's starting to show
Your rotten thoughts yeuch
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
I will force my body to be my weapon and my statement, so
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
(Death and night and blood)
Hey little baby don't you lean down low
Your brain's exposed and it's starting to show
Your rotten thoughts yeuch
(Death and night and blood)
