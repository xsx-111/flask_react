Walk On By Lyrics
If you see me walking down the streets
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by
Ah, walk on by

And make believe that I can't see the tears
That let me breathe, oh, in private
'Cause each time I see you, I just want to cry
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem so broken in pieces
Walk on by
Oh, walk on by

And foolish pride if I can't see the tears that let me hide
All the tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said (goodbye)
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by, just go for a stroll in the trees

Walk on by
Ah, walk on by

And make believe that I can't see the tears
That let me breathe, oh, in private
'Cause each time I see you, I just want to cry
Walk on by
Walk on by

Now, you really gotta go, you really gotta go (by)
Ah, you really gotta go, you really gotta go (by)
You really gotta go, you really gotta go (by)
Ah, you really gotta go, gotta go (by)Embed
