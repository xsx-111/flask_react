Enough Time LyricsWhat's gonna happen when the sky goes black?
What will you do when the sea comes back?
What if there's no way of moving back?
What when your face falls apart?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?
You're drifting out like a child who's lost
Who's looking for a better way
You're moving like a coin in the air
What when your face falls apart?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?
You're maybe looking for a sign of life
You hope it's gonna save your life
What will you do to restore your sight?
What when your face falls apart?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?
Have you got enough time?Embed
