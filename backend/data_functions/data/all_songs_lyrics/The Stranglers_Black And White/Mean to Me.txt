Mean to Me LyricsIf I let loose right now well I'd be screaming out loud
My baby's been so mean to me I can't face the crowd
She's been mean to me, mean to me and making me blue
And if I ever get the chance I'm gonna throw her out and send her to you
It started out this morning when we crawled out of bed
She balled me out for screwing should be loving instead
She's been mean to me, mean to me and making me sad
And if I ever get the chance I'm gonna make her sorry that she's been bad to me
I'd like to tie her to the railway line and jump on the train
I'd like to take away her parachute on a burning plane
She's been mean to me, mean to me and making me sad
And if I ever get the chance I'm gonna make her sorry that she's been bad
She carried on when I got home from towing the line
She said that I'd been boozing I'd been drinking the wine
She's been mean to me, mean to me and making me blue
And if I ever get the chance I'm gonna throw her out and send her to youEmbed
