Guilt Lyrics
I feel guilt, I feel guilt
Though I know I done no wrong, I feel guilt
I feel guilt, I feel guilt
Though I know I've done no wrong, I feel guilt

I feel bad, so bad
Though I ain't done nothin' wrong, I feel bad
I feel bad, so bad
Though I ain't done nothin' wrong, I feel bad

I never lied to my lover
But if I did I would admit it
If I could get away with murder
I'd take my gun and I'd commit it
I never gave to the rich
I never stole from the poor
I'm like a curious child
Give me more, more, more
More, more, more, more

I feel blood, I feel blood
Though I feel it in my veins, it's not enough
I feel blood, I feel blood
Though it's streamin' through my veins, it's not enough
I never stole a scarf from Harrods
But if I did, you wouldn't miss it
I never stole a doll from Lovecraft
But if I did, you know I'd kiss it
I never stole from the rich
I never gave to the poor
I'm like a curious child
Just give me more, more, more, more
More, more, more

I feel guilt, I feel guilt
Though I know I done no wrong, I feel guilt
I feel guilt, I feel guilt
Though I ain't done nothin' wrong, I feel guilt

Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
