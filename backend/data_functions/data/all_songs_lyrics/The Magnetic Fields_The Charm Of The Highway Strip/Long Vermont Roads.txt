Long Vermont Roads Lyrics
Your eyes are long Vermont roads
With a tacky song on the radio
And your eyes are toothless young men
In Tennessee in the rain again

And the fireflies never go to sleep
And the country songs never help you sleep

But after all those trains
And all those breakdown lanes
The roads don't love you
And they still won't pretend to
After all those days
On God-forsaken highways
The roads don't love you
And they still won't pretend to

Your eyes are the Mesa Verde
Big and brown and far away
And your eyes are Kansas City
In Kansas and in Missouri
But after all those trains
And all those breakdown lanes
The roads don't love you
And they still won't pretend to
After all those days
On God-forsaken highways
The roads don't love you
And they still won't pretend to

After all this time
And after all your crying
The roads don't love you
And they still won't pretend to
Roads are dark and long
And all those country songs
Well, they don't love you
And they still won't pretend toEmbed
