Little Boy Soldiers LyricsIt's funny how you never knew what my name was
Our only contact was a form for the election
These days I find that I don't listen
These days I find that we're out of touch
These days I find that I'm too busy
So why the attention, now you want my assistance
What have you done for me?
You've gone and got yourself in trouble
Now you want me to help you out
These days I find that I can't be bothered
These days I find that it's all too much
To pick up a gun and shoot a stranger
But I've got no choice so here I come
War games
I'm up on the hills, playing little boy soldiers
Reconnaissance duty up at 5:30
Shoot, shoot, shoot and kill the natives
You're one of us and we love you for that
Think of honour, Queen and country
You're a blessed son of the British Empire
God's on our side and so is Washington
Come out on the hills with the little boy soldiers
Come up on the hills, playing little boy soldiers
Come out on the hills, playing little boy soldiers
Come on outside - I'll sing you a lullaby
Or tell a tale of how goodness prevailed
We ruled the world, we killed and robbed
The fucking lot - but we don't feel bad
It was done beneath the flag of democracy
You'll believe and I do - yes I do, yes I do
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
These days I find that I can't be bothered
To argue with them, well what's the point?
Better to take your shots and drop down dead
Then they send you home in a pine overcoat
With a letter to your mum
Saying find enclosed one son, one medal and a note
To say he won4Embed
