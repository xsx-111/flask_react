Burning Sky LyricsHow are things in your little world?
I hope they're going well, and you are too
Do you still see the same old crowd?
The ones who used to meet every Friday
I'm really sorry that I can't be there
But work comes first, I'm sure you'll understand
Things are really taking off for me
Business is thriving, and I'm showing a profit
And in any case it wouldn't be the same
'Cause we've all grown up, and we've got our lives
And the values that we had once upon a time
Seem stupid now, 'cause the rent must be paid
And some bonds severed, and others made
Now I don't want you to get me wrong
Ideals are fine when you are young
And I must admit we had a laugh
But that's all it was and ever will be
'Cause the burning sky keeps burning bright
And as long as it does (and it always will)
There's no time for dreams when commerce calls
And the taxman's shouting, 'cause he wants his dough
And the wheels of finance won't begin to slow
And it's only us realists who are gonna come through
'Cause there's only one power higher than that of truth
And that's the burning sky
That's the burning sky
Oh and by the way I must tell you
Before I sign off, that I've got a meeting next week
With the head of a big corporate
I can't disclose who, but I'm sure you'll know it
And the burning sky it keeps on burning bright
And it won't turn off till it's had enough
It's the greedy bastard who won't give up
And you're just a dreamer if you don't realize
And the sooner you do will be the better for you
Then we'll all be happy, and we'll all be wise
And we'll all bow down to the burning sky
We'll all be happy, and we'll all be wise
And together we will live beneath the burning skyEmbed
