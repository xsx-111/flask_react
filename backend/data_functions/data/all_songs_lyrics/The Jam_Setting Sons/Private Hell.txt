Private Hell LyricsCloser than close - you see yourself -
A mirror image of what you wanted to be
As each day goes by - a little more -
You can't remember - what it was you wanted anyway
The fingers feel the lines - they prod the space -
Your ageing face - the face that once was so beautiful
Is still there but unrecognizable -
Private Hell
The man that you once loved - is bald and fat -
And seldom in - working late as usual
Your interest has waned - you feel the strain -
The bed springs snap - on the occasions he lies upon you -
Close your eyes and think of nothing but -
Private Hell
Think of Emma - wonder what she's doing -
Her husband Terry - and your grandchildren
Think of Edward - still at college
You send him letters which he doesn't acknowledge
'Cause he don't care
They don't care
'Cause they're all going through their own - Private Hell
The morning slips away - in a valium haze
And catalogues - and numerous cups of coffee
In the afternoon - the weekly food
Is put in bags - as you float off down the high street
The shop windows reflect - play a nameless host
To a closet ghost - a picture of your fantasy -
A victim of your misery - and Private Hell
Think of Emma - wonder what she's doing -
Her husband Terry - and your grandchildren
Think of Edward - still at college
You send him letters which he doesn't acknowledge
'Cause he don't care
They don't care
'Cause they're all going through their own - Private Hell
Private Hell
Alone at 6 o'clock - you drop a cup -
You see it smash - inside you crack -
You can't go on - but you sweep it up -
Safe at last inside your Private Hell
Sanity at last inside your Private Hell
Sanity at last inside your Private Hell
Private Hell
REPEAT TO FADEEmbed
