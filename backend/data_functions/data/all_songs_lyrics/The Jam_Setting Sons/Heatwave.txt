Heatwave LyricsWhenever I'm with him
Something inside starts to burnin'
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heat wave, burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from cryin', it's tearin' me apart
Whenever he calls my name
Soft, low, sweet and plain
I feel right there, I feel that burnin' flame
Has a high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heat wave, burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from cryin', it's tearin' me apart
Ooh, ooh, heat wave
Ooh, ooh, heat wave
Sometimes I stare in space, tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Now that funny feelin' has me amazed
I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
It's like a heat wave, burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from crying, it's tearin' me apart
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah
I feel it burnin', right here in my heartEmbed
