Chapel of Ghouls Lyrics
Ghouls attack the church
Crush the holy priest
Turning the cross towards hell
Writhe in Satan's flames

Crush the priest
The feeble church

Dead - your god is dead
Fools - your god is dead
Useless prayers of lies
Behold Satan's rise

Crush the priest
The feeble church
The family of dog
Lust upon the altar

Demons attack with hate
Satan in the fires of hell awaits
Death against you all
God hear my death call
Crush the priest
The feeble church
The family of dog
Lust upon my altarEmbed
