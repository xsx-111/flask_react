Immortal Rites Lyrics
Gathered for a sacred rite
Subconscious minds allied
Call upon immortals
Call upon the oldest ones to intercede
Rid us of our human waste
Cleanse our earthly lives
Make us one with darkness
Enlighten us to your ways

From churning worlds of mindlessness
Come screams unheard before
Haunting voices fill the room
Their source remaining undefined
Shadows cast from faceless beings
Lost for centuries

Lords of death, I summon you
Reside within our brains
Cast your spells upon our lives
So that we may receive
The gift of immortality
Bestowed on those who seek you
Gathered for a sacred rite
Subconscious minds allied
Call upon immortals
Call upon the oldest ones to intercede
Rid us of our human waste
Cleanse our earthly lives
Make us one with darkness
Enlighten us to your ways

Lords of death, I summon you
Reside within our brains
Cast your spells upon our lives
So that we may receive
The gift of immortality
Bestowed on those who seek you
