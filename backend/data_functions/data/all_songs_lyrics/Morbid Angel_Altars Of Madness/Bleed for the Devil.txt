Bleed for the Devil Lyrics
Come to me, lord of filth
Hear my cries princes of nightmares
Touch us with your morbid lips
Let us taste your foulness

Bleed for the devil
Impious mortal lives
Feel the enticing power
Fill the chasm of your soul

Fill the air with the smell of death
Grace us with your magick
Fill the night with the stench of evil
I summon forth the beast

Bleed for the devil
Impious mortal lives
Feel the enticing power
Fill the chasm of your soul

Cold look in his eyes
He holds the gleaming knife
Girl cries as he cuts away the
Strips of flesh
Bleed for the devil
Impious mortal lives
Feel the enticing power
Fill the chasm of your soulEmbed
