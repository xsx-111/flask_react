Nicest Thing LyricsAll I know is that you're so nice
You're the nicest thing I've seen
I wish that we could give it a go
See if we could be something
I wish I was your favorite girl
I wish you thought I was the reason you are in the world
I wish my smile was your favorite kind of smile
I wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of style
I wish you couldn't figure me out
That you'd always wanna know what I was about
I wish you'd hold my hand
When I was upset
I wish you'd never forget
The look on my face when we first met
I wish you had a favorite beauty spot
That you loved secretly
Cause it was on a hidden bit
That nobody else could see
Basically, I wish that you loved me
I wish that you needed me
I wish that you knew when I said two sugars
Actually I meant three
I wish that without me your heart would break
Yeah, I wish that without me you'd be spending the rest of your nights awake
I wish that without me you couldn't eat
Yeah, I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep
Look, all I know is that
You're the nicest thing I've ever seen
And I wish that we could see if we could be something
Yeah, I wish that we could see if we could be something8Embed
