We Get On LyricsSimply knowing you exist
Ain't good enough for me
But asking for your telephone number
Seems highly inappropriate
Seeing as I can't even say hi when you walk by
And that time you shook my hand
It felt so nice
I swear I've never felt
This way about any other guy
And I don't usually
Notice people's eyes, but
I conducted a plan
To bump into you most accidentally
But I was walking along
And I bumped into you much more heavily
Than I'd originally planned
It was well embarrassing and
I think you thought that I was a bit of a twat
I just think that we get on
Oh I wish I could tell you face to face
Instead of singing this stupid song
But yeah I just think that we might get on
So I went to that party
Everyone, they were kind of arty
And I was wearing this dress
Cause I wanted to impress
But I wasn't sure if I looked my best
Cause I was so nervous
But I carried on regardless
Strutting through each room trying to find you
And when I saw you
Kissing that girl
My heart it shattered
And my eyes they watered
And when I tried to speak I stuttered
And my friends were like, "Whatever
You'll find someone better
His eyes were way too close together
And we never even liked him from the start
And now he's with that tart
And I heard she done some really nasty stuff down in the park
With Michael, he said she's easy
And if your guy's with someone that sleazy
Then he ain't worth your time
Cause you deserve a real nice guy"
So I proceeded to get drunk and cry
And lock myself in the toilet for the entire night
Saturday night I watched channel five
I particularly like CSI
I don't ever dream
About you and me
I don't ever make up stuff about us
That would be classed as insanity
I don't ever drive by your house
To see if you're in
I don't even have an opinion
On that tramp that you're still seeing
I don't know your timetable
I don't know your face off by heart
But I must admit
That there is still a part Of me
That thinks we might get on
That we could get on
That we should get on1Embed
