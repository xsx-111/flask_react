Birds Lyrics
She was waiting at the station
He was getting off the train
He didn't have a ticket
So he had to bum through the barriers again
Well the ticket inspector saw him rushing through
He said, "Girl you don't know how much I missed you but
We'd better run cause I haven't got the funds to pay this fine"
She said, "Fine"
Well so they ran out of the station and jumped onto a bus
With two of yesterdays travel cards and two bottles of bud
And he said, "You look well nice"
Well she was wearing a skirt
And he thought she looked nice
And yes, she didn't really care about anything else
Cause she only wanted him to think that she looked nice
And he did
But he was looking at her, yeah all funny in the eye
She said, "Come on boy tell me what you're thinking
Now don't be shy."
He said, "Alright, I'll try"
All the stars up in the sky
And the leaves in the trees
All the broken bits that make you jump up
And grassy bits in between
All the matter in the world that's how much that I like you"
She said, "What?"
He said, "Let me try and explain again"

Right, birds can fly so high
And they can shit on your head
Yeah they can almost fly into your eye
And make you feel so scared
But when you look at them
And you see that they're beautiful
That's how I feel about you
Right, birds can fly so high
And they can shit on your head
Yeah they can almost fly into your eye
And make you feel so scared
But when you look at them
And you see that they're beautiful
That's how I feel about you
That's how I feel about you
She said, "What?"
He said, "You"
She said, "What are you talking about?"
He said, "You"

Right, birds can fly so high
And they can shit on your head
Yeah they can almost fly into your eye
And make you feel so scared
But when you look at them
And you see that they're beautiful
That's how I feel about you
Right, birds can fly so high
And they can shit on your head
Yeah they can almost fly into your eye
And make you feel so scared
But when you look at them
And you see that they're beautiful
That's how I feel about you
Right, that's how I feel about you
She said, "Thanks, I like you too"
He said, "Cool"Embed
