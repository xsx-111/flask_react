Mouthwash Lyrics
This is my face
Covered in freckles
With the occasional spot and some veins
This is my body
Covered in skin
And not all of it you can see
And this is my mind
It goes over and over
The same old lines
And this is my brain
It's torturous analytical thoughts
Make me go insane

I use mouthwash
Sometimes I floss
I've got a family
And I drink cups of tea
I've got nostalgic pavements
I've got familiar faces
I've got mixed-up memories
And I've got favourite places
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I hope everything's gonna be alright
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I hope everything's gonna be alright
This is my face
I've got a thousand opinions
And half the time to try and explain
And this is my body
No matter how you try and disable it
Yes I'll still be here
And this is my mind
And although you try to infringe
You cannot confine
And this is my brain
And even if you try and hold me back
There's nothing that you can gain

I use mouthwash
Sometimes I floss
I've got a family
And I drink cups of tea
I've got nostalgic pavements
I've got familiar faces
I've got mixed-up memories
And I've got favourite places
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I hope everything's gonna be alright
And I'm singing, "Oh oh" on a Friday night
And I hope everything's gonna be alright
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh3Embed
