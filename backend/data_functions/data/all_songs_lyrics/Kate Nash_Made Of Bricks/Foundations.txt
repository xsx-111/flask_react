Foundations Lyrics
Thursday night, everything's fine
Except you've got that look in your eye
When I'm telling a story and you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say
You'll go along with it, then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends
Then I'll use that voice that you find annoyin'
And say something like, "Yeah, intelligent input darlin'
Why don't you just have another beer then?"
Then you'll call me a bitch
And everyone we're with will be embarrassed
And I won't give a shit

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go, but I can't
And every time we fight I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't

You said I must eat so many lemons
Cause I am so bitter
I said "I'd rather be with your friends mate
Cause they are much fitter"
Yes it was childish
And you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared
But it gives me thrills to wind you up

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go, but I can't
And every time we fight I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't

Your face is pasty
Cause you've gone and got so wasted, what a surprise
Don't want to look at your face
Cause it's making me sick
You've gone and got sick on my trainers
I only got these yesterday
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this
Well I'll leave you there 'til the mornin'
And I purposely won't turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one
My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go, but I can't
And every time we fight I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't
And every time we fight I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't
And every time we fight I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't4Embed
