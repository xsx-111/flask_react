Merry Happy Lyrics
Watching me like you never watch no one
Don't tell me that you didn't try and check out my bum
Cause I know that you did
Cause your friend told me that you liked it
Gave me those pearls and I thought they were ugly
Don't you try to tell me that you never loved me
I know that you did
Cause you said it and you wrote it down

Dancing at discos
Eating cheese on toast
Yeah you make me merry, make me very very happy
But you obviously, you didn't want to stick around
Dancing at discos
Eating cheese on toast
Yeah you make me merry, make me very very happy
But you obviously, you didn't want to stick around
So I learnt from you
Do do do da do do do do do do da do do do do do do da do do
Do do do da do do do do do do da do do do do do do da do do
I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone
I can watch a sunset on my own

Sitting in restaurants
Thought we were so grown up
But I know now that we were not the people
That we turned out to be
Chatting on the phone, can't take back those hours
But I won't regret
Cause you can grow flowers
From where dirt used to be
Dancing at discos
Eating cheese on toast
Yeah you make me merry, make me very very happy
But you obviously, you didn't want to stick around
Dancing at discos
Eating cheese on toast
Yeah you make me merry, make me very very happy
But you obviously, you didn't want to stick around
So I learnt from you
Do do do da do do do do do do da do do do do do do da do do
Do do do da do do do do do do da do do do do do do da do do

I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
(Do do do da do do...)
I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
(Do do do da do do...)
I can be alone, yeah
I can watch a sunset on my own
I can be alone
I can watch a sunset on my own
Do do do da do do do do do do da do do do do do do da do do
