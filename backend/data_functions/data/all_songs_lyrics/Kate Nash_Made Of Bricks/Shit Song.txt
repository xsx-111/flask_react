Shit Song Lyrics
*coughs* ah, hm, *sniffs* eugh, hmm
La, la, la, la - ack
Fuck - uh

It is like I'm always thinking to myself
I'd like to meet someone else
It is like I'm always thinking to myself
I'd like to meet someone else

Darling, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that you're full of it
You're full of shit
You're full of shit
Darling, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that you're full of it

I'm sitting with my friends getting drunk again
On wine and I think about you
I'm sitting with my friends getting drunk again
On wine and I think about you

You don't have to think about yourself
All the time, you're full of shit
You know you don't
No you don't have to be so up yourself all the time
You could come 'round mine
We could drink some wine
In the summertime
It could be quite nice
You could come 'round mine
We could drink some wine
In the summertime
It could be quite nice
Actually
I think I might just have the bottle
To myself

Darling, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that you're full of it
You're full of shit
You're full of shit
Darling, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that you're full of it
You're full of it
You're full of it
Darling, yeah, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that your full of it
Yeah I know that you're full of it
Yeah darling, yeah, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that your full of it!
Yeah I know that you're full of it!
You could come round mine
We could drink some wine
In the summertime
It could be quite nice
You could come round mine
We could drink some wine
In the summertime
It could be quite nice1Embed
