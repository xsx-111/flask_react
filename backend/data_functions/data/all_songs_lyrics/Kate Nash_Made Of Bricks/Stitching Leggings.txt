Stitching Leggings LyricsI was sewing my leggings back together
But not very well
I was standing by the dashboard
When the plate, it sort of just fell
Sometimes I think that I'm lucky
And other times I don't
But most of the time I just think
Well I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
I was making the dinner and it sort of just burnt
I was walking down the stairs
When I tripped
Fell to the bottom
Broke my foot
And it really f*cking hurt
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well sometimes I think that you hate me
And other times I think that you think I'm endearing
Sometimes I just don't know you at all
Even though I'd like to think I was a bit of a know-it-all
Sometimes I'd just can't work you out
Even though I'd like to know what you were about
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else up
Well at least I don't have all the power in the world so I just can't f*ck everything else up
Yeah, at least I don't have all the power in the world so I just can't f*ck everything else up
Yeah, at least I'm lucky I don't have all the power in the world so I can't f*ck everything else upEmbed
