Dickhead Lyrics
Why're you being a dickhead for
Stop being a dickhead
Why're you being a dickhead for
You're just fucking up situations
Why're you being a dickhead for
Stop being a dickhead
Why're you being a dickhead for
You're just fucking up situations

Shiny floor, slippery feet
Lights are dim, my eyes can't meet
The reflection that turns my images
Upside down so I can see
Think you know everything
You really don't know nothing
I wish that you were more intelligent
So you could see that what you are doing is
So shitty
To me
Thirty five
People couldn't count
On two hands the amount of times you made me stop
Stop and think why are you being such a dickhead for
Stop being a dickhead
Why're you being a dickhead for
You're just fucking up situations
Why're you being a dickhead for
Stop being a dickhead
Why're you being a dickhead for
You're just fucking up situations

Stop, no don't show
Just have a think before you
Will you, stop, no don't show
Just have a think before you
Will you stop, no don't show
Just have a think before you
Will you stop, don't show
Will you just have a think before you

My brain and my bones don't want to take this anymore
No my brain and my bones don't want to take this anymore
No my brain and my bones don't want to take with this anymore
No my brain and my bones don't want to take this anymore, so
Why're you being a dickhead for
Stop being a dickhead
Why're you being a dickhead for
You're just fucking up situations
Why're you being a dickhead for
Stop being a dickhead
Why're you being a dickhead for
You're just fucking up situations2Embed
