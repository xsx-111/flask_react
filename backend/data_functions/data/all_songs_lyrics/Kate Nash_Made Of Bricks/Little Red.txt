Little Red LyricsEverybody took everything that they could and they
Made a little town out of stones and out of wood and they
Made a little king out of plasticine and they
Threw the rules away, but they kept the wisdom in
And all of the birds and the bees lived so peacefully
And all of the babies they slept so, so gently until
Little Red, Little Red, Little Red, Little Red
Little Red, Little Red, Little Red, Little Red
Little Red, Little Red, Little Red, Little Red
Little, Little Red came knocking
Little garden, how do I make your flowers grow
When I already do everything that I know
I bring you sunshine and I bring you rain
Still you refrain
All the other gardens are so full of flowers
They're so colorful, yet, I spend all these hours
Trying to make you as beautiful as them
But still you refrain
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock, knock, scratch
And a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock, knock, scratch
And a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock, knock, scratch
And a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock, knock, scratch
Little girl, why are you crying?
Just because the flowers in your garden are dying?
There's so much that you could be doing
And all of your neighbors, well, they haven't got a clue
Come on with me, we'll have a little fun, yeah
It's not too dangerous and we won't hurt anyone
Yeah, we'll cause some havoc between the birds and the bees
Yeah we'll, we'll paint the town red and we'll shake the trees
Oh, come on with me and I'll show you a good time
All you have to do is a jump and a climb
Yeah I'll, I'll take you over to the other side of town
Yeah there's so much to do there and nobody wears a crown
Should I go or should I stay?
My flowers are dying and I'm sick and tired anyway
This boy seems kind of cool, his jeans are kind of low
Well, I think I'll go
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump jump, jump, climb
And a jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump jump, jump, climb
And a jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump jump, jump, climb
And a jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump jump, jump, climb
Oh let's pack a picnic and we'll go for a drive
We'll go to a fun fair and go on all the rides
We'll climb up a mountain and we'll take in the sights
We'll jump in a plane and fly
If you want you can come back to mine
We'll drink some coffee and you can spend the night
We'll do anything that makes you smile
Cause your smile is beautiful and it makes me happy
Cause your smile is beautiful and it makes me happy
This little girl, she grew up and moved away and she
She lived her life full of risk and full of play and she
She lived her life with so much to say
And her flowers, they grow more beautiful every dayEmbed
