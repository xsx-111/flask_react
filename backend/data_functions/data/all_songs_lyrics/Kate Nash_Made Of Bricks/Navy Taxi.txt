Navy Taxi LyricsRain spat in my face, thanks a lot, mate
And I lost a tenner on the way
Thinkin' about it, did I spend it last night
When I was drunk and I wanted to get more drunk?
Missed the train, thanks a lot, mate
I didn't wanna be late today, 'cause I'm always late
And I really hate always bein' late
And now the other train is delayed, great
Carrier bags and a navy taxi, man said
"Take your time, love 'cause you don't have to rush
'Cause it's your life and it's no one else's, sweetheart
Don't let someone put you in a box"
So I take all that other stuff that I said before
And I'm gonna make it work
Because I'm losin' my mind
And it's drivin' me up the wall
So I tried to help you carry your shoppin'
But I wasn't concentratin', I was talkin'
And I got it caught on the side of this thing
And it split
And I'd try to help you walk along
But I'd probably end up pushin' you over
But don't worry, I'll never let you fall
And I'm stubborn and I'll shout
And I'll cut you out
And I'll, I'll make you feel
Like I never wanted to make you feel
And I'm stubborn and I'll shout
And I'll cut you out
And I'll, I'll make you feel
Like I never wanted to make you feel
Carrier bags and a navy taxi, man said
"Take your time, love 'cause you don't have to rush
'Cause it's your life and it's no one else's, sweetheart
Don't let someone put you in a box"
So I take all that other stuff that I said before
And I'm gonna make it work
Because I'm losin' my mind
And it's drivin' me up the wall
And this time, it will be different
This time, yeah, it will be different
This time, yeah, it will be different
And this time, yeah, it will be different
This time, yeah, it will be different
This time, yeah, it will be different
And this time, yeah, it will be different
This time, yeah, it will be different
This time, it will be different1Embed
