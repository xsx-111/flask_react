Pumpkin Soup Lyrics
You're chatting to me, like we connect
But I don't even know if we're still friends
It's so confusing understanding you is making me not want to do
The things that I know I should do
But I trip fast and then I lose
And I hate looking like a fool

I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss

The lights are on and someone's home
But I'm not sure if they're alone
There's someone else inside my head
Living there to fill me with dread
This paranoia is distressing
And I spend most of my nights guessing
Are we not, are we together?
Will this make our lives much better?
I'm not in love
I just wanna be touched
I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss

Whoops I think I've got too close
Cause now he's telling me I'm the girl that he likes most
Now I messed up it's not the first time
I'm not saying you're not on my mind
I hope that you don't think I'm unkind

I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss boy (Kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kissEmbed
