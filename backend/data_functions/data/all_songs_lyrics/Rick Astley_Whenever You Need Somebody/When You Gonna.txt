When You Gonna LyricsLove is a special thing
It means more to me than just a Wedding ring
When two people join as one
They don't know just what has begun
It comes to love, honour, cherish and obey
You promised girl that you would not go away
When you gonna come back home girl
You know I'm all alone, girl
When you gonna come back home
When you gonna come back home girl
You know I'm all alone, girl
When you gonna come back home

Love is a precious thing
So can't you see the joy that it can bring
So how can you be so cruel
You've gone and broken every rule
You promised to love, honour, cherish and obey
You promised me you'd never go away
When you gonna stay at home boy
You see I was alone, boy
When you gonna stay at home
When you gonna stay at home boy
You see I was alone, boy
When you gonna stay at home
Love's got a hold on me
I need you girl, can't you see

So why don't we spend some time
Let's get together, maybe we could find

We've got to love, honour, cherish and obey
We've got to promise that we'll never go away
Never gonna leave you home, no
Leave you all alone
Now I'm gonna stay at home
Never gonna be alone, no
You see I should have known
Never gonna leave you home
