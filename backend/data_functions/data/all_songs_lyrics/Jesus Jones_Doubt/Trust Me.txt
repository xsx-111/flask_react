Trust Me Lyrics
Trust me, I know what I'm doing

From day one I got things wrong
One day I'll get things right (Maybe)
I never thought I knew the answers
While the whole world thinks they might
Big headed, wrong-headed
Anything under the sun, I'm really no one

Trust me, trust me
Trust me

You were pushed away, you were led astray
You were dragged up the garden path
I made damn sure that I never (Ever)
Did things by half

Trust me, trust me
Trust me
I know what I'm doing
Trust me, trust me
Trust me, trust me
Trust me, trust me
Trust me, trust me
Trust me, trust me
Trust me, I know what I'm doingEmbed
