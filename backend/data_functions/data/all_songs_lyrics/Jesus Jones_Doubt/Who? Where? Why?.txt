Who? Where? Why? Lyrics
Who am I?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?

Have you ever felt that it's someone else
Living your life?
The image of you, only better, it's true
At the outside, at the outside
At the outside, at the outside

Who am I?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Jesus Jones
Jesus Jones

Is there nothing I've done that was truly begun
By the real me?
Have I stood to the side aware of the tide
That drags me
Out to the sea?

Jesus Jones
Jesus Jones

Who am I?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Who am I?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?
Where am I?
Why do I feel this way?Embed
