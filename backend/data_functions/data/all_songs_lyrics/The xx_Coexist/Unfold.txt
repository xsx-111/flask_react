Unfold Lyrics
Am I blind?
You move your hand away from mine
And I don't take it as a sign
That you're any less than mine

Oh, it doesn't move me to be cold
It doesn't lessen my hold
You know our time and all
Oh, let it unfold
I won't leave it untold
The feeling goes on and on and on

In my head
You tell me things you've never said
And I choose to forget
I take the good and leave the rest

Oh, the illusion's getting old
And you don't answer when I call
I would have given you it all
Oh, out of sight, out of mind
It doesn't mean you're not mine
The feeling goes on and on and on6Embed
