Missing Lyrics
My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
I don't feel the same
My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time

Will you miss me
(How did I, how did I how did I, oh)
When there's nothing to see?
(How did I, how did I how did I, oh)
Tell me, how did this come to be?
(How did I, how did I how did I, oh)
And now there's no hope for you and me

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
I don't feel the same
My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
Do you still believe
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh)
In you and me?
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh)
Are we all we could be?
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh)
Is it meant to be?

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
I don't feel the same
My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time8Embed
