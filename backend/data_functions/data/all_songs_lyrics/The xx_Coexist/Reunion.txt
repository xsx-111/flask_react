Reunion Lyrics
Revisit a life we both left behind
We don't know the harm
Move to the ever moving
All blazing, we go over and over
And over and over again
If I wait too long
I lose you from my sight
Maybe tonight
I could stop dreaming
And start believing in forever and ever
And ever and ever again

Reunion, reunion
Reunion, reunion
Never not ever
Never not ever again

When there's burning inside
Do you give it up?
How long should I wait?
There's no need to hide
When there's only you in here
There's an end to us with someone else in sight
You shine your light
And there goes that feeling, won't let me see them
Never not ever
Never not ever again
Did I see you see me in a new light?
Did I see you see me in a new light?
Did I see you see me in a new light?
Never not ever again
Did I (Never again)
See you (Never again)
See me (Never not ever)
In a new light? (Never not ever again)
Did I see you see me?
Never not ever
Never not ever again8Embed
