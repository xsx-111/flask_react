Fiction Lyrics
Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation
I wake up alone, with only daylight between us
Last night the world was beneath us, tonight comes, too long
We'll be torn apart by the break of day
You're more than I can believe
Would ever come my way

Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation
Come real life, why do I refuse you?
Cause if my fear's right, I risk to lose you
And if I just mind and wake up alone
Bring on the night

Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation
An uncertain haze, how am I to tell?
I know your face all too well, still I wake up alone
Fiction when we're not together19Embed
