Reconsider Lyrics
Remember me, I'm the one that's back from over
Time's gone by and I'm still so far from over
You reappeared like you had never been gone
I lose composure
You're touching me like you have no desire for closure
Reconsider

Did you lie awake like I did?
I stayed up til the stars didn't recognise me
So long
I waited so long
Now you don't see the skies that I do
My sun becomes your moon
For a familiar love
I am familiar love6Embed
