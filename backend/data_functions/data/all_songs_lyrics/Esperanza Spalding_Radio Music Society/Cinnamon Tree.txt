Cinnamon Tree LyricsCinnamon tree, graceful and free
We meet just once in a while but the spice in your smile is magic to me
Cinnamon tree, wise and sturdy
Your roots are firm in the ground to soak up whats around and make sweet seasoning, oh
Please rub off on me
So I carry a little of your auburn hue
For spice when days are dull or dreary
You bend your bows towards me
Times I'm weak and need someone to turn to
You share your flavor, ease my misery
You give all that you are
And just keep on growing
Your fragrance lives in all who know you
Cinnamon tree, grace falling free
We meet just once in a while but the spice in your smile is magic to me
Cinnamon tree, wise and sturdy
Your roots are firm in the ground to soak up whats around and make sweet seasoning, oh
It still amazes me
I just think of one stirring conversation
With you and my cup is filled with new infusions
And like your honesty
In the midst of all the sweetened chatter
Your earthy taste adds real perspective
You give all that you are
And just keep on growing
Your fragrance lives in all who love you
Cinnamon tree, graceful and free
We meet just once in a while but the spice in your smile is magic to me
Cinnamon tree, wise and sturdy
Your roots are firm in the ground to soak up whats around and make sweet seasoning, oh2Embed
