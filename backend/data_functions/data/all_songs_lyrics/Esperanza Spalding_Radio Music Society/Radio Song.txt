Radio Song LyricsLa la la la la la la la...
Right now you need it, driving yourself through the hard times
Traffic won't speed up, so you turn the radio on
(La la la la la la la la)
But it's the same old stuff that makes you yawn
(La la la la la la la la)
Well somehow he feels it and the DJ here at the station
Sends sweet salvation, when he starts to play this song
Now you can't help singin' along, even though you never heard it
You keep singin' it wrong
This song will keep you grooving
(Keep that traffic movin')
Play it to lift your spirits
(Soon as you hear it)
Words are speaking to you
(As if they knew you)
Ooh, this song's the one
(Keep that traffic movin')
Play it to lift your spirits
Words are speaking to you
Ooh, this song's the one
(You gotta make moving)
Play it to lift your spirits
(Soon as you hear it)
Words are speaking to you
(As if they knew you)
Yes, this song's the one
Even though you never heard it
You keep singing it wrong, this song's the one
And then they start mixing it up
When you're tired and scared of missing something
Waiting for some magic to come and make you feel better
Enter that song
Now that's how we know the power of song can save
When you're tired and scared of missing something
Waiting for some magic to come and make you feel better
Enter that song
Now that's how we know the power of song can save
A song can save
Well it can surely save the day and keep you grooving
(Keep it movin')
Play it to lift your spirits
Words are speaking to you
Yes, this song's the one
(Keep it movin')
Play it to lift your spirits
(Soon as you hear it)
Words are speaking to you
(As if they knew you)
Yes, this song's the one
La la la la la la la la...
Smiling and driving, sounds like soon it might be over
So you pull over, and start scrambling for a pen
But another verse comes in again
Paper in hand, you, can't help movin' while you're listenin'
Your skin starts bristlin', here comes the part you know
And you can't help singing along, even though you never heard it
And you keep singing it wrong
This song will keep you grooving
(Keeps traffic movin')
Play it to lift your spirits
(Soon as you hear it)
The words are speaking to you
(As if they knew you)
Ooh, this song's the one
(Keeps traffic movin')
Play it to lift your spirits
When the words are speaking to you
Ooh, this song's the one
(Keep that traffic movin')
Play it to lift your spirits
(Soon as you hear it)
Words are speaking to you
(As if they knew you)
Yes, this song's the one
Yes, this song's the one
Now if you want to
Sing it loud, with love, with love in your heart
(Play it to lift your spirits)
Because you like to, because you need to
This song's the one
Now if you want to
Sing it loud, with love, with love in your heart
Because you like to, because you need to
