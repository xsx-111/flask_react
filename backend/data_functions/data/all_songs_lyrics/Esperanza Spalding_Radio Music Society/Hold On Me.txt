Hold On Me LyricsI can hold my tongue for years I don't mind
For within that time, silent I recite thousands of poems about you
Until one of them comes true
I can hold my breath for years I won't get blue
On sweet sigh from you
In my memories the breath of life that tights me through
Till the air is clear enough to breathe around you
I'll keep holding on
Such a thrill when you're near, but a staggering feat
Holding still when I feel folks can hear my heartbeat
Your love may never flow my way still I'm gonna keep holding on
Shouldn't I just let go, since there's nothing left to do?
Time just melts away and the current grows stronger, pulling me downstream tâ€™ward you
But until my love runs dry, I'm gonna keep holding on
Holding on, I can't help myself when you're near, my head goes wild and my heart beats like an eager child
I keep holding on, holding onEmbed
