Smile Like That LyricsSmile Like That
Smile…
Scatting
It's been awhile since I've seen that smile
I can't help but wonder
And it's nothing but natural to wonder
If you've ever loved her
I'll be sure when I see
That I can make you smile like that
Smile like that
Is there something I can't help but notice
The way your eyes focus
On each word and gesture
She does that makes you smile like that
Smile like that now
I like that your heart is open
And you love freely and all
But not like that
I want us to be two lovely people
And we feel like three…
Now I like that your heart is open
And you love freely and all
But not like that
I want us to be two lovely people
Just two
Just me just you
I don't really mind if you smile like that
If it's something you can't help don't worry
But don't pretend you don't see
And feel what's obvious to me
Every time you smile that
When you smile like that
They've got something we don't have
It's natural
Let's just leave it at that so
To let you be
And maybe find someone that makes me smile like that
I wanna smile like that and
I still like that your heart is open and you love freely
And all
So stay like that
I'm sure that you'll be two lovely people
Gonna set you freeEmbed
