Vague Suspicions LyricsOn the neon news
They won't be talking about his life
Flowers still unfolding when he had to fly
Toward, toward God
May this war end
Insha'Allah, he knelt to pray
When a dusty troop misjudged
And blew him away
Strangers
Same God
There were faceless numbers
In the headlines we've all read
Drone strike leaves thirteen civilians dead
Hold that thought
My God
Maybe our heart is seized with passing pity for the death
And vague suspicions creep into your head
Am I part of war?
And what is God for?
