Let Her LyricsYou just walked into the quiet after the storm, yes
It's chillingly silent, and you sense that something's wrong
Hmmm, something's surely wrong
And you saw the letter, with the keys laying on the counter
But you know just what it means, and grab the phone to call her
Now is this another of her cruel jokes or
She made good those threats to finally leave you
Tears well up in your eyes which your worn-down nerves won't let you cry, and finally
Chorus:
She's gone, bye-bye, so long
Let her go
She's gone, bye-bye, so long now
Love goes on
Apartment stripped in silence
Still you hear each fighting, sobbing make up
And all those crazy ways you forgave each time she loved you
Now that you're all alone
You realize she filled your life with litter
Her kisses used to thrill
Now the aftertaste is bitter
With the memories from the mess you've endured when...
Chorus:
She's gone, bye-bye, so long
Let her go
She's gone, bye-bye, so long now
Love goes onEmbed
