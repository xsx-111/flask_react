Crowned & Kissed Lyrics
My king, my king, my, my, my, my
My king, my king, my, my, my, my

Where is the throne
For you, whose tender strength can heal a thousand souls
Everyone you touch just (Turns to gold)
Many have tried
But you're the one whose noble touch has gently pried
The sword from my heart

(Once you) Put a smile on the sun
(Once you) Paved the road for everyone
(And you) Shed the worries of another
(And you) Lay your burdens down

Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
To love you, I'm here

Go ahead, take on the world
I'll be beside you as you vanquish pain and woe
Each battlefield transformed now (hope can grow)
Oh, this is you sure can do alone
But I know even the strongest man needs someone to hold him

(Once you) Carried all the weight on the shoulder
(And you) Made a way for the future
Lay your burdens down
Let me love you

Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
Lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
I'm here, I'm here

Just lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you
Lay your burdens down
Don't even make a sound, don't worry about a thing
I'm here to love you
My kisses are your crown and I'm your queen
So now lay with me, my king
I'm here to love you

Lay your burdens down, don't even make a sound
I'll be beside you as you vanquish pain and war
So hope can grow
Everyone you touch just turns to gold
(I'm here to love you)
I want you to know I'll be by your side
I'm here to love youEmbed
