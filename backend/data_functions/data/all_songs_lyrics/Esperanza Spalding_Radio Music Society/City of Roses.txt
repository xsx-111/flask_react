City of Roses Lyrics
In the city of roses
Streets lined with red brick and green branches
All the rainy days might seem bleak
Our rain is the paint that makes the land lush and the folks unique
City parks, wild berries, and old bridges
A rolling river bringing good to and from the sea
And mountain hooded in snow silently watching over me

Everywhere I go these roots are with me
And I find
I take along a little piece of heaven
With these memories of mine

From the city of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses

Down along the river weekend market
On sunny Saturdays the waterfront comes alive
With street vendors and hippies that keep a hemp sack flying
All the people you could wish for or imagine
From the farmer in the city selling fresh grown greens
Musicians hustling to make sure that there's a thriving jazz scene
Everywhere I go these roots are with me
And I find
I take along a little piece of heaven
With these memories of mine
Everywhere I go these roots are with me
And I find
Wherever I may travel I take with me
These memories of mine

From the city of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses


Everywhere I go these roots are with me
And I find
I take along a little piece of heaven
With these memories of mine
Everywhere I go these roots are with me
Yeah, and I find
Wherever I may travel I take with me
Portland in my mind

Mmm, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of roses
City of roses, city of rosesEmbed
