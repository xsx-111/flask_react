Out of the Blue LyricsNo need to wipe your feet
The welcome mat's not there
But just take care
Before you dare to
Step inside my door
Something unbelievable
Has happened to the floor
Something unbelievable
Has happened to the floor
Something unbelievable
Has happened to the floor
Something unbelievable
These rooms won't give you shelter
They're open to the air
The upper story's out of reach
The stairs no longer there
Beyond all understanding
You've blown my house apart
You've set me free
You've set me free
You've set me free
You've set me free
You've set me free
To let you know
You've set me free
To let you know
You've planted
Everlasting hatred in my heart
You've planted
Everlasting hatred in my heart
My rooms won't give you shelter
They're open to the air
The upper story's out of reach
The stairs no longer there

You've planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You've planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You've planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You've planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You have planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You have planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You have planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You have planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heart
You have planted
All your everlasting hatred in my heartEmbed
