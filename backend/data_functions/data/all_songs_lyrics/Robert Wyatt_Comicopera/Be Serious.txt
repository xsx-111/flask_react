Be Serious LyricsI really envy Christians
I envy Muslims too
It must be great to be so sure
As a top Hindu or Jew
He said
"Pray to God for mercy"
He said
"Get down on your knees"
He said
"Ask Him for forgiveness"
He said
"When you do say please (do us a favour)"
And I got no one to turn to
When I'm sinking in the shit
I feel so sad and lonely
No-one to tell me what to do
He said
"Well I shouldn't grumble
We all have our ups and down
If you just ask Him nicely
He'll iron out your frown (I said do us a favour)"
And if I don't believe in will power (keep ya hair on)
Self expressions such a fraud
I mean how can I express myself
When there's no self to express
Be serious
Then he put a lid on it
Do us a favour
Do us a favour
I really envy Christians (do us a favour)
I envy Muslims too (do us a favour)
It must be great to be so sure (do us a favour)
Probably do want you (do us a favour)
Do us a favour
Do us a favour
When I've got no one to turn to (do us a favour)
When I'm sinking in the ship (do us a favour)
Feel so sad and lonely (do us a favour)
No-one to tell me what to do (do us a favour)
Be serious (do us a favour)
Do us a favour
Do us a favour
And I don't believe in willpower (do us a favour)
Self expressions such a fraud (do us a favour)
How can I express myself (do us a favour)
When there's no self to express (do us a favour)
Be serious (do us a favour)
Be serious (do us a favour)
Be serious (do us a favour)
Be serious (do us a favour)
Beeee serious (do us a favour)
Be serious (do us a favour)
Be serious (do us a favour)
...the dust... a building... the universe...
Do us a favour
Do us a favour
