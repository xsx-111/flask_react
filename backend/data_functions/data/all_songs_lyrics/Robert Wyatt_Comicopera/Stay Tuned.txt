Stay Tuned LyricsIn-between lost in noise
Somewhere, somewhere
In-between got no choice
But to be here
Somewhere, somewhere
If you can hear me
If you're still there
Stay tuned
There is more to come
Oh don't start searching
I'll get back to you
Riding waves trying to reach
Somewhere, somewhere
Cannot share this moment with you
I'm particles in the air
You can't see me
But I'm here
So if you can hear me
If you're still there
Stay tuned
There is more to come
Oh don't stop searching
Stay tuned
There is more to come
Oh don't stop searching
I'll get back to you
I'll get back to you
I'll get back to youEmbed
