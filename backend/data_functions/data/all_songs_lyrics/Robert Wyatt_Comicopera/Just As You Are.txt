Just As You Are LyricsMonica Vasconcelos:
It's that look in your eyes
Telling me lies
So many promises broken
What can I do?
What should I do?
Try to love you just as you are
'Cause I'm never going to change a thing about you
Never ever going to change a thing
Try to love you just as you are
Should I leave, should I stay
Should I call it a day
There's so much to say that's unspoken
In your way you've been true
But all I can do
Try to love you just as you are
'Cause I'm never going to change a thing
No I'll never ever change a thing about you
Try to love you just as you are
Robert Wyatt:
It's that look in your eyes
I know you despise me
For not being stronger
What can I do?
What should I do?
I've always loved you just as you are
And I never tried to change a thing
Never tried to change a thing about you
Always loved you just as you are
Will you leave, will you stay?
There may come a day
When I'm weak and I'm stupid no longer
In my way I've been true
I've lived just for you
I'll always love you just as you are
I never tried to change a thing
Never tried to change a thing about you
Always loved you just as you areEmbed
