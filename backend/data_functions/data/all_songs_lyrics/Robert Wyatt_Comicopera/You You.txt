You You LyricsDo do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do doâ€¦
You
You (???) (at the light?) when the dark descends
So I don't mind when it's that time again
Perfect time for you you
For you you
For you you
I feel you when night comes again
I'm tumbling down
(It's falling?)
You
You gave me money stuck in my memory
Just like you
You're here where you should be
You you you
You you you
You you you
You you
You
Is it you, love love?
(???) away with the night
And when day comes you'll (???) (there?)
So terrible to lose you
When the morning comes
You you
You you
You you
You you
You you
You youEmbed
