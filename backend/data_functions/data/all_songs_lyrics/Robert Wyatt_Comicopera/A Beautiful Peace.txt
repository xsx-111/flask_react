A Beautiful Peace LyricsOh look, there's a dead rabbit,… all flat,… completely flat...… Oh there's another one…...
What's in the gutter... oh it's a… one of those polystyrene… um boxes… that's all… take away... there's chips in there… didn't really want to finish the chips… that's unusual…...
I've been walking for hours
Needed a rest
Take a good look around
Nowhere to rest
There's a shop
Selling gentlemen's suits
Further along
An estate agent or two
And a take-away sign
Over a dusty door
Shiny photos of food
Slightly microwaved
There's a Methodist hall
No Smoking
No Dogs
In the Methodist hall
It looks pretty grim
In the Methodist hall
Despite a poster which says that
"He's There for Us All"
And it's a beatuful day
For walking away
Its's a beautiful day
But not thereEmbed
