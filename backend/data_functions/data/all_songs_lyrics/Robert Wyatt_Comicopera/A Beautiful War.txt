A Beautiful War LyricsIt's a beautiful day
To see my prey
It's a beautiful day
For a daring raid
I can see my prey from afar
So I open the hatch
And I drop the first batch
It's a shame I'll miss the blaze
But I'll see the film within days
And I'll get to see the replay
Of my beautiful day
Re-live my day
My beautiful day
Re-live my beautiful day
My beautiful day
When I open the hatch
And I drop the first batch
How they got no time to flee
Total success
We'll all be free
We'll all be free
We'll all be free
We'll all be free
We'll all be free
What a beautiful day
Just a beautiful day
Just a beautiful day
Just a beautiful dayEmbed
