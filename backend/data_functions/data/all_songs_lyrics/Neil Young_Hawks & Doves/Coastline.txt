Coastline Lyrics
Down on the coastline, Highway One
People heading out for the sun
That's where I found you long time ago
You're my angel, you're my queen
You're my best friend in between

We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning

Oowee, baby, what a night
That old moon sure is shining bright
We'll be dancing till the morning comes
High on the mountain top
Above the clouds
No wonder we get a little loud

We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning


We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morningEmbed
