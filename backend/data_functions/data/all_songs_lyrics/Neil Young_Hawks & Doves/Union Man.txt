Union Man Lyrics
I'm proud to be a union man
I make those meetings when I can, yeah
I pay my dues ahead of time
When the benefits come I'm last in line, yeah
I'm proud to be a union man

Every fourth Friday at 10 am
There's a local meeting of the A F of M, yeah!
"This meeting will now come to order. Is there any new business?"
"Yeah, I think 'Live music are better' bumper stickers should be issued"
"What was that?"
"'Live music is better' bumper stickers should be issued"
"The gentleman says 'Live music is better' bumper stickers should be issued
All in favor of what he said signify by saying 'aye'"
"Aye!, Aye!"
"If, however, you are opposed signify by saying 'no'"
I'm proud to be a union manEmbed
