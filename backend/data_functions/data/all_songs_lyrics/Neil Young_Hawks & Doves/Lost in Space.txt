Lost in Space Lyrics
Live with me 
Lost in space
I heard you were lost in space
That's such a lonely place
For you to be
Out of control
Singing with too much soul
I heard you got out on parole
Working for the queen
Gardening again
Landscape again
Keeping all the grounds
Around her clean
Working for the queen
Don't take out the magic pen
Don't draw on the infinity board
Your buildings, if they rise again
Would do much better
On the ocean floor
They'll never feel the way
They did before 
Out on the ocean floor 
What could be stranger than the unknown danger
That lies on the ocean floor?
Breakers crash on the beach
I count them like lambs in my sleep
They come at me steady
They know I'm not ready
They pound on my mattress door
Have they got a big one in store
Losing you
I heard I was losing you
That's not the only thing that I got to lose
I got to lose
The deep sea blues
Look at these blues
The deep sea blues
Live with me, live with meEmbed
