Mother Earth LyricsDo-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
A woman she is, mother of us all, y'all
Spinning around, keeping man tall
And she's always there sharing her love between us
Guiding all the years she knows before us
(Loving, giving, caring, sharing, giving, loving)
And Mother Earth goes spinning around
And spinning around and spinning around
Mother Earth, she spins around, round and around
Spinning around, making no sound
All the children of the Earth to who she gave birth
Always came first, for better or worse
Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...
Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...
Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...
Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...
And she's always there sharing her love between us
Guiding all the years she knows before us
(Loving, giving, caring, sharing, giving, loving)
And Mother Earth goes spinning around
And spinning around and spinning aroundEmbed
