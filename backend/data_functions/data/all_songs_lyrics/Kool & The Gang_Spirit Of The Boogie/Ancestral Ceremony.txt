Ancestral Ceremony LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
We are scientists of sound
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...)
Rhythmatically puttin' it down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...)
Movin’ rhythms in time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...)
Let the music kick your mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...)
Music is the message
Let the music in your heart
And we're just makin' mad music
For all our friends
Makin’ mad music
For all our friends
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
Music, music
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
