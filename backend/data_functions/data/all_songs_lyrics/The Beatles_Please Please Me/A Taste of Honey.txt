A Taste of Honey Lyrics
A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back (He'll come back) for the honey (For the honey) and you4Embed
