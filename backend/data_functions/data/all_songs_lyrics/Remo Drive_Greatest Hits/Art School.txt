Art School Lyrics
Look around in awe, no sound
A sea of bodies
Great view, feet on the ground
My label peeling
Art school
Colored hair
Too cool
For me but that's fair
Lay down, I lie again
My pants on fire
Talking so confident
My small empire
My band
Somewhere in Dinky
My bad
Shoulda knew you're busy

Look around in awe, no sound
A sea of bodies
Great view, feet on the ground
My label peeling
Art school
Colored hair
Too cool
For me but that's fair
Lay down, I lie again
My pants on fire
Talking so confident
My small empire
My band
Somewhere in Dinky
My bad
Shoulda knew you're busy4Embed
