Name Brand LyricsWho's got money for all my needs?
Who's got pennies to help feed me?
Irresponsibility is dear to me
I piss away my money on this bourgeoisie coffee
I am a child who needs pleasing
Pacifier lost my mouth I'm screaming
Who's got something really dirty?
I wanna prove myself as an adult
Who's got something really nasty?
Yellowing my teeth but I don't stop
I am a child who has questions
Is the dark for adult interaction?
At thirteen I swore I'd stay pure and
Yeah, these days I wish I broke my promise
Fendi, Fendi, Gucci
Hemi, Hemi, Chevy
Burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning
Fendi, Fendi, Gucci
Hemi, Hemi, Chevy
Burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning
Design all my affliction and
Blame it all on the past
Interests something in the air between us
Keeping me here
I need this
Never ending chase for freedom
From my own picture of perfect
'Cause it's not worth it
It's not worth it, no4Embed
