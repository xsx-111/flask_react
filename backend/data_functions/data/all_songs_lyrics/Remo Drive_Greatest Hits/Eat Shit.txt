Eat Shit LyricsPainting all of my body
Insurance can pay for me falling
I'm no stranger to hospital lobbies
I never go home
Getting stitches is embarrassing when you're aging
All my friends are growing up
I'm tearing up my jeans
Crashing my head in the pavement
I try to apply a meaning
I'm so stuck in the habits I formed when I was fifteen
Getting stitches is embarrassing when you're aging
All my friends are growing up
I eat shit dailyEmbed
