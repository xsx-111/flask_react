Strawberita Lyrics
I heard you wanted to test the water
Lay your head back, lay your head back
Burn your fingers playing with fire
Stay relaxed, stay relaxed
All my friends have plans with you
A party hat and mask that we can wear into the blue
In this evening I could lose
All the will I had to stay the hell away from you
Tonight I’m donning a stupid smile
I’m so pleasant, I’m so pleasant
Tonight I’m feeling so servile
I’m so sweet and I’m so sweet, yeah

Woo!
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

I want nothing to do with you
I want nothing to do with you
I want nothing to do with you
I want nothing to do with you1Embed
