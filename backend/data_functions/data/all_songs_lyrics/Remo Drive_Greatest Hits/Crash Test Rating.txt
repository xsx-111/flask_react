Crash Test Rating LyricsThe bags in my eyes are too heavy to carry
I wonder if you're around
My feet are too fragile for weight bearing
Please come help me bring me down
Admit it, you never really felt right
I question myself all the time
Admit it, you never really felt fine
Dismiss it, I need it right
Whoa, maybe we're nothing
Whoa, maybe we're nothing
Whoa, maybe we're nothing
Whoa, maybe we're nothing
The feelings I have are getting scary
I wonder how serious they are
I find that I'm always comparing
What good has that done me thus far?
Admit it, you never really felt right
I question myself all the time
Admit it, you never really felt fine
Dismiss it, I need it right
Only like me 'cause I'm safe
With my four-star crash test rating
Only like me when it's late
I don't know why I keep staying
Only like me 'cause I'm safe
With my four-star crash test rating
Only like me when it's late
All the time that I've been wasting3Embed
