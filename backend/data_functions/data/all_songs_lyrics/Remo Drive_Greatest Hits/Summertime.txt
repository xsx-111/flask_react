Summertime Lyrics
When you’re all alone
Face in your pillow
Springs in your mattress
Dig into your chest
Don’t kid yourself
Don’t kid yourself, Oh
When you lock your doors
Board up your windows
Draw up your curtains
It’s bound to get dark
Don’t kid yourself
Don’t kid yourself, Oh

Living’s easy
Summer time
Living’s easy
Everything’s fine for now
How long can it last

When you feel low
Staining the window
Motion strewn sheets
Across the floor
Don’t kid yourself
Don’t kid yourself, Oh
When you come home
You’ll be alone
Pleasure is fickle
Beats away through your breast
Don’t kid yourself
Don’t kid yourself, Oh

Living’s easy
Summer time
Living’s easy
Everything’s fine for now
How long can it last1Embed
