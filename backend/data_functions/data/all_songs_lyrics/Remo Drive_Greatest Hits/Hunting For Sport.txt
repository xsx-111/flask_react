Hunting For Sport LyricsHow long, how long
You’ve got me actin' as the dog I have become
How long, how long
Satiea in moments passing then they’re gone
You got me runnin' in a round
Wear me to the ground
Look and looking all around
Now I’m unsure if I want my master’s love
After groaning oh the pest I have become
What is love if it’s just you and me and everybody else you fuckin' know
How come, how come
You’ve kept me on this leash for so god damn long
How come, how come
You look at me and still you feel a need for someone
Another head in your collection
Hanging on your wall
Another strike of indiscretion
Now I’m unsure if I want my master’s love
After groaning oh the pest I have become
What is love if it’s just you and me and everybody else you fuckin' know
And I’ll come back in the morning- just as I always do1Embed
