How About You LyricsWriter(s): B. Lane/R. Freed
I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due
I like potato chips, moonlight motor trips, how about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill
And James Durante's looks give me a thrill
Holding hands in the movie show, when all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it, how about you?Embed
