You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me LyricsIf the nightingales could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me
And if the sandman brought me dreams of you
I'd want to sleep my whole life through
You brought a new love to me
I know that I'm the slave, you're the queen
Still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a maid and I am only a man
I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
You brought a new kind of love to meEmbed
