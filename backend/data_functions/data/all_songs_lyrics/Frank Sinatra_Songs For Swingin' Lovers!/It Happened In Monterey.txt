It Happened In Monterey LyricsIt happened in Monterey
A long time ago
I met her in Monterey
In old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart
Longs for the sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey
It happened in Monterey
A long time ago
I met her in Monterey
In old Mexico
Stars, guitars
Lips red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I fear that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
And without thinking twice
I left her and I threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart
How it longs for that sweetheart
That I left in old MontereyEmbed
