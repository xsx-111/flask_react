Old Devil Moon LyricsWriter(s): B. Lane/ E.Y. Harburg
I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon;
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
You and you glance;
Make this romance;
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night;
Blazing their light;
Can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide;
On a magic carpet ride;
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
Just when I think, I'm;
Free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with loveEmbed
