Love Is Here To Stay LyricsIt's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year. But, ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passin' fancies, and in time may go...
But, Ooooh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're - goin' a long, long way
In time The Rockies may crumble - Gibralter may tumble
They're only made of clay
But, our love is here to stay...
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passin' fancy's anytime they go...
But, Ooooh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're - goin' a long, long way
In time The Rockies may crumble and that Gibralter it may tumble
They're only made of clay
But, our love, our love is here to stayEmbed
