Danger Zone LyricsWatch Out
I'm back on the streets again
Breaking the law
Reason apart tell me just
Search for me once more
Oh, no, try to lock me in my room
Oh, no, and throw away the key
Oh, no, they think they've found the missing link tonight
They're out to be
In the danger zone
The sky is black
In the danger zone
The growing crack
In the danger zone
And lightning strikes my brain
Count me once forget me twice
My old rockers are here tonight
The word is out
The time is right
Run ahead and take a bite
Oh, no, it doesn't really beat you
It's just another scare
They're only try to bleed you
Step up and take what you can
In the danger zone
The sky is black
In the danger zone
The growing crack
In the danger zone
And lightning strikes my brain
In the danger zone
There's no way out
In the danger zone
You're running round and round
In the danger zone
There's nothing you can do
No, no, no, no
On the run
Out in the cold
On the run
In the danger zone
On the run
On my own
Out in the cold
In the danger zone
In the danger zone
The sky is black
In the danger zone
The growing crack
In the danger zone
And lightning strikes my brain
The danger zone
There's no way out
In the danger zone
You're running round and round
In the danger zone
There's nothing you can do
In the danger zone
You got nowhere to hide
In the danger zone
You know you're trapped inside
In the danger zone
There's nothing you can do
In the danger zoneEmbed
