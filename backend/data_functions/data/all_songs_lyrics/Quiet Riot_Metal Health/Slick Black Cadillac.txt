Slick Black Cadillac LyricsSlick black Cadillac
Ooo, just a big black set of wheels
Is what it takes to get me off
I'm gonna drive all night
Spin my wheels all night
It feels all right, oh yeah, it feels all right
I don't need no drivers license
I'm too reckless to survive
It's like a carburetor instigator
Feels all right, yes it feels all right
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac
It's got solid gold hub caps
It makes me feel like a king
I only need one thing
And that's a slick black Cadillac
Ooo, give it up
Now I got a fully equipped rock 'n' roll machine
At speeds that take me high, high, high
Dead man's curve
I hear one word drive, drive, drive
Drive, drive, drive
My machine is making headlines
Gives me love and everything
It's like an institution of revolution
It feels all right, oh yeah, it feels all right
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac
It's got solid gold hub caps
It makes me feel like a king
I only need one thing
And that's a slick black Cadillac
Pull over, woo
I got the coppers on my trail
Just for me an A.P.B
Sirens spinnin', me who's winnin'
They're after me, they're after me
Before I know just what happened
I disappeared to their surprise
I got a Cadillac monkey on my back
And I don't mind, no no, I don't mind
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac
It's got solid gold hub caps
It makes me feel like a king
I only need one thing
And that's a slick black Cadillac
Slick black Cadillac
It's got solid gold h-hub caps
Slick black Cadillac
I lay it down, spin wide
And get laid in back, yeah
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac
It makes me feel like a king, alrightEmbed
