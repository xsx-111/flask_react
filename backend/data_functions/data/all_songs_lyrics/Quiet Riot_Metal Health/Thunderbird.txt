Thunderbird LyricsHello, you, yes, it's me
You can't come back, you're flyin' free
You think you found
Everything that you need
Fly away, fly away
To your new home
Across the seas
Oh, leave your nest
Oh baby leave the best thing
That you've been
Fly on, thunderbird fly
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky
Fly on, thunderbird fly
On your own and I'm alone
In the shadow of what we done
And I can't help but think
That someday you'll be back home
Fly away, fly away
To your new home
Across the bay
And give your best
Ooh, baby leave the best thing
That you've been
Fly on, thunderbird fly
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky
Fly on, thunderbird fly
Fly on
When all is said, all is done
Still I live and carry on
Don't look back but think of me
We'll meet again, fly away
Fly on, thunderbird fly
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky
Fly on, thunderbird fly
Fly on, thunderbird fly
(You've got fly away)
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky
(On to the sky)
Fly on Thunderbird
