CASH MANIAC | CAZH MAN1AC Lyrics
Movin' up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands, cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall

In my Wonderland, I'm back on my Alice
Back in my palace, I'm fly like Aladdin
Serving my fans all my dope, 'cause they addicts
Haters mad 'cause I'm on top like an attic
And if it's beef then we shootin' sporadic
Game is like Disney, my words are like magic
I like "Black Beatles," but act like Black Sabbath
I smoke the O-Z when shit gets erratic

You see my future, but you cannot have it
I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit
Balance my chi so I could tame the savage
Getting so throwed 'til my thoughts are in fragments (fragments)

Movin' up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall
Movin' up like escalators
I can’t see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall
Life is so golden that's how I'm livin'
Look at my trunk jumpin' out like it ribbit
Devil gon' hate, blurrin' my vision
That's me at my lowest, no Peter Griffin
Young, black and gifted, I'm 'bout to get lifted
Now all my troubles and problems have shifted
After my fifth hit it seems I'll be driftin'
I'm never slipping, I'm forever pimpin'

You see my future, but you cannot have it
I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit
Balance my chi now, I'm feeling fantastic
Getting so throwed 'til my thoughts are in fragments

Movin' up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall
Movin' up like escalators
I can’t see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall
Cash maniac (Cash maniac)
Cash maniac (Cash maniac)
Cash maniac (Cash maniac)
Pay my money now
'Cause I like it when you
Fold it nice and clean, yeah
Pay my money now
'Cause I like it when you
Fold it nice and clean, yeah
I'll see you around33Embed
