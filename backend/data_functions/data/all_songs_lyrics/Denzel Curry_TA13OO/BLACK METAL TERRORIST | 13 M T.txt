BLACK METAL TERRORIST | 13 M T Lyrics
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell

Back and I'm dark and mysterious (Yeah)
Laughing away 'til I do something serious
Attitude only imperious (Yeah)
Rest all my enemies like I'm insidious
Inside I'm feeling so hideous (Yeah)
Fuck everybody, I murder you idiots
I am a little perfidious (Yeah)
Fuck a civilian, we're not equivalent
I am a little delirious (What?), suck my balls-almic (What?)
Drop bombs, Islamic (What?), flow so dead, sonic (What?)
I hear that life is a bitch (Yeah), I hear that life is a beast (Yeah)
Life is a freak on a leash (What?), I am the mark of the beast (Yuh)

Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell
Tortuously, killin' my infidels effortlessly, want to impede
The P-O-P-E D-E-A-D, dead 'em, I do it professionally
Assassin's Creed, your majesty, the after is not happily
Her body in factories, my ugly life tragedy
I'm at yo' face, that's a Periscope, fuck a telescope
Careful my angel or higher hope, I desire rope, uh
I'm gonna live by my confidence, I'm gonna die by my arrogance
Heaven and hell is irrelevant, I be the black metal terrorist

Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell
Jackal in a jack mood
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
Everything that I see will be taboo
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
In a bad mood, but I'm back too
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
Everything that I see will be taboo
I'm raising hell-
(SEND THEM TO HELL)

I be the black metal terrorist
I be the black metal terrorist
Send 'em to hell66Embed
