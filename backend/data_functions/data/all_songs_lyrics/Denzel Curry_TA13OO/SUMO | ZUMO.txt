Tell me who the hottest motherfucker that you know
If it ain't me, you a puto
Curry get the flame, call a nigga Prince Zuko (Ah, yeah)
Swimming through the money like a flounder, hold up (Yeah)
I just want the knowledge and the power, hold up (Yeah)
Why these niggas lookin' at me sour? (Uh)
Chopper eat a nigga like Chowder (Yeah)
Rada-rada-rada-rada-rada (Okay)
Never gave a fuck about a dollar (Okay)
Mo' money mean more problems (Okay)
Pray for me to fall like Autumn (Uh)
'Cause I got it on my own with no help, mane (Uh)
Got a bag then invested in myself, mane (Uh)
Denny the new hope (Yeah)
Deliver new dope (Yeah)
Givin' out bricks like (Uh)

Money double up like a goddamn duo (Uh-uh)
I just want the Yen and the Euro
Fuck the game up and leave my kids like Juno (Uh-uh)
Money come around like a hoover (Yeah)
Making Freebandz in the Future (Yeah)
Pockets on a nigga look super
Bills on me blue, Sly Cooper (Uh, yeah)
Money on my mind just like a tumor
Spread my money out and then I call that bitch a rumor
Curry-the-killer is on the move, no Uber
People try to block a nigga shine like lunar (Yeah)
Eclipse, wanna take all my chips
Wanna pop off the clip like hummus he dip, uh
Acrobat, with the bag, I'ma flip, uh
Money float like a damn battleship, uh

Denny the new hope (Yeah)
Deliver new dope (Yeah)
Givin' out bricks like (Uh)
Shaq at the free throw (Free)
Anybody wanna B-E-T? (Uh)
Man y'all niggas can't see me (Uh)
