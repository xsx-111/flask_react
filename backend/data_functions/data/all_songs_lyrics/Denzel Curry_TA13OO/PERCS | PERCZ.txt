PERCS | PERCZ Lyrics
Okay! All y'all niggas fu' as fuck! (Yeah!)
I'm U-L-T and I don't fuck with you if you ain't us (What?!)
In me I trust, I turn these niggas into cosmic dust (Okay!)
I'm Loaded Lux with a loaded K, cock back I spray I bust (Yeah!)
That player shit, that Raider shit still running through my blood (Huh!)
These brand new niggas took my name
And drug it through the mud (What?!)
I get the hammer, I be the judge like Dredd (Yeah!)
Police judge my dreads (Yeah!)
Fuck your favorite artists (Yeah!), make sure they all dead (Yeah!)
Shang Tsung, my swag, broke it apart, ran wit' it (Huh!)
Weak shit, peep shit, stay dark, soul tinted (Huh!)
Fuck around and get your door dented, new flows invented (What?!)
Shoot shit, Cole Bennett, rap game, don't get it (Okay!)
With these dumbass niggas (Yeah!), and they don't say shit (Yeah!)
Sound like "Durr, durr, durr," (What?!) you like, "Oh, that's lit" (Okay!)
With yo' boof ass hits (Yeah!), "I'ma fuck yo' bitch (Yeah!)
I just popped two Xans," (Yeah!) Nigga, fuck that shit! (Okay!)

On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst, actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a hearse
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs (What?!), I barely fuck with the Earth (Yeah!)
On me, industry niggas the worst (What?!), actin' like they from the dirt (Okay!)
On me, I do not fuck with the percs (Yeah!), I barely fuck with the Earth (Yeah!)
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a- (Yeah!)
Yuh, yuh, yuh!
Maybe I should go to jail to get my name up (Yeah!)
Then get out and show you how to fuck the game up (Yeah!)
Keep my name out yo' mouth, keep yo' chain tucked (Ugh!)
Keep yo' dame cuffed, I could make her famous (Ugh!)
She's a plain slut that loves it in the anus (Ugh!)
I should rap about some lean and my diamond cuts (Yeah!)
Get suburban white kids that want to hang with us (Woo!)
It's your friendly neighborhood, I don't give a fuck! (Yeah!)
Get it straight, I innovate, you ad-libs on the 808
Don't need a tattoo on my face 'cause Denzel is a different race (Bitch!)
I don't even try to hate, I'm just sayin' what I ain't (Bitch!)
People sleeping on me hard and I'm the hardest in the paint
Eight years in the game and I never rode a wave (Nah!)
I may be overlooked, but I'm never underpaid (Nah!)
And when I win a Grammy I'ma take it back to Dade (Okay!)
You signing to a label where they treat you like a slave

On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst, actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs, I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth, tryna put me in a hearse
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs (What?!), I barely fuck with the Earth (Yeah!)
On me, industry niggas the worst (What?!), actin' like they from the dirt (Okay!)
On me, I do not fuck with the percs (Yeah!), I barely fuck with the Earth (Yeah!)
On Tree, all of them niggas I birth (Yeah!), tryna put me in a- (Yeah!)
Finish him Zel, finish him Zel
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate, that's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Finish him Zel, finish him Zel81Embed
