Love Like We Do LyricsLife is better than the days behind
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine
No aggravation that we can't get through
A situation for the lucky few
And everyday is just a litte more
Of time together to be happy for
I'm happy even when the times are rough
'cause any time with you is good enough
When we
Love like we do
I don't believe in hatred anymore
I hate to think of how I felt before
When anger overwhelms your very soul
It's hard to realize you'll ever know
Love like we doEmbed
