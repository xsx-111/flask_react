Little Miss S. Lyrics
Shooting up junk in the bathroom
Makin' it with punks on the floor
Livin' the scene out of her limosine
Little Miss S. in a mini dress
Living it up to die
In a blink of the public eye

Day-glo paint on an electric chair
Electric dye in her lover's hair
A pretty sight in the middle of the night
Made up for everyone to see
Swingin' on the branch of a broken family tree

You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without life

The village idiots in her bed
Never cared that her eyes were red
Never cared that her brain was dead
In the hours that her face was alive
It was a thing just to be by her side
You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without life
Hey, yeah, alright

You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without life
You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without
You got a lot of livin' to do without life
Hey, yeah, alright, okay

Alright
Alright, okay, okay
It's alrightEmbed
