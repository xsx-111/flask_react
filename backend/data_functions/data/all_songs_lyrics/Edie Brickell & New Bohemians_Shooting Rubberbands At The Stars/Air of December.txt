Air of December LyricsThursday afternoon you cast a shadow 'round my room
The breeze moved the curtains and lifted my perfume into the air
And danced with lazy curls in your hair
The sun was in the sky like pink champagne
And it glistened in your eyes all day
I remember you
Put a chill across my face
Like the air of December
I swear I remember it that way
I swear I remember it that way
I swear I remember it
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you?
You stood by the lake
I wanted to take you for granted
The grass was thin and high
The water mirrored tiny sparkles to the sky
I remember you
Put a chill across my face
Like the air of December
I swear I remember it that way
I swear I remember it that way
I swear I remember it
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you?
In the by-myself mornings the birds windchime
The treelimbs crackle and the sunshine climbs up the sky
Like pink champagne that glistened in your eyes all day
I remember you
Put a chill across my face
Like the air of December
I swear I remember it that way
I swear I remember it that way
I swear I remember it
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you?Embed
