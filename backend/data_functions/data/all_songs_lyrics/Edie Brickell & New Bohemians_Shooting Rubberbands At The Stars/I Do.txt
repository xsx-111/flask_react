I Do LyricsPeople pointing
Finger-painting the world
Leaving me the siloheutte of my life
And I'm filling in the negative space with positively everything
I do, I do
And it's all because of you
I do, I do
And it's all because of you
It's not emotion that I feel for you
It's not devotion that I want from you
I want someone to follow who doesn't LEAVE the way
I want someone to listen who won't repeat what I say
And I'm filling in the negative space with positively everything
I do, I do
And it's all because of you
I do, I do
And it's all because of youEmbed
