Now LyricsYour mouth is red-I'm picturing it in my head
I'm picturing you smile at me
I want you to be with me now
Your hair is brown-I'm picturing it hanging down
I'm picturing it falling round those big brown eyes
I wanna be with you now
You're much more than this-a spiritual bliss
No matter who I'm with I miss you
You magnetism breathes through the moonlit trees
It's in the quiet breeze that's circling me now
Your face is bright-I'm picturing it every night
I'm picturing you when I sleep
I can keep you with me that way
And your heart is mine-I think about you all the time
I can hear you say to me that you wanna be with me
Now
You're much more than this-a spiritual bliss
No matter who I'm with I miss you
Your magnetism breathes through the moonlit trees
It's in the quiet breeze that's circlin' me
