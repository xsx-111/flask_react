Beat the Time LyricsI notice me -- I notice you
I see a lot of things that neither of us do
I notice me -- I notice you too
And there are simple things that we don't even try
Anymore
There's a way out of this
Beat the time
And everytime I turn around
We got some clever way to put each other down
And everytime I turn away
I can't decide if I should go or should I stay
With you
There's a way outa this
Beat the time
We can't leave these problems behind
So close the door and open your mindEmbed
