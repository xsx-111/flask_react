Nothing Lyrics
Are you in a bad mood?
Don't you wanna talk about it?
Did I say somethin' rude?
You don't have to cry about it
Aren't you feelin' okay?
Would you like a little company?
Or did you have a bad day?
Are you mad at me? Well, let it show
Don't tell me nothing
Don't tell me nothing I don't wanna know

There's nothing I hate more then nothing
Nothing keeps me up at night
I toss and turn over nothing
Nothing could cause a great big fight

Hey what's the matter?
Hey what's the matter?
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you
Don't tell me nothing
Hey what's the matter?
Hey what's the matter?
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you
There's nothing I hate more then nothing
Nothing keeps me up at night
I toss and turn over nothing
Nothing could cause a great big fight

Hey talk to me
Hey talk to me
Are you feelin' blue? blue?
Hey talk to me
Are you feelin' blue? blue?
Hey talk to me
Don't tell me nothing
Don't tell me nothing I don't wanna knowEmbed
