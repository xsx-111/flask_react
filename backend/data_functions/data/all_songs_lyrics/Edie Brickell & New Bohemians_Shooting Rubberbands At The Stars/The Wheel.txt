The Wheel LyricsSomewhere there's somebody who looks just like you do
Acts just like you, too, feels the same way
Somewhere there's a person in a faraway place
With a different name and a face that looks like you
Do you think about who it might be?
Do you wonder where you are?
In a distant foreign country
Ridin' around in another car
Where the wheels keep on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way they go around
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
All your thoughts are in another head
Your dreams are sleepin' in a different bed
The force that moves you is a circular breath
Of life and death going round and round and round
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
Maybe you ride a different wave
Maybe you catch another ray of the sun
That I've just begun to feel
Back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and around again
Again
And again and again
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning and
Nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
Back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and around againEmbed
