Circle LyricsMe
I'm a part of your circle of friends
And we
Notice you don't come around
And me
I think it all depends
On you
Touching ground with us, but
I quit
I give up
Nothing's good enough for anybody else
It seems, and
I quit
I give up
Nothing's good enough for anybody else
It seems, and
And being alone is the
Is the best way to be
When I'm by myself
It's the best way to be
When I'm all alone
It's the best way to be
When I'm by myself
Nobody else can say goodbye
Everything is temporary anyway
When the streets are wet
The colors slip into the sky
But I don't know why
That means you and I are
That means you and I
I quit
I give up
Nothing's good enough for anybody else
It seems, and
I quit
I give up
Nothing's good enough for anybody else
It seems, and
And being alone is the
Is the best way to be
When I'm by myself
It's the best way to be
When I'm all alone
It's the best way to be
When I'm by myself
Nobody else can say
Me
I'm a part of your circle of friends
And we
Notice you don't come around
