Dead Now Lyrics
I'm not myself, I am
A broken boxer stuffed with glass and sand
This is not how health should feel
Songs sung from the lungs of the elderly

I'm dead now, check my chest and you'll see
The life has been mined from me, burned for the heat, oh
I'm dead now, can you hear the relief
As life's belligerent symphony's finally cease, oh

I put my heart where my mouth is
Now I can't thumb it down again
I've gone deviled my kidneys
Now he's living inside of me
If we can't bring an exorcist
I'll settle for one of your stiffest drinks
We'll scream hell towards heaven's door
And I'll piss on your front porch

I'm dead now, check my chest and you'll see
The life has been mined from me, burned for the heat, oh
I'm dead now, can you hear the relief
As life's belligerent symphony's finally cease, oh
We're all dead now. Join hands and we'll sing
To the glory of hell and the virtue of sin
O-ooh, oh, oh
O-ooh, oh, oh
O-ooh, oh, oh
O-ooh, oh, oh
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong with me


O-ooh, oh, oh
O-ooh, oh, oh
O-ooh, oh, oh
O-ooh, oh, oh
Aah, there's something wrong with me
And it reads nothing like poetry
So will you love me in spite of these tics and inconsistencies?
There is something wrong with me
Oh, there's something wrong with me
Oh, it reads nothing like poetry
Oh will you love me in spite of these tics and inconsistencies?
There is something wrong with me1Embed
