The Oil Slick Lyrics
I went looking for a song for you
Something soft and patient to reflect it's muse
I took a walk with all my brightest thoughts
But the weather soon turned and they all ran off
Took to the ocean in a boat this time
Only an idiot would swim through the shit I write
How can I talk of life and warmth?
I've got a voice like a gutter in a toxic storm

All the dark words pouring from my throat
Sound like an oil slick coating the wings we've grown
There goes a love song drifting out to sea
I'd sing along if I could hear over the oil slick

So it came to pass and I came home
With four worn out limbs and not one love song
How predictable this is all you've got
Yet another selfish signpost to my ruin of faults

All the dark words pouring from my throat
Sound like an oil slick coating the wings we've grown
There goes a love song drifting out to sea
I'd sing along if I could hear
Over the dark words pissing from my throat
Sounds like an oil slick coating the wings we've grown
There goes a love song drifting out of my reach
I'd sing along if I could see past the oil slick
The oil slick
The oil slick
The oil slick

There is light but there's a tunnel to crawl through
There is love but its misery loves you
There's still hope so I think we'll be fine
In these disastrous times, disastrous times
There is light but there's a tunnel to crawl through
There is love but its misery loves you
Still got hope, so I think we'll be fine
In these disastrous times, disastrous timesEmbed
