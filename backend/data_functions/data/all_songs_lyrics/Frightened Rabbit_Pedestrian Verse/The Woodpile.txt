The Woodpile Lyrics
Far from the electric floor
Removed from the red meat market
I look for a fire door
An escape from the drums and barking
Bereft of all social charms
Struck dumb by the hand of fear
I fall into the corner's arms
The same way that I've done for years

I'm trapped in a collapsing building
Come find me now, where I hide and
We'll speak in our secret tongues
So will you come back to my corner?
Spent too long alone tonight
Would you come brighten my corner?
A lit torch to the woodpile (aye)

Dead wood waits to ignite
There's no spark on a dampened floor
A snapped limb in an unlit pyre
Won't you come and break down this door?

I'm trapped in an abandoned building
Come find me now, where I hide and
We'll speak in our secret tongues
So will you come back to my corner?
Spent too long alone tonight
Would you come brighten my corner?
A lit torch to the woodpile (aye)

Will you come back to my corner?
Spent too long alone tonight
Would you come brighten my corner?
A lit torch to the woodpile (aye)
Will you come back to my corner?
Spent too long alone tonight
Would you come brighten my corner?
A lit torch to the woodpile
Come find me now, where I hide and
We'll speak in our secret tonguesEmbed
