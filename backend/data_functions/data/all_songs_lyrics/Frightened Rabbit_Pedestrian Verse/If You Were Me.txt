If You Were Me LyricsTime passes, I accept the blame
And I accept that you might never care to see me again
At least I can shake off some shame
Still I quiver like a dying leaf in a violent wind
Don’t wish to be excused for this
My disguise and my excuses, they have worn so thin
But may I ask, and answer honestly
Oh, what would you have done if you were me?
How could it go so wrong so quickly?
Oh, what would you do if you were me?
Don’t assume that I have found this easy
Oh, how would you feel if you were me?
Time passes, kills everything in its path
And then it buries us in history
Some bits, some bits seem to stick
Oh, I thought that you and I could be a timeless thing
I have to ask, please answer honestly
Oh, what would you have done if you were me?
How could it go so wrong so quickly?
Oh, what would you do if you were me?
Don’t assume that I have found this easy
How would you feel if you were me?Embed
