Late March, Death March Lyrics
I cursed in church again and the handclaps all fell quiet
I watched a statue of you cry
A candle is blown, so we start the black march home
Through a stale and silent night

There's a funeral in your eyes and a drunk priest at your side
Staggering sermons never wash
There's no reproach from a lit touch paper, both
Got stubborn marrow in bastard bones
Should we just get home, sleep this off?
Throw some 'sorry's and then do it all again?

Well, folded arms clutch homicide
Bridge is out and the riverâ€™s high
This is a March death march
March, death march
There isn't a God so I save my breath
Pray silence for the road ahead
In this March death march
March, death march
Yeah, I went too far
As we walk through an hour long pregnant pause
No grain of truce can be born
My bridge is burned and perhaps we'll shortly learn
It was arson all along
Could we just get home, sleep this off?
Throw some 'sorry's and then do it all again?
Well, like Bulver said, less heart and more head
So un-furrow that brow, un-plant those seeds of doubt

Oh, folded arms clutch homicide
Bridge is out and the river's high
In this March death march
March, death march
There isn't a God so I save my breath
Pray silence for the road ahead
In this March death march
March, death march

Dead balloons and withered flowers
'Sorry' cannot save me now
In this March death march
March, death march
Think I went too far
(March, death march)
(March, death march)
Oh, I went too far
(March, death march)
(March, death march)
I went too far
I went too far
I went too far
I went too far
I went too far
I went too far
(March, death march)
(March, death march)
I went too far1Embed
