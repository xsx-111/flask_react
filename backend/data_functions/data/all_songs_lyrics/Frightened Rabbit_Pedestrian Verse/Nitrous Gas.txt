Nitrous Gas Lyrics
Shut down the gospel singers
And turn up the old heart-breakers
I'm dying to tell you that I'm dying here
Throw up the sickly joy and I'll
Swallow the sweet self-loathing
I'm just dying to be unhappy again

Oh, where love won't grow
Oh, I will build my home

And if happiness won't come to me
Hand me the nitrous gas

Leave the acute warm-heartedness
Go where the joyless bastard lives
He's dying to bring you down with him
Suck in the bright red major key
Spit out the blue minor misery
I'm dying to bring you down with me

Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, o-o-oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh
But if happiness won't come to me
Hand me the nitrous gas
You can keep all of your oxygen
Hand me the nitrous gas
And if happiness won't live with me
Think I can live with that
You can keep all of your oxygen
Hand me the nitrous gasEmbed
