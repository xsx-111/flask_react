Housing (In) Lyrics
Hear the dull drum roll
Of the Great North Eastern line's
Coupled carriage ticking like
My metronome
I see the housing glow
A skyline of cheap gold
And crooked teeth I will call home
For a day or so

You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me away now
I have just laid my head down
You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me, don't steal me from my house

Inside that housing glow
I stiffen my tired shoes
With the starch of family food
Oh, I've missed you so
You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me away now
I have just laid my head down
You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me, don't steal me from my houseEmbed
