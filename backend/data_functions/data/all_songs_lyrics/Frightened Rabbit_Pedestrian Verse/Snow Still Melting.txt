Snow Still Melting Lyrics
We are ruled by a governing frost
It melts beneath alcohol briefly and then bites back
Breathe on panes of glass
A circle appears before freezing again, aha
And it's taking it's time
Decree by reluctant
Decree in night by night
So slow mountain, and doesn't it take it's time?
We are ruled by a governing frost
It's as thin as a wedding veil
Too heavy to lift for a kiss
And a kiss brings warmth
But not nearly enough to finish the thaw
Call spring from 6 months in clothes
This calls for bold, naked honesty
Petrol, a match, and a torch
This snow is still melting and doesn't it take it's time?
To lost almost all feeling, jesus, didn't that take awhile?
Ohh, ohhh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Well, the snow may have melted but it covered all kinds of dirt
Can take one brush east, start sweeping and we'll clear this up
All the snow may have melted, but it covered all kinds of hurt
If we take one brush east, start sweeping and we'll clear this up
Clear this upEmbed
