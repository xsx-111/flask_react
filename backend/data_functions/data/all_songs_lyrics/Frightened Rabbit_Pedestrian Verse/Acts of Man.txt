Acts of Man Lyrics
I am that dickhead in the kitchen
Giving wine to your best girl's glass
I am the amateur pornographer
Unpleasant publisher by hand

Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man
Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man

I see the stumbling pinstriped trouser
Flecks of sick on an office shoe
Part of the fatty British average
Who lives in the houses around you

Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man
Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man

Let's all crowd 'round the cowering body
Throw stocky fingers, bricks and stones
Let's promise every girl we marry
We'll always love them when we probably won't
While the knight in shitty armour
Rips the drunk out of her dress
One man tears into another
Hides a coward's heart in a lion's chest

Man, he breeds although he shouldn't
He's breeding just because he cums
Acts the father for a minute
Till the worst instincts return

Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man
Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man

I have never wanted more, to be your man
And build a house around you
But I am just like all the rest of them
Sorry, selfish, trying to improve

I'm here, I'm here
Not heroic but I try
I'm here, I'm here
Not heroic but I try2Embed
