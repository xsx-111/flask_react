Backyard Skulls Lyrics
All our secrets are smothered in dirt
Underneath paving stones, lying waiting to be told
Some stay hidden, whilst some get found
Like a long lost soul, like a skull beneath the ground

Backyard skulls, deep beneath the ground
All those backyard skulls, not deep enough to never be found

Here lies the first time that I was wrong
And there is no more sign, no X's mark this spot
The ancient encounters with foreign skin
All but perished by now, but you can't erase the grin

From those backyard skulls, deep beneath the ground
All those backyard skulls, not deep enough to never be found

Through patio doors, lies century upon century
Of skulls untold, as hushed as suburban adultery
And below our homes, and underneath the lawns we keep
White silent skulls are smiling at the hypocrisy
Backyard skulls, deep beneath the ground
All those backyard skulls, not deep enough to never be found
Backyard skulls, deep beneath the ground
All those backyard skulls, not deep enough to never be found
Deep enough to never be found
Deep enough to never be foundEmbed
