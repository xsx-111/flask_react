Housing (Out) Lyrics
I've been taken again
Kidnapped before dawn
Stolen them by these songs, oh, damn them all
Beyond the housing glow
Looking back will lose its points
So step forward into the void, the endless road

You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me away now
I have just laid my head down
You can't carry me away now
Please don't steal me from my house
You can't carry me away now
I have just laid my head downEmbed
