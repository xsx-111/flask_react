Holy Lyrics
Well, you read to me from the riot act
Way on high, high
Clutching a crisp new testament
Breathing fire, fire
Will you save me the fake benevolence
I don't have time, I
I'm just too far gone for a telling
I've lost my pride

I don’t mind being lonely
So leave me alone
Oh, you're acting all holy
Me, I’m just full of holes

Well, I could dip my head in the river
Cleanse my soul, oh
I'll still have the stomach of a sinner
Face like an unholy ghost
Will you save me all the soliloquies
Paid my fines
I'll be gone before my deliverance
Preach what you like
'Cause I don't mind being lonely
So leave me alone
You're acting all holy
Me, I'm just full of holes, full of holes


Don't mind being lonely
Spare me the brimstone
Acting all holy
When you know I'm full of holes
Don't mind being lonely
Don't need to be told
Stop acting so holy
I know I'm full of holes, full of holes

Ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah

I don't mind being lonely
Won't you leave me alone
Oh, you're oh so holy
And I'll never be good enough
Don’t care if I'm lonely
Cause it feels like home
I'll never be holy
Thank God I'm full of holes, full of holesEmbed
