Days Gone By LyricsWe have just begun
We should feel the part of us that we're leaving
Back home
We have just begun
On the deed that's done to us
All the favours
To be grown
Waiting in a line
Not thinking of the time
We must go out and find
Whatever did we leave behind?
Soon we shall look back
On the past experience I'll remember
That dream
Soon we shall look back
One by one we're finding out all the answers
About home
Waiting on a melon (?)
What fun we had
Wiping your brow again
Clock keeps twenty past ten
And we're thinking of time going
Wait till tomorrow
Think of today
Think of the days gone by
Bye-bye is too late
Cry, cry is heartache
Bye-bye, the days gone by
In the end we'll see
How much of the party we've missed already
Please tell me
In the end we'll see
Hoping for another chance to hold onto
Forever
Waiting in a line
Not thinking of the time
You must go out and find
Whatever did we leave behind?
And we're thinking of time
Going by
And we're thinking of time
Going byEmbed
