Dreams LyricsTaking the time for dreams
Off to waste the day
Plungin' headlong, yeah
Nothing is what it seems
Only just a word that was said wrong
Takin' the time for dreams
Feelin' lazy
And you know there ain't as many
As there was a while ago
I said there isn't any
Goin' down slow
Start to feel the load
When they don't care, no
Worry your days away
What's the hurry when you're
Travellin' down a road goin' nowhere
Travellin' down the road
'Cause the woman drives me crazy
And she can't be bought with money
Yes, and she's easy on my mind
She thinks my jokes are funny
Makes me feel fine
Yes she does now
Keeps me in line
Just because now
She makes me feel fine
(Woah)
Well if you can
Try to teach them things
That they don't know, yeah
Give 'em a helpin' hand
Make them see the things there that don't show
Give 'em a helpin' hand
'Cause we're wastin' time
And no matter what they say now
Well we don't have very long
Just a dream away
You can come along
Alright
Alright now
She makes me feel fine
(Woah)Embed
