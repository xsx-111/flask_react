Book Ends LyricsI've got a driver, you've got a car
Maybe we could go out for a ride
Pass by the schoolyard and take a look around
Stop and get a bite if your crowd
I can remember all the good times
Put 'em in a book of memories
Hoping that our book will never ruin
Hoping that our book will never end
You picked a flower some time ago
Put it on my desk at school that day
Thought I would write you a small love poem
Though I got it from a book, you see
I can remember all the good times
Put 'em in a book of memories
Hoping that our book will never ruin
Hoping that our book will never endEmbed
