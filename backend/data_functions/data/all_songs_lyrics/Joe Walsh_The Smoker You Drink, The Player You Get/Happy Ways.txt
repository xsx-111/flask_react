Happy Ways LyricsLooking at the good things
All around me
Smiling at the people
That won't believe
My happy ways may raise a question
There is no answer, except in my dreams
There is no way to capture the sunshine
But it is foolish to fill from the night
Perfection, they say, will not last forever
But I can't help feeling someday it might
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
Then something happens, it seems to go
Bad
Cancel the feeling, and look to the sky
No need to worry about consequences
Give it a giggle, instead of a sigh
Yeah, oh yeah
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-laEmbed
