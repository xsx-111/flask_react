Meadows Lyrics(Screaming Introduction)
Can't think of any reason
Don't know exactly why
Must be it's out of season
Give it another try
I'm out here in the meadow
Part of an old stone wall
Stand here because you said so
Waitin' around to fall, yeah
Some things are left unspoken
Some things are handed down
The circle stands unbroken
Sending it back around
I've seen you roll in clover
Dressed for a scarecrow ball
Too bad the dance is over
Nothing to show at all
Can't help but feel uncertain
Knowing which way to turn
They want to raise the curtain
And you're holding the words to learn
I'm out here in the meadow
Part of an old stone wall
Stand here because you said so
Waitin' around to fall1Embed
