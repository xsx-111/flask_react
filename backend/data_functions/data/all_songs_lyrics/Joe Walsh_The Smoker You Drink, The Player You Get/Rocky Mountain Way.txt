Rocky Mountain Way Lyrics
Spent the last year Rocky Mountain way
Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture, I think it's safe to say
Time to open fire

And we don't need the ladies crying ’cause the story's sad
‘Cause the Rocky Mountain way is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Rocky mountain way, ooh

Well he's telling us this, he's telling us that, changing it everyday
Say's it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded and Casey's at bat, playing it play by play
It's time to change the batter

And we don't need the ladies crying ’cause the story's sad, uh huh
‘Cause the Rocky Mountain way is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Rocky mountain way, ooh

And we don't need the ladies crying ’cause the story's sad, oh yeah
‘Cause the Rocky Mountain way is better than the way we had
It's better than the way we had
So much better
So much better
It's so much better
It's so much better
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Rocky Mountain way, ooooh5Embed
