Lady Jay LyricsHear me when I cry
Listen to my song
Jay, my lovely lady
To the earth she did belong
I, a country Sir
Loved her for my life
But the manor lady's bright young son
Did take her for his wife
Under forest branches
She came to me
Until the day she cried aloud
A father I should be
That was the last time that we met
I never saw her again
For she took her life on Princetown Moor
To save my worthy name
She found Death's open arms
And lay in their embrace
I watched as icy fingers
Clawed her lovely face
Now I stumble through the mist
To where they laid her in her grave
And daily I'll remember
Flowers for my Jay
Far beyond this land
I will take your hand
The spirit of our love will live forever
Far beyond the clouds
We will laugh aloud
The spirit of our love will live againEmbed
