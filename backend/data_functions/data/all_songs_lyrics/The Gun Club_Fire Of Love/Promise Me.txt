Promise Me LyricsPromise me
I'm silent in the trees, waiting tonight
Promise me
While the searching light moon has found me
You know it feels like the very last time again
Promise me
Someone who will promise me, stand in the dark and fight like me
Through eyes like fireflies
Turn around and tell me, it'll be alright
Is it alright?
Promise me
Don't cheat my soul when it returns to me
Promise me
Give me the vision I was born to see
You know it feels like years since they burned me away
You know it feels like years since they burned my heart away
You know it feels like years, feels like years
You know it feels like years since they took my eyes awayEmbed
