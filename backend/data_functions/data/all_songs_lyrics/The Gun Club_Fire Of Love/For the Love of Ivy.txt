For the Love of Ivy LyricsYou look just like an Elvis from HELL
My heart is broken, so I'm going to HELL
Bury me way down deep in HELL
I'm a steel drivin' man, I want to go to HELL!
Then go tell Ivy oh-oh!
For the love of Ivy yeah-yeah!
I did it for Ivy oh-oh!
You're the one
Gonna buy me a graveyard of my own
Kill everyone who ever done me wrong
Gonna buy me a gun just as long as my arm
Kill everyone who ever done me harm
Then go tell Ivy oh-oh!
For the love of Ivy yeah-heah!
I did it for Ivy oh-oh!
You're the one
Well, jawbone eat and jawbone talk
Jawbone eat you with a knife and fork
I was hunting for niggers down in the dark
When all of a sudden I had a better thought
Let's go hunt Ivy, oh-oh!
Let's go get Ivy, Yeah-yeah!
For the love of Ivy, oh-oh!
You're the one
I did it for Ivy
I did it for Ivy
HA HA HA! Ivy!
I was all dressed up like Elvis from HELL! HELL!Embed
