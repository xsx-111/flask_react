Cool Drink of Water LyricsI ask for water, and she gave me gasoline
I ask for water, give me gasoline
I ask for water and she gave me gasoline
Lord, Lordy Lord
Cryin', Lord, I wonder, will I ever get back home?
Cryin', Lord, I wonder, I ever get back home?
Lord, Lordy Lord
I went to the depot, looked up on the board
I asked the conductor how long has this Eastbound train been gone?
I asked the conductor could I ride the blinds?
Son, buy your ticket, for that train ain't none of mine
Son, buy your ticket, train ain't none of mine
Lord, Lordy LordEmbed
