Black Train LyricsI'm moving on the black train
The night it beats me down
I'm moving on the Black Train
I breath a soundles sound
Riding on the Black Train
Every drop in my body moves with the train
And some of it's on the floor
I'm slippin' out to anyplace
Although I know I've been there before
Riding on the Black Train
Torn up on the Black Train
Torn from my southern home
Left a nigga lying dead by the river
Left the Will-O-the-Wisp to roam
Riding on the Black Train
I'm heat on the Black Train
A torch lighting up the night
With everything I've had and everything I've done
I still can't be satisfied
Riding on the Black TrainEmbed
