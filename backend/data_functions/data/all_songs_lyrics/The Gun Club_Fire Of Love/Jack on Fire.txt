Jack on Fire LyricsI am like Jack, I am from southern land
I'm holding your happiness in my hand
The sun behind me is a sexual red
And all your bounty-hunting ghosts are dead
I am like Jack and I tell you this
I will be your lover and exorcist
In the stillness of the mosquito sunset
You will make love to me to your very best
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
Way back in the Indian days
Nothing could drive the heat away
Drive the search and murder of lost enemies
Drive deep into what is never seen
And like Jack, there is a heat to the fight
Like a moth detects a heat to the light
And like Jack, I covet everything that is you
Because, the heat in you will temporarily do
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
In New Orleans at the Mardi Gras
I was dancing in a costume made of straw
Some Creole boy was a-lying dead
I used his blood to paint my costume red
A-black and white, I will abandon brain
For your nerves in hand and a ball of string
The marshes are sinking in a bright red sky
And you will make love to me tonight
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
And when you fall in love with me
We can dig a hole by the willow tree
Then, I will fuck you until you die
Bury you and kiss this town goodbye
It will be unhappy, it will be sad
But, it will be understood that I am BAD!
So don't you go and lie to me
'Cause everyday is judgement day with me
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
You sleep with Jack On Fire
You eat me Jack On Fire
You think like Jack On Fire
Oh no, you are nothing
Oh no, you are a-nothing
You will eat like a Jack On Fire
You will dream like a Jack On Fire
You will think like a Jack On Fire
You will feel like a Jack On Fire
Oh no, you drive so deep
Drive so deep...Embed
