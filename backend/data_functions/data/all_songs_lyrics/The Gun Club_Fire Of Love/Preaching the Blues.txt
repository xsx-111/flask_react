Preaching the Blues LyricsI was up this morning, blues walking like a man
I was up this morning, blues walking like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand
And the blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Travel on ol' Jeffrey Lee, ya know, can't seem to turn him around
So, Preach the Blues
Preach the Blues now
Blues, is low down shaking chill
Blues, is low down shaking chill
You ain't never had them, I don't believe you will
Blues is an achin' old heart disease
Blues is an achin' old heart disease
It's like consumption, baby, killing me by degrees
So, Preach the Blues
Preach the Blues now
I had religion, Lord on this very day
I had religion, Lord on this very day
But, the women and the whiskey, they would not let me pray
Gonna get me religion, gonna join the Baptist church
Gonna get me religion, gonna join the Baptist church
Gonna be a Baptist preacher, so I don't have to workEmbed
