Let Me Drown Lyrics
Stretch the bones over my skin
Stretch the skin over my hand
I'm going to the holy land
Stretch the marks over my eyes
Burn the candles deep inside
Yeah, you know where I'm coming from

So give up to greed, you don't have to feed me, yeah
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, won't you let it go, won't you let it go
Won't you let it, drown me in you, yeah?

So slip down the darkness to the mouth
Damn the water, burn the wine
I'm going home for the very last time

So throw it away, you don't have to take me, yeah
Make no mistake, I am what you make me
So let it go, won't you let it go, won't you let it go
Won't you let it, drown me in you?
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in...
Drown me in...
Oh, drown me in...
Yeah, drown me in...
Yeah
I see you turn around and burning down
The feeling starts to sink
I feel the hurt surround me
Please dissolve me
She's resolved to be

So, heal my wound without a trace
And seal my tomb without my face
I'm going to the lonely place

So give up to greed, you don't have to feed me, yeah
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, won't you let it go, won't you let it go
Won't you let it, drown me in you?
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in you
Drown me in...7Embed
