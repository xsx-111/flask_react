The Day I Tried to Live Lyrics
I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said, "Seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade and watch the rolling heads"

The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggars' change
And gave it to the rich
The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch

Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around I might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah

Words you say
Never seem to live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make
Never seem to ever get us anywhere but dead
The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs

Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around I might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah
I tried

I woke the same as any other day
You know why I should have stayed in bed

The day I tried to win
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs
And I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around I might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah

Just like you
Just like you
One more time around
One more time around11Embed
