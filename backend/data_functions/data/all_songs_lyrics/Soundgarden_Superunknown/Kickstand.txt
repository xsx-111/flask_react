Kickstand Lyrics
Kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Yeah, kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
My mother says that it's alright
My mother says that's the only life

So do it right
Do it right
Come stand me up
Come stand me up
Come stand me up

Oh, kickstand, I got a saddle made of leather
Oh, kickstand, I got the words to come together
I got the urge to ride your trike, yeah
My mother says that's the only life

So do it right
Do it right
Come stand me up
Come stand me up
Come stand me up
Oh, kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Yeah, kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup
My mother says that it's alright
Do it right
Do it right
Stand me up
Stand me up
Stand me up2Embed
