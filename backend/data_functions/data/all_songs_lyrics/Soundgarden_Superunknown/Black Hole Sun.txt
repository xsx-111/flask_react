Black Hole Sun Lyrics
In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
Sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun

Hang my head, drown my fear
'Til you all just disappear

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?68Embed
