4th of July Lyrics
Shower in the dark day, clean sparks diving down
Cool in the waterway where the baptized drown
Naked in the cold sun,  breathing life like fire
Thought I was the only one but that was just a lie

'Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July

Pale in the flare light, the scared light cracks and disappears
And leads the scorched ones here
And everywhere no one cares, the fire is spreading
And no one wants to speak about it

Down in the hole
Jesus tries to crack a smile
Beneath another shovel load

And I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
July
July
Yeah, oh

Now I'm in control, now I'm in the fall out
Once asleep but now I stand
And I still remember your sweet everything
Light a Roman candle and hold it in your hand

'Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
