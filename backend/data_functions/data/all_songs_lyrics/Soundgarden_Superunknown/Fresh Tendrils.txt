Fresh Tendrils Lyrics
Long time coming
Seemed to get me through
Long time coming
Many serve the few
Long to taste the shame
That bows down before you

Long time coming
It seemed to get me by
Long time coming
It seemed to satisfy
You longed to taste the shame
That everybody tries

Shame shame
Throw yourself away
Give me little bits of
More than I can take
If it sits upon your tongue
Or naked in your eyes
Give me little bits of
More than I can try
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away

Long time coming
It seemed to get me through
Long time coming
Many served the few
And long to taste the shame
That bows down before you
Yeah

Shame shame
Throw yourself away
Give me little bits of
More than I can take
If it sits upon your tongue
Or naked in your eye
Give me little bits of
More than I can try
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Throw yourself away
Long time coming
Long time comingEmbed
