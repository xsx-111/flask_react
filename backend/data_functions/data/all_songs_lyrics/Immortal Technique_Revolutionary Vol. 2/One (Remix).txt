One (Remix) Lyrics
Yo, Tech, it's the last call, baby, what's good?
Yeah, you know, a remix just feels right, don't it?
Before we get outta here you gotta drop one last gem on 'em though fam
No question, it's like the elders told me
No one person can do everything (Uh-huh)
But everyone can do something
So we gotta rep for all the niggas that ain't here right now
On the outro tip, the One Remix

Yo, One Enterprises comprises the artist and the sound
The pen and paper plays my savior while I'm gettin' down
Pray for my neighbors as a favor for holdin' me down
Slave for my papers as I savor the way that it pounds
It's underground, but the blatant vibrations widely found
Facin' the nation, complacent radio stations now
Stop hesitatin' and contemplatin' the way we patient
Start motivatin' and get them playin' the shit we sayin'
Ain't no delayin' in this war that we gettin' slayed in
'Cause time's a-wastin' while we stand adjacent to abrasions
Their fouls are more than flagrant
And so I see the prisons' cages while I pound the pavement
Lookin' for payment, sayin', "Fuck enslavement!"
Usin' the tools of old ancients
Announcin' my engagment to this music that we makin'
Ain't no fakin' on tracks, and we ain't never come wack (Never)
Immortal Technique and Akir, y'all niggas fear it's a wrap
It's likeâ€¦
One love, one music
One people, one movement
One heart, one spark
One, One, One, One
One gift, one lift
One stance, one shift
One way, one day
One, One, One, One, One

Immortal Technique in the trenches with my nigga Akir
Our family surived the genocides so we could be here
And now we enterprise the aftermath, one in the same
Livin' the revolution 'til we catch one in the brain
And even then my spirit'll return in heavenly form
And wipe the chessboard clean of my enemy's pawns
The Red Dawn Communist threat, buried and gone
So they invented a war the government can carry on
It makes me wonder if the word of God is lost in the man
This is for the children of Iraq lost in the sand
This is for the illest emcees that'll never be known
And this is for all the soliders that'll never come home
I wrote this for Mumia, stuck in the beast
The people who march in the streets and struggle for peace
For hood niggas, born rugged, never rockin' Versace
Eddie Ramierez' cousin George, and my old friend Sashi
Chris from the block and all my niggas stuck in a cell
Paul Wolfowitz, motherfucker, I'll see you in Hell
My destiny's to show the world that the music is real
Go back in time and play this shit for the slaves in the field
And for my children in the future that are waitin' to breathe
People slowly dyin' hangin' on, waitin' to leave
Believe when I'm gone and this album's on a library shelf
I'll be one with God and one with you and everything else
One love, one music
One people, one movement
One heart, one spark
One, One, One, One
One gift, one lift
One stance, one shift
One way, one day
One, One, One, One, One

Yeah, Revolutionary Vol. 2 has been brought to you
By the type of motherfuckers who ain't scared of shit
And if you playin' this album, and I'm no longer here
Sometime far away from when I recorded this
Remember that history
Isn't the way the corporate-controlled media made it look like
Read between the lines and free your mind
Revolution is the birth of equality
And the antithesis to oppression
But this is only built for real motherfuckers
So when I'm gone, don't let nobody I never got along with try to make songs kissin' my ass, recyclin' my beats or my vocals
The shit is real over here, man, thank you for listenin'
And thank you for supportin' independent hip hop
The heart and soul of our culture
Keepin' the truth alive, goodnight, my people, goodnight2Embed
