Slender Frame LyricsYour coat is hanging loosely
On your slender frame
There's many roads to leave by
But few come back again
I don't believe it
I believe it
Take a look around and see
What's stopping you is stopping me
One moonless night, we'll make it right
And vanish in the dark of night
Pack up your things and go
Run down the road, don't take it slow
Pack up your things today
And run away, yeah, run away
You say it's useless crying
That never got you far
You'd claim there's none as lonely
Lonely as you are
I don't believe it
I believe it
Take a look around and see
What's breaking you is breaking me
One moonless night, we'll make it right
And vanish in the dark of night
Pack up your things and go
Run down the road, they'll never know
Wrap up your things today
And run away, yeah, run away
One moonless night
And vanish in the dark of night
Pack up your things and go
Run down the road, don't take it slow
Pack up your things today
And run away, yeah, run away
Pack up your things and go
Run down the road, they'll never know
Wrap up your things today
And run away, yeah, run awayEmbed
