I Call Your Name LyricsWe got married on a cold
Mid-winter's morning
We said our lines then kissed
And it was over
Those pronouncements had such weight
I guess they made us hesitate, hesitate
When she moved her hips
And swayed in my direction
I thought we could make it yet
And beat the isolation
But in that gentle dark
Man, we tore ourselves apart
Through the fire and rain
Through the wilderness and pain
Through the losses, through the gains
On love's roller coaster train
I call your name
I call your name
Through the fire and rain
Through the wilderness and pain
Through the losses, through the gains
On love's roller coaster train
I call your name
We used to laugh
Is the fire dying, babe, it hurts to ask
Let me hold you for a while
Through the fire and rain
On love's roller coaster train
I call your name
I call your nameEmbed
