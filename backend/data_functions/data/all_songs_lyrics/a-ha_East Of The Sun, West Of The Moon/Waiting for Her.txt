Waiting for Her LyricsWaiting for her
That's all I ever do
Waiting for her
So why didn't I
Take the measures justified
Our love has always been the same
She comes then goes away again
Oh yeah
She used to say
We never had the breaks we should've had
Coming our way
But why didn't I
Take the time and put it right
Our love has always been the same
She leaves me standing out in the rain
Oh yeah
Send her my love
She's all I'm thinking of
Oh yeah
I'm telling you
We never had the breaks we should've had
Coming our way
And when she's sleeping by my side
Eyes closed, all knowledge trapped inside
Oh yeah
So why didn't I
Take the measures justified
Send her my love
She's all I'm thinking of
Oh yeah
I'm telling youEmbed
