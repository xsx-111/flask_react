East of the Sun LyricsHalf of a letter
Tells half a story
The way I see it
It's half the worry
Where I came from
I forgot too soon
East of the sun
And west of the moon
Money talks
And, hey, I'm listening
I've lived without it
Enough to miss it
Where I'm going
I'll get there soon
East of the sun
And west of the moon
Oh, never going to get there later
You know I want to get there soon
Never going to get there, baby
On a desert road to home
East of the sun and west of the moon
Another day leaves me aching
I try to wake up but something's breaking
Here inside me
Deep and hollow
A sound that no other
Sound could follow
I know the pain
Before the wound
East of the sun
And west of the moon
Oh, never going to get there later
You know I want to get there soon
Never going to get there, baby
On a desert road to home
Oh, never going to get there later
You know I want to get there soon
Never going to get there, baby
On a desert road to home
On a desert road to home
East of the sun and west of the moon
East of the sun and west of the moon
On a desert road to homeEmbed
