Early Morning LyricsEarly morning
Eight o'clock precise
I see the lonely
August sun arise
Say you know you will
Move me like you do
Out in the fields
I'm waiting the whole night through
Early morning
Early morning, yeah
Ran the whole way
Down to the tracks
Through the doorway
Then a last look back
Say you know you will
Save me like you do
Out in the fields
I'm waiting the whole night through
Early morning
Early morning, yeah
Out in the fields
I climbed all the stairways
To find the rooftop clear
Got the shotgun
Lying with me here
Say you know you will
Move me like you do
Out in the fields
I know how it feels, yeah
Early morning
Early morning, yeah
Out in the fields
Early morning
