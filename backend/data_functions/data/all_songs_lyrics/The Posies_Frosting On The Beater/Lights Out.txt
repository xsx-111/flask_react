Lights Out LyricsLights out
Lights out
Goodnight, shuteye
That's a good guy
Soothing seething, brooding
Are you breathing?
Are you sleeping?
Are you sleeping?
New day
New day
Endless chasm barking blue grey
Are we living in a tombstone smiling?
Driving
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Trickle
Trickle
Father fickle loves to tickle
Sister caffeine fill my inside churning
Turning
Talking
Tripping through the traffic blocking
I'm collapsing, won't you turn the lights out?
Lights out
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Lights outEmbed
