How She Lied By Living Lyrics
Shimmering was she
And loveliness to see
They found her when she was three
Where she lied
We talked within a wave
Of things we could not crave
But circumstance turned grave
That's where she lied

You told me
You told me you loved life
Don't tell me
Don't tell me you loved life
Don't tell me you loved life

I read your book of Rot
And wondered what you thought
As journalists have taught
It pays to lie
The fruit upon a vine
The gun that swallows time
To shimmer in our minds
That's how she lied
You told me
You told me you loved life
Don't tell me
Don't tell me you loved life
Don't tell me
Don't tell me you loved lifeEmbed
