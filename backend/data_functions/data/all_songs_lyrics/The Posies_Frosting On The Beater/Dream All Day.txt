Dream All Day LyricsI've got a lot of thoughts
Got a lot of plans
I lost a lot of sleep
Trying to understand
I could dream all day
In a blackened room
Staring into space
Underneath a thousand blankets
Just to find a place
Where everything is reachable
Imagining is safe
I tried to make it so
I didn't even know
I could dream all day
I dreamt I was awake
My mouth was colored grey
As the world revolved around me
I could only say
I could dream all dayEmbed
