Burn And Shine LyricsBurn and shine, son
And keep your spirit clean
For this is not a dress rehersal
Junior Phoenix
With your ash-filled eyes
Who will harbor your misfortune
Your mother says, your father says
He does not want to tell you
As if he didn't know you
Behind the lighthouse
There's still the hole you made
Better fill it in or it will get you
So talcum powder
Is now your closest friend
Smooth and white and ordinary
Your father says, your mother says
She does not want to tell you
As if she didn't know you
And in the dream everyone is holding hands
In a circle and you heal
Do you remember
The taste of pemmican
Then say hello to Hiawatha
And she's still frowning
At your puffy face
Overweight and barely breathing
No one ever said a word
They did not want to tell you
As if they didn't know you
As if they didn't know you
As if they didn't know you
Burn and shine
You burn and shine ...Embed
