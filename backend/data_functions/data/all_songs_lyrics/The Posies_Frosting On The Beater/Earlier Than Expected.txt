Earlier Than Expected Lyrics
Sacred pictures
With which she will fortell the future
Expert witness
A wound that won't believe in sutures

She's earlier than expected
A little premature madonna
Earlier than expected
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Rush right home now
Prepare, prevent, defend, define now
With no examples
You'll find the burdens more than ample

'Cause she's earlier than expected
A little premature madonna
Earlier than expected
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
And if you saw her trials
Would you consider her guilty
Of being a child?

Open mouth-faced
She saw Ulysses, claimed him captive
The vanquished embraced
He knew for this to be receptive
And he must have grace and be festive
Or freeze in the dirt which he rests in

She's earlier than expected
A little premature madonna
Earlier than expected
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

She's earlier than expected
A little premature madonna
Earlier than expected
And she will sleep and rest her brow
And face the tempest of tomorrowEmbed
