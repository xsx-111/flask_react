Coming Right Along Lyrics
Feed the daytime with indifference
Watch the twilight starve the sun
Shuffle home against the darkness
Turn the key and bite your tongue

And please be strong
You don't know it, but you're coming right along

Call belated, leave a message
Wait for hours just to talk
Feel like slowly getting blown off
Stretch your eyes, invite the clock

And please be strong
You don't know it, but you're coming right along
Please be strong
You don't know it, but you're coming right along

Cry as if to say you're sorry
Sight a life and hate your own
Try to think of what to mention
Leave the television on
And please be strong
You don't know it, but you're coming right along
Please be strong
You don't know it, but you're coming right along
Coming right along, coming right along1Embed
