Flavor of the Month LyricsCan you hear it?-like an invitation
Can you feel it?-it's a revelation
The flavor of the month is busy melting in your mouth
Getting easier to swallow and harder to spit out
Can you hear it?-does the sound remind you?
Can you feel it?-it's gonna redefine you
The flavor of the month is busy melting in your mouth
Getting easier to swallow and harder to spit out
Can you hear it?-like an invitation
Can you feel it?-a reverberation
The flavor of the month is busy melting in your mouth
Getting easier to swallow and harder to spit outEmbed
