Love Letter Boxes LyricsSomething 'bout the whiteness of the phone
Something 'bout the Genius of Modern Music
How can I think
How can I fail you?
Something 'bout the distance to the nerve
Something 'bout white hands of fate I don't deserve
The bedroom ghosts
How I long to sleep
Perchance to drown
We have been old together
No inside joke, this I won't tolerate
I see you clearly
Ah, love letter boxes
All in favor say
I will blindly follow the ring around
The positive sign
Something 'bout the history of the Jews
Beautiful one don't read too much into clues
Please shake the hand of the velvet glove
Whose fingerprints glow in the dark
And reveal crimes both brave and strange
I cannot teach you how to tell the truth
Even if it hits you
Ah, love letter boxes
All in favor say
I will blindly follow the ring around
The positive sign
Positive sign
Positive sign
Positive sign
Positive sign
Positive signEmbed
