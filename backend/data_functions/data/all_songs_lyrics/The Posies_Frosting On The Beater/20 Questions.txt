20 Questions LyricsA boy once was frozen
All guarded and closed in
Before he had chosen
A beauty to behold
The cream of creation
A red-wine sensation
The power of persuasion
Personified and whole
And we will not get younger
But we won't wait around till we die
'Cause she's got twenty questions
And so do I
The first time I passed her
The second I asked her
The third wish will last her
For long enough to know
The cream of creation
A red-wine sensation
The power of persuasion
Personified and whole
And we will not get younger
But we won't wait around till we die
'Cause she's got twenty questions
And so do I
So onward and upward
Ascent of the unheard
I search for enough words
To thankfully extol
The cream of creation
A red-wine sensation
The power of persuasion
Personified and wholeEmbed
