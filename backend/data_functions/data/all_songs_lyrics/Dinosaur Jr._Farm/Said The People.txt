Said The People Lyrics
I've been staring, I've been staring in the space
All this time, not a smile, such a waste
I don't wanna, I don't wanna know
I can't tell you, I just have to go

All the people, all the people drag me down
All the people, all the people that I know
Save me, save me, save me, save me

Bring me something, bring me something I can use
Well, here's one thing but it's not the one I choose
I can't help it, hope you show up soon
I can't help it, I'm coming home to you


Can you tell me? Can you tell me what went wrong?
Guess I should have seen it coming all along
Gotta fight it, I gotta be strong
Gotta be something, can't let it drag on and on
