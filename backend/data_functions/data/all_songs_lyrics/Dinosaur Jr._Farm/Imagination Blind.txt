Imagination Blind Lyrics
I can feel it like a breath on skin
Every season get a ritual in
Without a reason to fight I fall
Half of love more than nothing at all

I don't need it but I'm here at the door
Let me in, I've been a villain before
I've curled my fingers throwing fist to the wind
It's sad to think I'd do it over again

We wanna leave behind what can't be helped
We love to hold the key and keep it to ourselves
The ones we leave behind, the ones we need
Imagination blind, but changing

Without resistance I'd have no friends
Without your love I don't know where to begin
But I can wait, you take forever to thaw
Your icy grip won't be a death after all
