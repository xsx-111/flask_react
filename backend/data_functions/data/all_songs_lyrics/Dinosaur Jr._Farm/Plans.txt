Plans Lyrics
Well, I followed you that time
Things that touched me slipped my mind
If you help me then I'll try and I'll believe you
I need time, could you explain?
I've been caught up in my pain
And it's really not the same, you can see it

I got nothing left to be
Do you have some plans for me?
I got nothing left to be
Do you have some plans for me?

I can't filter what I lost
See my face and see the cost
All that's good that just got tossed and I keep waiting
And I don't know what to drink
I get twisted everything
I need you to see me sing, can you believe it?

I know you do, I know you do
I know you do
I know you do, I know you do
I know you do, I know you do

Now I know you came
Now I know you know my name
Don't let me be the same
Well, I followed you for years
I've got pain and I've got fears
Then there's moments when it clears and I've been waiting



For me, for me, for me, for meEmbed
