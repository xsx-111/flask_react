Ocean in The Way Lyrics
Said there's an ocean and I'm in the way
I'd like to go soon, we'll shine through the lake
I need to feel that you don't need a thing
Got tons of fear, what else should I bring?

Said there's a panic that I can't describe
I need that something I see in your eye
Just wanna lay down when I cannot deal
Pick me back up, give me something to feel

I've been out looking for somewhere to hide
There's been a mix up somewhere deep inside
I feel the ocean inside of your heart
Just takes a doubt to come smash it apart

Come on down, got some work to do while I'm around
Come on down, got some work to do while I'm around
Come on down, come on down

Said there's an ocean inside of my mind
It's all so murky, the truth's hard to find
When the time gets here you'll vouch you in
It'd be a shame to start over againEmbed
