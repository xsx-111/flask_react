Over It Lyrics
Cannot make it here, I'm over it
I've been feeling weird, get over it
Cannot wind up free, I'm over it
Is there more to see? I'm over it

What else should I do
If I run around for you?
Whether or not I'm spoke to
Keep it comin', more do

You stay out so long, I'm over it
I'll ponder later on, go over it
Can't escape the task, not over it
Waitin' for you to ask, I'm over it
And over it is you

I Haven't figured out it's true
How to ditch-out and I do
Not so easy to get through

I've been on the fence
Now it's makin' sense I see
Sometimes I overthink
I feel my heart sink
I need to believe
I got lost in thought, I'm over it
All I almost lost not over it
I got things to get, get over it
Hasn't happened yet I'm over it

Now it's time to do
All the things you say are true
I get over I need to
When I needed you came through

Can I run right into you?
Getting lost in nothing new
I need everything that's true
What could pick me over you?

You're not gonna go
I'm glad I should've know it's you!Embed
