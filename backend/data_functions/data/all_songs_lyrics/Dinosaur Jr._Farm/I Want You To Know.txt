I Want You To Know Lyrics
Start extremes, so it seems
I left it clean, found a place to hide
I love the place, I took your face
Forgot to face it by myself, I cried
I want you to know

I left you there, I hid upstairs
I had to kid because you're the one I see
I looked around, I felt the ground
It's soul not found, it's hard enough for me
I want you to know

Hey, did I let it go?
Stay with me, tell me if it shows

I want you to know

I brought you there, I thought you cared
Not to step but you just couldn't see
It's always you, it's always me
It's always talking you can set it free
I want you to know

Hey, you're the one who knows
Stay with me, I can't let it go
Hey, you put it in my head
Stay asleep, think on what you said
I want you to know1Embed
