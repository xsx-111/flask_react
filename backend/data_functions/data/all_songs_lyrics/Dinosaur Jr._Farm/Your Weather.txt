Your Weather Lyrics
There's no one living beyond the hands of fate
A number to get hung on that random way
Her light may never shine on your filthy wall
Degree of what you would want will have to fall
Oh, don't we all

Weather will remain the same
If it's painted on your eyelids
High when you decide
Your weather will remain


If it's painted on your eyelids
High when I decided, why can't you?

Our light may ever shine on
Forgive, forget and roll on
Our light may ever shine on
Forgive, forget and roll onEmbed
