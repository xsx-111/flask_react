Half-Thought LyricsWhat have you done
How could you be so
So many times
Accidents don't happen this much
Not this time every day
It's such a bad excuse
To wait for tomorrow
To think another day's
Enough to wait for the next
Do you really need time?
You know I can't leave
Though you hate to hear this every night
I can't keep you unaware
Of the time that you have
After how long you've asked
I can't make you forget
I've forgotten to say
So many things
Too many times
Complete all the half thoughts
That were only half mine
About how if nothing happened
That it was meant to be
I can't believe what kind of things
I made myself believe
If I take my own advice
It will always only show
The meaning it's lacked
If I found a new conviction
Will you and I start to feel it
Slip out of our handsEmbed
