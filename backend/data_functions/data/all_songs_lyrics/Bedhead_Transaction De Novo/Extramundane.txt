Extramundane LyricsI can't force myself to say something
Any more than i can think of a thing to do
Any more than you can pull yourself out of nothing
When there's nothing forcing you to
But I haven't tried meditation
Or completely closed my eyes
I haven't yet given up my reason
And that's worth a try
If I'm a fool I've always thought i am
Who's never seen clearly anyway
What sense lies in trying to pay attention
When it's your real thoughts attention betrays
But I haven't tried stimulation
Or completely opened my eyes
I haven't yet given up my senses
And that's worth a tryEmbed
