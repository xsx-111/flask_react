Parade LyricsI wiped away the sweat on my face
And I looked around the room
There was nothing out of place
But nothing was happening too soon
I could see the empty chair
Leaning against its shadow
Even though there was nothing there
There was something in my eyes followed
Like marks across the sky
Erased as they're made
I could see people going by
Through the moonlit shade
But no one stopped to look
Through the blinds on the window
I guess they all took
Me for someone they don't know
A parade falls apart
When the music slows down
When the streets are in knots
But there's no one left in town
When the sweat leaves your face
And the fear leaves your knees
And you live in this place
Where you live with complete easeEmbed
