Psychosomatica LyricsSomething's gone awry
And I can't determine why
It's like an incidence
But it's not providence
It's not written in the sky
And on it's meaning don't rely
It's hard to figure out
With byline of doubt
Whatever is amiss
I never fail to miss
I can't remember what I heard
And what I made up
If it turns out a mistake
If the worry's been fake
I can't reel it out
I was hit by more than doubtEmbed
