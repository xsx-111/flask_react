Forgetting LyricsIf my head's on my shoulders
Then I'm getting older
My face didn't look like this last year
I can't see it clearly
But the change seems over
The only thing that makes me look back
Is nostalgia
All your eyes getting wiser
With compliments I know I'm the miser
But the only that makes me look forward
Is forgettingEmbed
