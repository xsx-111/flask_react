Leave It in My Dreams Lyrics
Darling, darlin', I'm falling, oh
I'm your man

Guess I've been taking a lot from you, oh
Searching so long for the truth, oh
You hoped that girl would chase you out the door
As you think it, it's already too late
Searching for meaning in a combination of notes
Don't overthink it, don't overthink it

Tried to wake so early
Get up in the mornin', it just hurts
And I think of all those little things that you and I can do

And now I've taken too many hits
Oh, I'm breaking off with all that stuff
"Anybody else want some?" That's no good reason
I broke up with Edison, I've had enough, oh
Shy and fast times in the park
Don't overthink it

Sorry to wake so early
I get up in the mornin', it just hurts
I don't wanna hear what I can't mime
Anywhere with you could change my mind
Somebody's taking much too long
Somebody's taking much too long
Don't call me stupid
Don't call me stupid


It's my life and I can't delete it
Is that the life I lead?
All these surreal things and sudden decisions
Just wanna waste my time with you

I will leave it, oh, in my dreams
I'll never let it bother me, it's not my style
I know you want it
I know you want it

Somebody's taking much too long
Somebody's taking much too long
Don't call me stupid
Don't call me stupid13Embed
