Permanent High School Lyrics
If I told you the truth, it would be a lie

Be damned, don't you dare
I'll be laughing from here to there
Just because something's popular
Don't mean it's good
I'd like to be your drink
I'll help you talk
I'll help you think
Deal with it, I cheated on a test

Hiding what we want to do
Smart people will learn from fools
Life is like a hurricane
Cloud-swirls when the asteroid came
Depressed and stressed and oppressed
Lies are simple, truth complex
Snakes with venom, ones with none
Ones who bite you just for fun

The horror of being awakened
And temporarily see the madness of the life
Deal with it
If I told you the truth, it would be a lie
Deal with it
If I told you the truth, it would be a lie

Hiding what they want to do
Is it me or is it you?
Their lies comforting someone
Occupied like Washington
Sometimes it's easier to cry
Than try to figure out why
Fight for ungrateful grandchildren
In the future there's no sun

Well I'm sorry that, sorry dad
Sorry that I can't forget
Well I'm sorry that, sorry dad
Sorry that I can't forget
Well I'm sorry that, sorry dad
Sorry that I can't forget

When did my joy break like a toy?
Tell me what we're fighting for
When did my dreams tear at the seams?
Put me on a different team
Well I'm sorry that, sorry dad
Sorry that I can't forget11Embed
