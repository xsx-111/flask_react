ALieNNatioN Lyrics
In the land of the free-er
Evidence, there's no use

I've been bathing in the blood of our success
I guess it is just the stubborn side of man
That can see a riot and then somehow think
There could actually be no good reason
You want to see what people are really like
I'm not really sure you want to be knowing

How could you say
Murder in the name of national security
Yo no sé - they say
Murder in the name of national security
But there's silence in the way
But there's silence in the way

Evidence, there's no use
This is just the life that's been chosen for me
Yeah, well
I've been sipping on the blood of sweet success
Before history punishes us for it
You wanna see what, people are really like?
Watch them light a torch
Understanding ends this game

How could it be
Murder in the name of officer security
Yo no sé - they say
Murder in the name of officer security

If I was batting I'd be right behind ya
It's not the first time, that I've been lied to
All wordz are made - before I was born
My friend the walls say only they'll keep me warm
You know it, lies are comforting
Bye-bye, bye-bye
You know it all, obliviousness
I'll leave it in my dreams, my dreams
You know it on my own
Sitting down right here
I wanted it
Murder in the name of personal security
Yo no sé
Yes I'm going out tonite, just don't wanna be fooled again

(We all) play those mind games and we stay unaware
Not angels, not fiends
But just human beings
Work so hard to become a faint memory
In the mind of a collective group of strangers
Leaving all my melodies behind10Embed
