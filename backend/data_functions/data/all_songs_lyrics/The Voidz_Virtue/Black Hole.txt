Black Hole Lyrics
Well, it feels good
Going down the drain
Sending everybody down the drain
Think you won't drain too?
Are you selfish or stupid?
It's one of those two

Quit your crying for the other side
Can't fight with tears in my eyes
I don't want to be here any more than you
But pick a side
What's that say? NSA, NRA at the gates of Psycho City
Black hole sucking us into oblivion

Well, it feels good
Walking over me
Walking all over their graves
Like an inanimate object
That's what we became
Death did the same
And the bad feelings come in waves

Let me get a ride
Takes a drive on your body
Take a ride inside my mind
Get inside and take a ride
Listen to some noise
Quit your crying for the other side
Can't fight with tears in my eyes
I don't want to be here any more than you
But pick a side
What's that say? NSA, NRA at the gates of Psycho City
Black hole sucking us into oblivion2Embed
