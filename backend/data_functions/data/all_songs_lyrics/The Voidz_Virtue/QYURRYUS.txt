QYURRYUS Lyrics
Hot track, hot dress
Undressing this hot mess
Gettin' off on the west side
All day on a roof on the west side
Hot track, hot dress
Undressing this hot mess
Gettin' off on the west side
All day on a roof on the west side

Public is confused
Prison jazz virtue
He knows the truth if he thinks it through
Minor but major
I was gonna say
That's not your problem
At least not today

Hot track, hot dress
Undressing this hot mess
Gettin' off on the west side
All day on a roof on the west side
Hot track, hot dress
Undressing this hot mess
Gettin' off on the west side
All day on a roof on the west side
I lost what's mine
Little habibi
I lost what's mine
Trust in systems of the law
I lost what's mine
Somebody help
I lost what's mine
Odd creatures walking tall
I lost what's mine
I did the London Eye
I lost what's mine
I didn't wanna get off
I lost what's mine
Guess it was never mine
I lost what's mine
Take me back and I'm a child
I lost what's mine
I want my mom, I want my home
I lost what's mine
Ah, oh!
I lost what's mine
My son, oh!
I lost what's mine
Ahh-ahh!7Embed
