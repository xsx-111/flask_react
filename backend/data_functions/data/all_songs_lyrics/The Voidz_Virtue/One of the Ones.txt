One of the Ones Lyrics
Not for the ones who got away
But this is for the ones you got away from
I'mma gonna quit
I'mma gonna quit
By the 'y' in bye
I'mma gonna quit

I know, I know
I never read the law
Please hide, my love
My husband's at the door
I know, I bet you
Never was the type
I know, you know, I know, you know, I know
I never get it right

Think like a fountain, sing like a truck
I think we've been civilized long enough
I'mma gonna split, I'mma gonna split
By the 'y' in bye
I'mma gonna split

I know, I know
I never get it back
Please hide, my love
My husband's at the back
He lied, he cried
He listened through the door
I know, I know
Don't you want me anymore?
I wanna see you in your tanlines
With my giant and wise elephant eyes
I'm not gonna quit
I'm not gonna quit
By the 'i' in hi
We will be in sync

Please hide, my love
My husband's at the door
He lied, he cried
He listened through the floor
What happened
Don't you want me anymore?
I know, you know, I know, you know
You like it like it was before2Embed
