My Friend the Walls Lyrics
Some like to play
You play just to win
For a flower to grow
The seed must die

Change my mind in the dark
Down to the left hand cliff
Of your nude body's face
My friend the walls
Lonesome, the utmost fear
Off the record
When nobody is there
My friend the walls

When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
When I get my hands on you

In the dark changes his mind
Everybody dreams to be a name
On a street sign some day

When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
When I get my hands on you
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh

Writing songs
Close the door
All I know since '94
So I don't want a give away
But I give it anyway
On the floor
Close the door
I can't watch this anymoreEmbed
