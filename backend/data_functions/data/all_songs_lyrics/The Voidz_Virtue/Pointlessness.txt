Pointlessness LyricsI think I'm wasted
But I'm ready
I think I'm ready
But I'm wasted
Oh, oh, oh
All I think about
'Till the end of all days
All I think about
All that I think about
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
Oh
What does it matter?
I believe that
You're gonna be forgotten
Any day now
Just like the others told you
I think I'm wasted
But I'm ready
I think I'm ready
But I'm wasted
Oh, oh, oh
All I think about
'Till the end of our days
All I think about
All that I think about
What does it matter?
Oh
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
Oh
What does it matter?
What does it matter?4Embed
