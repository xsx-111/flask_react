Pink Ocean Lyrics
Trying to seek it
Trying to see it through
And I saw your face
So fast…
We should do this again
I bit my lip before - do this again before…

I don't believe it
Don't overthink it
I won't believe it

I want out of this world
I won't lie anymore, I can't love anymore
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway
I want out of this world
I won't lie anymore, I can't love anymore
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway

We should do this again
I've bit my lip before, do this again before
I get a job, I get a job
Just like you ask of me
I want out of this world
I won't lie anymore, I can't love anymore
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway

One eye, catch my look
Gave me the side eye, like I'm a crook
I was at your house
But you never came
And I wanted you
All the lights I faced

I want out of this world
I won't lie anymore, I can't love anymore
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway
I want out of this world
I won't lie anymore, I can't love anymore
I want out of this world
I didn't want it anyway13Embed
