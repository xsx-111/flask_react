Think Before You Drink LyricsAs a child I had no knowledge
No way to understand
My father kept me sheltered
He would hold me in his hand
You know I was protected
With no threat from anywhere
I drank my mother’s milk
And I didn’t have a care
But it didn’t last forever
I was soon sent off to school
Where the teachers gave me poison
And I drank it like a fool
We took pride in our past
What our leaders said they fought for
To justify the murders
Of the children in the war
They said that mother nature
Couldn’t give us what we need
And that explained the factories, and pollution in the stream
They gave us all the facts
Explaining economic war
And like a fool I listened
But I won’t listen anymore
So before the final slaughter
Please stop and think
You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
So before the final slaughter
Please stop and think
You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink2Embed
