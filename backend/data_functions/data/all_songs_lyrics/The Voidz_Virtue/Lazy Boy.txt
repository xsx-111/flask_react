Lazy Boy Lyrics
Everything I say is everything you wanna hear
My heart is broken through my dreams
I don't wanna be a puppet that the ghost of my young self
Still controls
Jackets are the eyes to the soul

Holdin' back the tears as you're walkin' down the hallway
I don’t wanna do it
I don’t wanna do this anymore
Hurt you after class and you're doing it the hard way
I don't wanna see it
I don’t wanna do this anymore
Ohhh

Everything I say is everything you wanna hear
Jackets are the eyes to the soul
When it's not that important, the stronger man will back down
I don't wanna do this anymore

Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Holdin' back the tears as you're walkin' down the hallway
I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna do this anymore

Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no
Going in a circle, ah no
Throw it in the circle, oh no6Embed
