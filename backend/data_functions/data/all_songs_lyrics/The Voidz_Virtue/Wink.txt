Wink Lyrics
I see the writing on the wall
I was playing it too safe
Playing it too safe is dangerous
All the things that kept me going
Was all the things that slowed me down
I see the writing on the wall

I thought it was here, but it's not my fault
You said it was there, but it's not over there
Oh, fuck yeah
It's gonna be somewhere you'll see

I don't wanna know
Guess we could make up stuff to talk about
Woah oh oh oh oh oh

I wanna put you in my crocodile mouth
And drag you to the bottom of my swamp
Oh, fuck yeah
It's gonna be something to see

I don't really know where I'm going
Not sure that I wanna be knowing
Everyone's the hero in their made-up movie life
I was playing it too safe I see
Playing it too safe is dangerous
Maybe not for me but for them

People who do not do anything know
Exactly where all their time is going
Oh, fuck yeah
Gonna beâ€” happier maybe

People in the wrong bodies, mountain broken like a heart
Drive a highway through you like a rainbow arc
It's all over there, oh somewhere
It's gonna be, cheap, maybe free

Stay a while
I never wanted it to go that way
Say it in a while
A plane flies through the moon
Or we could think of things to talk about
Save it in a pile
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh10Embed
