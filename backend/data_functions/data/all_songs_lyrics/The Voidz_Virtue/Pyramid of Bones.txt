Pyramid of Bones Lyrics
I'm a devil, I'm a villain
Aggressive driver with a casual expression
"Equinsu ocha" (white devil)
Just the guy from the "11th dimension"
Lies are simple, truth is complex
Murder in the name of personal comfort
Just remember, they surrendered
Dangerous to be right, if everyone is wrong

As they say
It's the darkness of his mind
"I can change"
Don’t you ever listen to the white man's lies
Truth be told, you would feel much better
Once you know
Don’t you ever listen to his lies…


I'm a devil, I'm a villain
Aggressive driver going the wrong direction
Truth is complex
Lies are simple
Murder in the name of national security
Just remember, I surrender
I see beasts in the shapes but no shapes in my wordz
One taste of jail and you see how we fail
The great death and horror unveiled
Weak, strong, all belong
All will perish, like this song

Shallow things
That distract you through the day
In the end
Don’t you ever listen to the white man's lies
I suppose
Do exactly what you want
King of beers
Don’t you ever listen to his lies…
As I said
It will catch us all some day
"I can change, I can change"
They play the game by different rules, insisting
It's all equal13Embed
