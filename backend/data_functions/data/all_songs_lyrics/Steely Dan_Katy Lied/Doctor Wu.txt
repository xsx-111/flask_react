Doctor Wu Lyrics
Katy tried, I was halfway crucified
I was on the other side
Of no tomorrow
You walked in, and my life began again
Just when I'd spent the last
Piaster I could borrow
All night long
We would sing that stupid song
And every word we sang
I knew was true
Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
Are you crazy, are you high
Or just an ordinary guy
Have you done all you can do
Are you with me Doctor

Don't seem right
I've been strung out here all night
I've been waiting for the taste
You said you'd bring to me
Biscayne Bay, where the Cuban
Gentlemen sleep all day
I went searching for the song
You used to sing to me
Katy lies, you can see it in her eyes
But imagine my surprise
When I saw you
Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
She is lovely yes she's sly
And you're an ordinary guy
Has she finally got to you
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor3Embed
