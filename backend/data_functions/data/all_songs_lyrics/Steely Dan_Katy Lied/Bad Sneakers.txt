Bad Sneakers Lyrics
Five names that I can hardly stand to hear
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isn't here
I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard
Yes I'm going insane
And I'm laughing in the frozen rain
Well I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend
You fellah, you tearin' up the street
You wear that white tuxedo
How you gonna beat the heat?
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you think that I don't see
That ditch out in the valley
That they're digging just for me?
Yes I'm going insane
You know I'm laughing at the frozen rain
Well I feel like I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend

You know, going insane
Yes I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend3Embed
