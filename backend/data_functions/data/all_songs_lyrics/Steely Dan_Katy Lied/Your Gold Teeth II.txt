Your Gold Teeth II Lyrics
Who are these children
Who scheme and run wild?
Who speak with their wings
And the way that they smile?
What are the secrets
They trace in the sky?
And why do you tremble
Each time they ride by?

Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal
Who are these strangers
Who pass through the door?
Who cover your action
And go you one more?
If you're feeling lucky
You best not refuse
It's your game the rules
Are your own win or lose

Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal

Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal
