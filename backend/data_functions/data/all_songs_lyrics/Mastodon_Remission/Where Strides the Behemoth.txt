Where Strides the Behemoth Lyrics
Condition tomorrow
With visions inlaid
The priest stands to our right
A princess is mine

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

The regress of some minds
Further chase the prize
Pretentious, you follow
Religion is mine


Anger precedes my footsteps
Haunting past comes into head
Horizon seems so far away
This life close to end of days
Kill and I will be damned
Forgive and I will be free
Unify the eyesight
