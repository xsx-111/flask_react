As Far as I Can See Lyrics
As far as I can see
Nobody loves me
As far as I can tell
Nobody loves you either
And we're all goin' down
All down the staircase
And we're all goin' down
All down the staircase aboard

As far as I can see
Nobody's listenin'
As far as I can tell
Nobody's listenin' to me
And when I'm cryin' out
Out for an answer
And when I'm cryin' out
Nobody cries back for me1Embed
