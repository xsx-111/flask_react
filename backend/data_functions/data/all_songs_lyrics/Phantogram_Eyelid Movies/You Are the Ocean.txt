You Are the Ocean Lyrics
This song is about you
Cause I can't live without you
When a song is about you
Then you know you've got problems
That you can choose

There's a hole in my conscience
There's a hole in my country
Like a nose that keeps runnin'
Like a hose that won't stop flowin'
And I know that it's comin'
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming soon
Here's why

Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drownin'
You should be lookin' out
The mornin' will follow
And I won't remember
You should be lookin' out
It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever
You should be lookin' out
You should be lookin' out
In the fall I get lonely
In the winter I'm still lonely
Come the knives of the springtime
In the summer I go crazy

Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drownin'
You should be lookin' out
The mornin' will follow
And I won't remember
You should be lookin' out
It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever
You should be lookin' out
You should be lookin' out4Embed
