Turn It Off LyricsI've got your name
Got your notebook
Cellphone look
Population
An invitation to die
And all the faces
Mopeds can't collide
It's fascination
And it will eat you alive
Me I'm no stranger to the law and no I won't abide
I've got my handcuffs
Mouth taped
Suicide eyes
And all the faces
Gracious
Look up to the sky
This is the way of the world
Weight of the world makes me cry
I could have been easier on you
I should have been a little bit easier on you1Embed
