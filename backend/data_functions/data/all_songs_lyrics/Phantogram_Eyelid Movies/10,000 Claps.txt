10,000 Claps Lyrics10,000 claps
10,000 claps for me
10,000 cats
10,000 cats for me
Seasonal change, stars rearrange
Kissing my grave
Why are you bothering me?
10,000 rats
10,000 rats to meet
Standing in line
One at a time, for me
Sparkling night
Sharpening knives
Parallel lines
Taking up all of my time
Wishing away
Robbing my stones
Kissing my grave
When can you take me back home?Embed
