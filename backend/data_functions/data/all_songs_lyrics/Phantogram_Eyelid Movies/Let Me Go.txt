Let Me Go Lyrics
This golden glow
Is not happiness
It's the dust that you kicked on my face
Before saying goodbye
Oh memory
Won't you speak to me?
Can you show me the boat in my soul
That can sail me back home

Let me go
Let me go
Let me go

You can shave me down
You can clean my teeth
Get me ready to meet all the people
That I thought I knew
But my memory
Has mistaken me
Can't remember the last time
I felt so incredibly young
So let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go

And I try
To leave
But my bones
Just won't agree
And I try
To believe
You should try
Set me free

Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me goEmbed
