Futuristic Casket LyricsI must have died
A thousand times
When I get out
I'll rule the earth
I saw your face in a past life
I'm ready to move on
In a futuristic casket
And you're still alive
To work it out
I'll dig a hole
To crawl inside
And make my home
I saw your face in a film tonight
I wanted to touch the screen
I'll never be cruel again
I saw your face in a past life
I'm ready to move on
In a futuristic casket
I saw your face in a film tonight
I wanted to touch the screen
I'll never be cruel again2Embed
