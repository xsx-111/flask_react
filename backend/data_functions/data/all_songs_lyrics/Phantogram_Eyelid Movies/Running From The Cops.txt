Running From The Cops Lyrics
New surroundings
New surroundings

My dreams will never come true
And if they ever ever do, it's never you
I want to implode, I want it to end
And all those old feelings are coming back again


My dreams are haunting my soul
And when I'm driving down the road, I'm not in control
I want to let go, I want to shake hands
With the person that's responsible for this master plan
I know I will, I know I can


My dreams will never come true
And if they ever ever do, it's never you
My dreams will never come true
And if they ever ever do, it's never you1Embed
