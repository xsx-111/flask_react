All Dried Up Lyrics
All dried up
In the morning light
Realize my love is gone
Tell me that you're fine
Are you staying warm
Can you show me a sign
Without your body

Can't feel my my love anymore
Can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still walking
Can't feel my love anymore
Can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still running
I'm still running

Last night I had a dream
That the sky would part
And you'd come for me
Can you keep me waiting
Until the sun goes down
I am dying here
Without my body
Can't feel my my love anymore
Can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still walking
Can't feel my love anymore
Can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still running
I'm still runningEmbed
