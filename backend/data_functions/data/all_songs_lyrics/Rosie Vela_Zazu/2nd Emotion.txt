2nd Emotion LyricsSecond my emotion. When I laid my eyes on you
Takin' that emotion
And I wanna make it all come true... Just for you
A li'l dab'll do ya in the Home of the Brave
I don't know if I can be sure of you
I don't know if I can. Help me
I think I'm fallin' all over you
Tell me. I'm just a dreamin' fool
Second kiss of lovin'. Oh no
Remember when your heart was mine?
Takin' that illusion
Guess I'm gonna feel it all the time
All the time now
A li'l dab'll do ya in the Home of the Brave
I don't know if I can be sure of you
I don't know if I can. Help me
I think I'm fallin' all over you
Tell me. I'm just a dreamin' fool
Ah. Ki me kin no von zin zorry
Ah. Ki me kin no von zin zorry now
I'll never come back. I'm in pieces
I can't decide about ya
Ah. Ki me kin no von zin zorry
Ah. Ki me kin no von
A li'l dab'll do ya in the Home of the Brave
I don't know if I can be sure of you. Now
Help me. I think I'm fallin' all over you
Tell me. I'm just a dreamin' fool
Help me. I think I'm fallin' all over you
Tell me. I'm just a dreamin' fool
Help me. I think I'm fallin' all over you
Tell me. I'm just a dreamin' fool
How could you leave me standin' there, darlin'?
How? Ki me kin no von. So sorry now
I'll never come back. I'm in pieces
I can't decide about you
Ah. Ki me kin no von zin zorry
Ah. Ki me kin no von zin zorry now
A communo-bi-cause
I'm in "decide" I'm in. I can't see
And I can't know it now
I'm in "decide" I'm in. I can't see
Kin dy zin teasin'. A call it a day
I coulda been a bison. Ooh I on a vee
On din dy coulda been
On din dy con a zee. Oh, lover la lie. Da da
I can't see and I can't know and I can't feel yaEmbed
