Taxi LyricsI am the one who rides in taxis
I am the one who moves in yellow
Connect me please. I've gone the distance
Don't look at me. It's your envision
I have heard of your story
Breaking out on the scenes
Maybe we could have changed things
That's enough for me to see
That's enough for me to see
That's your hootchikoo
I have heard of a time. You walked on water
And you formed. You formed the miracle
You called the miracle. And people heard ya
For miles n miles n miles. But that was long ago
Now no one knows your name
And no one tries to find ya
No one cries out loud for baby
Maybe I think you've been had
I am the one who rides in taxis
I am the one who moves in yellow
Get clear. Feels like a movie
I know: same ending
I have heard of your story
Breaking out on the scenes
Maybe we could have changed things
That's enough for me to see
Floor the gas and set me free
You're still a star...
I have heard of a time. You walked on water
And you formed. You formed the miracle
You called the miracle. And people heard ya
For miles n miles n miles. But that was long ago
Now no one knows your name
And no one tries to find ya
No one cries out loud for baby
Maybe I think you've been had
Speakin' tongues in time
Does remind me of a disco. Yes
Tried it. Don't deny it
Diamonds ain't really a girl's best friend
Heard of a time you know
It was long ago, but you held me close
Said "Don't let go." And I told you
I loved you; I wanted you soEmbed
