Interlude LyricsLove's in a memory. Too many faces that I have given
All my life I desired someone who would know me
Time and time again I try to keep on goin' on
But it doesn't always seem to work
I just wanna say that I am waiting always for your love
Could you know?
Lost in a wonderland
Looking for you is a dream of visions
All my life I desired someone who would love me
Time and time again I try to turn myself to me
But it doesn't work
I just miss you more and more
I'm waiting always for your love... Love
Someone said another day is my hesitation now
Come again... I wanna play some more
You're the one. The only one
That's my liberation of love
It's a matter of faction in another kind of world
Of mine
Loving's a mysterious thing, too
Something you can't deny
Someone who puts the flame to... of love inside
Love is an incredible thing you just have to hold to
Love is on the way for those who hope to
Love is an incredible dream yeah... if you just want it
Oh my head
Time and time again I try to turn myself to me
But it doesn't always seem to work
I just miss you more and more
I'm waiting always for your love
Could you know?Embed
