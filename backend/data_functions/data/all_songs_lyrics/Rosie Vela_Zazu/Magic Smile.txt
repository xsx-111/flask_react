Magic Smile LyricsI can't imagine how you'd thrill me
And then you'd walk away
I can't imagine how you'd love me
And then you'd go away
Oh, but oh,oh, magic is there when you smile
Just like a Hollywood child
And I haven't noticed just where you've been, like a stranger, like in a wind
I could tell you were a fast-as-ya-can-man
And good advice I could give to you
I wanna see you now
I don't care, I don't eat, I don't sleep, I don't cry
No, no, we're two of a kind
Oh,no
Tell me control
It's too much time
I been tryin' to see ya baby, I been dyin' to keenovay
I been tryin' to see ya baby, any way that I can
I been tryin' to see ya baby, I been dyin' to keenovay
I been tryin' to see ya baby and I wonder why
But oh, magic is there when you smile
Just like a Hollywood child
And I haven't noticed just where you've been, like a stranger
Like in my heart I could tell
You were a fast-as-ya-can-man
And good advice I could give to you
I wanna see you now
I don't care, I don't eat, I don't sleep, I don't cry
We're two of a kind
Oh, no
Tell me it's not so
It's too much time
I can't imagine how you'd love me
And then you'd run away
I'm over my head, I can't believe it
I can't imagine how you'd love me
And then go away
Oh, but oh
Da da da da da da da da da...
I just have to say
Modern man was meant to win
Lovin' you is all I want
I can taste, I can feel...no, no
Guess love's real
That's what they say now
Undiscovered consciousness they call love
I said less than this, less than this: goodbye
It's too much timeEmbed
