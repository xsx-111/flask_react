Sunday LyricsThere was something about a face
There was something in her eyes
Would not be there tomorrow
If only things could change
Well I know I have to let you know. It's my embrace
My heart can't wait
Well I am just another friend
Who's caught up in the madness
Hold my head to my... come back... come back tomorrow
I was there from the start
And I'll be there to guide you. All that you need
A love like yours is hard to leave
But a love like mine is hard to find. Come back...
Come back tomorrow. I can only sigh
It must be love. Must be love. Must be love
It must be love. Love
How could I backtrack in time
Muk an a say. Do da ba
I sent you my Head On
Ka vin you co da vin. An in a
Sideshowed a bad chat. A muk an a say
Do da ba a Zen. Jive coulda Calvin you wussie
I'm just goin' wild. When I look in your eyes
But I only see a photo. Only just a child
Well I know I have to let you go
It's much too late. My heart can't break
Well I am just another friend
Who's caught up in the madness
Hold my head to my... come back... come back tomorrow
I was there from the start
And I'll be there to love you. Always you see
A love like yours is hard to leave
But a love like mine is hard to find. Come back...
Come back tomorrow. I can only try
It must be love. Must be love. Must be love
It must be love. Love
There was something about a face
It must be love
There was something in her eyes
Or my imagination. I know
There was something about a face
It must be love
There was something in her eyes
Or my imagination. Well I know
And I can't shin-da shin-da
And I can't live without your love. Oh no
There was something about a face
It must be love
There was something in her eyes
Or my imagination. I know
There was something about a face
It must be love
There was something in her eyes
Or my imagination. I knowEmbed
