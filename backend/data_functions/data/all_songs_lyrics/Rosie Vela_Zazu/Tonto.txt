Tonto LyricsI have not noticed where you've been
Could I be a missin' you?
I can't remember how it felt
All the times you left me there
I know. I came before the scenes. I was even kind
I could say that one of us was too damn high
Well the heroes never call
Nobody's there and there's nowhere to fall
Don't you ever wonder? Or it don't matter at all
I have not noticed where you've run
Could I get a message there?
I can't remember how it felt
All the dreams you left me with
I know. I came before the scenes. I was even kind
I could say that one of us was too damn high
Well the heroes never call
Nobody's there and there's nowhere to fall
Don't you ever wonder? Or it don't matter at all
Well the heroes never call
Nobody's there and there's nowhere to fall
Don't you ever wonder? Or it don't matter at allEmbed
