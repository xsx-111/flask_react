Zazu LyricsThey said you meant to
Discarbonate the Diamond Rip-Off
Without your one best friend, now. Oh
Oh, didn't you know
Imagination's my Business High
You'll never make it
I thought that I could break in
Innocence is all that it was
2,000 million billion faces
2,000 stars in space
That fell in my sky when you tried
Zazu, please. You're not that kind
This Techno-data is mine
I'm the one with the secret code
We could go to Venus
Space me. With a little ride
You know how I like it
When the music's high
Say the museum's blinded by the Guiding Light
Homocorporate Honchos
Payroll's in the night to survive
I'll still be on your side
Oh Zazu da-day
Drive me crazy
You know a fever is on
I'm just someone who's in love
With the cause of the perfect man
We could go to Venus
Space me. With a little love
You know how I like it
In the stars above. Zazu
I say the museum's blinded by the Guiding Light
Homocorporate Honchos
Payrollin' in the night to survive
I'll still be on your side
They said you meant to
Discarbonate the Diamond Rip-Off
Without your one best friend, now. Oh
Oh, didn't you know. Oh, didn't you know
Imagination's my Business High. ZazuEmbed
