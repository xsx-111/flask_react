Boxs LyricsOh... I have been touched
By the Power of the Spirit
I was in over my head
Is it any wonder how I feel
The way I'm missing you
Night after night after night
Do you remember how it was
When I was kissin' you?
On the night we were so right?
Is it any wonder? I want to know
Is it any wonder? I loved you so
One night you may find me
Standin' in the wings outside of your heart
I need your love decision
Bangin' on Boxes in the middle of your street
Bang Bang on Boxes so my heart can feel the beat
Is it any wonder? I want to know
I have been touched by the Power of the People
But I wasn't over my head
You go out to play. I'll throw the bombs away
We'll start all over again
Is it any wonder how I'd be the President now?
Night after night after night
Do you remember how it was
When I was lovin' you?
On the night we were so right?
Is it any wonder? I want to know
Is it any wonder? I loved you so
One night you may find me
Standin' in the wings outside of your heart
I need your love decision
Bangin' on Boxes in the middle of your street
You got me Bangin' on Boxes
In the middle of your street
Is it any wonder? No no. Oh, boxes
So my heart can feel the beat
Is it any wonder? No no. OhEmbed
