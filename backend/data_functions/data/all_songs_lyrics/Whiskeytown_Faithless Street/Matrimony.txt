Matrimony LyricsWell, I'm saving this dress for my wedding day
Momma wouldn't have it any other way
She says when she married, her waist was twenty three
I guess I'll never wear it anyway
I don't believe I care to marry
Though I cannot explain exactly why
It somehow seems to me that matrimony is misery
Simply a faster way to die
I'm saving all my money for my wedding day
You know my momma wouldn't have it any other way
She says when she married, she didn't' have a dime
But I guess I'll spend that money some other way
Because I don't believe I care to marry
Though I cannot explain exactly why
It somehow seems to me that matrimony is misery
Simply a faster way to die
Well, I'm saving my best thing for my wedding day
Because my poppa wouldn't have it any other way
He says if I lose it early, I'll have thrown my life away
But I swear I'll use my cherry my own way
I don't believe I care to marry
Though I cannot explain exactly why
It somehow seems to me that matrimony is misery
Simply a faster way to dieEmbed
