Faithless Street LyricsIf angels are messengers from god
Please send one down to me
If angels are messengers from god
I wrote a letter he should read
Been living on faithless street all by myself
Work your whole life for someone else
Trying to find sanction, christ above man
He never she'd his peace on this land
So I started this damn country band
Been living on faithless street all by myself
Work your whole life for someone else
Trying to find sanction, christ above man
He never she'd his peace on this land
So I started this damn country band
'cause punk rock was too hard to singEmbed
