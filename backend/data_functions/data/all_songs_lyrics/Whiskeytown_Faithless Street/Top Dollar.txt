Top Dollar LyricsWell I tried to find something
Something to hold on to
I thought it was you cause I'm sick and tired
Of trying to make something
Something out of nothing
I guess since you were bluffing
Now I think I'm losing my mind
The pain in my heart
Was it worth the price?
The pain in my heart
Was it worth the time I wasted on you?
You're giving me the top dollar blues
And I gave you it all, all
All that I could give you
You've taken what I've given
Ynd thrown it all away
Like it's nothing
Never meant nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
What an awful price I've paid
The pain in my heart
Was it worth the price?
The pain in my heart
Was it worth the time I wasted on you?
You're giving me the top dollar blues
I've bet all my money and that's how it goes
You ran a good race
But you lost just by a nose
It's true
Baby, you're giving me the top dollar blues
The top dollar blues
I gave you it all, all
All that I could give you
And the top dollar blues
Top dollar bluesEmbed
