Drank Like A River LyricsWell, he was nearly died when he returned to the town he'd come from
He's brown bagging it tonight behind some tavern
Somebody wrecked his life, and I'll bet you it was his darlin'
Somebody wrecked his life, and I'll bet you it was his darlin'
So he drank like a river when the wedding bells rang
Watched from the steeple as the choir girls sang
Died in a gutter on his feet and his hands...
The same hands that had once touched her face
Well, he was nearly died when he returned to the town he'd come from
He's hanging out drinking beer with his brother-in-law
He was a drinker at night, and in the morning he was unnerving
He was a drinker full time, the day that he lost his darlin'
So he drank like a river when the wedding bells rang
Watched from the steeple as the choir girls sang
Died in a gutter on his feet and his hands...
The same hands that had once touched her face
So he drank like a river when the wedding bells rang
Watched from the steeple as the choir girls sang
Died in a gutter on his feet and his hands...
The same hands that had once touched her face
So he drank like a river when the wedding bells rang
Watched from the steeple as the choir girls sang
Died in a gutter on his feet and his hands...
The same hands that had once touched her faceEmbed
