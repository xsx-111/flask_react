Midway Park LyricsRide with you tonight, i'll ride forever
There's no way to predict this kind of weather
Ashes fall to earth, words are severed
Feathers turn to weighted iron pillars
Midway park
Streetlights shine on a hood that is dark
Down on the graves
Where we'll lie. We'll lie. We'll lie
Think of you tonight, i'll think forever
There's no way to predict this kind of weather
Ashes fall to earth, words are severed
Feathers turn to broken beads and pillars
Midway park
Streetlights shine on a hood that is dark
Down on the graves
We'll lie. Where we'll lie. We'll lie
Don't tell the truth, we'll lie
Just lie
Don't tell the truth
Just lieEmbed
