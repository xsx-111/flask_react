What May Seem Like Love LyricsWhat may seem like love may soon fall apart
You don't practice what you preach
You don't finish what you start
Your lies have got me tryin' to mend a broken heart
Please don't speak to me again
You keep telling me you're sorry
But I just don't give a damn
You keep telling me you're sorry
Well, I'm never gonna listen to a single word you're sayin
What may seem like love may soon fall apart
The student shouldn't speak and interrupt his teacher's thought
There's a lesson to be learned about being true to heart
Please don't speak to me again
You keep telling me you're sorry
But I just don't give a damn
You keep telling me you're sorry
Well, I'm never gonna listen to a single word you're sayin
What may seem like love may soon fall apart
You don't practice what you preach
You don't finish what you start
Your lies have got me tryin to mend a broken heart
Please don't speak to me again
You keep telling me you're sorry
Well, I just don't give a damn
You keep telling me you're sorry
Well, I'm never gonna listen to a single word you're sayin
I'm never gonna listen to a single word you've been sayinEmbed
