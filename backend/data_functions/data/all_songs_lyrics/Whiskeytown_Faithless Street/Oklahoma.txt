Oklahoma LyricsSee old mabel walk on down the house (??)
Pickin flowers for someone else
See old mabel walk down the house
Said son, better go on back inside
Storm brewing from the northwest side
Didn't ask about my daddy's ruin
Cause that old motherfucker ain't alive
See old mabel walk on down the store
Buying groceries to eat
Walkin on down the street
Said son, you better go on back inside
Storm brewing from the northwest side
Didn't ask about my daddy's ruin
Cause that old motherfucker ain't alive
See old mabel walk on down the house
Pickin flowers for someone else
Old mabel (?? ?? ?)
Family Bible on the coffee table
In old mabel's houseEmbed
