Hard Luck Story LyricsWell, I was thinking that I shoulda
But I didn't ever leave you
But baby, I'm leavin tonight
And there's a trucker drinking coffee in the station who can give me a ride
Well, I was thinking about a heading to mobile, alabama
And that was just last saturday night
I can leave you if I wanna, little baby and I'm gonna tonight
Cause I got a bucket full of tears and a hard luck story
There's a bad moon rising behind
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you, but I changed my mind
Well, I'm a fast talking, hell raising, son of a bitch
And I'm a sinner and I know how to fight
Well, I can leave you if I wanna, little baby and I'm gonna tonight
Cause I got a bucket full of tears and a hard luck story
There's a bad moon rising behind
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you, but I changed my mind
Well, I'm a fast talking, hell raising, son of a bitch
And I'm a sinner and I know how to fight
Cause I can leave you if I wanna, little baby and I'm gonna tonight
Well I was sitting, I was drinking on a barstool
Thinking how true love becomes a lie
And I never should have left you
But I had to, and I betcha there's a man there with you tonight
And I swore it to your daddy that I missed you, but I didn't
If I came back it wouldn't be right
Cause I can leave you if I wanna, little baby and I'm gonna tonightEmbed
