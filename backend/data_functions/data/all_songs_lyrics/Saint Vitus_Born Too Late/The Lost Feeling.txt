The Lost Feeling LyricsI live inside you
Depression is my name
I'll crack your world with
Bitter mental games
You try to suppress me
But nothing holds me down
Just when you think you're happy
I come around
I was meant to be
A punishment to you
A thorn in your side
A cancer eating through
I twist reality
And make it hard to bear
I am the only thing left
When love isn't there
I'm taking over
I'll snap your mind in two
I'll make suicide seem
Like the right thing to do
You try to drown me
With alcohol and pills
But in the end you are
The only one that killsEmbed
