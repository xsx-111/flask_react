Clear Windowpane LyricsI see colours everywhere
I have things living in my hair
In the dark, I see lights
My brain is working overtime
On clear windowpane
In my house, all things glow
My walls are a living light show
Purple dragons, smoke with me
I have friends only I can see
On clear windowpane
I can't handle coming down
'Cause I can't take the human crowd
I can't face reality
So I fly back to where I am free
On clear windowpaneEmbed
