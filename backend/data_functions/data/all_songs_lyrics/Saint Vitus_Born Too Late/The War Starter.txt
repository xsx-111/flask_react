The War Starter LyricsI have seen a thousand wars
And I will see a thousand more
I have heard the children cry
And I have seen their bodies fry
You know me, you've seen my face
All around this wretched place
You can call me warrior
But I'm actually the war starter
Long ago in days of old
I gave you clubs then broadswords
Now you use machinery
New toys of war, new toys for me
You've elected one of my
Right-hand men to lead your kind
After war saves your economy
He'll soothe you with artificial peace
Mushroom clouds, atomic fright
Burning winds, your towns ignite
I have taught you very well
How to create your own Hell
Blind mice follow their leaders
No one wins, it's the end of class
Push your button and you 've passedEmbed
