Thirsty And Miserable LyricsThirsty and miserable
You drop to the floor
You drink 'til you can't
See any more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
My brother wants a ride
To the liquor store
You pitty him for what
He wants it for
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
It 's 1: 30 and we 're
Getting nervous
Because the store closes at two
And there 's not enough
To last us all, oh fuck!
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting moreEmbed
