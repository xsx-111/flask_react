Look Behind You LyricsFoggy morning drifting 'round you
Blackened haze
Pounding footsteps right behind you
You can't see past your trembling hand
Every day
Shadows from an empty man
Look behind you
Echoed screaming in your ears
Constantly
Reaching for your loaded gun
Ringing in forbidden fears
Suddenly
Look behind you as you run
Look behind you
Turn the corner, dead-end street, you can't go on
What are you gonna do?
By yourself right from the start
Everything was all dreamed up by you
You live in doubt
Look behind you
Look behind you
Look behind youEmbed
