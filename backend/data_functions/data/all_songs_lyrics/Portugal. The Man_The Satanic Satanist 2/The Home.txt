The Home Lyrics
Do you ever listen for the sounds that your hands make?
Did you know that we could make sounds?

I don't know what the palace knows
But I don't run with sheep, the shepherd can't herd me
My feet never slow with the age that takes me
I'll slip back to the mountains where nobody knows me

I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here

Grow a field of plenty to hold me tight
And keep us warm from the cold that burns me
My feet ever slow with the age that takes me
I'll slip back to the mountains where nobody knows me

I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here
Do you ever listen to the sounds that your head makes?
Did you know that (know that)
We could (we could)
Make sounds?

I don't know what the palace knows
But I don't run with sheep, the shepherd can't herd me
My feet never slow with the age that takes me
I'll slip back to the mountains where nobody knows me
I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here
(I will make my home here)
I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here
(I will make my home here)

I know that I was fine before (Fine before, fine before)
I know that I was fine before (Fine before, fine before)
Know I was fine before (Fine before, fine before)
Know I was fine before (Fine before, fine before)
Know I was fine before (Fine before, fine before)
Know I was fine before (Fine before, fine before)Embed
