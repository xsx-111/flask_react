Let You Down Lyrics
It's a shame that we need everything
Still, everything I see, I need
Just go, please don't go
I, I want all, all, all
That I see, see, see
Just go, please don't go

'Cause I'll only let you down
And I'll only let you down

And watch the world spinnin' 'round
And know that it's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Just go, please don't go

'Cause I'll only let you down
And I'll only let you down

And watch the world, watch the world
Watch the world, watch the world, watch the world

'Cause I'll only let you down
Only let you down, let you downEmbed
