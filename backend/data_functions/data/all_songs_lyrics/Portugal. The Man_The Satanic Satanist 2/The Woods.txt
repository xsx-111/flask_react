The Woods Lyrics
When I lived in the woods
When I lived in the woods
When I lived in the woods
Everything was alright
Everything, everything was alright
Never knew where we are
Never needed to know
Never needed to know, just where we are
Everything was alright
All the people, all the people were living it right

Breathe in time to be where I was
If I need, baby, give me all your love
If we need to find the time
We'll never see all your love

If you find yourself in need
If we got to go then we'll bring along some company
If you find yourself in need
If we got it all then we got just what we need

Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)
Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)
Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)
Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)
Breathe in time to be where I was
If I need, baby, give me all your love
If we need to find the time
We'll never see all your love

When I lived in the woods
When I lived in the woods
When I lived in the woods
Everything was alright
Everything, everybody was alright
Well you gotta get, I gotta make some money
Baby gotta go, baby gotta get busy
All the people were alright, all the people were living it right

Breathe in time to be where I was
If I need, baby, give me all your love
If we need to find the time
We'll never see all your love

Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)
Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)
Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)
Why-y-y-y? (Why-y-y-y?)Embed
