Everyone Is Golden Lyrics
Diamonds shine like stars under the ground
Little rivers run in rings around the town
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean

So we picked up all we had and moved to '93

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden
And nobody will love them, nobody will love them
(Everyone is golden, now, everyone is golden)
(Everyone is golden, now, everyone is golden)

And we took a train into the town
And stuck another needle in the ground
And if we never get another sound and we know

So we picked up all we had and moved to '93

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden
And nobody will love them, nobody will love them
(Everyone is golden, now, everyone is golden)
(Everyone is golden, now, everyone is golden, now)
And I will pick you up
Gathered 'round the school to hear just what they found
But they told us they had tried, still, the little boy had died
We gathered 'round to hear just what they'd done
Yeah, they shine like stars under the ground
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean

So we picked up all we had and moved to '93

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden
Nobody will love them, nobody will love them
Everyone is golden, now, everyone is golden
Everyone is golden, now, everyone is golden

Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you3Embed
