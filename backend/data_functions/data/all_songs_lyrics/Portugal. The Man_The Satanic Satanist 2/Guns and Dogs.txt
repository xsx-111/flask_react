Guns and Dogs Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

We took a trip down in '87
We were looking for a place where we don't fear Heaven
We got, we got some guns, got some dogs
But just like them dogs, well those guns just get bigger
Looking to the town to show us what they got
Take you to the cabin, yea we'll show you what we got
We got space to do just what you please
If you never make it out

And if I never stand on another corner, trying not to be a bother
Let's be, let's be love
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again
Let's be, let's be love
Took a trip down in '87
They were looking for a place where we don't need Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Once you crawl in, you never come back again
Ooh-ooh-ooh
And once you crawl in, you never come back again
And if I never stand on another corner trying hard to be a father
Let's be, let's be love
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again
Let's be, let's be love

Though I never pray God reigns today
Though I never pray God reigns today
Though I never pray God reigns today
Though I never pray God reigns today

If you catch us coming up about around the bend
If we step a little higher will we find it then?
It's got to be something roaming up around the bend

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Once you crawl in, you never come back again
Ooh-ooh-ooh
And once you crawl in, you never come back again

Though I never pray God reigns today
Though I never pray God reigns today
Though I never pray God reigns today-a-a-a-ay1Embed
