Breathe on Me Lyrics
It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air
And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united
Two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Oh, yeah

Oh, this is way beyond the physical (Too way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before (never been before)
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe on me (breathe on me)
Oh baby just, breathe on me (breathe on me)
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (oh)

Monogamy is the way to go (go, go)
Just put your lips together and blow (blow, blow)
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

Breathe on me (oh, oh)
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Breathe on me (breathe on me)
Oh baby just, breathe on me (breathe on me)
We don't need to touch, just
