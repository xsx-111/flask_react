Showdown Lyrics
Sometimes I just love to have that out
Just something a girl's gotta do, oh

Never thought I'd see you like this
You're looking good when you're half dressed
Just let me give you one last test
Is that a sin? (No)
Am I too hot for you though?
Did you check out my video?
There's some things you don't know
Like this

I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Uh, like this

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh
I don't really wanna be a tease
But would you undo my zipper please?
Uh-uh, please don't talk, listen
I'll let you touch me if you want
I see your body rise, rise
And when you come, don't get too hot
Butterfly

I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Uh, like this

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

Forget the tension when we fight
You make it up, turn down the light
It's just a lover's game we play, yeah
After the screaming's at an end
Why don't we do it all again?
That's when the fun really begins
Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Here comes the showdown, oh
Here comes the showdown, oh
What goes around comes around
The crowds are waiting, oh
(Yeah)
Here comes the showdown, oh6Embed
