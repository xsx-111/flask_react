I Got That (Boom Boom) Lyrics
(Shorty)
We goin' to go to the club and get crunk with Britney
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ying Yang, Ya Who? Britney

(Shorty) She think she fine
Fine enough to blow your mind
(Shorty) She think she bad
Get on the floor and shake that ass
(Shorty) She think she fine
Fine enough to blow your mind
(Shorty) She think she bad
Get on the floor and shake that ass

Yeah
This is for all the southern boys out there
(Britney Spears) Check this out

I see you looking my way
And I know that
You have something to say
Watching every inch of my body
Like you wanted to play (So here we go)
Boom, boom, boy, you look so sexy
Boom, boom, boy, you look so sexy
I begin to dance, just a little bit
To turn you on (Yeah, I got that)
I got that boom boom that you want
Watching me all night long
Hurry up before it's gone
I got that boom boom that you want
I don't think you should wait
One minute might be too late

You had caught my eye and
I wanted to get to know you
Don't be shy, I want you to come closer
So what you gonna do? (So here we go)
Boom boom, boy, you look so sexy (So damn sexy)
Boom boom, boy, you look so sexy (Tonight)

I got that boom boom that you want (That you want)
Watching me all night long
Hurry up before it's gone
I got that boom boom (I got that boom boom) that you want
I don't think you should wait
One minute might be too late

(Shorty) She think she fine
Fine enough to blow your mind
(Shorty) She think she bad
Get on the floor and shake that ass
(Shorty) She think she fine
Fine enough to blow your mind
(Shorty) She think she fine
Get on the floor and shake that ass
Twilly-Twilly, what? Twilly Twilly, what?
Twilly-Twilly, shorty get on the floor shake that ass for me
Twilly-Twilly, Twilly-Twilly, Twilly-Twilly
Shorty get on the floor shake that ass for me

She naked, she soakin' wet
Strip tease like an hmm, dripping sweat
She got a little body that I can't forget
I ain't met a young lady that out did her yet
Britney Spears and the Ying Yang Twins
Huh, we done became friends
Might as well let the party begin
If you with it then join on in

(Shorty) She think she fine
Fine enough to blow your mind
(Shorty) She think she bad
Get on the floor and shake that ass
(Shorty) She think she fine
Fine enough to blow your mind
(Shorty) She think she bad
Get on the floor and shake that
I got that boom boom that you want
Watching me all night long
Hurry up before it's gone
I got that boom boom that you want (I got that boom boom)
I don't think you should wait
One minute might be too late
I got that boom boom that you want (yeah)
Watching me all night long
Hurry up before it's gone
I got that boom boom that you want (yeah)
I don't think you should wait
One minute might be too late

Boom boom, boy you look so sexy (Damn, you look so sexy)
Boom boom, boy you look so sexy (What you doing to me?)
Boom boom, boy you look so sexy (Damn, you're turning me on)
Boom boom, boy you look so sexy
