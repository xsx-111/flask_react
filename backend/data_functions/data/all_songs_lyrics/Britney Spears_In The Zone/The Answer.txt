The Answer Lyrics
Yeah, I've been waitin' for you
So patiently
And now you're here
You're my answer
Thank you
Yeah
I think you're my answer
Uh, here I go
Let's go

You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning inside)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer

Patiently, I've waited for this day to finally come
Knowing someday somehow I would find that special one
Someone perfect, someone true
Someone that, I knew, was you
(I knew it was you)
Talk to me

Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night?
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right?
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied?
Who's the one I need in my life?
Let's go

You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're the answer, baby)
You're my answer

I can hardly speak because I'm underneath your spell
Saving every moment that I have you to myself
Putting my love to the test
Because baby, this is destiny (Yeah, this is destiny)
Talk to 'em
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night?
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right?
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied?
You're the one I need in my life
Let's go

You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (yeah, I've been yearning)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love (when they ask me)
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer (you're my answer)
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning for you)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (burning, burning)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer
Talk to me
Tell me
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night? (who can hold me?)
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right? (wipe my tears away) (it's you)
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied? (who can give me love?)
Who's the one I need in my life?
(You're my answer)
Let's go

You're the answer (You're the answer)
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (that's been burning)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're the answer baby)
You're my answer
You're the answer (You're my answer)
