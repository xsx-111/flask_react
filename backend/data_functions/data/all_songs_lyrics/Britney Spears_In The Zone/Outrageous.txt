Outrageous Lyrics
Outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl
Outrageous

Sexy as I wanna be
Got these fellas chasing me
It's 'bout time I hit the streets
All my girls still feeling me
B-girl ain't lost the beat
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Got to keep going, no stopping me
And if you don't like it, then (La, la-la-la, la-la-la)

Coming through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show
It's outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl
Outrageous

I'm about to bring the heat

I'm about to give you the (La, la-la-la, la-la-la)

Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl
Outrageous

I just wanna be happy
In a place where love is free
Can you take me there?
Somebody, ooh
And when you mention my name
Make sure you know the truth, yeah
Until I vow to keep it forever

Outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
