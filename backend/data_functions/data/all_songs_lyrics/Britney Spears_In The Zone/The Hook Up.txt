The Hook Up Lyrics
It's a dance thing, blow!
Boys and girls, come sit on the right pon di dance wit dem
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He was looking, said he wanna hook up
But she don't wanna hook up, told him: "Just go"
And then she looked and said she wanna hook up
I really wanna hook up, told him: "Let's go"

Baby, I can't believe everything your body make me wanna do
And the way that you move on the floor
Now I think I'm in love with you (In love with you)
Grab my waist
Wanna get with the rhythm and that move you do, do
Switch my hips on the floor
Baby, slow to keep up with you

Back it up, now
Bump you rump, now
Grab my waist, now
Work it out, now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, now
Take it lower
To the floor, now
Hook up, baby, we can drop a little something
Ride it, baby, we can do a little something
Take out, baby, wanna get a little something
You know, baby, let's hook up a little something

Baby, I can't believe everything that I feel when I dance with you
(Dance with you)
From the small of my back to the breath on my neck
To the move you do
Put your body, gotta get my body up right next to you
Move the party, gotta rock the party until they're over you

Back it up, now
Bump you rump, now
Grab my waist, now
Work it out, now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, now
Take it lower
To the floor, now
Back it up, now
Bump you rump, now
Grab my waist, now
Work it out, now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, now
Take it lower
To the floor, now
Boy, I can't explain what you do to me
My whole world has changed, I live in a fantasy
Tonight, I'm in the mood
Please take me by your hand
I wanna get in your groove
So, baby, take me there

Yo, everybody get up now!
If y'all sit down
Me wan' see ya pon the dance floor a move now
Yo, everybody down!

The bodies keep shaking
My body keeps shaking
Better get your butt out here, baby
Come on, let's go
So do how you do it
Bend over, get to it
Back down to the ground
Pick it up, let's go
Pick it up, let's go
The bodies keep shaking
My body keeps shaking
Better get your butt out here, baby
Come on, let's go
So do how you do it
Bend over, get to it
Back down to the ground
Pick it up, let's go
Pick it up, let's go
Don't stop, just get, get on the floor
Butt drops, hips pop, popping for sure
Who's got, got it? Get it some more
One time, two time, three time we go

Back it up, now
Bump your rump, now
Grab my waist, now
Work it out, now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, now
Take it lower
To the floor, now
Back it up, now
Bump your rump, now
Grab my waist, now
Work it out, now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, now
Take it lower
To the floor, now

Hook up, baby, we can drop a little something
Ride it, baby, we can do a little something
Take out, baby, wanna get a little something
You know, baby, let's hook up a little something

Back it up, now
Bump your rump, now
Grab my waist, now
Work it out, now
Grab my shoulder
Pick it up, now
Take it lower
To the floor, now
Back it up, now
Bump your rump, now
Grab my waist, now
Work it out, now4Embed
