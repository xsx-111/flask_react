Brave New Girl Lyrics
She's gonna pack her bags, she's gonna find her way
She's gonna get right out of this
She don't want New York, she don't want L.A
She's gonna find her special kiss
She don't want no sleep, she don't want no high
Oh, like peaches and cream
She's gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
Ah, you know what I mean?

She wants the good life, no need to rewind
She needs to really, really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
So, she met this man, he was kind of rough
He said, "Girl, what you looking for?"
She said, "I don't know, I go with the flow"
He said, "Let's get on the floor"
He said, "You look real cute with your low ride jeans and your pink little baby tee"
"Let's get a room, girl, come and ride with me"

She wants the good life, no need to rewind
She needs to really, really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
I just keep on running
I just keep on running
Who knew she could feel so alive?
(Shining star)

She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight6Embed
