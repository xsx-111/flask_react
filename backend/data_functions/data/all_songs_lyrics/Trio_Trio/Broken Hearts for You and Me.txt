Broken Hearts for You and Me LyricsEs ist Zeit für etwas Flottes
Stimmung, gute Laune!
Die Damen in den Innenkreis!
Die Herren in den Außenkreis!
In Gegenrichtung, Marsch, Fox!
And the monkey wrapped his tail around the flagpole
To show his asshole
To the one, two, three
Broken hearts for you and me
I guess we agree
The party's over now, it's plain to see
Broken hearts for you and me
Why should we stay?
You know it's better if we go our own ways
Broken hearts for you and me
We tried our best
Too little future, though, and too much past
Broken hearts for you and me
Don't you cry
Kiss me good-bye
Broken hearts for you and me
We made so many mistakes
We know it better now, but it's too late
Broken hearts for you and me
Why should we stay?
You know it's better if we go our own ways
Broken hearts for you and me
Don't you cry yi-yi-yi
Just kiss me goodbye yi-yi-yi
You know why yi-yi-yi there are
Broken hearts for you and me
Don't you cry yi-yi-yi
Just kiss me goodbye yi-yi-yi
You know why yi-yi-yi
So don't you cry yi-yi-yi
So don't you cry yi-yi-yi
Bye, bye, bye, bye yi-yi-yi
Bye, bye, bye, bye yi-yi-yi
Don't cry yi-yi-yi yi-yi-yi yi-yi-yi-yi-yi
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi
You know why yi-yi-yi
You know why yi-yi-yi there are
