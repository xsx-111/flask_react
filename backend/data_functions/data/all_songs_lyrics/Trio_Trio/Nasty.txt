Nasty LyricsNasty is the feeling, nasty is the feeling
Nasty is the feeling for you
Crazy how I loved you, crazy how I loved you
Crazy how I fell for you
Dirty when I hear ya, dirty when I see ya
Dirty when I feel you close to me
Hurtin's gonna come up, hurtin's gonna come up
Hurtin's gonna come up, you see
Evil's gonna turn out, evil's gonna turn out
Evil's gonna burn out my heart
Feelings that are old, feelings that are cold
Feelings that are broken apart
Evil's gonna turn out, evil's gonna turn out
Evil's gonna burn out my heart
Feelings that are old, feelings that are cold
Feelings that are broken apart
Nothing's gonna help, nothing's gonna help, help
Nothing's gonna help us from here
Fussin' and fightin', fussin' and fightin'
Fussin' and fightin' is near
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
Dirty when I hear ya, dirty when I see ya
Dirty when I feel you close to me
Hurtin's gonna come up, hurtin's gonna come up
Hurtin's gonna come up, you see
Nothing's gonna help, nothing's gonna help
Nothing's gonna help us from here
Fussin' and fightin', fussin' and fightin'
Fussin' and fightin' is near
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
(ich liebe dich nicht mehr)
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
(ich will dich nicht mehr)
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
(ich brauche dich nicht mehr)
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
I can't go on with this feeling bout you
