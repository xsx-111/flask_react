Sunday You Need Love, Monday Be Alone LyricsYou see her dancing out on the floor
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
You wanna, wanna, wanna have her like before
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
But you gonna use her, shape her for your needs
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
You gonna make promises you never, never keep
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
You gonna leave her out on her own
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
'Cause sunday you need love, love, monday be alone
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Hey you, you, you, you
Tender young lady
Wonder where you go, where you sleep tonight
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Hey you everlovin' woman
Beware you don't pass the borderlines of light, again tonight
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
You gonna use her, use her, shape her for your needs
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
You gonna make promises you never, never keep
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
You gonna leave her out on her own
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
'Cause sometimes you want her, want her, then again you don't
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Sunday you need love, love, Monday be alone, lone
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Hey you, you, you, you
Tender young lady
Wonder where you go, where you sleep tonight
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Hey you everlovin' woman
Beware you don't pass the borderlines of light, again tonight
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Better find someone else to treat you well
Better find a good man to give you some respect
You gonna use her, use her, shape her for your needs
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
You gonna make promises you never, never keep
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
'Cause sometimes you want her, sometimes you don't
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
'Cause sometimes you want her, want her, then again you don't, don't
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Sunday you need love, love, monday be alone
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Su-su-su-sunday you need love, love, monday be alone, lone
Sunday you need love, Monday be alone
Hey you, you, you, you
Tender young lady
Wonder where you go, where you sleep tonight
Sunday you need love, Monday be aloneEmbed
