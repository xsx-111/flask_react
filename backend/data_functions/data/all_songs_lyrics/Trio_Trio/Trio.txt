Trio LyricsSo we've come
To the end of our line
And I know you're thinking of me
You're staring as you cry
And the staring leaves me wanting
All I have left is what's in my mind
Of the the day we said goodbye
Though we never said goodbye
And I'll find myself dreaming of the day
I'll see you're smile again
And we'll leave this broken glass behind
'Cause I woke to find
Life was not a nightmare in my sleep
And the stare will come over me
And the stare will come over me
No one's there to tell me
Everything will be alright
No one's threreEmbed
