Lady-O-Lady LyricsOne two three
Lady-O-Lady, don't go
You ain't gonna leave me now, no no
Lady-O-Lady, please stay
We oughta be together now. Let's play
Yesss
Lady-O-Lady, don't go
The things that you do to me o-o-o
Lady-O-Lady. Your touch
The way that you're holdin me - too much
You don't know how much I want you now
Lady stay and let me show you how
The night is young. Tomorrow is another day
So far away
Lady-O-Lady don't go
You ain't gonna leave me now, no no
Lady-O-Lady your touch
The way that you're holdin me - too much
Lady stay a little longer now
Feel my love a little stronger now
The night is young. Tomorrow is another day
So far away, so far away
Yes, Lady, yes yes yes
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
Lady-O-Lady, don't go
Um Himmels Willen, du kannst doch jetzt nich' geh'n
Lady-O-Lady don't go
Ich bin am Kommen, da willst du geh'n
Lady-O-Lady don't go
Zehn Minuten noch, bitte!Embed
