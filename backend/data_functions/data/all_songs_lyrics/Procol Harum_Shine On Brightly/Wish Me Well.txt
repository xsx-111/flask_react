Wish Me Well LyricsYou know I caught a glimpse, thought I understood
But I left it all far behind
Now if I'd known then what I know now
Do you think I would've been so blind?
Gonna take myself down to a wishing well
I'm gonna make myself one last wish
And if you follow me there, better bring what you've found
'Cause my night has come and I'm going down
Gonna buy myself a big rockin' chair
And when I'm sittin' in that, then no one will peek
And if my friends will come, they'll see what I'm suffering from
I wish, I wish, I could rock myself to sleep
Gonna take myself down to a wishing well
Gonna make myself one last wish
If you follow me there, better bring what you've found
'Cause my night has come and I'm going down
