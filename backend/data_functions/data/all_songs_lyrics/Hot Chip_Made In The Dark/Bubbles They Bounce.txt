Bubbles They Bounce Lyrics
Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip
Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip
Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip
Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip, Hot Chip

No more, no more
No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks
No more, no more
No more the moon shines; sorry, Prince
No more, no more
No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks
No more, no more
No more the moon shines; sorry, Prince

Get to know, but take it serious like Jane does
Bounce because, bounce with love
Read your mind and give a second look
A listen won't leave you second guessing, we can make it up

Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
I like the sound of bubbles popping
Our tongues swapping, our tongues swapping
I like the sound of bubbles popping
Our tongues swapping, our tongues swapping

An elephant in the room
The bells ring out of tune
The whistle isn't near
The mouth movements are clear
The finger's out of joy
Depressing to a point
The sadness of your voice
Accepting you're no more

My eyes are laughing with you
My hands are feeling love
My ears are ringing with a joyful sound
My heart is racing forwards
My toes are dancing too
My body is not dying, it's celebrating you
(Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they bounce)
The only boy I ever loved was
The only boy I ever loved was you, you, you
The only boy I ever loved was
The only boy I ever loved was you, you, you

No more, no more
No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks
No more, no more
No more the moon shines; sorry, Prince

Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they bounce, bubbles they bounce
Bubbles they, bubbles they, bubbles they bounce

I like the sound of bubbles popping
Our tongues swapping, our tongues swapping
I like the sound of bubbles popping
Our tongues swapping, our tongues swapping
Hey, oh, hey, oh
Hey, oh, hey, oh
Hey, oh, hey, oh
Hey, oh, hey, oh

No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)
No more moonshine; the moon shines, sorry, Prince
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)
More kicks than rests, more effects than bass
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)
No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)
No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)
No more moonshine; the moon shines, sorry, Prince
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)
More kicks than rests, more effects than bass
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)
No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks
(Hey, oh, hey, oh)

I told you bubbles they bounce, I told you bubbles they bounce
(No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks)
I told you bubbles they bounce, they bounce, they bounce
(No more moonshine; the moon shines, sorry, Prince)
I told you bubbles they bounce, I told you bubbles they bounce
(More kicks than rests, more effects than bass)
I told you bubbles they bounce, they bounce, they bounce
(No more horror flicks, no more horror flicks)Embed
