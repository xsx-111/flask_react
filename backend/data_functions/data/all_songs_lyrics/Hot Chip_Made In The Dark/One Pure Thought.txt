One Pure Thought Lyrics
What is it I don't remember? Made my being so much better
If I could have just one pure thought
What is it I don't remember? Made my being so much better
If I could have just one pure thought

I won't be on my way, I won't be on my way
(There is nothing greater)
I won't be on my way, I will help you on your way
I won't be on my way, I won't be on my way
(There is nothing greater)
I will help you on your way, there is nothing more to say

So, far as we've seen, we've been the mightiest team
To bear arms since Nile Rodgers was denied entry
And although the Macarena has entirely been
I believe you will appreciate the rest of this dream
I got so lost and I'm feeling like I'm following thread
I was the child in the forest with the bones and the bread
I was a train at the point where the rail road ends
Trying to roam across sand with only steam in my hands
It was a trip that I wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip I that I thought would never end
It was a trip that I wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip I that I thought would never end
What is it I don't remember? Made my being so much better
If I could have just one pure thought
What is it I don't remember? Made my being so much better
If I could have just one pure thought
What is it I can't remember? Made my being so much better
If I could have just one pure thought

I won't be on my way, I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way, I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way, I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way, I'll help you on your way
I won't be on my way, I won't be on my way
(There is nothing greater)
I won't be on my way, I will help you on your way
I won't be on my way, I won't be on my way
(There is nothing greater)
I'll help you on your way, there is nothing more to sayEmbed
