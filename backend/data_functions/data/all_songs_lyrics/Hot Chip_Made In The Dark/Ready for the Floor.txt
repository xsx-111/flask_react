Ready for the Floor Lyrics
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now

Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
We are ready, we are ready for the floor

I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
I'm hoping with chance you might take this dance
I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
You're sinking below, I'm using my force
I'm hoping with chance you might take this dance
You're my number one guy

Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
We are ready, we are ready for the floor
I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
You're sinking below, I'm using my force
I'm hoping with chance you might take this dance
You're my number one guy, number one guy
Number, number, number, number, number
One, one, one, one, one guy

(Number one guy) Instead of carving up the wall
(One, one guy) Why don't you open up with talk?
(Number, number, number one) I am ready, I am ready for a fall
(Number one, number one) Instead of carving up the wall
(Number one, one, one) Why don't you open up with talk?
(Guy, guy) We are ready, we are ready for the floor
(Number one guy) Instead of carving up the wall
(Number, number one, one) Why don't you open up with talk?
(Guy) I am ready, I am ready for a fall
You're my number one guy
(Number one) Instead of carving up the wall
(Number, number one, one) Why don't you open up with talk?
(Number, number one, one) We are ready, we are ready for the floor1Embed
