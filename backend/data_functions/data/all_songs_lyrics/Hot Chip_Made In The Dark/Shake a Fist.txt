Shake a Fist Lyrics
I'm ready to try this
There's so much to see here
I could be wealthy
With nothing to stop me
I'm ready to try this (I move underwater)
There's so much to see here (I eat what I slaughter)
I could be wealthy (Inside a moon and palace)
With nothing to stop me (Let's raise another chalice)

Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without

You said if I tried this (I'd be teleported)
But when you first tried this (Your body contorted)
And if this is heaven (I might have to tell you)
I'm gonna give hell just (A quick once over)
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without

Before we go any further
I'd like to show you all a game I made up
This game's called 'Sounds of the Studio'
And it can be played with any record
Including this one, you may be surprised
Now if you have a pair of headphones
You better get 'em out and get 'em cranked up
'Cause they're really gonna help you

That's a pure solution
That's my magic potion
That's the incantation
That's a pure solution
That's my magic potion
That's the incantation
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without
Out and out and out, out and out and out
Shake a fist and let's breathe within, without

You said if I tried this (I'd be teleported)
But when you first tried this (Your body contorted)
And if this is heaven (I might have to tell you)
I'm gonna give hell just (A quick once over)
I'm ready to try this (I move underwater)
There's so much to see here (I eat what I slaughter)
I could be wealthy (Inside a moon and palace)
With nothing to stop me (Let's raise another chalice)Embed
