My Brother Is Watching Me Lyrics
My eyes fill up with tears
My arms shake
My brother is watching me
A baby is in my arms
We climb the stairs
My brother is watching me
Wash my hands
Shave my head
I won't be leaving soon
You feel so warm
You feel so warm
No, I won't be leaving soon

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
