Wrestlers Lyrics
It's me versus you in love, it's me versus you in love
It's me versus you in love, it's me versus you in love
It's me versus you in love, we'll tag team, double up
Hit you in the sweet spot and make you wish you'd buffed up
The gloves are off, the gloves are off

'Cause we've been messing around
Breaking us a man down
But while you've got us on the ropes
We plan to play the mess around
He's technically trained
You've got him buckled up and he will misbehave
You're way bigger and trained
But I've got the power and the glory in my burly brains
The gloves are off, the gloves are off

So why's he going to have to fight dirty?
Don't fight dirty, don't hit me with the chair
The gloves are off
So why's he going to have to fight dirty?
Don't fight dirty, don't bite me in the face
The gloves are off
Now what ya gonna do when I come for you
With all that I've got?
I've got a roll of coins
I'm aiming for your loins and I will never stop

I learned all I know from watching the wrestling
I think you think I'm about to throw the towel in

Here comes Four Jack
Watch your back, watch your back
He'll charm you with the double axe
And then he brings the tyre tacks
He's not dressed for a cage
He's robed in garments strictly for another age
Here we come, drop kick, half nelson, full nelson
Willie Nelson, Willie Nelson

Body slam, suplex, head lock, Summer Slam
Elbow drop, belly flop, cage match, grudge match
Body slam, suplex, head lock, Summer Slam
Elbow drop, belly flop, cage match, grudge match
It's me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus
Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus

I learned all I know from watching the wrestling
(Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus
Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus
Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus
Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus)
I think you think I'm about to throw the towel in
(Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus
Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus
Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus
Me versus, me versus, me versus, me versus)
Everyone knows Monday night means wrestlingEmbed
