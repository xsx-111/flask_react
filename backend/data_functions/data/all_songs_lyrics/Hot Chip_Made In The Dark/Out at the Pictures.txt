Out at the Pictures Lyrics
It's on every street, it's fucking cheap
Sometimes you find you're in your mind
Are you at the pictures
Or out at sea?
It's better this way
Trust you, believe me

Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(There's a whole world in there)
Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(Just don't stop and stare)
Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(You will find gel there)
Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(There's a hole in the world there)

We like it for what we just got
It's better still, it's something hot
Out at the pictures
I cannot see
It's better this way
Trust you, believe me
Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(There's a whole world in there)
Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(Just don't stop and stare)
Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(You will find gel there)
Whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the, whe-the
Weather, weather, weather, weather
(There's a hole in the world there)Embed
