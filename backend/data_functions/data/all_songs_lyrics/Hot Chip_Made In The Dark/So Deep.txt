So Deep Lyrics
You know when you told me that it was going down
I didn't believe you, but I do now
And everything that you said came true
Believe me when I say that I'm in too

Deep, so deep
She kissed me twice and I could not sleep
Deep, so deep
Forget everything I said last week

She kissed me once, twice, I need some advice
'Cause I never tasted anything quite so nice
Let me tell you, I got so ill
I had to go to the chemist for a sleeping pill, 'cause I'm in

Deep, so deep
She kissed me twice and I could not sleep
Deep, so deep
Forget everything I said last week

You know I got to, got to, got to, got to
Get her, get her, get her
I got to, got to, got to, got to
Send her a letter
I got to, got to, got to, got to
Get her, get her, get her
I got to, got to, got to, got to
Send her a letter
Deep, so deep
She kissed me twice and I could not sleep
Deep, so deep
Forget everything I said last week
Deep, so deep
She kissed me twice and I could not sleep
Deep, so deep
Forget everything I said last weekEmbed
