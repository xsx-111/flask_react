Hold On Lyrics
My only weapon was my pen
But I traded it for my hand
Not a smart move, but my move
Does this say I'm a man?
My only lesson was in my brains
But I traded them for my hand
Not a smart move, a repeat move
Does this put pay to our plan?

Hey, hey
You'll never get to heaven if you don't give back
So give back a little twist
If you wanna a lend a hand
Wait, wait
Don't leave before I'm finished
If you do then that's rude
You may learn a little bit about those things you do

I'm only going to heaven if it feels like hell
I'm only going to heaven if it tastes like caramel
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Sir, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside
Sir, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside

My only weapon was my pen
But I traded it for my hand
Not a smart move, but my move
Does this say I'm a man?
My only lesson was in my brains
But I traded them for my hand
Not a smart move, a repeat move
Does this put pay to our plan?

Hey, hey
You'll never get to heaven if you don't give back
So give back a little twist
If you wanna a lend a hand
Wait, wait
Don't leave before I'm finished
If you do then that's rude
You may learn a little bit about those things you do

I'm only going to heaven if it feels like hell
I'm only going to heaven if it tastes like caramel
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Sir, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside
Sir, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside
Sir, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside
Sir, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside
Girl, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside
Girl, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside
Girl, I've a good mind to take you outside, outside, outside


I'm only going to heaven if it feels like hell
I'm only going to heaven if it tastes like caramelEmbed
