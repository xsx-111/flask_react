Bendable Poseable Lyrics
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable

There are holes in what we knew
There is a hole between me and you
There is an error within our phrase
Then it takes and not erased

Watch what you say
I will not bend in every way
My backbone is grey stone
I'm soft foam, I'm yellow clay
Watch what you say as time ticks, ticks away
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, time delay
Time delay, time delay
Time delay, bend away

I look, I look, I look, I look
I look, I look, I look, I look
I look, I look, I look, I look
I look, I look, I look, I look
There's the rubber, the square rubber ring
If you are new, then dance your way in
It's time to leave your weapon behind
Broken weapons are all we find
My hands, in my hands
In my hands, in my hands
My hands, in my hands
In my hands, in my hands
My hands, in my hands
In my hands, in my hands
They don't make magic mule every day
They don't make magic mule every day

I wanna knee slide, up and down
I wanna knee slide, up and down
You're gonna see my, see my thigh
See my beautiful thigh
'Til my jeans don't work no more
My jeans don't work no more
I'm all on the floor
I'm all on the floor
I wanna knee slide, up and down
I wanna knee slide, up and down
You're gonna see my, see my thigh
See my beautiful thigh
'Til my jeans don't work no more
My jeans don't work no more
I'm all on the floor
I'm all on the floor
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseable
Bendable, poseableEmbed
