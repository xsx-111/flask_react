Touch Too Much Lyrics
When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again

I lift my head and it falls again
I take a step and I fall, I never asked for much
Watch my hand in a shaking love
And it is always thus, I never asked for much

When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again

If I said, "Enough's enough", you'd know
I'd call on your brother, he would show
It'd be on his face, I would not stare
But beyond our best attempts we'd care

It was a really long time ago when you were a friend of mine
And I would really like you to know, it would help to ease my mind
I would hold you up again if you ask me
I would hold you up again if you ask me
I would hold you up again if you ask me
I would hold you up again if you ask me
When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home againEmbed
