Happiness And The Fish LyricsI confess
Everyone is overweight
And I'm obsessed
Talking is just masturbating
Without the mess
Addiction leaves you sad today
& unimpressed
I can't remember all the names because
Everyone you meet today
Is just so fucking vain
Bored again by happiness
All those friends I've (die) lost in there
I'm upset
Happiness is not a fish
That you can catch
Imagination can't resist
This laziness
That pins you down get on your knees
Everyone you meet today
Is feeling useless and ashamedEmbed
