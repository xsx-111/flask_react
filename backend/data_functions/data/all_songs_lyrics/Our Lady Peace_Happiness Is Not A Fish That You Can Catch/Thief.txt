Thief LyricsI don't wanna understand this horror
There's a weight in your eyes
I can't admit
Everybody ends up here
In bottles
But the name tag's the last thing you wanted
As the world explodes
We fall out of it
And we can't let go
Because this will not go away
There's a house built out in space...
Chorus:
I can't see that thief that lives inside of your head
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed
And I don't know what's happening
And I can't pretend
But I can be your...
Be your...
Someone help us understand
Who ordered
This disgusting arrangement of time and the end
I don't wanna hear who walked on water
'Cause the hallways are empty and
Clocks tick
As the world implodes
We fall into it
And we can't go home
Because this will not go away
There's a house built out in space...
Chorus
It's a long long getaway
It's a long long getaway
Make it home again
Make it home again
It's a long long getaway
It's a long long getaway
Chorus
It's a long long getaway...Embed
