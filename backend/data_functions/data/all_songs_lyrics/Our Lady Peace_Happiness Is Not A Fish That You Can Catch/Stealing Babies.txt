Stealing Babies LyricsI'm teething on the answers you're saving
How you gonna to make me understand?
Well I'm dreaming while
You're stealing babies
How are you going to help me sleep again
How should I say "I'm so sorry!"
How should I pray to know that we're alive?
Eve stands alone
By the knock on the door
By the thin in her bones
She's courageous and loving
Exhausted and cold
She's not ready to go
But the ghost on the phone
Helps her safely into her dream
You're leaving pieces of family
How you gonna help them understand?
Well I'm screaming while
You're stealing babies
Why do you wanna knock us down again?
Why?
How should I say "I'm so sorry!"
How should we pray
To make us feel alive?
Eve stands alone
By the knock
On the door
By the thin in her bones
She's courageous and loving
Exhausted and cold
She's not ready to go
So the ghost on the phone
Helps her safely into her dream
It must be our egos
It must be my lack
I pray that it might not come back
It must be our egos
It must be my lack
I pray that it might not come back
I've been weighed down again
I'm weighed down again
I've been weighed down again
I'm weighed down...
Weighed down...
Weighed down...
Down...
Down...
Down...Embed
