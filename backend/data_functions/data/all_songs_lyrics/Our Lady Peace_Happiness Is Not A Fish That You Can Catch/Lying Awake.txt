Lying Awake LyricsI'm here to wear you out
I'm here to watch you hide
Nothing to figure out
I'm here to watch you die
Running away from the breast of
Your busy giant healing machine
Nobody left in line
No-one to make you shine
Running away from the backs of opinions
You've borrowed and betrayed
Lying awake
Don't ask why you should pay for this
You mother
Another
A shameless abusing
But this time we're saving you
I'm here to break you down
I'm here to bury time
Nothing to talk about
Nothing to change my mind
Running away from the breast of
Your busy giant healing machine
Lying awake
Don't ask why you should pay for this
You mother
Another
A shameless abusing
But this time we're saving you
-Instrumental-
Lying awake
Don't ask why you should pay for this
You mother
Another
A shameless abusing
But this time we're saving you
Lying awake
Don't ask why you should pay for this
You mother
Another
A shameless abusing
But this time we're saving youEmbed
