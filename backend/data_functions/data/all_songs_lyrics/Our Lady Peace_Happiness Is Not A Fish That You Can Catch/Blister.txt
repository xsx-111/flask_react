Blister LyricsLately I can't breathe
Waiting they're chasing me
No one listens but I'm okay with it
Only I wonder why
If only my hands weren't tied
The world's a blister
But I'm okay with it
(Don't touch me)
What if I was there
What if I was scared
I'm waiting for...
They're at my door
But I'll be back again
Lonely, wandering
Patrolling for enemies
No one listens but I'm okay with it
(Don't trust me)
What if I was there
What if I was scared
I'm waiting for...
They're at my door
But I'll be back again
And I'll be back again
You wonder why, I don't know
You shout at me "Let me go!"
You wonder why, I don't know
You shout at me "Let me go!"
What if I was there
(Don't touch me)
What if I was scared
(Don't trust me)
I'm waiting for...
They're at my door
But I'll be back again
What if I was there
(Don't touch me)
What if I was scared
(Don't trust me)
I'm waiting for...
They're at my door
But I'll be back again
I'm waiting for...
They're at my doorEmbed
