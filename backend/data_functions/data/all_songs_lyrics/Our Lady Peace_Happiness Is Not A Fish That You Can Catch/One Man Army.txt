One Man Army LyricsTake these plastic people
Read their lips, now let it linger
Is there anything that makes them sound sincere?
Come on, tightly hold your hand
Take a deep breath
Give them the finger
Are you worried that your thoughts are not quite clear?
Twitch
Overlooked, unfit appearance
I remember falling
I remember marching
Like a one man army
Through the blaze
I remember coughing
I believe in something
I don't want to remember falling
For their lies
Unbutton your clothes
Undress your soul
Show them your vigor
Are those inhibitions easiest to fear?
Come on, take this gasoline tin
Head up high, walk like a winner
Let the bare feet be the last sounds that they hear
Twitch
Overlooked, unfit appearance
I remember falling
I remember marching
Like a one man army
Through the blaze
I know I'm coughing
I believe in something
I don't wanna remember falling
For your lies
Falling
I remember falling
I remember marching
Like a one man army
Through the blaze
I know I'm coughing
I believe in something
I don't wanna remember falling
I remember crawling
By the way I know I'm falling
I remember marching
I don't wanna remember falling
I don't wanna remember falling
For your liesEmbed
