Consequence Of Laughing LyricsTake all your pills and divide them
By color and size
And take all your problems and advise them
That everything's fine
Since you ran away you've been beating
Your habits to death
And if you were to stay would you feed them
This white happiness?
Nobody wants to harm you
When you're outside
But it's hard to believe
When everyone's killing time
But somebody knows
That you're just not laughing
You're not laughing
Take all your pills and divide them
By number and might
And take all your problems, chastise them
Everything's nice
Since you ran away you've been beating
Those ladders instead
And if you were to stay would you feed them
With violence and...
Nobody wants to harm you
When you're outside
But it's hard to believe
When everyone's killing time
But somebody knows
That you're just not laughing
You're not laughing
Nobody wants to harm you
When you're outside
But it's hard to believe
When everyone's killing time
But somebody knows
That you're just not laughing
You're not laughing
You're not laughing
You're not laughingEmbed
