Is Anybody Home LyricsGoodbye the future's sold out
There's no use screaming
Who thought we'd ever get this far?
Oooo
Tonight your faith has come down to money and a tv
Psychics who've never been to mars and nazi breast feeding
I know you must be upset
I can't find meaning
Im sorry, we're sorry
We're all scared, all scared
Hey, is anybody home?
Has anybody wasted tears on loneliness that everyone...
Oooo
Goodnight, the truth has come out
That everyone's needy
White teeth, a ticket to meet God
And be all that you envy
Shotgun under your bed has
Started breathing
You shot it, you shot it
I'm bare, I'm bare
Hey, is anybody home?
Is anybody wasting tears on loneliness that everyone becomes?
Is anybody low?
Is anybody painting fear on bedroom walls that save us from???
Is anybody home?
Is anybody wasting tears on loneliness that everyone becomes
When they're not alright
Hey, is anybody home?
Has anybody wasted tears on loneliness that everyone becomes?
Is anybody low?
Has anybody painted fear on the bedroom walls that everyone becomes
Becomes, becomes, becomes, becomes, becomes
The loneliness that everyone becomes1Embed
