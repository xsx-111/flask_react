Born to Move LyricsEvery day I'm going to strut that stuff
When the music's loud I can't get enough
Singing hi, singing hi
Come on feet, Teach yourself to move
People shuffling up and down again
Unhappy faces ain't going to get you in
Singing hi, singing hi
Come on people, Teach yourself to move
Hey, hey! Hey, all right!

Spread the news, we're going to have some fun
Let it go, moving son-of-a-gun
Singing hi, singing hi
Come on feet, We was born to move
Hey, hey, Lord! Come on, move it, now boy!
