Chameleon Lyrics
You took me running up a wrong way street
When we got there, you said, "Can't you read?"
I must be blind, but now and then I see
Another number where mine used to be

You keep on changing your face like a chameleon
You keep on changing your face like a chameleon

I say what's up, and then you say it's down
I see triangles, and you say it's round, round, round
Saw an empty glass; you said it's full
Lord, it's so hot, then you come on cool, cool

You keep on changing your face like a chameleon
You keep on changing your face like a chameleon
You keep on changing your face like a chameleon
You keep on changing your face like a chameleonEmbed
