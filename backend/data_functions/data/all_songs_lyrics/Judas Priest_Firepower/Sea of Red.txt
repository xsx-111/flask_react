Sea of Red Lyrics
Now look and listen as you walk around
And you'll hear voices on the wind
Those lonely whispers from this hallowed ground
Just take your time as they begin

As the sun goes down
The silence is profound
For they gave so much
So we might go on and live
Laying peaceful they forgive

In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head

In fields of wonder where those swallows soar
Our hearts are weary as we pray
The grass is greener from the tears that fall
For you on this remembrance day
Your message has been heard
Words of wisdom have been shared
Their despair won't matter as they rise above
There is no end to love

In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
Sea of red

From this earth take wing
Shine down from the sky
We see you as you fly

In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
Sea of red
On the sea of red
Where the glory has no end
There's a place for us
As our lives begin again
Bow your head
Sea of redEmbed
