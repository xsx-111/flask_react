Lone Wolf LyricsHey, I am the voice of your anger
Hey, I am the voice of your pain
Hey, I crave the feeling of danger
Hey, I am the one with no name
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
They don't know the way that I'm feeling
They don't know the depth of my rage
I am like the wolf that is prowling
Hey, I won't be found in a cage
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Lone wolf is there to guide me
From death to life againEmbed
