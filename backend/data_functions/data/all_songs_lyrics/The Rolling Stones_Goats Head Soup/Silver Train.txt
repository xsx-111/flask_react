Silver Train Lyrics
Silver train is a-coming
Think I'm going to get on now, oh, yeah
Silver train is a-coming
Think I want to get on now, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Silver rain is a-falling
Fallin' up around my house, oh, yeah
Silver rain is a-falling
Fallin' up around my house, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure love the way
That she laughed and took my money
And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and called me honey

Silver rain is a-falling
Falling up around my house, oh, yeah
Silver bells is a-ringing
Ringing all around my house, ding-dong, oh, yeah
And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and took my money
And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and called me honey


I'm going home on a south-bound train
With a song in my mouth
I'm going home on a south bound train
With a song in my mouth

Silver train is a-runnin'
Think I'm gonna get on now, oh, yeah
Silver train is a-comin'
Think I'm gonna get on now, oh, yeah

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and took my money
And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and called me honey
Silver train is a-comin'
Think I'm gonna get on now, oh, yeah
Silver train is a-comin'
Think I'm gonna get on board, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeahEmbed
