Winter Lyrics
And it sure been a cold, cold winter
And the wind ainâ€™t been blowing from the south
It's sure been a cold, cold winter
And the light of love is all burned out

It sure been a hard, hard winter
My feet been dragging across the ground
And I hope it's going to be a long, hot summer
And the light of love will be burning bright

And I wish I been out in California
When the lights on all the Christmas trees went out
But I been burning my bell, book, and candle
And the restoration plays have all gone around

It sure been a cold, cold winter
My feet been dragging across the ground
And the fields has all been brown and fallow
And the springtime take a long way around

Yeah, and I wish I been out in Stone Canyon
When the lights on all the Christmas trees went out
But I been burning my bell, book, and candle
And the restoration plays have all gone around
Well, well, well
Sometimes I think about you, baby
Sometimes I cry about you, Lord
Well well well well well well well
Yeah and I'll wrap my coat around you, woman
Yeah I'll wrap my coat around you, woman
I know what I'm talkin' about


Yeah and I'll wrap my coat around you, woman
Baby sometimes I want to keep you warm
Sometimes I want to wrap my coat around you
Sometimes I want to burn a candle for you
Sometimes I want to wrap my coat around you, Lord
Sometimes I want to burn a candle for you
Sometimes I want to keep you warm
Sometimes I want to wrap my coat around you, Lord I cry
Yeah I want to. sometimes it feels allEmbed
