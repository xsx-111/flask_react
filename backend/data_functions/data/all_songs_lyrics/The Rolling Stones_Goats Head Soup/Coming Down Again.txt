Coming Down Again Lyrics
Coming down again, coming down again
Coming down again, coming down again

Share your thoughts, there's nothing you can hide
She was dying to survive
I was caught, oh, taken for a ride
She was showing no surprise

Coming down again, coming down again
Where are all my friends? Coming down again
Coming down again, coming down again
On the ground again, coming down again

Slipped my tongue in someone else's pie
Tasting better every time
She turned green and tried to make me cry
Being hungry, it ainâ€™t no crime

Coming down again
All my time's been spent, coming down again
Coming down again (Sky fall down again)
Coming down again (Sky fall down again)
(Sky fall down again)
Coming down again (Sky fall down again)
Coming down again

Coming down again, coming down again
Where are all my friends?
(Sky fall down again)
Coming down again (Sky fall down again)
Coming down again (Sky fall down again)
Coming down again
Coming down again
Where are all my friends?
Coming down again
On the ground againEmbed
