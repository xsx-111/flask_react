Star Star Lyrics
Baby, baby, I've been so sad since you've been gone
Way back to New York City where you do belong
Honey, I missed your two tongue kisses
Legs wrapped around me tight
If I ever get back to Fun City, girl
I'm going to make you scream all night
Honey, honey, call me on the telephone
I know you're moving out to Hollywood
With your can of tasty foam
All those beat up friends of mine
Got to get you in their books
And lead guitars and movie stars
Get their toes beneath your hook

Yeah! You're a starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, star
Yeah, a starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, star
A starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker star

Yeah, I heard about your Polaroids
Now that's what I call obscene
Your tricks with fruit was kinda cute
I bet you keep your pussy clean
Honey, I miss your two tongue kisses
Legs wrapped around me tight
If I ever get back to New York, girl
Going to make you scream all night
Yeah! You're a starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, star
Yeah, a starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, star
A starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker star

Yeah, Ali McGraw got mad with you
For giving head to Steve McQueen
Yeah, you and me we made a pretty pair
Falling through the Silver Screen
Honey, I'm open to anything
I don't know where to draw the line
Yeah, I'm making bets that you going to get
(You man) before he dies
(John Wayne)

Yeah! You're a starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, star
Yeah, a starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, star
A starfucker, starfucker, starfucker, starfucker starEmbed
