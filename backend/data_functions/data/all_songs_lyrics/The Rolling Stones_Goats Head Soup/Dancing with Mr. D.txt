Dancing with Mr. D Lyrics
Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst
The air smells sweet, the air smells sick
He never smiles, his mouth merely twists
The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick
But I know his name, he's called Mr. D
And one of these days, he's gonna set you free
Human skulls is hanging right around his neck
The palms of my hands is clammy and wet

Lord, I was dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, Lord, keep your hand off me
Dancing with Mr. D

With Mr. D., with Mr. D

Will it be poison put in my glass?
Or will it be slow or will it be fast?
The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider
A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night
Hiding in a corner in New York City
Looking down a .44 in West Virginia
I was dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, Lord, keep your hand off me
Dancing with Mr. D

With Mr. D., with Mr. D
With Mr. D., with Mr. D
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

Lord, I was dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, Lord, keep your hand off me
Dancing with Mr. D., with Mr. D

One night, I was dancing with a lady in black
Wearing black silk gloves and a black silk hat
She looked at me longing with black velvet eyes
She gazed at me strange, all cunning and wise
I saw the flesh just fall off her bones
The eyes in her skull was burning like coals
Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone
I was dancing with mistress D
Lord, I was dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing
I was dancing, dancing, Lord, keep your hand off me
Dancing, dancing
I was dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing2Embed
