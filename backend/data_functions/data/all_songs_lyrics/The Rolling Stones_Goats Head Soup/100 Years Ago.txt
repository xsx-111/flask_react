100 Years Ago Lyrics

Went out walking through the wood the other day
And the world was a carpet laid before me
The buds were bursting and the air smelled sweet and strange
Seemed about a hundred years ago

Mary and I, we would sit upon a gate
Just gazing at some dragon in the sky
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away
Well, it seemed about a hundred years ago

Now all my friends is wearing worried smiles
Living out a dream of what day it was
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?

Went out walking through the wood the other day
Can't you see the furrows in my forehead?
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away
Now it seemed about a hundred years ago

Now if you see me drinking bad red wine
Don't worry 'bout this man that you love
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?

You're going to kiss and say good-bye
Yeah, I warn you
Yes, you're going to kiss and say good-bye
Yeah, I warn you
Yeah, you're going to kiss and say good-bye
Oh Lord, I warn you
And please excuse me while I hide away

Call me lazy bones
I ain't got no time to waste away
Lazy bones, ain't got no time to waste away
Don't you think, don't you think
It's just about time to hide away?
Yeah, yeah

(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on)
Yeah, ah kiss me, yeah
Kiss me, yeah, kiss me
Come on and kiss me, kiss me
Woo, kiss me baby, kiss me baby
Good God, ah
Goodbye yeah, goodbye yeah, goodbye yeah, come on, yeah
Come on, baby, kiss me (Yeah)
Yeah, you gotta kiss me baby, Lord
I want you, I want you, I want you
Come on, I want you, I want you (Come on)
I want you, I want you (Come on, baby)
Yeah, yeah, look it, look itEmbed
