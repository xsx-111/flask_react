Can You Hear the Music Lyrics
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
Can you feel the magic hanging in the air?
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah
Love is a mystery I can't demystify, oh no
Sometimes I wonder why we're here
But I don't care, I don't care

When I hear the drummer, get me in a groove
When I hear the guitar, make me want to move
Can you feel the magic floating in the air?
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah
Sometimes you're feeling you've been pushed around
And your rainbow just ain't here
Don't you fear, don't you fear

When you hear the music, trouble disappear
When you hear the music ringing in your ears
Can you feel the magic floating in the air?
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah, yeah

Can you hear the music?
Can you hear the music?
Can you feel the magic dancing in the air?
Can you feel the magic? Oh yeah
Love is a mystery that can't be mystified
Sometime I'm dancing on air and I get scared, I get scared
When you hear the music ringing in my ears
Can you hear the music? Oh yeah
Can you hear the drummer get you in a groove?
Can you hear the guitar make you want to move? Yeah
Can you hear the music? Oh, yeah
Can you hear the music ringing in my ears?
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
Can you hear the music?Embed
