Firewater Lyrics
We just stop believing
We hadn't got the time
It was all too heavy
Started too much fights

Take a bar seat by the person
Judged him with a smile
Passed him the open bottle
And we shared another wine

Howling at the moonlight
Squinting at the sun
Firewater to the belly
Look what we've begun

Shadow's getting weaker
It's fading by day
My liver's up and left me
The devil thinks I'm great

Take a bar seat by the person
Judged him with a smile
Passed him the open bottle
And we shared another wine
Howling at the moonlight
Squinting at the sun
Firewater to the belly
Look what we've begun

Take a bar seat by the person
Judged him with a smile
Passed him the open bottle
And we shared another wine

Leaning on a tombstone
Scratching in the dirt
Hatching plans together
My fingers have been burnt

Take a bar seat by the person
Judged him with a smile
Passed him the open bottle
And we shared another wine

Howling at the moonlight
Squinting at the sun
Firewater to the belly
Look what we've begun
