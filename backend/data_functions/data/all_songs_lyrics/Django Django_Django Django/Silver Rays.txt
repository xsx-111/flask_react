Silver Rays Lyrics
Just get it going 'cause I can't get started
It doesn't matter if you can't say no
You say I'm never gonna be disheartened
You only tell me what I need to know
It doesn't matter if it left us stranded
I'll build a raft and sail us back to shore
It's not the way that anybody planned it
You know we should have thought about all this before

I climb up high to all the furthest branches
And gather fruit from all the tallest trees
You always said that we should take our chances
Watch the dust blow for a change of breeze
We'll venture out into the great uncharted
So far away from any beaten track
Enjoy it now before it's gone, departed
You know that once it's gone then there'll be no way back

Silver rays ricochet
And dance across the golden floor
Silver rays, you can stay
And let me drift away from shore
Silver rays, shadows play
And become the one that I adore
Silver rays cast away
And illuminate forever moreEmbed
