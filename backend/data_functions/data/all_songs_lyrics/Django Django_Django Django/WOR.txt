WOR Lyrics
Press the button and drop it on the zone
Took all you had to strip me to the bone
Don't slam the door way down deep in hell
Took a chance on you and it's time to ring the bell

Side effects have you walking in a daze
Then the fallout from this thing just radiates
You'll be the first, I'll always be the last
I'll duck and cover until the threat has passed
Make your move now and try to win the game
But in the end, it always stays the same
Don't shy away behind those hostile lines
I read between them almost every time

Hold your fire, it's all I'm asking for
But the aftershock just shook me to the core
Flick the switch and watch it all erupt
Best get out before the whole thing goes
Press the button now and drop it on the zone
Took all you had to strip me to the bone
Don't slam the door way down deep in hell
Took a chance on you and it's time to ring the bellEmbed
