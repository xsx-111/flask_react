Storm Lyrics
You wanna go, you always wanna go
You wanna go somewhere where you don't know
You always run, and when I try to run
You leave me bent over with a stitch in the road
You are a maze, a complex sum
I'm counting on my fingers and I'm on to my thumb
You are a storm, you are my little storm
I watch the wind change to find out where you've been blown

Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax, this game is over)
Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax, this game is over)

You conjure a key in the palm of your hand
You're burning all your bridges, drawing a line in the sand
We travel far, catch the last of the sun
We keep on going 'til we've nowhere to run
Look at the hills, they look so green
The horizon is the place that you always dream
We shoot the nest like the bolt from the gun
You're tapping on the door to the beat of the drum
Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax, this game is over)
Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax)

Look at the front, it looks so free
It's the only real thing that's been happening to me
You've taken all you thought was wrong
You used it for the lyrics of your favourite song
You are a maze, a complex sum
I'm counting all my fingers and I'm on to my thumb
You are a storm, you are my little storm
I watch the wind change to find out where you've been blown

Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax, this game is over)
Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax)
Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax, this game is over)
Pull it up and steer it over (Pull it up and steer it over)
I can’t relax, this game is over (I can’t relax)Embed
