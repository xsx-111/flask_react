You thought you'd set the bar, I'd never tried to work it out
We just lit the fire and now you want to put it out
You gave it all you got, and what you've got is not a lot
Why don't you hand it over? Time is up, you've had your shot

Gather once again, disasters in the end
It's like a default

You thought you'd made the grade, all you made will start to fade
We threw it in the fire, it's better that it not remain
You just brought together, didn't seem to have the heart
Wheels, they're coming off now, knew that it would fall apart
Take one for the team, you're a cog in the machine
It's like a default

–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default

Take one for the team, you're a cog in the machine
It's like a default

You've missed the starting gun for everything you've ever done
You took part in the race but disappeared without a trace
You thought you'd set the bar, I never tried to work it out
We just lit the fire and now you want to put it out

Forget about the cause, press rewind, then stop and pause
It's like a default
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault
–Fault, like-like-like, de-default

Forget about the cause, press rewind, then stop and pause
It's like a default6Embed
