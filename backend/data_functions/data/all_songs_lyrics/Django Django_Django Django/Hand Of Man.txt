Hand Of Man Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Sit down and talk to me
Think of colours, shapes and harmony
Picture where the space becomes a scene
Open up your eyes and start to dream

Sit down and think what it could be
Follow lines and paths you think you see
Past the place where songs and life began
Walk back and take the hand of manEmbed
