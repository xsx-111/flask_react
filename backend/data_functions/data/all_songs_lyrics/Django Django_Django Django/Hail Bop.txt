Hail Bop Lyrics
Always look at the white sky and you lose your head in the clouds
Wanna step onto them and float onto their ground
You appear from the hillside and there's a funny look in your eye
Between a rock and a hard place and I will either do or say die

Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

Stitch the phrases together 'til something starts to make sense
Talk of the future, ignoring the present tense
Stars shine in the night sky, you light up like a solar flare
Won't just burn up on contact as we enter the atmosphere

Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

Hail to the bop, believe me
Took your time to come back and see me
I've been waiting here so long
And now you've taken off again
Hail to the bop, believe me
Took your time to come back and see me
I've been waiting here so long
And now you've taken off again
Hail to the bop, believe me
Took your time to come back and see me
I've been waiting here so long
And now you've taken off again
Hail to the bop, believe me
Took your time to come back and see me
I've been waiting here so long
And now you've taken off again2Embed
