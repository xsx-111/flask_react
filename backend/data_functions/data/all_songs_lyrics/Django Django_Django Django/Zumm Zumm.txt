Zumm Zumm Lyrics
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know

Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Know you, know you
Know you, know you
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Know you, know you
Know you, know you
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Know you, know you
Know you, know you
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know

Straight out of nowhere
The greatest thing
Seen nothing like it
Just like a dream
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Know you, know you
Know you, know you
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Know you, know you
Know you, know you
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Know you, know you
Know you, know you
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know
Got to get to know, got to get to know

Straight out of nowhere
The greatest thing
Seen nothing like it
Just like a dream
Nothin' to feel like
Hard as a drum
Blinded by impact
Left deaf and dumb
I got to get to know, know you
I got to get to know, know you
I got to get to know, know you
I got to get to know, know youEmbed
