Hold Back the Rain Lyrics
Hold back the rain
Yes we're miles away from nowhere
And the wind doesn't have a name
So call it what you want to call it
Still blows down the lane

And if the fires burn out there's only fire to blame
(hold back the rain)
No time for worry cause we're on the roam again
(hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter and we ride the outside lane
(hold back the rain)
Not on your own so help me please hold back the rain

Okay go off and wander
I'm guilty just the same
Sometimes you're needed badly
So please come back again


Hold back the rain, hold back the rain. hold back the rain
Hold back the rain (hold back the rain), hold back the rain
(Hold back the rain), hold back the rain (hold back the rain)
Hold back the rain (hold back the rain), hold back the rainEmbed
