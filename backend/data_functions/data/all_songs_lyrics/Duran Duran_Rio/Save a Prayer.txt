Save a Prayer Lyrics
You saw me standing by the wall
Corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun
So you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes
And where to go

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after

Feel the breeze deep on the inside
Look you down into your well (Do-do-do-do-do)
If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire (Do-do-do-do-do)
Take a chance like all dreamers
You can't find another way (Do-do-do-do-do)
You don't have to dream it all
Just live a day (Do-do-do-do-do)

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Pretty looking road
I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin (Do-do-do-do-do)
Don't ask me why, I'll keep my promise
Melt the ice (Do-do-do-do-do)
And you wanted to dance
So I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul (Do-do-do-do-do)
Some people call it a one-night stand
But we can call it paradise (Do-do-do-do-do)

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after

Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do

Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after11Embed
