Last Chance on the Stairway Lyrics
I don't remember quite how I met you wasn't long ago
I just get a picture of sun in your eyes the waves in your hair
Maybe it's something said in a movie or you could've said last night
It just took me out on a limb and I don't really know what I'm doing here

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide and my beat's so in time, can you look at me?
I'm out of reach I'll talk if it feels right, I've had my last chance on the stairway

Funny it's just like a scene out of Voltaire twisting out of sight
'Cause when all the curtains are pulled back we'll turn and see the circles we've traced
Ain't no game (ooo-ooo) when you're playing with fire
It doesn't seem right that we fight so the party runs on all night

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide and my beat's so in time, can you look at me?
I'm out of reach I'll talk if it feels right, so nervous to say, tell me can't you see?
And if you want I'll fall out forever, I can't say no more, baby dance with me
And please don't say leave it till later, I've had my last chance on the stairway

Wonder why (wonder why ooo-ooo) what makes me rise so high
Maybe it's something they put in your perfume or the look in your eyes
It could be the atmosphere sinking, oh, I don't know what you're thinking
I don't even know what you're drinking, but it keeps this heaven alive
And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide and my beat's so in time, can you look at me?
I'm out of reach I'll talk if it feels right, so nervous to say, tell me can't you see?
And if you want I'll fall out forever, I can't say no more, baby dance with me
And please don't say leave it till later, I've had my last chance on the stairway

Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway2Embed
