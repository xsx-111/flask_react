My Own Way Lyrics
I saw you at the air race yesterday
April showers get out of my way
Fear of flying no not me
I'm never bothered what you say
Someone's kid just lives for today
It ain't your problem anyway

Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way
Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way

Number one
Public figure what a pain
Just puts another rattle in your brain
Take another green but it's not the same
So now you're on the sand lane everyday
Dancing with the bulls in any old way
Running like a fox to keep up with me

Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way
Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way

I'm on 45 between 6th and Broadway,
7UP between 6th and Broadway
Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way
Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own wayEmbed
