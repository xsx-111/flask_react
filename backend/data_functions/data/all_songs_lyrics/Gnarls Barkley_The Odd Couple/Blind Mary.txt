Blind Mary LyricsWhoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Yeah!

I love Mary (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (Marry me)
I love Mary (La la la)

She has never seen the sunshine (Sunshine)
Yet, she's getting along just fine (Fine)
She's not staying, she's just passing through (Through-ooh-ooh)
Hey, do you mind if I follow you?
You

I love Mary (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (Marry me)
I love Mary (La la la)
Yeah

I heard a voice say, "Catch me if you can"
Before you know it, I was holding her hand
It's harder to imagine than understand
How she knows exactly who I am
Yeah
I love Mary (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (Marry me)
I love Mary (La la la)
Yeah

She's my friend, she doesn't judge me
She has no idea I'm ugly
So, I've absolutely nothing to hide
Because I'm so much prettier inside
Yeah

I love Mary (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (Marry me)
I love Mary (La la la)
