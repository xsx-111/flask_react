Charity Case Lyrics
Give, give, give it away, now
Give, give, give it away, now
Give it away, now

I-I-I-I don't know what matters to you at this moment
But that's all that matters to me
How are you? How are you? Knock on wood
Well, I'm not doin' so good
I bet you probably couldn't tell
Although you're worth it, I'm still not well
And I don't understand how I'm so understanding
I guess that that's all I can be
How are you? How are you? I think I can help
But I can't help myself
Shouldn't I be happy? You need my help
I usually just talk to myself

Oh, can't you see, oh, can't you see?
If I help somebody, baby, there's mercy for me (Me)
Ah, charity (And you, for you, one for you, and you, and you)

Don't wanna bother you, baby, but I'm bleedin', too
Are you needin' me like I'm needin' you?
Even my shadow leaves me all alone at night
Guess I need to start to take my own advice
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Oh, can't you see, oh, can't you see?
Somebody's a liar, whoever said freedom was free (Free)
Ah, charity

Give, give, give it away, now
Give, give, give it away, now
Give it away, now
Give it away, now

Woo! Alright
Yeah
I want to be your baby
Charity, you better give it to somebodyEmbed
