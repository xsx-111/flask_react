Would Be Killer Lyrics*shotgun cocks twice*

I've got a secret
Something I thought maybe I could do
But I can't, now can I?
Lucky, lucky you!
Did you know I could be, a would be killer?
If suddenly I should be, I would be killer
Hurt people, hurt people
This is always how
Oh I've been entered by evil
So someone best love me right now!
Because I could be, a would be killer
If suddenly I should be, I would be killer
Now don't you dare me
Or we will dance
High up balancing ballet
So I may still get my chanceEmbed
