Going On Lyrics
I've seen it with my own eyes how we're getting otherwise
Without the luxury of leaving (Leaving)
The touch and feeling of free is intangible, technically
Something you've got to believe in ('Lieve in)
Connect the cause and effect, one foot in front of the next
This is the start of a journey (Journey)
And my mind is already gone, and the fear of the unknown
Somehow just doesn't concern me ('Cern me)

And you can stand right there if you want

But I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
To a place in the sun that's nice and warm
I'm going on

And I'm sure they'll have a place for you, too, ooh

Anyone that needs what they want and doesn't want what they need
I want nothing to do with (To do with)
I aim to do what I want, and to do what I please
Is first off my to-do list (To-do list)
But every once in a while, I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss (Do miss)
But, baby, I've got to go, baby, I've got to know
Baby, I've got to prove it (Prove it)
And I'll see you when you get there

But, I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
May my love lift you up to the place you belong
I'm going on

And I promise I'll be waiting for you, ooh

Don't follow me4Embed
