No Time Soon Lyrics
This could be one of those days
When we must go our separate ways
Scared for you to be out of my sight
Cause you never know, you might

And I carry this, it's heavy
And I miss you already
You were perfect, babe

My time will come, yours, too
I'd gladly go before you
I hope you live forever
Or, baby, we can go together, ah
It'll be perfect, babe

And I carry this, it's heavy
And I miss you already
You were perfect, babe
PerfectEmbed
