Whatever Lyrics
Ooh, yeah

I don't have any friends at all
'Cause I have nothin' in common with y'all
So who's gonna catch me if I fall?
My back's always against the wall (Oh)
I don't have anything to say (Say)
I want everything to go my way (Way)
Shut up, mom, it is not okay ('Kay)
I'm alone almost every day

But it's cool (It's cool)
It could be better (Could be better)
I don't care (I don't care)
Ha, whatever (Whatever)
Whatever, man

La la la la, la la la
Whatever
La la la la, la la la
Whatever
La la la la, la la la
Whatever
La la la la, la la la
What
Talk to my counselor 'bout how I feel
Everyone agrees I could use some help
I love my girl more than I love myself
But she's going steady with someone else (Woah)
I don't know what else to do (Do)
Said fuck me? Well, fuck you, too (Too)
I know it sounds real sad but true (Too)
Being alone is nothing new

But it's cool (it's cool)
It could be better (could be better)
I don't care (I don't care)
Whatever (whatever)
Whatever, bitch!

But it's cool (It's cool)
It could be better (Could be better)
I don't care (I don't care)
Ha, whatever (Whatever)
Whatever, bitch

La la la la, la la la
Whatever
La la la la, la la la
Whatever
La la la la, la la la
Whatever
La la la la, la la la
WhatEmbed
