DD Form 214 Lyrics
Say it baby
Say it baby
You know it baby
Show it baby
Slower baby
Say it baby

Call me, call me
When you get lonely
Darlin' you don't have to worry
I'll be there
Be there in a hurry
Say it
Say it and I got you
Alright, I'll do it over
No need to worry
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I get
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmm
I don't
I get so lonely
I can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one
That lives in me
My dear
I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one but you

I really am, yeah, look
I'm doing favors for petty pay
Run through the track like I'm Cirque du Soleil
All of this pain that I feel inside
Baby you's got to be shitting me
Sicker than all of your sickest shit
Flipping your heart like I'm flipping bricks
Niggas be talking that triple shh
Like triple six, don't exist
I am more Hades than Heracles
Baggin' these bitches, I'm Birkin, b
You think your **** is hurting me? (Nah)
Homie, come back when you get to my rank
Call me young Peggy the skank
I get the Ratchet and Clank
I whip that ass like Sasha Banks (Yuh, aha)
I whip yo ass like I'm Bruce Wayne with the cape, nigga
I can’t be sullied, (Uh, girl) and ain’t a damn thing changed on 'em
I won’t be bullied (Girls, you know what I mean)
Y'all know what the fuck I mean
You know just how it goes so
Just so your own you know it
I'm giving you water
Baby, I'm a veteran
Baby, I'm a veteran
Baby, I'm a veteran
There's no need to question
There's no second guessing
Baby, I'm a veteran
Baby, I'm a veteran

Fuck, come on
Woo shit, ahh
Girls, ah
Wait a minute, ma
Mm, hmm
Man, ooh shit
Wait a minute mother fuck
Wait, ooh
Work this son of a bitch, you
Ah, girls
Wait a minute...
Girls
I then changed positions
I put one leg on the ceiling
And the other one just across the closet door
Ahh, fuck me
Ahh, just3Embed
