Rainbow Six Lyrics
Cunty, cunty, cunty, cunty
Cunty, cunty, cunty, cun-
Cunty, cunty, cunty, cunty, cun-, cun-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You think you know me)

Boolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you should know I got the straight drop
Boolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you should know I got the straight drop
Boolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you should know I got the straight drop
Boolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you should know I got the straight drop

Pull up on yo' block with the pistol
Slap you up nigga, little boy, just dismiss you
I don't give a fuck, right punch you, it's official
I don't give a shit, lil' nigga, you need tissue
For your fucking face 'cause it's full of the blood
Blood, bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody, blood
Smack you fuckin' up, nigga, I take a stub
Grab you fuckin' up nigga, put you in the trunk
Fuck with me, nigga I take you to the dump
Me nigga, I-
What you niggas want? Huh
Got that thang in the trunk, huh
What you niggas need? (Yeah) Huh
Pills, crack, coke, weed, huh
Pressure, pressure (Lord forgive me, I'm sorry)
I don't wanna hit 'em with the K
I don't wanna hit 'em with the K (Hit 'em all in the body)
I'ma have to go and be the bad man
Baby I'ma put him in his place
I'ma have to do it to you baby (I just caught another body)
I'ma have to give him something 'mazing (Hit 'em all in the body)
Tell 'em when I'm talking to my baby (Lord forgive me, I'm sorry)

Coolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you know I got the straight drop (Straight drop)
Coolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you should know I got the straight drop (Straight drop)
Coolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you know I got the straight drop (Straight drop)
Coolin' on the block with the Glock cocked
And you know I got the straight drop (Straight drop)

Look, it's the young alt-right menace
What's the pistol to a pennant?
Treat a writer like a cynic, nigga, huh
Surface level niggas never get it
Fuck a rating and a cynic (Ooh)
Always talking, never livin', nigga, huh
I don't make no music for these niggas (Ooh)
Say they wanna be a critic
But they cannot take no criticism, huh
Nigga, we the junkies, they the dealers
I be rappin', they be triggered
You be writin', I'm a killer, nigga what?
Fuck is this song? Fuck is my whip?
Fuck up your streams, I got the rips
Skinny and paid, I'm Taylor Swift
We at your job, catch you on shift
Nigga, you gone
I don't like you (Nigga, I'm-)
Niggas don't want it (Fuck, oh)
Lord forgive me, I'm sorry (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hit 'em all in the body (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lord forgive me, I'm sorry
I just caught another body
Hit 'em all in the body
I had to get some money (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hit 'em all in the body

I don't wanna be alone
It's so hard for me to trust you, baby
I'm around you, baby
I got so much on me
40, I'd drown you, baby
I don't wanna drown you, baby
I just wanna love you, baby
I got too much for me
Oh my god, I'm so weak
Holy fuck, I'm lonely6Embed
