One, two
Huh, mhm
Sh-, shit
Mhm, show 'em, yeah
Damn, Peggy

Oh, you ain't got your flag now, nigga what? (Damn)
No badge, no gun, you is not tough (Nah)
Got the Benilli M4 with the big nuts (Yeah)
Toucan Sam whip it like big ****, pay homage
You are not a guest, you're a hostage
Rap game thirsty, piss same color as Logic (God damn)
White boys act tough, I don't give no fucks
Heard he acting like Dex, beat his ass 'til he Russ (Skrrt)

Keep it on the hush
I heard that yo' mama, sister, auntie, gettin' touched
Gat in my lap, catch me surfin' Stormfront

Wax, beach
I put the judge in the seat (Beat), I send that bitch to the bank
I heard she pray to Allah ('Lah), nah bitch, you prayin' to me
I do this shit for Kalief (Yeah), these coppers beggin' for war
You niggas marchin' for peace, I make they family weep
Kill 'em or give 'em the beats, we point the gun at your seed, nigga
Huh
And Iâ€™m ridin' in that Bentley coupe, bitch (Huh, bitch)
Fuck a Trump, and a fucking coon, bitch (Yeah)
This is not for no interviews, bitch (Nah, bitch)
Or the evening news, bitch (Brrah!)

Huh, huh, eh
Yee, yeah
Fucking dry, I'm out of weed, I'm irritable
I'm fucking nauseous, I'm all crazy
(I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, man, I feel like killing somebody)
...Off my plans, fuck all my bands
I got the weed, I got the stems
Fuck you, I'm paid, baby I'm-
I got these bills (Bills, bills, bills)
Fuck, I got these bills (Bills, bills, bills)
I got these bills (Bills, bills, bills)
You overthi-3Embed
