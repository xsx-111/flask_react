Panic Emoji Lyrics
You think you know me
Yesterday I thought I was having a heart attack
Panic attack
Made a wack beat yesterday
I get ideas in my-
I keep smoking weed
I masturbate constantly

Keep hustlin', keep hustlin', keep movin'
I'm a nuisance, I'm useless
We fucked, this hurts
I'm a nuisance (Ahh)
DOA to the base, face wet, legs shake
Grab my chest, feelin' faint
These symptoms (Ahh, ahh), can't help them
Where my health went?
This hurts
Wait

Crackers keep callin' me Aces
I put the spade on the hook
All of you yuppies is puss
You ain't never hit a jugg
Ain't no money on yo' books
I put Lemmy in the grave
I push the golden gun up on ya braids
Shh, pew! Fade
Phew, what's goo-
Don't stop, can't win, sh, sh
Fuck you, sh, sh
Fuck you
Fuck, no
Eyes can't-, yeah (Should be walkin' in right-)

And I'm gettin' cash, you ain't never there, ooh, yeah
Oh, you fuckin' mad, 'cause I'm countin' swag, ooh, yeah
Nigga, you’s a bitch, you’s a fuckin' hoe, ooh, yeah
I can tell you (Pussy)
(I keep smoking weed)
Yeah, uh, pull up on 'em wit' the stick talk
Nigga, you ain’t 'bout that brick talk
Fuck with me you get shot (Shoo, shoo)
I am a thot
Fuck it, I am a opp
Wrist cut, wrist cut, wrist cut
Gray death on the block

Yeah, I'm depressed
Yeah, it's just a panic
Yeah, it's just a panic
Yeah, it's just a panic
Dear, it's just a panic
Ooh, it's just a panic attack
