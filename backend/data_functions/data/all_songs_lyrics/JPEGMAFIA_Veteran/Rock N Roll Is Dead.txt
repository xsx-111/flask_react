Rock N Roll Is Dead Lyrics
â€‹elbuod sees 
(You think you know me)
Big Daddy Hoffman comin' to you here with a
Kimber Team Match II .45, 1911
This baby oughta be nice, right there (Ooh)
Cocked, locked and ready to rock (Oh, uh)
One, two
High key, uh

Gone with the sauce
Got the .45 tucked in the bag
Hit 'em with the hawk
Nah, fuck it dawg, whip 'em wit the strap
I've been on the fuckin' road (Uh)

How many cars does it take
