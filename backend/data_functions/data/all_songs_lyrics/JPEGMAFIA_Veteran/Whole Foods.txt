Whole Foods Lyrics
Sir
Man, if I don't-, huh-uh-huh-uh-huh
Bitch, I shop at Whole Foods like I'm boujee
Pass the blunt, my mind is missin'
Tweet my shit, I need the mentions
Stop pretendin'
Look, look

Ridin' 'round the city like a side bitch
Hermit 'til I die, close the blinds, bitch (Bitch)
Mama told me, "Baby, you's a prophet, so profit" (Profit)
Treat these fucking labels like a side-, hold up
Fuck it dog, I had to do it (Ooh)
Reviewers looking stupid, stick to music
I am the Black God, fuck a human, Stanley Kubrick (Yeah)
You know this rappin' shit be therapeutic
Pitchfork told me to never be abusive 'less I'm movin' units
I see what the truth is
'Cause niggas preaching 'bout the pussy be the biggest douches
Wow

Suh
Nasty
Damn, Peggy
I'm out the window lookin' real stupid, fuck that
It's young Scully how I peep the ruins (Shh), trust that
I whip the whip like the shit been boosted (Whip it)
My bus pass ain't been legit since I smashed Karrueche (Not true)
These people thinking that they warriors, they straight Kabuki (It happen)
I hit your mama with that Conker's Bad Fur Day
GoldenEye, hit 'em up (Uh)
Perfect Dark nigga for the job, so I zip 'em up
Put 'em in a bag like I'm pickin' up dog shit
