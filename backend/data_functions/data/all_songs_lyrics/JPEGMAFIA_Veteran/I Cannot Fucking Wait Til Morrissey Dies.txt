I Cannot Fucking Wait Til Morrissey Dies Lyrics
I do it, I do it
It really don't matter to me dawg

Tom (Tom), Varg (Varg), Morrissey (Yeah)
Bunch of timid white ******* who can't fuck with me (Okay)

Fuck a Johnny Rotten, I want Lil B (Man)
Fuck you niggas talkin', this a killin' spree (Dang)
Pull up on a cracker, bumpin' Lil Peep
God (God) damn (Damn), holy sheet
Got my reparations, bought some jewelry (Yoooo)
Ayy, I'm a left-wing Hades

Racks make you walk wop-sided
And you know I rock real diamonds

Now maybe I'm s-
