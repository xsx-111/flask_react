Curb Stomp Lyrics
Niggas right there probably thinking I’m loud as shit
Ask me I give a fuck, so, (Nope), no
Did I tell you
So, (This nigga right now, nigga), oh
Da-damn, Peggy! What
Uh, uh

Hit, hit, hit
Superman Peggy making hits (Hit)
Smallville fucking with the kents (Hit)
Kush getting trumped for the pence

I’m rolling (Yeah)
Fuck that nigga, I’m Rollins (Yeah)
3rd Reich nigga, I’m Stalin
Curb stomp all my opponents
Aw baby, I’m violent (Huh, yeah)
Kush loud but the gun silent (Yeah)
Fuck rap, nigga, I’m firing (Brrat)
Alt right pussies keep crying (Why?)
Did I tell you

Biddy bye bye
Clap your hands, when the Glock, extend
I’ma clap your mans, he’s a fucking fan
We don't fuck with stans, nigga, watch your hands
Hit, hit, hit, hit
Peglord charging niggas rent (Hit)
Pig stay picking up his scent (Bitch, hit)
Nigga, what’s a god to a trend (Yo, uh yeah)
Fuck a Torah, bitch, I'm praying *** * Benz (No shit)
Rocky horror, pick her pocket then I spend (Bitch lit)
Young Aramark I profit off the pen (What the fuck)
And these drafts never got sent (Ah)

I’m rolling
Fuck that nigga, I’m Rollins
3rd Reich nigga, I’m Stalin
Curb stomp all my opponents (Heh, heh-heh)

Aw baby, I’m dying
I’m crying
Aww, baby I'm-
Haha, hahahaha
Ayy, I punched that nigga (Did I tell you)
What, what? Hol' up Did I tell you9Embed
