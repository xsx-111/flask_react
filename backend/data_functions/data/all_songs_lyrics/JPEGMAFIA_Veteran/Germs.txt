Germs Lyrics
Let me call you right back
Ok
Whoa, what
What, what, whoa, what, what, what, what, what, what (Me)
What, what, what, what, what, where
Nigga, where
Sorry
Ok
Nigga, why you feel-
Said

Off top, bitch I'm rollin' (Rollin')
Can't stay focused, I'm hopeless (Skee)
I want white, like a token (Tax)
Blunts stay rolling, I’m posted (I'm posted, yeah)
Catch you home alone, Macaulay Culkin (Ooh)
Matt Hardy, my gun, you getting broken (Pussy ass nigga)
Your bitch wet and she throatin' (Skrr)
My girl blonde like Goten (Shh, whoa)

Yeah, I'm waitin', ayy
Fuck these niggas
It’s no shade (No shade at all, baby, none at all nigga)
You can’t take (Easy money)
You know that, I'm grand prize (I'm returnin'-, I'm returnin', the-)
Ahh you know, I- (Gimme the fuckin' money, nigga)
Look, bitch, I got the sauce, and it's wopped up (Woo)
Stocks up, I'ma slip and shoot a cop up (That's life)
They not us, I'ma make em put his guard up (Damn)
Jesus, hot sauce, with the cross up (What, what)
(All day)
I finesse 'em with a better body (Yee)
Fresh Prince, no prints on a severed shotty (Brrat)
Kill Trump, do 'em like Floyd did Gatti (It’s no shade)

Man, look it ain't no motherfucking shade, I'm just talking
You the one that got that liberal arts degree

You know I give it, I serve it, you know that I'm grand prize (Hahaha, yeah, wow)
It’s no shade (No)
You can’t take (No, yeah)
You know I give it (Yeah), I serve it, you know that I’m grand prize (Yeah, yeah)
It’s no shade (It's no shade)
You can't take (It's no shade)
You know that I’m grand prize6Embed
