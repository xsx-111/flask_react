Williamsburg Lyrics
Selling art to these yuppies, gettin' mixed offers
Hold up...

Selling art to these yuppies, gettin' mixed offers
I'm in New York like I’m Peter Parker
Wrote a 16 then I tossed it
If I wanted bullshit, I’d just read Gawker (Facts, nigga)
Young Rick murder, I just shoot walkers
I’m a slave to this rap shit, I can’t quit (Nah)
Fresh Sig with the grip (Ooh)
A y****e pop shit, call the gun Britney Jean
When the spears come out, I hit you and JT
You yuppies ain’t real, let you live for a fee
We taking Brooklyn back, you can leave the coffee
And you coons dying too, word to Charles Barkley (Word)
My head dreaded up like my name Marley
Nah, we don’t do-, shh
Simple rhyming ass niggas get they wig pushed back (Uh)
Get your mic snatched, nicotine patched
Call my white b**s up, get your life hacked
Heard your stock dropped, nigga, this the blow back
Put the Hawkeyes on him, heard he like M*A*S*H (Shoo)
You gon’ rust in peace, heard you like thrash
Put a price on your head, that’s a light bag
.45 on me like Mike back, whoa
Flame, alright
Baby, I’m just heating up (It's lit)
Not a need-, a need it is a must (Yeah)
Feeling stuck, you know how to keep me up (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Icy love, icy like a hockey puck (Oh, alright)
Baby (Baby), I’m just heating up (It's nasty, it's lit)
Need your-need your love (Stop, eh)
Not a need it is a must (Yeah)
You know how to keep me up (Yeah, yeah)
Icy-

(...off in the main)
I walk in the booth like I own it (Hidden Hills)
I know that I belong there (Deep off in the main)
Mm (Hidden Hills, deep off in the main)
These days ain’t the same (Hidden Hills)
All ain’t b***t like that (Deep off in the main)
These fuck niggas ain’t trill like that
Y’all niggas, y’all built like rats, oh (Hidden Hills)
