Macaulay Culkin Lyrics
'Sup
'Sup

I got my hands on my face like Macaulay Culkin
Gave her the cig, but I left her smoking
And it’s the same dude
Black pants, brown boots, chest open
I traveled down the road and back again, my girl's golden (Ooh)
Black man, white fam, I feel like Jason Jordan (Hoo)
I play my albums front to back, it make me feel important (Right)
Apply compression when I spit so it don’t get distorted
Piper Chap, with the strap
Fuck the talk, get the warden (Fuck outta here)
I think I'm Rick and Morty
In the lab I take precautions
Snipe 'em out, burn the body (Brrat)
Stash the Glock, buy the coffin (Nasty)
Just for me
Yo style is my custody
Man, I should charge a shipping fee
These rappers don't mean shit to me (Shit to me, bruh)
Two guns (Nothin'), Mulder and Scully, I'm solving mysteries (Damn, Peggy)
Feminist, pistol whip your w**e first, that's chivalry (Uh)
Sounding like my minimes
But you ain't got the heart to do these evil deeds
Debra pack
Turn Stone Cold into Simple Steve
Where it at
Slap a nigga up
Then I get the cream
Five buck, six cookies (Woo)
Sounding like a deal to me
Yo shit don't appeal to me (Yeah)
My fans going heel for me
Gots to keep it real for me
Shouldn't even be on no bills with me
These punk niggas be killing me (Yeah)
That wack shit ain't trill to me (Yah)
Fuck y'all niggas, I take the heat
Don shit, nigga8Embed
