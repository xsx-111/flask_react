DJ Snitch Bitch Interlude Lyrics
Hulk Hogan, known to keep the thang smokin'
Steady fuckin' with a blonde, I think I’m Frank O-
(DJ Snitch Bitch)
Bail, I can’t deal with all these sudden motions
Mac high as Sierra, your updates is frozen (Nasty)
Crouching in the bushes like I’m jailposing
That .38 special team, I don’t need coaching (Damn)
You are not a man, bitch, you're a fuckin' token
Giuliani, suck a dick, that’s the fuckin' slogan (You know)
Black market shawty, keep the thangs on me (Ooh)
Blood on my money but ain’t a stain on me (Nah)
Ridge racer, no games for me (Fuck, nigga)
New money, new habits (Yeah)
Make you disappear with no trace, that’s tragic (Nah)
Riding down Calvert in a caddy with the ratchet
Pussy call the cops so much, the cops should give him badges
Hold up, let me hear that back?

Alright!3Embed
