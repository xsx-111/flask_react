My Thoughts On Neogaf Dying Lyrics
Whoa

I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care (I don't care)
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care (Fuck)
I don't care
Little care
I don't care

(Let's get it!)
I don’t care about the cars
I don’t care about your flash
I don’t care about your phone
I don’t c-
I don’t care about the beats
I don’t care about your plays
I don’t care about the bass
I don’t care
(Ride em' cowboy, nigga!)
I don’t care about your bank (Okay!)
I don’t care about your fees
Give a fuck 'bout your degrees
I don’t care (I don’t care)
Give a fuck about your life
I don’t care, nah
(That's what we like to call big damage, nigga!)
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care (I don't care)
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

I don't give a fuck about it
Man, now, I don't care
I get around to it
I don't care
