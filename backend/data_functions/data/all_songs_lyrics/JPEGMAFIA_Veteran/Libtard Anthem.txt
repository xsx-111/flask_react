Libtard Anthem Lyrics
Heard you beat a bitch with a guitar

Word on the street, you're a libtard
Heard rape makes you get hard
Word on the street, you're a rockstar
Heard you beat a bitch with a guitar (Do it for the clout)
Heard you hit bitches for the clout
You beat the bitch for the clout (Do it for the clout)
F*** the bitch up for some clout (Ooh)
Do it for some clout, yeah do it for some clout (Swagger!)
F*** the bitch for clout (Do it for the clout)
Beat the bitch for clout (For clout!)
I skrrt off with top down (Do it for some clout)
Burn out, finger out (Skrrrr! Do it for some clout)
I ain't gon' feel bad, wow
I ain't gon' lose these thousands (I do it for the clout, I do it for some clout)
I'm a dog, wow-wow
And I got that pow-pow (Do it for the clout)
Word on the street, you're a libt*** (Swagger! Do it for the clout)
Word on the street, you say yee-haw! (Do it for the clout, ayy)
Word on the street, you got 'preme on
Word on the street, you're a libtard (Swagger! Do it for the clout, do it for the clout)
Word on the street, you're Bill Maher
Word on the street, I know my real mom (Yeah, do it for the clout)
Word on the street- (Yeah, do-)
Word on the street, you fucked Tomi Lahren (Ooh, do it for the clout, wow)
Word on the street, you're a libtard
Word on the street, you're a Bill Maher
Word on the street, you fucked Tomi Lahren
Word on the street, I know my real mom4Embed
