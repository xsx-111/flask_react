Hardly Wait Lyrics
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait

It's been so long
I've lost my taste
Say angel come
Say lick my face
Let fall your dress
I'll play the part
I'll open this mouth wide
Eat your heart

I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait

Lips cracked dry
Tongue blue burst
Say angel come
Say lick my thirst
It's been so long
I've lost my taste
Here, Romeo
Make my world as great
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
In my glass coffinEmbed
