Easy LyricsOyster pearl, You easy girls
You're flapping in, You're shouting
You're dead good
All the men say
Legs wide hips swinging like a doorway
Easy, Easy, Easy
I'm ranting
I'm raving
I'm taking in just everything
You're giving me no leeway
I open once and you call me devil's gateway
Easy, Easy, Easy, Easy
And I deserve it ; I asked for it
Have to admit it ; We dress like targets
Yeah I deserve it ; Give me no leeway
I give you fine times
You can call me devil's gateway
Oh!
Easy, Easy, Easy, Easy, Easy, Easy, Easy, Easy
Easy {and I deserve it...and I deserve it} (X3 )Embed
