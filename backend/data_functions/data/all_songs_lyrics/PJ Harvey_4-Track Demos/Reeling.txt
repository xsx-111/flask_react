Reeling LyricsI wanna bathe in milk
Eat grapes
Robert DeNiro, sit on my face
I can't sleep for thinking
Set my head a reeling
I wanna go to Spain
Spend nights
Just sipping on nectar and ice
No, I can't sleep for thinking
Set my head a reeling
Living in a horse race
Wanna make the shit hit the fan
No, I can't sleep for thinking
Set my head a reeling
Even Aphrodite
She got nothing on me
Take me to the moon
Take me to the moon
Fly me to the moon
Take me to the moon...
Dye my hair on stage
Reeling
Reeling
Even Aphrodite
She'll have nothing on me
Reeling
Reeling
Take me to the moon
Take me to the moon
Fly me to the moon
Take me to the moon...
Reeling...1Embed
