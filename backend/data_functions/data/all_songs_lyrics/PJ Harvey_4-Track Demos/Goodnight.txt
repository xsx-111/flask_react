Goodnight Lyrics
Here I am
Prairieland
Got it all, got
Gun in hand
I see
Dungarees
They're on my husband
They're on me

We have the stars
We have the trees
We have everything
We need to feed

I'll make babes
He'll make chairs
We'll sell them at
The county fair
We'll walk on
We'll walk tall
We'll dance once a week
The union hall
We'll have the stars
We'll have the trees
We'll have everything
We need to feed

Here I am
Prairieland
I got it all, got
Gun in hand
I'll sweep the porch
I dust his room
We'll swing together
On our chair at noon

We'll have the stars
We'll have the trees
We'll have everything
We need to feed

Goodnight, Irene
We'll have the stars
Goodnight, Irene
We'll have the trees
I'll see you in my dreams
We'll have everything
We need to feedEmbed
