M-Bike LyricsHis m-bike's clean
You polish that thing
He looks her over more than me
But I won't let it get to me
Yeah he can play with
His machine
Night or day
Wind or shine
Looks at her shape
Not at mine
But I'm not complaining
No I think it's neat
Yeah he can play with
His machine
But all he's speaking
And all he sees
Is just his motor-bike not me
I won't let it get to me
Can't stop thinking his god damn machine
Motor X4
Take that lady
Coast her west
Ride his motor
Over the edge
Yeah I could break her
Break her break me
But get rid of that
God damn machine
Yeah I could break her {motor}
Break her break me {motor}
But get rid of that {motor}
God damn machine {motor}
Yes I'm gonna break her {motor}
Think what you like {motor}
I fucking hate {motor}
His motorbike {motor)Embed
