Conversation Intercom Lyrics
Time and time again
Translation seems to sabotage the words
You know what he says
Not what is heard
Damn this mean device
It makes a whispering man sound as if he cries
It's the pinnacle of what is typical

Conversation intercom
You hear what I say but
It comes out all wrong
Conversation intercom
You say what I see still
You speak in different tongues

Don't act like a fool
It makes you so uncool and
That's what it does best
'Cause if anything
It's just a temper-test
Fill in your own words
Yeah
1-800 Dial-to-be-heard
It's the pinnacle
Of what is cynical
Conversation intercom
You hear what I say
But it comes out all wrong
Conversation intercom
You say what I see still
We speak in different tongues

Yeah
Clap your hands and you know what to do...
My ears attends to you...
As people listen intently...

Can you copy?
Do you receive?
Do you receive?
Do you receive, yeah?
Do you receive?
Damn this mean device
It makes a whispering man sound as if he criesEmbed
