My Cruel Joke Lyrics
I used to think Cupid was a real jerk
A child star tormented
A faded star of yesterday, now toothless and jaded
He shoots his arrows wildly
With bottles scattered across the sky he trips on clouds
With a face like Keith Richards

I am your voice
What you propose
I am your choice
Your vow to be
Whatever you do, I'll agree
Please forgive me my cruel joke

I'm everywhere - partial and entire
I'm on the inside of everything
And on the outside
I'm trembling like a man away from home
But I can't speak my heart
In case they hear me
Now, no one will listen to our song

I am your voice
What you propose
I am your choice
Your vow to be
Whatever you do, I'll agree
Please forgive me my cruel joke
I used to think cupid was an asshole
The loneliest soul in the universe
And as the wrinkled birdman approached me
I could smell his smouldering cigarette breath
And he looked at me out the corner of his head and he spoke:
So, you ask me why no one stays together any more?
You're never around when I need you
You're never around when I need youEmbed
