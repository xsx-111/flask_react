More Than This LyricsGuess i had it coming
Ambition is my worst vice
Next thing I know
Time is having it's way with me
Working hard at putting skin on baloney
It all makes sense in some way i forget right now
Somehow i manage to fool
Myself and everyone else
That this is really just
Only, maybe, only
Just the meantime
Meantime
Frequent liar mileage
As if I had a choice
Limp to the edge of patience
And let yourself fall
Wearing out mirrors
All over the world
I hope i can get far playing
Air guitar
In the meantime
Meantime
There has to be more than this
There has to be more than this
Somehow i manage to fool
Myself and everyone else
That this is really just
Only, maybe, only
Just the meantime
Meantime
There has to be more than thisEmbed
