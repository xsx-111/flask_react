Flying Without Wings LyricsIf love ever comes barging in like that again
That's it, I'm calling security
If time ever tries to pull one of those stunts again
You'd better believe, it ain't me, it ain't me
'cause everything you try to conceal
Is everything you want to reveal
Flying without wings
I wish i just couldn't feel a thing
It goes to show: you never knowEmbed
