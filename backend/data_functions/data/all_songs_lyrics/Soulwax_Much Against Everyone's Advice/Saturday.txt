Saturday Lyrics
Saturday, oh Saturday
How cruel of you to go away
You turn us on and you don't even have the decency to stay

We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Walking like a chameleon

Turn around and turn me on and make that sound you do so well 'Cause I'm not dancing I'm just shifting weight
I thought that you could tell

We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Walking like a chameleon
Sometimes love kills time
It just might tonight

Neon claws and drama queens agree to like the local band
Everyone is smoking filter cigarettes all over again
We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Talking like a chameleon
Sometimes love kills time
It just might tonight
Sometimes love kills time
It just might tonight
Sometimes love kills time
It just might tonight
Sometimes love kills time
It just might tonightEmbed
