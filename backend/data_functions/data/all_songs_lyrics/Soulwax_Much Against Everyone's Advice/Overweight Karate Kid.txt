Overweight Karate Kid Lyrics
Like an overweight karate kid you could moonwalk
Over my heart
Using candour as painkiller
Tastes like vanilla to me
Occasionally

Someone please make me go home
The worst at being alone
Just tell me I ought to watch
Informercials for love
And buy all of their trust

Saturdays have shown us I'm not
The world's most talkative guy
You say it's fine
But I can always try and answer
With amplified anger
Then cry inside

Someone please make me go home
The worst at being alone
Just tell me I ought to watch
Informercials for love
And buy all of their trustEmbed
