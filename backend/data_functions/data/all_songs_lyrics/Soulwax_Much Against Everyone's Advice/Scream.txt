Scream Lyrics
Like she was scream
I try to hear
What's in my dreams
I gotta fear
I cannot breathe
Please hold me tight
I try to feel
Don't talk so fast

This radioactive she
What she does to me
Caught her inside, cuts like a knife
She's like a scream to me

I'm not afraid
I cannot help
There's no disguise, no alibis
What do I think
I cannot say
Something about me
Like she was here

This radioactive she
What she does to me
Caught her inside, cuts like a knife
She's like a scream to me
This radioactive she
What she does to me
Caught her inside, cuts like a knife
She's like a scream to me
She's like a scream to meEmbed
