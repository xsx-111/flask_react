Proverbial Pants LyricsDon't let this heart pollute you
Cross your legs and hope to die, 'cause
Saturday night was god's way
Of telling me I ought to
Know- proverbial pants
Please not again
Oh proverbial pants
Please not again
All i can do is warn you
In some stupid-half way
Please tell me that you love me
But not too loud
Oh-proverbial pants
Please not again
DON'T COME TOO CLOSE CAUSE YOU'LL RUIN IT
YOU'LL HOLD IT AGAINST ME
INEVITABLY
CONSEQUENTLY
Tell me what am i wearing
When you think of me?
This ought to be embarassing
You- not me
Oh-proverbial pants
Please not again
DON'T COME TOO CLOSE CAUSE YOU'LL RUIN IT
YOU'LL HOLD IT AGAINST ME
INEVITABLY
CONSEQUENTLYEmbed
