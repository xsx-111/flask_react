Temptingly Yours LyricsMaybe I'm wrong
But I could've sworn
I saw your eye twitch
Didn't object
What did you expect?
Now I have to tell you:
Don't come back to tempt me
I'm happy in my misery
You asked what I did
I did what you asked
But I couldn't get it
Right from the start
You went for my heart
Now i have to ask you
Don't come back to tempt me
I'm happy in my misery
It was your idea in the first place
And I know it takes two but on certain days
I try not to think of how it would be if....
I don't pretend
To know where it ends
Wish I could care less
One time I cried more
In 1994
But that doesn't count I guessEmbed
