The Salty Knowledge Of Tears Lyrics
Somebody
Take this love and run away
'Cause I don't care
It is all I can say

I keep on losing you
And finding you

Take me upstairs and
Into your arms
Do not be deceived by my charms

I keep on losing you
And finding you

That's why I fear
All the salty knowledge of tears

Just shut your mouth and kiss me
Just close your eyes
Punish yourself with a handkerchief
I don't reply
That's why I fear
All the salty knowledge of tearsEmbed
