Too Many DJs Lyrics
Everybody wants to be the DJ
Everybody thinks it's, oh, so easy
You think you belong and you come on strong
I can still tell the right from the wrong
I could never be that kind of girl
Nobody takes the time to turn
You always act as if it's understood
But sweet revenge is finger-lickin' good

If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
I don't know
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
I don't know

Here's one thing how to understand me
Loneliness tastes like cotton candy
Answer "I love you" with "I know"
Never check the messages on your answer phone
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
I don't know
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
I don't know
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
I don't know
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
I don't knowEmbed
