Three Nights Lyrics
Tonight, I sit right down in my room
Going over it and over it and over it again
Something's got a hold of me
And I just can't seem to shake myself loose
Let me go, let me go
I'm surely breakin' up
Tonight I'm gonna make that body pay, tonight I'm gonna make that body scream
Tonight I'm gonna drop to my knees

I want you to feel like you make me feel
I hope that I'm gonna make you feel
Like you make me feel
Like you always

There's a lover in my heart, killer in my hands
Whiskey on my breath
Someone handed me a ladder
And for the longest time I've been climbing to the bottom of it
Someone reached out and gave me their hand
And for the longest time I've been tryin' to dislodge my teeth from it
My life's a piece of shit that got caught in my shoe
And I've been grinding that stink into the dirt for a long time now
Now, now, now
I wanna make you feel like you make me feel
I wanna make you feel like you make me feel
Now, now, now, now
Now


I think you stuck my friend with knives
Dragged him out so he could die
One in his heart and three in each side
Knives
One in his heart and three in each side
One in his heart and three in each side
Knives
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Stick me
Stick me (Stick me)
Knives (Stick me)
One in his heart and three in each side
One in his heart and three in each side
Knives, knives, knives
Go ahead
Stick me, stick me, stick me
Knives
Knives, no (Stick me, stick me, stick me, stick me, stick me)Embed
