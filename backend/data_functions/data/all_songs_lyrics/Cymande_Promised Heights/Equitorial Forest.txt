Equitorial Forest LyricsNow we're sailing
Time is stranging
See what's happening
Please start trying
Now now now
Time has come
Move move move
Show me that you can move
Hell hell hell
(?)
Come come come
The day will soon be done
Come come come
The day will soon be done
Move move move
Show me that you can move
Come come come
The day will soon be done
Oh yeah
Come come come
They day will soon be done

Anytime we sail

Sail on
