Changes LyricsLord it gets harder
These time, these times are changing
Faster than before
No love has been displayed out here
And common pains have brought us near
Boy I think its strange
These time, these times are changing
Faster than you know
All that we do should clearly show
That when the need is there love grows
Grow-o-os
Grow-o-ho-hoes
Grow-o-hoesEmbed
