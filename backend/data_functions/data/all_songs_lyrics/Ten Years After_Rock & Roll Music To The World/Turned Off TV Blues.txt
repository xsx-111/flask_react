Turned Off TV Blues LyricsIt's a cold and winter's night and the rain is falling down
It's so cold, cold outside, snow is laying all around
There is blackness in my window, and the silence is the only sound
Well I'm sitting and I'm thinking though I like to watch t.v
It just fills my head with garbage that my eyes ain't surposed to see
Got the turned off t.v. blues now, but I'm lonely as you see
Well I've got a worried feeling, all the pain and misery
Well, it's happenning in the world now, even though I cannot see
Though my body is now with you, still my mind is runnning free
There's just nothing I can do now, though I search from day to day
But the truth is so hard to tell you, and you know it, anyway
It's a cold and winter's evening, I wish my blues would go awayEmbed
