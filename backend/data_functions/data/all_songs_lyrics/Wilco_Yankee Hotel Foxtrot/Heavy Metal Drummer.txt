Heavy Metal Drummer Lyrics
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love

Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blond hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another then another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned

Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks are ringing in my ears

Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another
She fell in love
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing Kiss covers beautiful and stonedEmbed
