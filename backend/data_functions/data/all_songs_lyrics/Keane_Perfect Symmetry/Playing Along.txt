Playing Along Lyrics
At the start of the news day, the fires begin
In words and in pictures, but I'm not listening
I'm not taking it in
I'm going to go to the country, where nothing goes on
Going to bury my head where I can't hear the sound of bombs
Playing along

Me, I'm just playing along
You and I, so many good people
Are just playing along

I'm going to go to a bar where is the jukebox is on
Going to shut out the noise with a rock'n'roll song
Playing along

I'm going to turn up the volume
I'm going to turn up the volume
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think

Tell us a tale of the proud and the free
Sing us a swingtime American melody
From 'Follow The Fleet'
Me, I'm just playing along
You and I, a billion people
All are just playing along

I'm going to turn up the volume
I'm going to turn up the volume
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
I'm going to turn up the volume
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even think
I'm going to turn up the volume
Till I can't even thinkEmbed
