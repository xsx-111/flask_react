Spiralling (demo) LyricsOhh!
Ohh!
I'm waiting for my moment to come
I'm waiting for the movie to begin
I'm waiting for a revelation
I'm waiting for someone to count me in
'Cause now I only see my dreams, in everything I touch
Feel their cold hands on, everything that I love
Cold like some, magnificent skyline
Out of my reach, but always in my eyeline now
We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling
I fashioned you from jewels and stone
I made you in the image of myself
I gave you everything you wanted
So you would never know anything else
But every time I reach for you, you slip through my fingers
Into cold sunlight, laughing at the things that
I had planned, the map of my world gets
Smaller as I sit here, pulling at the loose threads now
We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling
When we fall in love
We're just falling
In love with ourselves
We're spiralling
Did you wanna be a winner?
Did you wanna be an icon?
Did you wanna be famous?
Did you wanna be the president?
Did you wanna start a war?
Did you wanna have a family?
Did you wanna be in love?
Did you wanna be in love?
I never saw the light
I never saw the light
I waited up all night
But I never saw the light
When we fall in love
We're just falling
In love with ourselves
We're spiralling
We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling
Ohh!
Ohh!Embed
