Again and Again (Demo) LyricsWas it all in real time
Or was it just in my mind
Or was I just a ghost passing through you?
Clinging to the wreckage
Until I got the message
Hanging at the edge of the room
Give me something that's real
Give me half of your bitterest pill
Something from under the surface
You actually feel
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in your eyes, in your eyes
They were just easy lies
The lightest words are heavy
And promises are easy
And no one's ever happy or sad for very long
But just because I said it
It doesn't mean I meant it
I guess that was the way all along
I'm just shaping the sound
I'm just turning the syllables round
Dipping my toe in the water
And watching you drown
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in my eyes, in my eyes
They were just easy lies
And it's been a long time waiting
And it's been a lifetime in the making
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
You said when you are alone and afraid
I will come to your aid
But was it just a dream, just a dream
'Cause it was real to me
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same to me
Say these words again and again
And again and againEmbed
