Black Burning Heart (demo) LyricsI wish that I could be
In the cellars of the sea
And disappear in them
Never to be seen again
Live this life
Its unrelenting appetite
For feeding off the weak
Who never had their time to speak
The sky will be my shroud
A monument of cloud
If we could turn back, you can paper over the crack
But it will return now, and your heart will burn black
Give me your hand
Cut the skin, let me in
The molecules of us
Bleeding into one again
The sky will be my shroud
A cenotaph of cloud
If we could turn back, you can paper over the crack
But it will return now, and your heart will burn black
Forgotten my way home, forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start, and it burns my heart
I know
Everything you said was right, and I suppose
Everything is here forever, till it goes
You gave it all away, kept nothing for yourself
Just a picture on the shelf
"Je souhaiterai m'immerger
Dans les profondeurs des mers
Et disparaître
Pour ne plus jamais être vu"
Burning up now
And I'm racing down a road I don't recognise
I realise I've
Forgotten my way home, forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start, and it burns my heart
Turn backEmbed
