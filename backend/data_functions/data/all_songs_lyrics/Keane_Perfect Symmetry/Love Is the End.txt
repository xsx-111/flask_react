Love Is the End Lyrics
Now is the time of our comfort and plenty
These are the days we've been working for
Nothing can touch us and nothing can harm us
And nothing goes wrong anymore
Singing a song with your feet on the dashboard
A cigarette streaming into the night
These are the things that I want to remember
I want to remember you by

It won't come again
Cause love is the end
Oh no, my friend
Love is the end

I took off my clothes and I ran to the ocean
Looking for somewhere to start anew
And when I was drowning in that holy water
All I could think of was you

Oh, my friend
Love is the end
So best not pretend
Cause love is the end
Take it back, don't let it die
Oh, rage against the fall of night
Cause I still do depend on you
Don't say those words that run me through

Oh, love is the end
So let's not pretend
Cause love is the end

And so I tread the only road
The only road I know
Nowhere to go but home
Nowhere to go
Maybe our time is up
But still you can't abandon
All the principles of love
Donâ€™t say those words
Oh, don't say those words
Don't say those words
Don't say those wordsEmbed
