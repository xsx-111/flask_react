The Lovers Are Losing Lyrics
(Watch out)
I dreamed I was drowning
In the river Thames
I dreamed I had nothing at all
Nothing but my own skin
I dreamed I was drifting
On the howling wind
I dreamed I had nothing at all
Nothing but my own skin

Slipped away from your open hands
Into the river
Saw your face looking back at me
I saw my past, and I saw my future

You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
Cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
But any way you look at things
Looks like the lovers are losing
I dreamed I was watching
The young lovers dance
I reached out to touch your hair
But I was watching from a distance

We cling to love like a skidding car
Clings to a corner
I tried to hold onto what we are
The more I squeeze, the quicker we alter

You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
Cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
But any way you look at things
Looks like the lovers are losing

I dreamed I had nothing at all (Nothing but my own skin)
I dreamed I had nothing at all (Nothing but my own skin)
I dreamed I had nothing at all (Nothing but my own skin)
I dreamed I had nothing at all (Nothing at all)
You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
Cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
But any way you look at things
Looks like the lovers are losing

You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
Cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
But in the final reckoning
Looks like the lovers are losing
