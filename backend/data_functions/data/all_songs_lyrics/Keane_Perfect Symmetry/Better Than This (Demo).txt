Better Than This (Demo) LyricsIs this what you meant?
Is this what you dreamed of
When you were making your plans
Shaking the dirt off?
Do you feel like you and I belong?
Just keep your eyes on the road
And nothing can go wrong
You can do so much better than this
You can do so much better than this
I’ve been checking my sums
Oh where did the time go?
Holding my photograph up to the window
Through the paper and refracted sun
I can see all the things I wish that I’d done
You can hang your hopes on the medicine
You can put your faith in the phone-in
You can tell yourself you’re doing your best
You can do so much better than this
Get a grip on yourself
Get a grip on yourself
Could have been something but you’re too late
And you weren’t invited anyway
Because the photographs show the wrong man
Because there is no soap star holding your hand
You don’t see yourself in the freeze frame
Must be someone else using your name
And everyone will be the same
And everyone will glow
And everywhere you’ll see your name
In every shop window
It’s better than this
You can do so much better than this
You can do so much better than this
You can do so much better than thisEmbed
