My Shadow Lyrics
It's time to make a start
To get to know your heart
Time to show your face
Time to take your place
In every speck of dust
In every universe
When you feel most alone
You will not be alone

Just shine a light on me, shine a light
I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
And you will see my shadow on every wall
And you will see my footprint on every floor

It only takes a spark
To tear the world apart
These tiny little things
That make it all begin

Just shine a light on me, shine a light
I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
And you will see my shadow on every wall
And you'll see my reflection in your free fall
Just shine a light on me, shine a light
I'll shine a light on you, shine a light
'Cause when your back's against the wall
That's when you show no fear at all
And when you're running out of time
That's when you hitch your star to mine

We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by
We won't be leaving by the same road that we came by1Embed
