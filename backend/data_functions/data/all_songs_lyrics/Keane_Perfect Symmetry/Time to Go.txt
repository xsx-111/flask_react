Time to Go Lyrics
Now, picturing a scene
Seen it all before
We drink, we drink a little much
Drink a little more
To shake off the nerves and
Take off the edge and
Now is there any way back home?
Seen it all before
And I know the signs
We drink, drink a little much
To stimulate the mind
Now it's two hours to go
Insult everyone that we know
Now it's such a long way home

Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You're making a spectacle
Maybe it's time we left?
I don't wanna spoil your night
I don't wanna hurt your pride
But maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time?
Now eating from your hand
Laugh at every line
Soon losing track of you
Losing track of time
Now it's dead on the dancefloor
And nobody's laughing anymore
Have I become a tiresome bore?

Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You're making a spectacle
Maybe it's time we left?
I don't wanna spoil your night
I don't wanna hurt your pride
But maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time

To go where there's nowhere to hide
From what's broken inside
A faultline rips right open
Under the wide, wide ocean's tide
Under the wide, wide ocean
Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You're making a spectacle
Maybe it's time we left?
I don't wanna spoil your night
I don't wanna hurt your pride
Maybe it's time to fly?
Maybe it's time?
Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time?Embed
