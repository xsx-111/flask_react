Spiralling Lyrics
I'm waiting for my moment to come
I'm waiting for the movie to begin
I'm waiting for a revelation
I'm waiting for someone to count me in
Because now I only see my dreams in everything I touch
Feel their cold hands on everything that I love
Cold like some magnificent skyline
Out of my reach but always in my eye line

Now we're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling

I fashioned you from jewels and stone
I made you in the image of myself
I gave you everything you wanted
So you would never know anything else
But every time I reach for you, you slip through my fingers
Into cold sunlight, laughing at the things that I had planned
The map of my world gets smaller as I sit here
Pulling at the loose threads
Now we're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling
When we fall in love
We're just falling
In love with ourselves
We're spiralling

Did you want to be a winner?
Did you want to be an icon?
Did you want to be famous?
Did you want to be the president?
Did you want to start a war?
Did you want to have a family?
Did you want to be in love?
Did you want to be in love?
I never saw the light
I never saw the light
I waited up all night
But I never saw the light

When we fall in love
We're just falling
In love with ourselves
We're spiralling
We're tumbling down
We're spiralling
Tied up to the ground
We're spiralling4Embed
