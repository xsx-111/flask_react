Better Than This Lyrics
Is this what you meant?
Is this what you dreamed of?
When you were making your plans
Shaking the dirt off?
Do you feel like
You and I belong?
(Oh, ah, oh)
Just keep your eyes on the road
And nothing can go wrong

You could do so much
Better than this
You could do so much
Better than this

I've been checking my sums
Oh where did the time go?
Holding my photograph
Up to the window
Through the paper
And refracted sun
(Oh, ah, oh)
I can see all the things
I wish that I'd done
You can hang your hopes on the medicine
You can put your faith in the phone-in
You can tell yourself you're doing your best
You could do so much better than this

Get a grip on yourself
Get a grip on yourself
Could have been something
But you're too late
And you weren't invited anyway

'Cause the photographs
Show the wrong man
'Cause there is no soap star
Holding your hand
You don't see yourself
In the freeze-frame
Must be someone else
Using your name
And everyone will be the same
And everyone will glow
And everywhere, you'll see your name
In every shop window
It's better than this
You could do so much better than this
You could do so much better than this
You could do so much better than this1Embed
