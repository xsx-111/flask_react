Black Burning Heart Lyrics
I wish that I could be
In the cellars of the sea
And disappear in them
Never to be seen again
Leave this life
Its unrelenting appetite
For feeding off the weak
Who never had their turn to speak

The sky will be my shroud
A monument of clout

If we could turn back
You can paper over the crack
But it will return now
And your heart will burn black

Give me your hand
Cut the skin, let me in
The molecules of us
Bleeding into one again
The sky will be my shroud
A cenotaph of clout

If we could turn back
You can paper over the crack
But it will return now
And your heart will burn black
Forgotten my way home
Forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start
And it burns my heart

I know everything you said was right and I suppose
Everything is here forever till it goes
You gave it all away, kept nothing for yourself
Just a picture on the shelf

Je souhaiterai m'immerger dans les profondeurs des mers
Y disparaître pour ne plus jamais être vu

Burning up
Now I'm racing down a road I don't recognize
I realize I've forgotten my way home
Forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start
And it burns my heart
Turn back1Embed
