Denying Lyrics
Ooh, yeah, yeah, come on

You think you're quick
But I'd like to see you keep up with me
You think you're slick
But I'd like to see you pull a trick on me
You think you're so cool
Hey, big man, you're old school
You think you're smart
But who the hell d'ya think you're talking to?

Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself, tell me why keep on

Denying everything you say
Denying everything you do
So be a fool to yourself forevermore
Trying any kind of move
Tell me, so what's it gonna prove?
You ain't foolin' nobody
You ain't foolin' nobody but yourself
I know you're sweet
But I know you don't wanna be seen that way
Admit defeat, win or lose
Who cares? It's just a game you play
I know you need me
If you stay that way, it's never gonna be
You've got your style
But I know what you really want from me

Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself, tell me why keep on

Denying everything you say
Denying everything you do
So be a fool to yourself forevermore
Trying any kind of move
Tell me, so what's it gonna prove?
You ain't foolin' nobody
You ain't foolin' nobody but yourself

(Ha ha, check yourself)
Check yourself
But don't forget yourself
'Cause you're denying
(Ha ha, ha ha, check yourself, ha, uh-don't forget yourself)
Check yourself
But don't forget yourself
'Cause you're denying
(You're gettin' everything you are
And even everything you need, that's life, come on
Ha ha, check yourself)
Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself, tell me why keep on

Denying everything you say
Denying everything you do
So be a fool to yourself forevermore
Trying any kind of move
Tell me, so what's it gonna prove?
You ain't foolin' nobody
You ain't foolin' nobody
Denying everything you say (everything you say)
Denying everything you do (everything you do)
So be a fool to yourself forevermore (oh)
Trying any kind of move (any kind of move)
Tell me, so what's it gonna prove? (whatcha gonna prove?)
You ain't foolin' nobody
You ain't foolin' nobody (woo)
Denying everything you say (you ain't foolin' nobody)
Denying everything you do (yeah)
So be a fool to yourself forevermore (bein' a fool to yourself ain't helpin' no one else)
Trying any kind of move (any kind of move)
Tell me, so what's it gonna prove? (whatcha gonna prove?)
You ain't foolin' nobody
You ain't foolin' nobody (oh)
Denying everything you say (you ain't foolin' nobody)
Denying everything you do3Embed
