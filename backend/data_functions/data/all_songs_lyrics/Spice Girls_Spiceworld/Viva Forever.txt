Viva Forever Lyrics
Do you still remember
How we used to be
Feeling together
Believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour
My spirit I gave ya
We'd only just begun

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes, I still remember
Every whispered word
The touch of your skin
Giving life from within
Like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers
Like the sands of time
Promises made
Every memory saved
As reflections in my mind
Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now
Was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold
They will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting (everlasting), like the sun (like the sun)
Live forever (live forever), for the moment (for the moment)
Ever searching (ever searching) for the one (for the one)
Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment
Ever searching for the one
Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment
Ever searching for the one
Viva forever, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment
Ever searching for the one7Embed
