Saturday Night Divas Lyrics
Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down
Get down get deeper and down

I'm not alone, no you're not in my mind
You were the victim of your crime, I left you behind
Boy you were a fool, to treat me that way
Not gonna let you, I'm gonna forget you, there's nothing to say

You're a twisted lover, kiss and telling on a superstar
That's what you are
But it was Saturday night, I know the feeling was right
I didn't know we'd get so far

Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down
Get down get deeper and down
Take it from me, you know I mean what I'm saying
Better watch out, you'd better wise up to mind games he's playing
He may have the looks, he may have the charms
But where does he go, what does he do when he's not in your arms?

Keep your head up high, don't you know you are the super fly
And that ain't no lie
Because it's Saturday night, we got a feeling that's right
Don't you know we'll get so high?

Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down (Saturday night)
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down
Get down get deeper and down
Get down deeper and down (get down Saturday night)
You're a twisted lover, kiss and telling on a superstar
That's what you are
But it was Saturday night, I knew the feeling was right
I didn't know we'd get so far

Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get down, deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down (get down Saturday night)
Saturday night
Get down, get deeper and down (ho-oh)
Get down, get deeper and down (oh-oh)
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down (Saturday night)
Get down, get deeper and down

Wanna get down, wanna get down
Wanna get down, Saturday night
Wanna get down, wanna get down
Wanna get down, Saturday night
Wanna get down, wanna get down
Wanna get down, Saturday night
Wanna get down, wanna get down
Wanna get down, Saturday night
Get down, get deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down (get down Saturday night)
Get down, get deeper and down (yeah, Saturday night)
Get down, get deeper and down (get down on Saturdat Night)
Saturday night
Get down, deeper and down
Get down, get deeper and down (get down Saturday night)
