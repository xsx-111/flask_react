Step to Me Lyrics
Why don't ya step to me
Let me take you for a ride
I'll take where you can run
But you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil, tell the truth
I can tell you don't know what to do

I can't believe what I heard yesterday
About your boastin' and lyin'
Whispering words you had no right to say
And now there's no use denying, yeah

Big words and small promises
You're living in your dreams, oh
Smell the coffee cause it's time to wake up
Sometimes the truth can be mean, yeah

Now it's time, come prove your words to me (ooh)
If you think you've got what it takes (ooh)
There's no time for your insecurities (ooh)
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
Why don't ya step to me
Let me take you for a ride (take you for a ride)
I'll take where you can run
But you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil, tell the truth
I can tell you don't know what to do

I'm tired of hearing from your cheap talkin' friends
Just how you run me around, ha
I know you boys ain't got nothing better to do
Than try to keep your girl down

Small town, big attitude
Is more than just a state of your mind, yeah
But you and me belongs to me and you
Cause honesty's so hard to find

Now it's time, come prove your words to me (ooh)
If you think you've got what it takes (ooh)
There's no time for your insecurities (ooh)
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
Why don't ya step to me
Let me take you for a ride (take you for a ride)
I'll take where you can run
But you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil, tell the truth
Fooling yourself makes a fool out of you

Why don't you step to me
If you think you've got what it takes
I heard the rumour
About your loving, well it's fake
Ch-ch-ch-check yourself
If you think I'm gonna stand for that
What do you think I am?
Some kind of pussycat
Chit-chat to the girls and the boys
You call your friends
Tell them that you've never been
To the place where lovin' ends
You never graduated from
The school of love, you see
So come on boy
Why don't ya step to me?
Now it's time, come prove your words to me (ooh)
So you think you've got what it takes (ooh)
There's no time for your insecurities (ooh)
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face

Why don't ya step to me?
Let me take you for a ride (take you for a ride)
I'll take where you can run
But you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil, tell the truth
I can tell you don't know what to do
Why don't ya step to me?
Let me take you for a ride (take you for a ride)
I'll take where you can run
But you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil, tell the truth
Fooling yourself makes a fool out of you4Embed
