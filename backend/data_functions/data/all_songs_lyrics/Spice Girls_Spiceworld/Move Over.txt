Move Over Lyrics
Generation next, generation next (ah, generation next)
Generation next, generation next (generation)
Generation next, generation next (generation, yeah)
Generation next, generation next

Hold it down, feel the noise
Let 'em know it's a vibe, pick it up it's alive
Hold it down, feel the noise
Let 'em know it's a vibe, pick it up it's alive

Move over, yeah, don't do it over (yeah yeah yeah)
'Cause it's over, yeah yeah yeah (don't do it over)
Generation next (yeah yeah, generation yeah)

Next phase, next stage, next craze, next wave
Let me tell you 'bout a thing
Gotta put it to the test
It's a celebration, motivation, generation next
We're sowing the seed (seed), every colour every creed (creed)
Teach never preach, listen up and and take heed

Take the heat, feel the flow
'Cause you're ready to burn and we're ready to go
Take the heat, feel the flow
'Cause you're ready to burn and we're ready to go
Move over, yeah, don't do it over (yeah yeah yeah)
'Cause it's over, yeah yeah yeah (don't do it over)
Generation next (yeah yeah, generation yeah)

Let me tell you 'bout a thing ('bout a thing)
Gotta put it to the test (to the test)
It's a celebration, motivation, generation next
You gotta know the rules (rules), if you wanna play the game (game)
Respect and dedication never riding on the fame (dedication on the fame)

Dedication, celebration, phenomenation, good vibration
Mel-o-vation, domination, baby nation, recreation
Imagination, (crazy nation)

Move over, yeah, don't do it over (yeah yeah yeah)
'Cause it's over yeah yeah yeah (don't do it over)
Move over, yeah, don't do it over (yeah, yeah)
'Cause it's over, yeah yeah yeah
Generation next (yeah yeah, generation yeah)

Generation next, generation next (ah, generation next)
Generation next, generation next (generation)
Generation next, generation next (generation, yeah)
Generation next, generation next
Generation next, generation next (ah, generation next)
Generation next, generation next (generation)
Generation next, generation next (generation, yeah)
Generation next, generation next2Embed
