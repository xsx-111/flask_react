The Lady Is a Vamp Lyrics
Elvis was a Kula Shaker
Marley, Ziggy, melody makers
She's a Bond babe, kick some ass
Doctor No, this girl's got class
Charlie's Angels, girls on top
Handbags, heels, their pistols rock
"Baby Love", a soul glam queen
Sing the blues, a love Supreme
(Sixties Twiggy set the pace
Way back then she had the face)

That's all in the past, legends built to last
But she's got something new
She's a power girl in a nineties world
And she knows just what to do

'Cause the lady is a vamp, she's a vixen not a tramp
She's a da da da da da da da
Come on fellas, place your bets, 'cause you ain't seen nothing yet
She's the talk of the town, she's the best, yes

Jackie O., we loved her so
So did Mr. President, as far as we know
Norma Jeane had a Seven Year Itch
Some Like It Hot to a fever pitch
Sandy, Danny, summer love
Pink Ladies, T-birds, Blue Moon above
That's all in the past, legends built to last
But she's got something new
She's a power girl in a nineties world
She's a downtown swinging dude

'Cause the lady is a vamp, she's a vixen not a tramp
She's a da da da da da da da
Come on fellas, place your bets, 'cause you ain't seen nothing yet
She's the talk of the town, she's the best, yes

Scary, Baby, Ginger, (Posh), (Sporty), yes, now that's your lot
We're the Spice Girls, ready to go
Ladies and gents, can you please take your seats?
And we hope that you enjoy the show
Thank you very much3Embed
