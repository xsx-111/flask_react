Never Give Up on the Good Times Lyrics
She used to be a chancer, sparkle in the rain
Told me she needed a friend
Is she going crazy? Baby's on the way
Seems like the day never ends

Everybody needs some affection (Ah-ah-ah)
Never shy (Never shy)
Gotta try (Gotta try)
Wherever you're going

Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)

Bossa nova baby, heart is never soul
Shouting but he's never heard
Eyes all wide and open, the streets are paved with gold
Someone's come back on their word

Everybody needs some affection (Ah-ah-ah)
Never shy (Never shy)
Gotta try (Gotta try)
Wherever you're going
Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)

Down and dirty city, feeling outta place
Maybe you've ran out of time
He treats her like a lady, smile upon her face
Make up the last of the lines

Everybody needs some attention (Ah-ah-ah)
Never shy (Never shy)
Gotta try (Gotta try)
Wherever you're going

Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Believe in the love that you find)
Hey now, look around, pick yourself up off the ground
I said hey now look around pick yourself up off the ground (Never give up)
I said hey now look around pick yourself up off the ground
I said hey now look around pick yourself up off the ground
I said, hey (Never give up)

I said never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)2Embed
