Do It Lyrics
Oh yeah, come on
Come on and do it (Yeah)
Come on and do it (Do it, do it)

It's just another thing, you gotta keep your eye fixed on the road
Do what your mama said, I will not be told
Keep your mouth shut, keep your legs shut, get back in your place
Ha, blameless, shameless, damsel in disgrace

Who cares what they say
Because the rules are for breaking
(I said-a) Who made them anyway?
You've gotta show what you feel, don't hide

Come on and do it
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel
Come on and do it
You've gotta make it real
Come on and do it
It's time to free what's in your soul
You've got to get it right, this time
Come on, freak and lose control
Remember things like you should be seen and never heard
Give a little respect to me and it will be returned
Keep your head down, keep your nose clean, your back against the wall
Girl there's no way out for you, you are sure to fall

Who cares what they do
Because it's yours for the taking
So, it's not for you anyway
Make your own rules to live by

Come on and do it
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel
Come on and do it
You've gotta make it real
Come on and do it
It's time to free what's in your soul
You've got to get it right, this time
Come on, freak and lose control

You might do the wrong thing (Might do the wrong thing)
For the right reasons (For the right reasons)
Don't just do the right thing (Don't do the right thing)
To be pleasing (To be pleasin', baby)
Who cares what they say
Because the rules are for breaking
(I said-a) Who made them anyway?
You've gotta show what you feel, don't hide

Come on and do it
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel
Come on and do it
You've gotta make it real
Come on and do it
It's time to free what's in your soul
You've got to get it right, this time
Come on, freak and lose control
Come on and do it (do it, do it)
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel
Come on and do it (Come on)
You've gotta make it real
Come on and do it (Oh)
It's time to free what's in your soul
You've got to get it right (Get it right), this time (This time)
Come on, freak and lose control
Come on and do it (Come on and do it, oh yeah)
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel
Come on and do it (Do it, do it)
You've gotta make it real
Come on and do it (Come on, come on)
It's time to free what's in your soul
You've got to get it right (Get it right), this time (This time)
Come on, freak and lose control
Come on and do it (Oh yeah)
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel
Come on and do it (Come on)
You've gotta make it real3Embed
