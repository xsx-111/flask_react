Someone Always Hates Someone LyricsLast night I shook hands with the devil
In a dream that I can never lose
He laughed when he saw me cryin'
At the pictures on the evening news
He said it's not really a dilemma
You're just a little out of touch
Don't think of the situation
Cos it'll make you think too much
Someone always hates someone
Someone always hates someone
Someone always sells a gun
Cos someone always hates someone
A child will be born tomorrow
As open as an empty cup
And we'll fill it with hope and sorrow
The very things that messed us up
We'll ask him to join the congregation
A hindu moslem christian or jew
Pretty soon he'll recognise his brothers
But soon he'll know the enemy too
Someone always hates someone
Someone always hates someone
Someone always buys a gun
Cos someone always hates someone
I died and I went to heaven
In a dream I never had before
A good friend who had gone before me
Had kindly left my name at the door
I looked on the face of the almighty
Couldn't help myself
I started to shout
How come you made a mess of things
How come you didn't work it out
He said
Someone always hates someone
Someone always hates someone
There's so much love for everyone
But someone always hates someoneEmbed
