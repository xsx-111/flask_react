Web of Lies LyricsJust a minor indiscretion
No need to apologise
I don't want this to become an obsession
But I just can't believe my eyes
Evidence in my possession
Points a finger straight at you
Every day I'm closer to a confession
If only I can face the truth
Every mistake that you make
Drives the knife into my heart
Twisting down deeper and deeper
Still tearing me apart
I'm trying to find a grain of truth in this web of lies
I'm trying to find a grain of truth in this web of lies
You swear to god you're on the level
And you've nothing more to hide
Then I turn around and "speak of the devil"
You're both together side by side
Every mistake that you make
Seems more careless than the last
I'm just amazed that you try to cover
The tracks of your past
I'm trying to find a grain of truth in this web of lies
I'm trying to find a grain of truth in this web of lies
Have you got me in your pocket?
Am I eating from your hand
I think we need to shed some light on the matter
So I can really understand
Darlin' there's no perfect crime
That's left without a trace
And right now I'm judge and I'm jury
Till I can rest my case
I'm trying to find a grain of truth in this web of lies
I'm trying to find a grain of truth in this web of liesEmbed
