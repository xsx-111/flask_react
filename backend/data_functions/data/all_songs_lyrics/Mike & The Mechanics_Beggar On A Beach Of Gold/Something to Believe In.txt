Something to Believe In LyricsThere's a silver moon
Shining in the room
Where we sleep like spoons together
Lying in the dark
I can feel your heart
And it beats with mine forever
Coming from the street
You can feel the heat
As the city sleeps
In the silence
And the perfect light
Of a summers night
Is broken by the violence
Then a woman screams
And a baby cries
And someone's dream is shattered
When the nightmares dance
Before your eyes
They can leave you bruised and battered
Then I realise
That I'm by your side
And I'm listening to you breathing
And in this room
With the silver moon
You're something to believe in
There's a boy out there
With a crazy stare
And a gun to make a living
In a sea of hate
Where you can't think straight
In a world that's unforgiving
And it's all gone bad
In a world gone mad
And you're scared that you'll discover
That the one you love
And the one you trust
Is like all the others
Then I realise
That I'm by your side
And I'm listening to you breathing
And in this room
With the silver moon
You're something to believe in
You're something to believe in
And in this room
With the silver moon
You're something to believe inEmbed
