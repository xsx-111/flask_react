Going Going.... Home LyricsGoing going home
I hold a memory I can't let go
Going going home
Going going home
You're long ago
And far away
But I can still remember you
Going, going home
I've got a memory that I can't let go
And I know I won't be alone
I'm goin' home
The ones I love will all be there
And I can see their smiling faces
Oh I'm giving in
It's like living in a war
It can't be right
And I can't fight this world
No more
I don't care where this highway goes
Going going home
I know I won't be alone
I'm going
I'm going home
I know you'll always wait for me
And now I'm going back to you
Oh I'm giving in
It's like living in a war
It can't be right
And I can't fight this world
No more
I don't care where this highway goes
