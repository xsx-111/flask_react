Mea Culpa LyricsYou can't forgive
And you won't forget
We did something
That we both regret mea culpa
I held my breath while you
Took your time
To tell the world
What's yours is mine mea culpa
You don't need me
You don't need anyone at all
You've got what you desired
You lit the fire
And watched the rise and fall
And in your eyes I could see my face
A non believer
In a state of grace mea culpa
I see no reason for your complaint
You got the sinner
And not the saint mea culpa
I can't say much I can't say anything at all
You tell the story well
Then you retire to watch the rise and fall
You never know what's in your heart
Until you look
You never know what's in your heart
Until you look
Take a look
Just take a look
Just take a look
Just take a look
