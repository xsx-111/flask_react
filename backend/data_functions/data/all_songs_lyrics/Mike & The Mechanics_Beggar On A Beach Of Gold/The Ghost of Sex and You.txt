The Ghost of Sex and You LyricsIt was an unbelievable night
She was an unremarkable girl
You may not call it poetry
But it changed my world
It was an unforgettable dawn
She was an indisputable fact
Even if I could have
I might not have it back
It's an unexceptional day
She's an unavoidable truth
Uncompromised elation
Suspended since my youth
It's an unforgivable lie
I have nothing in my defence
There can be no forgiveness
To caution this descent
It wasn't in a dream
A film or on TV
This was really happening
Happening to me
Though I may protest
Suggest I never knew
The ghost comes back to haunt me
The ghost of sex and you
I held her hand outside the hotel
Kissed her mouth in the back of the car
Whether fact or fantasy
I knew we'd gone too far
I feel her breath on the back of my neck
She's lying naked here on the floor
Wrap the sheet around her
Disappear beyond the door
It wasn't in a dream
A film or on TV
This was really happening
Happening to me
Though I may protest
Suggest I never knew
The ghost comes back to haunt me
The ghost of sex and you
It was an unbelievable night
She was an unremarkable girl
You may not call it poetry
But it changed my world
The ghost of sex and you
It was an unforgettable dawn
She was an indisputable fact
Even if I could have
I might not have it back
Sex and you
It's an unexceptional day
She's an unavoidable truth
Uncompromised elation
Suspended since my youth
Sex and you
It's an unforgivable lie
I have nothing in my defence
There can be no forgiveness
To caution this descent
The ghost of sex and youEmbed
