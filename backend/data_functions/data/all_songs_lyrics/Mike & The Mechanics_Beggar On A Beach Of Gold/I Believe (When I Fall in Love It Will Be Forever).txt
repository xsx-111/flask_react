I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever) LyricsShattered dreams worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began then was done
Now I stare into a cold empty well
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Without despair
We will share and the joys of caring
Will not be replaced
What has been must never end
And with the strength we have
Won't be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Ever, ever, ever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I'm so glad that I found someone
To believe in again
God surely answered my prayer
God surely answered my prayer
You know god surely answered my prayer
You know god surely answered my prayer
God always will answer your prayers
Believe in one who will answer my prayer
Thank you god
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Come on let's fall in love
You're the woman I've been waiting for
Come on let's fall in love
You're the girl that I really adore
Come on let's fall in love
Come on baby let's fall in love
Come on let'sEmbed
