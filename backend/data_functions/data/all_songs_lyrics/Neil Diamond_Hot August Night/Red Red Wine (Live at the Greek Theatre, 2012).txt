Red Red Wine (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics
Red, red wine
Go to my head
You make me forget that I
I still need her so
Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
But memories won't go
No, memories won't go

I had sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong and I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine, yeah
Stay close to me
And don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart
My blue, blue heart
That red, red wine
That red, red wine
That red, red wine
Oh yesEmbed
