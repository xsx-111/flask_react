Forever in Blue Jeans (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics
Money talks
It don't sing and dance and it don't walk
As long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be forever in blue jeans, yeah

Alright up there?
Honey's sweet
It ain't nothin' next to baby's treats
And if you pardon me, I'd like to say
We'll do okay forever in blue jeans, yeah

Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone you and I
There's nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now

Money talks
But it can't sing and dance
And it can't walk
As long as I can have you
Here with me, I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, yeah
Honey's sweet
It ain't nothin' next to baby's treats
And if you pardon me I'd like to say
We'll do okay forever in blue jeans, yeah

Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight by the fire
All alone, you and I
(Maybe tonight)
There's nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now

Money talks
But it don't sing and dance
And it don't walk
As long as I can have you
Here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
