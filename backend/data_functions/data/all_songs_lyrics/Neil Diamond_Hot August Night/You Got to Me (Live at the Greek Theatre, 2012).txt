You Got to Me (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics
Mama she always told me it would happen
She never said that it would happen like this
Papa said "some little girl'll catch you nappin'
Some little girl'll get to you with her kiss"

You got to me
Brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
Got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine

Used to slip through every girl's hand like water
Never was one who could ever tie me down
Straight ahead and steady as Gibraltar
Till you brought me tumblin' to the ground

You got to me
Brought me to may knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
Got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine
Want everybody dancing
(Down on my knees
Made me say please)

You got to me
Brought me to may knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
Got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine

You got to me, babe
You got to me
You got, you got, you got to me
You got, you got, you got to me
