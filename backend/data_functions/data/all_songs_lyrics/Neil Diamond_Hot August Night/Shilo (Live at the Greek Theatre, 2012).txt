Shilo (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics
Young child with dreams
Dream every dream on your own
When children play
Seems like you end up alone

Papa says he'd love to be with you
If he had the time
So you turn to the only friend you can find
There in your mind

Shilo, when I was young
I used to call your name
When no one else would come
Shilo, you always came and we'd play

Counting the years
Keeping my dreams to myself
Till the young girl with fire
Made me trust somebody else

Held my hand out, I let her take me
Blind as a child
All I saw was the way
That she made me smile
She made me smile
Shilo, when I was young
I used to call your name
When no one else would come
Shilo, you always came and we'd play

Lalalalalala, lalalalalalala

Had a dream and it filled me with wonder
She had other plans
"Got to go' said she knows that I understand
I understand

Shilo, when I was young
I used to call your name
When no one else would come
Shilo, you always came
Come today, come today, come todayEmbed
