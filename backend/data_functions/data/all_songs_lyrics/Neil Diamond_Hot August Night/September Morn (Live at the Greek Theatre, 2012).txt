September Morn (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics
Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long, I hardly knew you
Standing in the door
Stay with me a while
I only wanna sing for you
We've traveled halfway around the world
To find ourselves again

September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September mornings still can make me feel that way

And look at what you've done
Well, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In the corner of your room
Look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before
September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September mornings still can make me feel that way
Dee-da-doo


September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September mornings still can make me feel that way
September morn
We danced, we danced, we danced that night away
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September mornings still can make me feel that way
September mornings still can make me feel that wayEmbed
