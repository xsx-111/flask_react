Beautiful Noise (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the street
Got a beautiful sound
It's got a beautiful beat
It's a beautiful noise
Goin' on everywhere
Like the clickety-clack
Of a train on a track
It's got rhythm to spare

It's a beautiful noise
A sound that I love
It fits me as well
As a hand in a glove
Yes, it does, yes, it does

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the park
Hey, it's the sound of the kids
And it plays until dark
Hear, it's the sound of the cars
And their furious flights
But there's even romance
In the way that they dance
To the beat of the lights

It's a beautiful noise
A sound that I love
And it makes me feel good
Just like a hand in a glove
Yes, it does, yes, it does
What a beautiful noise

It's a beautiful noise
Made of joy and of strife
Like a symphony played
By the passing parade
It's the music of life

It's a beautiful noise
A sound that I love
And it fits me as well
As a hand in a glove
Yes, it does, yes, it does
What a beautiful noise
Comin' into my room
And it's beggin' for me
Just to give it a tune
Yeah, it's begging for me
Just to give it a tuneEmbed
