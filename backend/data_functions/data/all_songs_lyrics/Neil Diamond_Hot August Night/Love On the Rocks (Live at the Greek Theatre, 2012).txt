Love On the Rocks (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics
Love on the rocks, ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink, I'll tell you some lies
I got nothing to lose, so I'll just sing the blues
For a while
I gave you my heart, gave you my soul
You left me alone here with nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone and now all I want
Is a smile

First they say they want you, even they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there, walking in a storm
When they know they have you then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say, you got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need, you can say what you want
Not much you can do when the feeling is gone
Maybe blue skies above but it's cold
When your love's on the rocks

First they say they want you, even they really need you
And suddenly you find you're out there, walking in a storm
When they know they have you then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say, you got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
Love on the rocks ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink, I'll tell you some lies
Yesterday's gone and now all I want
Is a smileEmbed
