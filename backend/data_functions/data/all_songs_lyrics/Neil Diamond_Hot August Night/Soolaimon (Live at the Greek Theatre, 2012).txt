Soolaimon (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics
Lord of my want, want, want
God of my need, need, need
Leading me on, on, on
Onto my woman, she dance for the sun
Lord of my day
God of my night, night, night
She flew away
Taking me home and she callin' my name
Soolaimon

Come she come say
Ride on the night
Sun becomes day
Soolaimon
Day, it shall provide
Soolaimon

Soo, soolaimon
Soolai, soolai, soolaimon
Soo, soolaimon
Soolai, soolai, soolaimon
Soo, soolaimon
Soolai, soolai, soolaimon
Soo, soolaimon
Soolai, soolai, soolaimon
Lord of my want, want, want
God of my need, need, need
Leading me on, on, on
Onto my woman, she dance for the sun
Lord of my day
God of my night
She for the way, way, way
Taking me home and she callin' my name

Lord of my want
God of my need
Taking me homeEmbed
