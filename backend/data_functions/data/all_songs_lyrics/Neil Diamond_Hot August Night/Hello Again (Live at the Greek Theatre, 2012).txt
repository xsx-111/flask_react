Hello Again (Live at the Greek Theatre, 2012) Lyrics

Hello again, hello
I just called to say 'hello'
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
I know it's late
I just couldn't wait
Hello, my friends, hello
I just called to let you know
I think about you every night
When I'm here alone
And you're there at home, hello

Lately it's been crazy
Maybe I'm to blame
Won't you put your heart above your head?
We've been through it all
You loved me just the same
And when you're not there
I just need to hear

Hello, again hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to want you like I do
And to feel this way
When I hear you say 'hello'
Hello, my friends, hello
It's good to need you so
I think about you every night
And I know it's late
I just couldn't wait
HelloEmbed
