Heal Over LyricsIt isn't very difficult to see why
You are the way you are
Doesn't take a genius to realise
That sometimes life is hard
It's gonna take time
But you'll just have to wait
You're gonna be fine
But in the meantime
Come over here, lady
Let me wipe your tears away
Come a little nearer, baby
'Cause you'll heal over
Heal over
Heal over someday
And I don't wanna hear you tell yourself
That these feelings are in the past
You know it doesn't mean they're off the shelf
Because pain's built to last
Everybody sails alone
But we can travel side by side
Even if you fail
You know that no one really minds
Come over here, lady
Let me wipe your tears away
Come a little nearer, baby
'Cause you'll heal over
Heal over
Heal over someday
Don't hold on but don't let go
I know it's so hard
You've got to try to trust yourself
I know it's so hard, so hard
Come over here, lady
Let me wipe your tears away
Come a little nearer, baby
'Cause you'll heal over
Heal over
Heal over someday
Yeah, you're gonna heal over...3Embed
