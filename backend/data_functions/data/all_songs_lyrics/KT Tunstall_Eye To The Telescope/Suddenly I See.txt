Suddenly I See Lyrics
Her face is a map of the world
Is a map of the world
You can see she's a beautiful girl
She's a beautiful girl

And everything around her is a silver pool of light
The people who surround her feel the benefit of it
It makes you calm
She holds you, captivated in her palm

Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

I feel like walking the world
Like walking the world
And you can hear she's a beautiful girl
She's a beautiful girl
She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white
Makes you feel warmer
When you're trying to remember what you heard
She likes to leave you hanging on her word

Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

And she's taller than most
And she's looking at me
I can see her eyes looking from the page of a magazine
She makes me feel like I could be a tower
A big strong tower, yeah
The power to be, the power to give
The power to see, yeah, yeah (Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give
The power to see, yeah, yeah (Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give
The power to see, yeah, yeah, yeah (Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give
The power to see, yeah, yeah (Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give
The power to see, yeah, yeah
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah (Suddenly I see)
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me, yeah yeah (Suddenly I see)
Suddenly I see (Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me8Embed
