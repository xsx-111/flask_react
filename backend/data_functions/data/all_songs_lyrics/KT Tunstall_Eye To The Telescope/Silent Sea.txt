Silent Sea LyricsI was happy in my harbour when you cut me loose
Floating on an ocean and confused
Winds are whipping waves up like skyscrapers
And the harder they hit me, the less I seem to bruise
And when I find the controls
I'll go where I like
I'll know where I want to be
But maybe for now
I'll stay right here
On a silent sea
On a silent sea
I was happy in my harbour when you cut me loose
Floating on an ocean and confused
And when I find the controls
I'll go where I like
I'll know where I want to be
But maybe for now
I'll stay right here
On a silent sea
On a silent sea
I'll stay right here
On a silent sea
On a silent sea
And when I find the controls
I'll go where I like
I'll know where I want to be
But maybe for now
I'll stay right here
On a silent seaEmbed
