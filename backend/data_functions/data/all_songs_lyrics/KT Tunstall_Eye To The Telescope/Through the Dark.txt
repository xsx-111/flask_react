Through the Dark LyricsAs I walk away
I look over my shoulder
To see what I'm leaving behind
Pieces of puzzles
And wishes on eyelashes fail
Oh, how do I show
All the love inside my heart
Well this is all new
And I'm feeling my way through the dark
And I used to talk
With honest conviction
Of how I predicted my world
I'm gonna leave it to stargazers
Tell me what your telescope says
Oh, what is in store for me now
It's coming apart
I know that it's true
'Cause I'm feeling my way through the dark
Try to find a light on somewhere
Try to find a light on somewhere
I'm finding I'm falling in love with the dark, oh yeah
Oh, what do I know
I don't care where I start
For my troubles are few
As I'm feeling my way through the dark
Through the dark
I'm feeling my way through the darkEmbed
