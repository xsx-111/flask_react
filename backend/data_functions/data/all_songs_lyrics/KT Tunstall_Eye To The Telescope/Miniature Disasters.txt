Miniature Disasters LyricsI don't want to be second best
Don't want to stand in line
Don't want to fall behind
Don't want to get caught out
Don't want to do without
And the lesson I must learn
Is that I've got to wait my turn
Looks like I got to be hot and cold
I got to be taught and told
Got to be good as gold
But perfectly honestly, oh
I think it would be good for me
'Cause it's a hindrance to my health
That I'm a stranger to myself
Miniature disasters and minor catastrophes
Bring me to my knees
Well I must be my own master
Or a miniature disaster will be
It will be the death of me
I don't have to raise my voice
Don't have to be underhand
Just got to understand
That it's gonna be up and down
It's gonna be lost and found
And I can't take to the sky
Before I like it on the ground
And I need to be patient
And I need to be brave
Need to discover
How I need to behave
And I'll find out the answers
When I know what to ask
But I speak a different language
And everybody's talking too fast
Miniature disasters and minor catastrophes
Bring me to my knees
Well I must be my own master
Or a miniature disaster will be, will be , oh
I've got to run a little faster
Or a miniature disaster will be, will be , oh
I need to know I'll last if a little
Or a miniature disaster will be, will be , oh
Miniature disaster hits me
It could be the death of meEmbed
