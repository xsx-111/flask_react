Under the Weather LyricsUnder this national raincloud
I'm getting soaked to the skin
Trying to find my umbrella
But I don't know where to begin
And it's simply irrational weather
I can't even hear myself think
Constantly bailing out water
But still feel like I'm gonna sink
Cos I'm under the weather
Just like the world
So sorry for being so bold
When I turn out the light
You're out of sight
Although I know that I'm not alone
Feels like home
Feels like home
You say you feel like a natural person
You haven't got nothing to hide
So why do you feel imperfection
Cut like a sword in your side
Cos you're under the weather
Just like the world
So sorry for being so bold
When I turn out the light
You're out of sight
Although I know that I'm not alone
Feels like home
Feels like home
Feels like home
Feels like home
Yes, it feels like home
Yes, it feels like home
Oh cos I'm under the weather
Just like the world
And I need somebody to hold
When I turn out the light
You're out of sight
Although I know that I'm not alone
It feels like homeEmbed
