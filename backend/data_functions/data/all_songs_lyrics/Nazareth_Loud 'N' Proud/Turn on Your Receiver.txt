Turn on Your Receiver LyricsTurn on your receiver
I'm gonna let it on the line
'Cause I'm a great believer
In hangin' on to what is mine
So come over here and listen
I don't want you to be missin'
What I say
And I ain't gonna waste my time
Sayin' it all again
I've been hearin' stories
'Fact the word's all over town
I've had my share of worries
Ever since you've been around
So come over here and listen
I don't want you to be missin'
What I say
And I ain't gonna waste my time
Sayin' it all again
Turn on your receiver
There's a message comin' through
Keep your hands off my woman
Keep your hands to yourself
Keep your hands off my woman1Embed
