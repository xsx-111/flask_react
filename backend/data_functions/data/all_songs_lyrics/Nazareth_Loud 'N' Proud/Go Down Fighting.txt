Go Down Fighting LyricsI'm gonna go down fightin'
I'm gonna go down fightin'
'Cause I know that I'm right and
I'm gonna go down fightin' for your love
Well, I know what you're thinkin'
You got me up against the wall
But the higher that you're flyin'
The further down you gotta fall
Now don't you be fooled by my shakin' knees
'Cause I can fight dirty
And when I'm scared I get mean
I'm gonna go down fightin'
I'm gonna go down fightin'
'Cause I know that I'm right and
I'm gonna go down fightin' for your love
I know you're thinkin'
That the odds is on your side
First thing you gotta learn is
That it just don't come down to size
I can see the seeds of doubt
Begin to grow on your face
If you wanna back down now
You know, that's no disgrace
I'm gonna go down fightin'
I'm gonna go down fightin'
'Cause I know that I'm right and
I'm gonna go down fightin' for your love1Embed
