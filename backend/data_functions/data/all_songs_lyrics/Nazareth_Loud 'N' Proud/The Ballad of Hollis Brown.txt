The Ballad of Hollis Brown LyricsHollis Brown he lived
On the outside of town
Hollis Brown he lived
On the outside of town
With his wife and five children
In his cabin broken down
He looked for work and money
And he walked a ragged mile
He looked for work and money
And he walked a ragged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy now
They're tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and you wonder why
With every breath that breathe
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
Is there anyone that knows?
Is there anyone that cares?
You prayed to the Lord above
To please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
To please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell you
That you ain't got no friend
Your baby's a-cryin' louder
Now it's poundin' on your brain
Your baby's a-cryin' louder
Now it's poundin' on your brain
Your wife's screams are a-stabbin' you
Like dirty, drivin' rain
Your grass is turnin' black
And there's no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On them seven shotgun shells
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall
Your brain it is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain it is a-bleedin'
And your legs just can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand
There's seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the oceans pounding roar
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people bornEmbed
