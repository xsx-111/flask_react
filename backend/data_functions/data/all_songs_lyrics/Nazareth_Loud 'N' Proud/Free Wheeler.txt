Free Wheeler LyricsI'm a free wheeler, I'm an underground dealer
I'm the kind of guy you never get to know
You can quit thinking about stoppin' my drinkin'
You know, I'll go the road I choose to go
No one's ever gonna rearrange me
No one's ever gonna try to change me
You know, I'll go the road I choose to go
I'm a free lover, living undercover
When things get hot, I have to move out fast
When they know I'm lyin', the women come cryin'
But still I go the road I choose to go
No one's ever gonna rearrange me
No one's ever gonna try to change me
You know, I'll go the road I choose to go
I'm doin' fine, takin' my time
I don't want to settle down
No, no, noEmbed
