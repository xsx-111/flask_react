Succexy Lyrics
Lonesome for no one when
The room was empty
And war as we knew it was obsolete
Nothing could beat complete denial

All we do is talk, sit, switch screens
As the homeland plans enemies
All we do is talk, static split-screens
As the homeland plans enemies

Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy

Let's drink to the military
The glass is empty
Faces to fill and cars to feed
Nothing could beat complete denial

All we do is talk, sit, switch screens
As the homeland plans enemies
All we do is talk, static split-screens
As the homeland plans enemies
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy, so succexy)
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy, so succexy)
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy, so succexy)
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy)

Passive attraction, programmed reaction
Passive attraction, programmed reaction
Action, distraction, more information
Flesh saturation, lips on a napkin
Ass, ass, ass
Where does the time go?
We're waking up so slowly
Days are horizontal lately
Out of body, watched from above
Out of body, watched from above
Passive attraction, programmed reaction
More information, cash masturbation
Follow the pattern - the hemlines, the headlines
Action, distraction, faster than fashion
Faster than fashion, faster than fashion
Lonesome for no one when
The room was empty
And war as we knew it was obsolete
Nothing could beat denial1Embed
