The List Lyrics
All dressed down to catch a whiff of the buzz
Smells like the death of the last great cause
But you and I, we've been through that
That is not our fate
Give my face to the back of your head
Loyal in your shadow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Broken accidental stars

Do lawyers have lawyers?
Do landlords have landlords?
We're wondering
One more cheap suit in the loop
More chlorine in the pool
The blonde doll smiling behind us
Says, "One day, you'll be just like us."

All dressed up to catch a glimpse of the list
We've seen some success, it looks like a camero
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Broken accidental stars

Do lawyers have lawyers?
Do landlords have landlords?
We're wondering
One more cheap suit in the loop
More chlorine in the pool
The blonde doll smiling behind us
Says, "One day, you'll be just like us."
Calling from the next hotel – can you put me on the list?
Who we are now, we will always be – the best haircuts are taken
Calling from the next hotel – can you put me on the list?
Who we are now, we will always be – the best haircuts are taken
Calling from the next hotel – can you put me on the list?
Who we are now, we will always be – the best haircuts are taken
Calling from the next hotel – can you put me on the list?
Who we are now, we will always beEmbed
