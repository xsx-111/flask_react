IOU LyricsOld world underground, where are you now?
Subtract my age from the mileage on my speeding heart, credit cards
Accelerate, accumulate
Looked for you downtown
Wound up in a movie with no story
Now it’s late and you are nowhere to be found
Hesitation’s always mine
Hesitate outside the times
With all I don’t say
With all I don’t do
I’m sending you invitations to hesitate to
Every ten year-old enemy soldier
Thinks falling bombs are shooting stars sometimes
But she doesn’t make wishes on them
When she wishes, she wishes for less ways to wish for
More ways to work toward it
Ten year-old enemy soldier
Our falling bombs are her shooting stars
Hesitation’s always mine
Hesitate outside the times
Oh, call me or drop me a line
Say you’ve been with me
Say you’ve been with me
Say you’ve been with me this whole time
Old world underground, I never knew you
But I’ve seen your face everywhere
There was a farm before we tore the small town down
Multiply, divide2Embed
