Dead Disco Lyrics
Skip town, slow down
Push it to the east coast
Step down, turn around
Push it to the west
Need less, use less
We're asking for too much, I guess
'Cause all we get is...

Dead disco
Dead funk
Dead rock and roll
Remodel
Everything has been done
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Dead disco
Dead funk
Dead rock and roll
Remodel
Everything has been done
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Tits out, pants down
Overnight to London
Touch down, look around
Everyone's the same
Worldwide, airtight
No one's got a face left to blame
And all we get is...
Dead disco
Dead funk
Dead rock and roll
Remodel
Everything has been done
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Dead disco
Dead funk
Dead rock and roll
Remodel
Everything has been done
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I know, I know you tried to change things
I know, I know you tried to change
I know, I know you tried to change things
I know you tried to change
