Wet Blanket LyricsFalling for the creep, the body leech, here he comes
Vicious hypnosis, clenched fist saying it's wrong
To want more than a folk song
Underneath the shaker knit, he's a brick wall
She keep falling for the trick, vegetarian sing-along
Give a little kick with your fine thigh-high
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
Making a mess
See, she is happy you wanna break it
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
Making a mess
See, she is happy you wanna break it
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Your phony roots, borrowed guitar
Telling her what to think we are
You're the number one wet blanket
Hardly a day goes by you don't try to break down
No, I don't buy it
You're still around, I wonder why
She just keepâ€¦
Falling for the creep, the body leech, here he comes
Vicious hypnosis, clenched fist saying it's wrong
To want more than a folk song
Underneath the shaker knit, he's a brick wall
She keep falling for the creep
The body leech coming on
Vicious hypnosis, clenched fist saying
It's wrong to want more than a folk song
I'm wrong to want more than a folk song
I'm wrong to want more than a folk song
Underneath the shaker knit, he's a brick wall
She keep falling for the trick, vegetarian sing-along
Give a little kick with your fine thigh-high
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
Making a mess
See, she is happy you wanna break it
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Your bathing suit, borrowed guitar
Telling her what to think we are
You're the number one wet blanket
You're still around, I wonder why
You're still around, I wonder why
You're the number one wet blanket1Embed
