Hustle Rose Lyrics
Behold the fishnet slut tonight
Hustle Rose goes from limb to limb
Fingertip to painted lip, she sways her way up to him
Says, "Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
You're gonna wanna wear it out."

If you're looking for something lifelike
Hit a sardine nightclub
If every surface you touch is cold, never go home
He says, "I can't feel a thing, my dreams are so tight
Why wouldn't I stand in line tonight?"

Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
You're gonna wanna wear it out
You're gonna wanna wear it out
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
You're gonna wanna wear it out
You're gonna wanna wear it out

You could throw me a bone
If I get too close, you wake me up
Remind me softly to go
If I forget, won't you wake me up?
Remind me not to feel a thing
Keep the dream tight
I can't feel a thing
My dreams are so tight
Can't feel anything
My dreams are so tight
Why wouldn't I stand in line tonight?2Embed
