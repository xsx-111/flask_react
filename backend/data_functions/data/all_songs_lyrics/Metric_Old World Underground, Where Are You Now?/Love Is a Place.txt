Love Is a Place Lyrics
There's spring in the air
They're sweeping the streets
The wind is a breeze
The sun becomes her, he agrees

What's holding up her face?
Nothing but blue skies
Passageways to windows
That don't close

Where do you live?
Love is a place
Where are you from?
She says, "Ask yourself, ask anyone"

What's holding up her face?
Nothing but blue skies
Passageways, the mind's eye
