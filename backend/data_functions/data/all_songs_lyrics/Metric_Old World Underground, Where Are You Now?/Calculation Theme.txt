Calculation Theme LyricsI'm sick, you're tired
Let's dance
Break to love, make lust
I know it isn't
I'm sick, you're tired
Let's dance, dance, dance
Cold as numbers but let's dance
As though it were easy for you to lead me
I could be passive, gracefully
Half the horizon's gone
Skyline of numbers
Half the horizon's gone
Working the numbers
'Til I'm sick
Sleep don't pacify us until daybreak sky lights up the grid we live in
Dizzy when we talk so fast
Fields of numbers streaming past
I wish we were farmers
I wish we knew how to grow sweet potatoes and milk cows
I wish we were lovers
But it's for the best
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Where is the love?"
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Who here is in line for a raise?"
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Where is the love?"
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Who put these bodies between us?"Embed
