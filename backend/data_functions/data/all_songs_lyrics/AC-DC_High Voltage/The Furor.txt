The Furor LyricsHey, what's the furor?

Kick the dust, wipe the crime from the main street
Await the coming of The Lord
Hanging 'round with them low down and dirties
Bringing order from the boss
What's the furor 'bout it all?
Leave you panting, bust your balls
Kicked around, messed about, get your hands dirty
On the killing floor

I'm your fuhrer
I'm your fuhrer, baby
Come on, yeah

Frame of mind, cross the line to a new state
I can shake the law
Friend of mine gonna build me a new place
Not knocking door-to-door

I'm your fuhrer
I'm your fuhrer, baby
What's your furor?
I'm your fuhrer, baby

Bring on the furor
C'mon


Well, I'm your fuhrer
What's your furor, baby?
Feel the furor
I'm your fuhrer, baby
I'm your fuhrer
What's your furor, baby?
Feel the furor
You're my fuhrer
I'm your fuhrer
I'm your fuhrerEmbed
