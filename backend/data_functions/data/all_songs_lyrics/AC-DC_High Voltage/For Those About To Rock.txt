For Those About To Rock LyricsStand up and be counted
For what you are about to receive
We are the dealers
We'll give you everything you need
All hail to the good times
'Cause rock has got the right of way
Gonna let you go tomorrow
We're living for today
Chorus:
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
We rock at dawn, like a hurricane
Like a bolt right out of the blue
The sky's alight with the guitar pain/bite
??? will roll down, roll down on you
We rock at dawn, like a bolt right out of the blue
Chorus: X2
A battery for hire, with a guitar fire
Aimed at you old friend (???)
Pick up your guns, a twenty one
Chorus: X4 (fade)Embed
