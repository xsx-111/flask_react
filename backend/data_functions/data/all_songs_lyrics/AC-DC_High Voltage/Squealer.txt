Squealer Lyrics
She said she'd never been
Never been touched before
She said she's never been
This far before
She said she'd never liked
Oh, to be excited
She said she'd always had
Had to fight it (and she never won)
She said she's never been
Never been balled before
And I don't think, yeah
She'll ever ball no more (fixed 'er good)

Squealer, when I held her hand
Squealer, I made her understand
Squealer, when I kissed her lips
Squealer, sucked her finger tips
Squealer, she started getting hot
Squealer, made it hard to stop
Squealer, it got too much
Squealer, I think I've got a magic touch

Take you where you wouldn't dare (Squealer)
Even lick you there to show I care (Squealer)
It's time to sin, let me in (Squealer)
It's time to sin, let me in (Squealer x3)
Licked you there to show I care (Squealer)
Squealer, it's time to sin, let me in
Squealer, it's time to sin, let me in
Squealer, it's time to sin, let me in
Squealer, it's time to sin, let me in
(Squealer, Squealer)Embed
