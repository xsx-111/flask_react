Moon in June Lyrics
On a dilemma
Between what I need and what I just want
Between your thighs I feel a sensation
How long can I resist the temptation?
I've got my bird
You've got your man
So who else do we need
Really?

Now I'm here I may as well put my
Other hand in yours while we decide
How far to go and if we have
Time to do it now and if it's
Half as good for you as it is for
Me then you won't mind if we lie
Down for a while
Just for a while
'Til all the thing I want
Is need
'Til all the thing I are
I'm you

Nah nah

I wanted you
More than ever
Now we're on the floor
And you want more
And I feel almost sure that 'cause
Now we've agreed
That we've got what we need
Then all the thing in us needs is wanting
I realized when I saw you last
We'd be together now and then
From time to time
Just here and there, now I
Know how it feels
From my hair to my heels
To have you on the horns of my dilemma
Oh, wait a minute
Over, up, over, up, down...
Down, over, up, over, up...

Living can be lovely here in New York State
Ah, but I wish that I were home
And I wish I were home again
Back home again, home again
Back home again, home again
There are places and people that I'm so glad to have seen
Ah, but I miss the trees
And I wish that I were home again
Back home again, home again
Back home again
The sun shines here all summer
It's nice 'cause you can get quite brown
Ah, but I miss the rain- ticky, tacky, ticky
And I wish that I were home again
Home again, home again, home again
Home again, home again, home again
Living is easy here in New York State, state
Ah, but I wish that I were home again
Back in West Dulwich again
Just before we go on to the next part of our song
Let's all make sure we've got the time
Music-making still performs the normal functions:
Background noise for people scheming, seducing, revolting, or teaching
But that's alright by me, don't think that I'm complaining
After all, it's only leisure time, isn't it?

Now I love your eyes
See how the time flies
She's learning to hate
But it's just too late for me
It was the same with her love
It just wasn't enough for me
But before this feeling dies
Remember how distance can tell lies
Nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah, nahnah nahnah nahnah
Nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah, nahnah nahnah nah nah nah

You can almost see her eyes
Is it me she despises, or you?
You're awfully nice to me
And I'm sure you can see what her game is
She sees you in her place
Just as if it's a race
And you're winning, and you're winning
She just can't understand that for me
Everything is just beginning
Until I get more homesick
So before this feeling dies
Remember how distance tells us lies




Singing a song in the morning
Singing a song at night
Don't even know what I'm singing about
But it makes me feel alright
You say you like my hat
You say you like my shirt
But you never say you like me
Or anything nice like that
What about me?
What about me?1Embed
