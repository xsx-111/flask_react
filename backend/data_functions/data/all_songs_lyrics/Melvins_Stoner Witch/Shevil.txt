Shevil LyricsSHEVIL
It's nice to take a narrow man
And hold in a heaven
Grab it hold of for lamb
You try to deafen me
And leave it for shavin
Man over for same, yeah
Ben stars in all my wars and more, they're
Gonna act in emergency
When he beats them down and haunt it all away
It's nice to pick a lame vein
And mold it for metal
Raw load is a gran
Budweiser eppen me
Ex-ect us for favors
Why one does a hang child
Piston story yeah
And sorta sorry
Wind highs are livin
Well you all come cold
When we sell are soulEmbed
