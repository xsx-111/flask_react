Revolve LyricsFreedom on like stems from walk away
You gotta hold your time
You gotta hit him with the right of way
Maybe black too far for any like the one seen
In a way it's sane, either way it's gotta mean
Red sister might be chokin'
But I ain't about that kind
Answer me with the rhythm of a body
That was born to lose two times
Hey big bo day
He says deny, but you're for tin lie
Head my shoulder
Big boat deloves, big boat denies
They might try to hide
They have to have some more dead sense
You might be rye like a ball in the wind
Poison dandy lifeforms crime
Mix both down cross sticky pedal the line
The flavor might be missin'
But he acts to cross that anyway
You can bet he can diddle with the promise
In the power of another day
Hey big bo day
He says deny, but you're for tin lie
Head my shoulder
Big boat deloves, big boat denies
Two of you sold my wallet
One of you stole my tie
Didn't you say that you're watching?
Denied
Venomous stole in me
Three of you standing by
Didn't you say that you've got it?
Watch me eyeEmbed
