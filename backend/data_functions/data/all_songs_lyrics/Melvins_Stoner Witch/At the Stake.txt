At the Stake LyricsMaybe once and maybe came away
I took a quarter of your wishes
Fed them all aside
The weaker of the fortune's mystery
Hasn't yet all appeared to me
But then I never wanted more than three
Shade's know any reason
Flames are all I see
Hala-tease been forsaken maybe
Stirin all on a lee
So it seems and so it's came away
Might be the voicings frighten
And so it's gotten me
The weaker of the fortune's mystery
Has finally pissed indee
Indeed, made it for the eve
Shade's know any reason
Flames are all I see
Hala-tease been forsaken maybe
Stirin all on a lee
Now they're gonna burn me
Make all my flesh away'd
Real green turnin half ball shaken
Leave me, horror day1Embed
