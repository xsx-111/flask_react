Lividity LyricsHow - How does it - How does it feel?
How - How does it - How does it feel?
How - How does it - How does it feel?
Do you - Do you feel inclined?
Tense
Just tense
I got friends
Do you know
Not so easy as mine, is it?
Been  eyes
Go blind
How's your protocol?
In order to, uh
Just beg,  show the times
In the wrong state of mind

Whaddaya mean? My lungs are fineEmbed
