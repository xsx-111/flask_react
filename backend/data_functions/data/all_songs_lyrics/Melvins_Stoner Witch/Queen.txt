Queen LyricsAs a measure of the soul
Ever done run bring your fear
You and me, we got the same air goin'
Breathin' here
You got send to toad water, you been
Like someone left to cold half breathin'
Maybe me and the Queen could take another over
Walk it away, yeah
Oh little wish it away
I got time to wish away
Little wish it away
Head look about the free
Like a dumb mum bring a wheel
I might take the tee mind over
Load and see
I done kicked a hole wide lookin'
A gapin' half to free mind mover
Maybe me and the Queen can give a side order
Love it away, well
Oh little wish it away
I got time to wish away
Little wish it away
She don't hangEmbed
