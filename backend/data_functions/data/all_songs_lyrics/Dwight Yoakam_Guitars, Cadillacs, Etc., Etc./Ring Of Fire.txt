Ring Of Fire LyricsLove is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
Chorus:
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames climbed higher
And it burned, burned, burned
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

Chorus:
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames climbed higher
And it burned, burned, burned
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Ooh, but the fire went wild
Chorus:
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames climbed higher
And it burned, burned, burned
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

Chorus:
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames climbed higher
And it burned, burned, burned
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
Chorus:
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames climbed higher
And it burned, burned, burned
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
Oh, it burned, burned, burned
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire...Embed
