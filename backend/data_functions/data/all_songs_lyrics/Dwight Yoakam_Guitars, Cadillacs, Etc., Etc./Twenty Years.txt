Twenty Years LyricsHey look yonder, Henry, comes the sherrif
And he's carrying a warrant in his hand
Don't you run, poor old Henry, for he'll shoot you
Lord, Lord
Not long will you be a free man
Chorus:
Now twenty years you must spend behind steel bars
For a crime that you did not do
Yeah the lie she swore in that district court
Has proved to be the ruin of you
Tried to warn you, Henry, not to cross her
Tried to tell you about her vengeful ways
When you turned and left her for another
She swore, Henry, that she'd make you pay
Chorus:
Now twenty years you must spend behind steel bars
For a crime that you did not do
Yeah, the lie she swore in that district court
Has proved to be the ruin of you
--- Instrumental ---
Listen well, all you young rounders
Heed the lesson poor old Henry never learned
That even hell with all its fiery power
Hath no fury like a woman's scorned
Chorus:
Now twenty years you must spend behind steel bars
For a crime that you did not do
Yeah, the lie she swore in that district court
Has proved to be the ruin of you
Yeah, the lie she swore in that district court
Has proved to be the ruin of you...Embed
