Bury Me LyricsBury me along the Big Sandy
Down in the blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth does tremble
Now, don't you mourn for me
When my soul is free
Woman, don't you cry
Just bury me along the Big Sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
This old town of sin
It's about to do me in
I don't know how much I can stand
With my knees on the street and my heart at their feet
I'm forced to beg from Satan's hand
So bury me along the Big Sandy
Down in the blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth does tremble
Don't you mourn for me
When my soul is free
Woman, don't you cry
Just bury me along the Big Sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
When I came to this land
I was strong and I could stand
But now I've somehow gone astray
Yet, I still see the truth
In the teachings of my youth
And I know that the Lord ain't turned away
So bury me along the big sandy
Down in the blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth does tremble
Don't you mourn for me
When my soul is free
Woman, don't you cry
Just bury me along the Big Sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
Under a blue Kentucky sky
Under a blue Kentucky skyEmbed
