Heartaches By The Number LyricsHeartache Number One was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache Number Two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
Chorus:
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more
Now I've got heartaches by the number
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
Instrumental
Heartache Number Three was when you called me
And told me you was coming home to stay
With hoping heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
Chorus:
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Love that I can't win
The day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
Ah the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end...Embed
