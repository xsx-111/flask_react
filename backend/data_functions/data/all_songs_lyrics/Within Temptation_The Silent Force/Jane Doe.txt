Jane Doe LyricsWhy, you just won't leave my mind
Was this the only way
I couldn't let you stay
Run away, hide away
The secrets in your mind
Sacrificed just her life
For a higher love
No matter how many stones you put inside
She always keeps on floating in your mind
With every turn of your head you see her face again
Until the end, over and over again
Why, you just won't leave my mind
Was this the only way
I couldn't let you stay
Told the truth she laughed at you
Something snapped inside
She had to go or they would know
All you tried to hide
The sins of your life are now catching up with you
You can't stay ahead, there's nothing you can do
With every turn of your head you see her face again
Until the end, over and over again
Why, you just won't leave my mind
Was this the only way
I couldn't let you stay
