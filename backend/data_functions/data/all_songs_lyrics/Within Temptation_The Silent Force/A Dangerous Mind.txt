A Dangerous Mind Lyrics
I'm searching for answers 'cause something's not right
I'll follow the signs, I'm close to the fire
I fear that soon you'll reveal
Your dangerous mind

It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
I fear your smile and the promise inside
It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind
(what's on your mind)
I fear your presence, I'm frozen inside, inside

I'm searching for answers, not questioned before
The curse of awareness, there's no peace of mind
As your true colors show
A dangerous sign

It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
I see the truth that you've buried inside
It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
There is no mercy, just anger I find, I find
I just have to know, while I still have time
Do I have to run or hide away from you?

It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
I see the truth that you've buried inside
It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
There is no mercy, just anger I find (it's in your)
It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
I see the truth that you've buried inside
It's in your eyes (it's in your eyes), what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
There is no mercy, just anger I find, I findEmbed
