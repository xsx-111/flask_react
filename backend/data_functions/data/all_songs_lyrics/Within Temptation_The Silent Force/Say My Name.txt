Say My Name Lyrics
Say my name, so I will know you're back
You're here again for a while
Oh, let us share the memories
That only we can share together
Tell me about
The days before I was born
How we were as children

You touch my hand
These colors come alive
In your heart and in your mind
I cross the borders of time
Leaving today behind to be with you again

We breath the air, do you remember
How you used to touch my hair?
You're not aware, your hands keep still
You just don't know that I am here
It hurts too much
I pray now that soon you're released
To where you belong

You touch my hand
These colors come alive
In your heart and in your mind
I cross the borders of time
Leaving today behind to be with you again
Please say my name, remember who I am
You will find me in the world of yesterday
You drift away again
Too far from where I am
When you ask me who I am

Say my name
These colors come alive
In your heart and in your mind
I cross the borders of time
Leaving today behind to be with you again

Say my nameEmbed
