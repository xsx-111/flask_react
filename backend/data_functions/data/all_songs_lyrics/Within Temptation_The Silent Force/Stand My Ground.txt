Stand My Ground Lyrics
I can see
When you stay low nothing happens
Does it feel right?
Late at night
Things I thought I put behind me
Haunt my mind

I just know there's no escape now
Once it set its eyes on you
But I won't run
Have to stare it in the eye

Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I've gotta face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand my ground

It's all around
Getting stronger, coming closer
Into my world
I can feel
That it's time for me to face it
Can I take it?
Though this might just be the ending
Of the life I held so dear
But I won't run
There's no turning back from here

Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I've gotta face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand my ground

All I know for sure, is I'm trying
I will always stand my ground

Stand my ground, I won't give in
(I won't give in)
I won't give up
(I won't give up)
No more denying, I gotta face it
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I gotta face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand my ground1Embed
