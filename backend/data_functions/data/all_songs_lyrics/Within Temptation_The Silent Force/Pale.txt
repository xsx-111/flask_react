Pale Lyrics
The world seems not the same
Though I know nothing has changed
It's all my state of mind
I can't leave it all behind

Have to stand up to be stronger, have to try
To break free from the thoughts in my mind
Use the time that I have, I can't say goodbye
Have to make it right
Have to fight
'Cause I know, in the end it's worthwhile
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away
It will be alright

I know, should realize
Time is precious, it is worthwhile
Despite how I feel inside
Have to trust it will be all right

Have to stand up to be stronger, have to try
To break free from the thoughts in my mind
Use the time that I have, I can't say goodbye
Have to make it right
Have to fight
'Cause I know, in the end it's worthwhile
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away
It will be alright
Oh, this night is too long
Have no strength to go on
No more pain, I'm floating away
Through the mist, I see the face
Of an angel, who calls my name
I remember, you're the reason I have to stay

Have to try
To break free from the thoughts in my mind
Use the time that I have, I can't say goodbye
Have to make it right
Have to fight
'Cause I know, in the end it's worthwhile
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away
It will be alright2Embed
