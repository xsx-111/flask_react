Forsaken Lyrics
Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time
We lived our lives in our paradise
As gods we shaped the world around
No borderlines we'd stay behind
Though balance is something fragile
While we thought we were gaining
We'd turn back the tide, it still slips away
Our time has run out, our future has died
There's no more escape

Now the day has come, we are forsaken
There's no time anymore
Life will pass us by, we are forsaken
We're the last of our kind

The sacrifice was much too high
Our greed just made us all go blind
We tried to hide what we feared inside
Today is the end of tomorrow
As the sea started rising
The land that we conquered just washed away
Although we all have tried to turn back the tide
It was all in vain

Now the day has come, we are forsaken
There's no time anymore
Life will pass us by, we are forsaken
Only ruins stay behind

(We're the kind, forsaken)
(Our greed, make us)
(Our greed, go blind)
(No time)
Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time
Now the day has come, we are forsaken
There's no time anymore

Now the day has come
The day has come
The day has come1Embed
