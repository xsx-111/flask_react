April Anne LyricsApril Anne with the red bandanna round her head
Pretty Anne with the peacock feathered fan said
That the sash around her waist turned to lead
And her jingle-jangled faggot friend was dead
And the wine he spilled stained her pillow red
And the midnight cowboys came but quickly fled
Oh the whole thing was bringing her down
Lady Anne, we danced the fandango on your bed
Anne, the Gypsy Woman once said:
Let an Easy Rider share your bed
But you chose the drunken gigolo instead
How were you to know he was ill-bred?
Then you sat and cried and hung your head and said
That the whole thing was bringing you down
April Anne with the red bandanna round her head
Pretty Anne with the peacock feathered fan said
That the sash around her waist turned to lead
And her jingle-jangled faggot friend was dead
And the midnight cowboys came and quickly fled
Oh the wine he spilled stained her pillow red
And she let an Easy Rider share her bed
But she chose the drunken gigolo instead
We danced the fandango around her bedEmbed
