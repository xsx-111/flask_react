Let It Bleed, Genevieve LyricsGenevieve lay bleeding in my basement
Misconceiving life again
Up on the sidewalk, her replacement
Waiting to be skinned
Bobby wants a lady from the low lands
And I'd like to have one too
Paul said, "One in the bush worth two in your hand"
Even then you'll find there are too few
Genevieve lay dreaming on my ceiling
A thought came, rolling stone, across her mind
Looking down with great feeling
I'll trade you yours for mine
Just try to sing in choirs, hear the old gears grind
And upstairs they'll say, "There's too much noise"
I tell the lady we'll be quiet
She knows boys will be boys
Gene Gene Gene, what's the matter
You'll get your way next time around
Subtract the former from the latter
You're fatter than when you were found
Genevieve lay bleeding in my basement...Embed
