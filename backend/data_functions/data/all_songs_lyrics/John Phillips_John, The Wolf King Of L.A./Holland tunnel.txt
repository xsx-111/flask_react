Holland tunnel LyricsLa la-la la, la-la
La, la-la la, la-la
La la-la la, la-la
La, la-la la
First thing you do, drive right through that Holland Tunnel
Pay your toll to the soul on the other side
Pick up your ticket for the New Jersey turnpike
And drive, baby drive
This is your last chance for the Howard Johnson's
Get your steam plans station on the night
Check your gas and oil, don't forget to be loyal
And drive, baby drive
'Bout this time you're passing Pittsburgh Pennsylvannia
And the pawn shop from the corners really true
Hawk your watch n' ring, cause it don't mean a thing
When you get home I'll buy you something new
Drive on
La la-la la, la-la
La, la-la la, la-la
La la-la la, la-la
La, la-la la
Next morning gonna find you driving down the highway
Red ballin, red ballin all the way
You know the lollipop know suckin, you tow so good truckin'
A little good luck and you'll get stuck in L.A
First thing you do is drive on through that Holland Tunnel
Pay your toll to the soul on the other side
Pick up your ticket everything will be alright
(la la-la, la la-la)Embed
