Drum LyricsSome robbers, they don't need no knives or guns babe
They come get you where you are
Somebody's come and stole my blackbird drum, baby
You know they took them from my car
Thirty dollar drums, you don't get no backbeat
No, they'll only break your heart
Those junkie bums, they're gonna steal my blackbird drums
Then they put them in their arms
Please be careful what you say
Or the man will come take you away
Watch out, watch out for what you do
I think that they are looking for you, yeah
Yes they are
Some robbers they don't need no knives or guns babe
They come get you where you are
Those junkie bums, they're gonna steal my blackbird drums
You know they took them from my car
And then they put them in their armsEmbed
