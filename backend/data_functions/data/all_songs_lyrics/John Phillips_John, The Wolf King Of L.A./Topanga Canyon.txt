Topanga Canyon LyricsSometimes I drive out to Topanga
And I park my car in the sand
Watching and waiting for a pickup
From my man
And maybe down to Farmer's Market
Those people, they're working in the sun
Buy and sell it for a profit
To anyone
Oh Mary, I'm in the deep waters
And it's way, way over my head
Everyone thought I was smarter
Than to be this dead
You've heard of trainwrecks in the mountains
Sometimes there's shipwrecks on the sea
Mary, you must always be careful
Can't you see?
Oh Mary, I'm in the deep waters
And it's way over my head
Everyone thought I was smarter
Than to be this dead
Someone's sick in San Fransisco
Some are down in New Orleans
Others are kept in Camarillo
Picking beans
Oh Mary, I'm in deep waters
And it's way over my head
Everyone thought I was smarter
Than to be misledEmbed
