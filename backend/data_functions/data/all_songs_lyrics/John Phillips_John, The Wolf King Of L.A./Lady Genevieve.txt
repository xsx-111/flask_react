Lady Genevieve LyricsIn a place far from here
Circled by mountains
Her skirts are raised
She gently sways
And holy men deceive
Lady Genevieve
Blue of blouse, crystal sphere
Slowly, revolving
Her life is seen
The blues are green
Kings cannot believe
Lady Genevieve
Butterfly all appear
Frozen in final motion
Her colors fade
The bargain's made
Collectors have achieved
Lady Genevieve
Night has come, so spread your wings
While they all are sleeping
Catch the wind
Your wings shall mend
And happily conceive
Lady Genevieve
Lady Genevieve
Torn from the willow
Rest your head
Rest your head
No one shall receive
Lady GenevieveEmbed
