Malibu People LyricsI got a fine beach house, baby
And the waves roll in
Playing in the sand with your best friend babe
Malibu people really know how to live
A castle in the sand and a lady
And the waves roll in
Keep it in mind for some other time
Malibu people really know how to live
It took some time to find a crack in her defenses
A hole in her heart you might say
Keeping abreast of her, keeping things bandaged
All I know is that the waves roll in
Big belly woman laying waiting in the sand for her baby
And the waves the roll in
If she needs a spot to drop, you know she's got to drop
Before the waves roll in
All right...
A castle in the sand and a lady
And the waves roll in
Keep it in mind for some other time
Malibu people really know how to live
Big belly woman laying waiting in the sand for her baby
While the waves the roll in
If she needs a spot to drop, you know she's not to got
Before the waves roll in
It's the season againEmbed
