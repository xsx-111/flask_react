Palm Desert Lyrics
By Palm Desert
To market to buy
Tenderfoot up to date
Palms of the real estate
By Palm Desert
Springs often run dry

I came west unto Hollywood
Never-never land
Juxtaposed to B.B.D. and O
Beyond San Fernando
On hillside manors
On the banks of toxicity
Those below and those above the same

Dreams are still born in Hollywood
I don't understand
Just suppose the youngster knows
He's had a good deal of fortune
And up through the babble
On the fair banks complicity
Buy your leave or stay beyond the game
Palm Desert, not fade away
Palm Desert, I wish I could stay
Palm Desert, sages abound
So head your head to the ground round

Meanwhile in the wild west of Hollywood
Age is losing hold
Inasmuch as you are touched
To have withstood
By the very old search for the truth within
The bounds of toxicity
Left unsung, so I have strung the frame

Not fade away
I wish I could stay
Palm Desert
Head your head
To the ground round4Embed
