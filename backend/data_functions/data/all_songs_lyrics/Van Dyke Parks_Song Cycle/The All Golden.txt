The All Golden LyricsHe is not your run
Of the mill garden variety
Alabama country faire
Left on Silver Lake
He keeps a small apartment top
An Oriental food store there
He returned from Alabama
To see what he could see
Off the record he is hungry
Though he works hard in his
Alabama country fair
I should think he'd fade away
The way that Bohemians often bare
The frigid air
He returned from Alabama
To see what he could see
Constant commentary by the wayside
Nowadays them country boys
Don't cotton much to one two three four
Rest your team
Work out in the All Golden!
You will know why hayseeds
Go back to the country
Constant calm might still
Our stately union
Nowadays a Yankee dread
Not take his time to wend to sea
Forget to bear your arms
In the All Golden
You will know why hayseeds
Go back to the country
Might as well not 'low
For one more go round
That's all folks
Them hayseeds go back
To the country
Ja git it? AlrightEmbed
