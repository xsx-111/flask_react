Vine Street Lyrics
Ooh, sing so gay and loudly
Sing on down the hills that ring
Charmed a fair young lady
Charmed a fair young lady
Would you forsake your horse runnin' 'round?
Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your home, so dear
And go home with Black Jack Davey?
Go home with Black Jack Davey?
Last night, she slept on a warm feathered bed
Beside her husband and baby
Tonight she'll sleep and lay in the mud
Beside ol' Black Jack Davey...

That's the tape that we made
But I'm sad to say it never made the grade
That was me, third guitar
I wonder where the others are?

I sold the guitar today
I never did play much, anyway
Vine Street
We used to live there
On Vine Street

She made perfume
In the back of her room
And me and my group
We'd sit out on the stoop
And we'd play for her
The songs she liked best
To have us play
On Vine Street

Vine Street
The crack of the backbeat
On Vine Street

Swingin' along
On the wings of a song
And I'll lie in, secure
Self-righteous and sure
Why, we've things to say
That the people would pay
To hear us play
On Vine StreetEmbed
