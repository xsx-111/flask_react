Down Laurel Canyon LyricsTracks of the beaten in automobile
Pound the from nine to fivers
'round a long line of drivers
Wind to dine in the divers
And dandy lie
One line bled in tandem
From some new hatchet deals
Cracks in the heat and then caught by the wheel
Catch the country store feel
For the hackamore crew
View the crackerbare coterie
Standing by
One line bred randyrand and
Too few wretched meals
What's up Laurel canyon, hey
What is up in Laurel Canyon
The seat of the beat
To greet and eat
At the heart of their companion way
That's up Laurel Canyon
And what is up the Canyon
Will even eventually
Come downEmbed
