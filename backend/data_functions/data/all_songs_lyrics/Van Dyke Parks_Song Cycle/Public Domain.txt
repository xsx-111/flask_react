Public Domain LyricsOur lowly liquor
Lobby longs to back a road
To old time songs
Biblebelts worn from here
And after all were
Born in the know
So rally round awhile
Jim Crow for I thought
I'd like to show
They can recall
The Alamo way down
In old Mexico
I left Academia
Amid sixty-two
Was it sixty-one scholar
Was cooled from the U
Doubtless more on sore
Wing than prayer
I up and just withdrew
To the wander round there1Embed
