Ejection LyricsThere's only one course of action
Left for me to take
I've tried every switch selection
That might control this state
I think for my protection
I better make it straight
Into ejection
Better tell base
Ejection
That I think it's a case
For ejection
Explode into space
Ejection
Protect my face
Ejection
The radar screen's projection
Tells me I'm too late
To make a course correction
I'm about to meet my fate
There's no time for reflection
I'd better make it straight
Into ejection
Bust through the sky
Ejection
The air rushing by
Ejection
It's a case of goodbye
Ejection
I'm too fast to die
Ejection
When a ship meets with destruction
The Captain stays to drown
But no tin contraption
Is going to drag me down
My reference intersection
Tells me that I'm bound
For ejection
Eight times my weight
Ejection
I've got to escape
Ejection
Only one move to make
Rejection
Abandon this crate
Ejection
Abandon this crate
Ejection
Watch me go
Ejection
Time to pull
Ejection
Watch me go
Ejection
Ejection
Ejection
