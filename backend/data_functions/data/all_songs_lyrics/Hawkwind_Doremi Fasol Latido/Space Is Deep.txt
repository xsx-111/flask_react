Space Is Deep LyricsSpace is dark, it is so endless
When you're lost it's so relentless
It is so big, it is so small
Why does man try to act so tall?
Is this the reason deep in our minds?
It does not feel, it does not die
Space is neither truth nor lies
Into the void we have to travel
To find a clue which will unravel
Is this the reason deep in our minds?
The secret lies with our tomorrow
In each of us is a hidden sorrow
Path goes onwards through the night
Beyond the realms of ancient light
Is this the reason deep in our minds?Embed
