Brainbox Pollution LyricsWell my body's burning up and I'm feeling so bad
And I think it must be something that I've just had
Screaming sounds are buzzing through my brain
Am I mad or am I sane?
I can't control my body anymore
It's reaching down into the very core
I gotta find a way of solving the solution
Is this what they call brainbox pollution?
Take my hand, I'll lead you on
To a land so far, my dreams your own
Is this world that we all find?
It's leaving us so far behind
I can't control my body anymore
It's reaching down into the very core
I gotta find a way of solving the solution
Is this what they call brainbox pollution?Embed
