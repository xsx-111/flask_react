Lord of Light LyricsThe elements that gather here
Upon this hill shall cast no fear
Lines that march across the world
Travel which no man has ever heard
Moon that shines its beam so bright
Stones that measure the silvery light
Of energy that travels here
It happens on the seventh year
A day shall come, we shall be as one
Perhaps to die, it has begun
From the realms beyond the sun
Here our lifetime has begun
What can I be?
What can I be?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
Will it be me?
Will it be me?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
What can I see?
The elements that gather here
Upon this hill shall cast no fear
Lines that march across the world
Travel which no man has ever heard
Moon that shines its beam so bright
Stones that measure the silvery light
Of energy that travels here
It happens on the seventh year
A day shall come, we shall be as one
Perhaps to die, it has begun
From the realms beyond the sun
Here our lifetime has begun
Flying is trying is dying
Flying is trying is dying
Flying is trying is dying
Flying is trying is dying
The elements that gather here
Upon this hill shall cast no fear
Lines that march across the world
Travel which no man has ever heard
Moon that shines its beam so bright
Stones that measure the silvery light
Of energy that travels here
It happens on the seventh year
A day shall come, we shall be as one
Perhaps to die, it has begun
From the realms beyond the sun
Here our lifetime has begunEmbed
