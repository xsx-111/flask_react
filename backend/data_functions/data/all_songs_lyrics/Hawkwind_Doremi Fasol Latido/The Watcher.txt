The Watcher LyricsWe are looking in on you now
What do you think you can do now?
You're very small from way out here
The last thing you will feel is fear
I gave you the chance to do the right thing 
I gave you the chance to do the bright thing
And now our sense is all disgusted
Re-affirm you can't be trusted
A world imprisoned screams with pain
There are no leaders you can blame
Your avarice destroyed your sphere
And there's no room for you out here
This is the end now
This is the end now
This is the end now
This is the end now
This is the end nowEmbed
