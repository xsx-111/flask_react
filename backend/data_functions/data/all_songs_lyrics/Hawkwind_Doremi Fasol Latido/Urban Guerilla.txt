Urban Guerilla LyricsI'm an urban guerrilla
I make bombs in my cellar
I'm a derelict dweller
I'm a potential killer
I'm a street fighting dancer
I'm a revolution romancer
My rising sign is cancer
I'm a two-tone panther
So let's not talk of love and flowers
And things that don't explode
You know we used up all of our magic powers
Time to do it in the road
I'm a political bandit
And you don't understand it
You took my dream and canned it
It is not the way I planned it
I'm society's destructor
I'm a petrol bomb constructor
I'm a cosmic light conductor
I'm the people's debt collector
So watch out Mr. Business Man
Your empire's about to blow
You know I think you had better listen, man
In case you did not know
I'm an urban guerrilla
I make bombs in my cellar
I'm a derelict dweller
I'm a potential killer
A street fighting dancer
I'm a revolution romancer
My rising sign is cancer
I'm a two-tone panther
So let's not talk of love and flowers
And things that don't explode
You know we used up all of our magic powers
Time to do it in the road
I'm a political bandit
And you just don't understand it
You took my dream and canned it
It is not the way I planned it
Society's destructor
I'm a petrol bomb constructor
I'm a cosmic light conductor
I'm the people's debt collector
