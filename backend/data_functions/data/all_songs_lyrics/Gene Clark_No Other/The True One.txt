The True One Lyrics
Changes come so quickly, easily it can seem bizarre
They say there's a price you pay for going out too far
You can buy a one way ticket out there all alone
And you can sit and wonder why it's so hard to get back home

Nothing is important lost, that's not easy to believe
The longer you're in one place, the harder it is to leave
You can have a thousand cards to pull out of your sleeve
But in the end the loser is the one who does deceive

There's always a reality in what you are doing
Sometimes it's so hard to see which one is the true one

I use to treat my friends like I was more than a millionaire
Spending those big ones like I could afford them all upstairs
But what's been flying high must always touch the ground
Just walk upstairs and ask, you'll be likely directed down

Into the reality of what you are doing
Sometimes it's so hard to see which one is the true one
There's always a reality in what you are doing
Sometimes it's so hard to see which one is the true oneEmbed
