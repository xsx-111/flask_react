Lady of the North Lyrics
Flying high above the clouds
We lay in the grassy meadow
The earth was like a pillow for our dreams
Trials never entered into any conversation
That was the relation of our dreams

But as a change in the wind must come
Over the mountain
And the seasons roll under the sun
Passing the shadows of our dreams

Flying high above the clouds
We lay in the grassy meadow
The earth was like a pillow for our dreams
Trials never entered into any conversation
That was the relation of our dreams

But as a change in the wind must come
Over the mountain
And the seasons roll under the sun
Passing the shadows of our dreams
A fine lady of the north
Like silver on the ocean shore
Like wind's whispers through the treesEmbed
