Some Misunderstanding Lyrics
There's been some misunderstanding
And I'd like to make it right
Both of us need inspiration
And the timing must be right

We all have soul
Yet nobody knows
Just how much it takes to fly

But I see my life before me
And I'd like to make a try
Maybe someone knows what fate is
Maybe someone knows just why
All I know is, it's all related
Maybe someone can explain time

But I know if you sell your soul
To brighten your role
You might be disappointed in the lights
We all need a fix at a time like this
But doesn't it feel good to stay alive

Now I see that in my visions
That my eyes are seeing twice
Once for every expectation
And once for what I realize

But I know if you sell your soul
To brighten your role
You might be disappointed in the lights
We all need a fix at a time like this
But doesn't it feel good to stay aliveEmbed
