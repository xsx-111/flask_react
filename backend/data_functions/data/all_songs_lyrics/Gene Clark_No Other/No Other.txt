No Other Lyrics
All alone you say
That you don't want no other
So the Lord is love
And love is like no other
If the falling tide
Can turn and then recover
All alone we must
Be part of one another

All alone you say
The power is perfection
Is the power peace
Or merely the connection
To the God of Love
That powers the protection
From the tide of life
That flows in each direction

When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind
Must find the right direction

All alone you say
That you don't want no other
So the Lord is love
And love is like no other
If the falling tide
Can turn and then recover
All alone we must
Be part of one another

When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind
Must find the right directionEmbed
