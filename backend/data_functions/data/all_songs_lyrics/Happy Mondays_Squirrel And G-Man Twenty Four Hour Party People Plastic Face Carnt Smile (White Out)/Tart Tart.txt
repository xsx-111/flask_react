Tart Tart Lyrics
When he came out to the lock-up
He said I'm looking for something better
And he made his shock announcement
And backed off, backed down, backed off
And then he got up off the floor
He said I'm wealthy enough, not to do this no more
And he made it all known with his hand held up, palm out
And she said don't know if i should
Cause i worry too much about the tests on the blood
And at first it was a 'yes', and then a 'no', then a
'yes'

A maggot sleeps on her desk
He wears a sleeping bag as his vest
And he's getting too too bothered
About the spots on his chest, chest, chest
Now T T, she laid it on
And a few days later shes gone
So its back to the womb
To get drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned warmEmbed
