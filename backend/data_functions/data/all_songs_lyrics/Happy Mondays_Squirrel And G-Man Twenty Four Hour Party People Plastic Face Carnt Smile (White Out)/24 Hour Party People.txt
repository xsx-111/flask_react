24 Hour Party People Lyrics
How old are you? Are you old enough?
Should you be in here watching that?
And how old are you? Are you owning up?
Should you be in here with?

Twenty four hour party people
Plastic face can't smile the white out
With the twenty four hour party people
Plastic face can't smile the white out

You come in beaten
So why don't you join in?
You come in beaten
So why don't you join in with?


I can see you through the door
You been chewing bread and water
And there's a grudge on you
You know you not ought to have
You've been running around the racetrack
You've been running around the racetrack
Put that mother to bed, to bed
Put that mother to bed


Cause I have to wait for you to conduct
Press the pause of the self destruct
With the twenty four hour party people
Plastic face can't smile the white out
With the twenty four hour party people

Now better, you're the white out
I need full-time, I don't need part-time
I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 6, 5 all the time
I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, full time
I don't need the part-time, I need 3, 6, 5
Oh, no days off
Twenty four hour party people
Plastic face can't smile the white out
I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 6, 5 all the time
I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, full-time
I don't need a part-time, I need 3, 6, 5
Oh, no days off1Embed
