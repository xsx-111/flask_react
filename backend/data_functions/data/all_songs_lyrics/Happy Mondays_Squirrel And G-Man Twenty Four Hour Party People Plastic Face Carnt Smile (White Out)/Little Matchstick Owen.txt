Little Matchstick Owen LyricsThe harder you get the more that you like it
The heat and the cold march as one
Thinking and sleeping and smoking and whoring
Ooohaooo
Did it ever get boring it soothes you
Me no taxi
Me no radio car
Me no taxi
Get no radio cab
Cause it don’t float that way for you
No it don’t swing that way for I
And your father was disgusted with you
And your brother get busted
No that won’t swing that way for me
No that don’t swing that way for you
The harder you get the more that you want it
The harder it goes the more that you like
You’ll be no taxi
Be no radio car
Get no taxi
You’ll be no radio cab
So you can go to the back of the queue
Oh and we’re just too nice to get into that queueEmbed
