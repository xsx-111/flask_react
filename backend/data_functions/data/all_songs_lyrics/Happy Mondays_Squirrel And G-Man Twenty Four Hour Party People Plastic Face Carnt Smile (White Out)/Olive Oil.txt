Olive Oil LyricsWhich one of you, has got to be so sad for
And what'd ya look ashamed about
Always on downer,that just sounds like you
And your waiting for some things to jump out of that tree
And then your hundreds, they'll be for free
I'm so green
Ive got to be seen to believe
I had to ask mister fixit
Everybody on this stagecoach likes robbin' an' bashin'
Big blacks and blonds smokin' miles and miles of hash
Thats sweet
The bigger the tree the better the time
Yeah i can see now, how your looking for someone still
A lot more funkier,a lot more ooohh
Well thats the way it seems is what the way you are
Your still peeing in that room, and the roof drops in
And said 'ello goodbyes and a few months later your mine
At this rate even sooner
Still a lot more funkier, still a lot more youEmbed
