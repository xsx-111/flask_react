Enery LyricsSpread your germ, spread your germ
Spread your germ, spread your germ, pass your germ
Spread your germ, pass your germ
Spread your bug
It's no national CD
You Can't stop and wait here
Getting the attention that it wants
Give the attention which it needs
A strong strong strong
Strong strong medicine
Won't put you right this time
Spread your germ, spread your germ
Bring your bug,bring(preach) your germs
Pass your bug
(Instrumental)
Give it the affection
It should have
Give it the attention
Which it needs
The international bus
Has come to pick up
You and Horse
It's not that food
That you get from your tin
Your body is looking
Too thin
You Pass your bug, pass your bug
Pass your bug, spread your bug
Spread your germs
Spread your germs
Pass your bugEmbed
