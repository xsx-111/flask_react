Weekend S LyricsYou think you’re better than the rest of us by a many mile
And I know we’re okay and not in good shape but you’ll have to do
We thought we saw you from behind so you got slapped on your shoulder
Back attack
You didn’t mind you just laughed you was way over there
Let’s get out of here
Everybody in here
They all look like you do
Let’s get out of here
Everybody in here they all grin like you
We both steamy smiling happy faces
But when you turn away
You get daggers in your back
Hey let’s get out of this place
Everybody in here they all look like you
Hey let’s get out of here
Everybody in this place they all grin like you do
Gotta get out, gotta get out of hereEmbed
