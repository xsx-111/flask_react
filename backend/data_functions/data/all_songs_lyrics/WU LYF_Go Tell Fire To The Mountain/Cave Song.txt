Cave Song LyricsNow the blood runs out
Mark red lines across the pavement
Whilst the snow falls down
Stained crimson on the ground
Don’t call the police
I’m begging you please
Because you know
It’s dark
In this cave
The spotlight
Can’t find the stage
It’s dark
In this cave
But it feels like home so I think I’m gonna stay
Here
Where the looks fall cold
You know this knife shines bold
And then I’m running I wish I could just fall off
But now it’s getting kinda hard
I think I'll be leaving in a funeral cart
Don’t call the police
I’m begging you please
(Don't call the police
I'm begging you please)
Who’d of thought the lies they told you
Would awake my restless brother
Who’d of thought the lies they told you
Would awake my sisters lover
“Nah don’t call the police
I’m begging you please
You please
You please!”Embed
