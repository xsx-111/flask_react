Summas Bliss LyricsShe lays down in summer's bliss
Forgetting what she’s told
Man in the wild
You were so young but this city's made you old
It takes so long
So long now to get home
And now I’m home I wish I never
Ever been born at all
And in this county they are already dead
I see the mountain
On fire
No go tell some fire for us
There’s children in the street, watching the concrete turn to gold
Man in the wild
You were so young but this cities made you old
Now it takes so long
So long to get home
And the golden girls they keep calling ("Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!")
Now it takes so long
So long to find a home
But now I’m home I wish I never ever been born at all
You know the mountain won't go falling if your still
Willing to climb
But when the mountain goes falling true riches you will find
I see the mountain
On fire
Go tell the fire for usEmbed
