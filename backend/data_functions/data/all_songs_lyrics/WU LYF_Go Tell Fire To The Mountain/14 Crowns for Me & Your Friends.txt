14 Crowns for Me & Your Friends LyricsBaby won't you say it's over
So I can say a thousand things
It was your looks that were making me cold outside
And now I find it hard to believe
Like I wish I hadn't seen you
If my eyes would just fall out
The home truths you been telling girl
Fill me with self doubt
Everybody wants you
And every body needs you
To be brave
(Be brave babe and they
Were fourteen children)Embed
