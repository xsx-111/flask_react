Heavy Pop LyricsLike children they play
I wanna feel at home
I want to feel at home
You know I can't stay
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home
Nah at night
And in the day light
Come on broken boys
Let's stay tight
So when the morning comes
And were all dead
We can live free
Just like my brother said
He said:
"Don't stay, go out and play, you can't live until you're dead."
But you know the freedom that my brother saw
It deep down, in your heart
Nah the children play like my brother say
And I wanna feel at home
And it's the beautiful sight at the break of day light
That makes me feel like I'll find a home
So to the girls and boys calling out wolf noise
One day you'll find a home
And if the world unites
Sets the mountain alight
Then outside your house will become your home
Like children lets' play
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home
Come on don't stay
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home
Alright?3Embed
