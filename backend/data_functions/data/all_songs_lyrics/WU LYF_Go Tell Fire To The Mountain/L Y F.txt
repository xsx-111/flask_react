L Y F LyricsI woke up today
To hear the baby say
“We can’t live this way
I won't hold this crown”
Now remember these words I say to you
I swear they are true
My blood it runs blue
Nah, we can't live this way, no, we can't live this way, hey hey
Nah, I can’t wait for the kids to come
Come start this fire
No, I can’t wait for the kids to come
And I said, "Son
You know I love you forever
Your faith is true
You know I love you forever
But my blood runs blue
I love you forever and ever and ever
And ever and ever and ever"
If we live this way it will all fall down
Only fire can go replace his crown
“Hey, hey L Y F, how many you kids are scared of death?”2Embed
