Such a Sad Puppy Dog LyricsMy baby, my baby’s got no words for me
You know my brothers in jail
My father said son
Oh son I can’t afford his bail
And they put a crown
On to his head and they murdered him
(Winter went down him
The mountain spat snow again)
My baby/ my baby’s got no words for me
You know a brothers in jail
My father said son
Oh son I can’t afford his bail
(Now don’t let me take up my fathers dreams)
He said wants to be
Shorty wants to be a thug
He said he’s gonna be
Shorty’s gonna be a thugEmbed
