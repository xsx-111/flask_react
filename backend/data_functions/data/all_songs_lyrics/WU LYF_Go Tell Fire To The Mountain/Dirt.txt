Dirt Lyrics
The fire starts
Can you hear the sound
Of the kids all calling
I won't hold this crown
Me and your friends
We run this town
And keep on calling
Until it all falls down

Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire

The loudest part
A liar's town
Where 100 people
Hold you down
Me and your friends
We killed a man
By telling him things
He couldn't understand
The fire starts
Can you hear the sound
Of the kids all calling
I won't hold this crown
Mum and dad
Look what you done to me
I was your baby boy
Now watch me bleed

Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire
Go tell fire

No matter what they said
Dollar is not your friend
And it the feeling that so hard to know
The feeling that won't come slow
No matter what they said
Dollar is not your friend
And it the feeling that so hard to know
The feeling that won't come slow
Until you find a home
Won't come slow
Until you find a home
World unite now, I love you forever
World unite now, I love you forever
World unite now, I love you forever
World unite now, I love you forever
World unite now, I love you forever
World unite now, I love you foreverEmbed
