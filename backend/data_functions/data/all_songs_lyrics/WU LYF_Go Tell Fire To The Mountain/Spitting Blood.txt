Spitting Blood Lyrics x4
Now we're spitting blood, spitting blood
Like the golden sun god, golden sun god

I was born into plastic fame
Read his tattoo
But it don't matter, were all in the same
Ship sailing to what we hold as true
I got the star of David hanging over me
But oh mother Mary I find it hard to believe
That some ones hands no different to mine
Could be hung on a wall, held as divine
 x2
We are so happy, happy to see
All of our children will run blind and free

Across concrete fields of broken glass
With five-year-olds having heart attacks
You fed 'em to well on TV
Cut me, I won't even bleed
My blood's as lazy as the mums and dads
Whose fantastic mundane can't all be bad
So lets just keep eating more
More, more, more, more and more
And then we all go throw up on the poor
Outside I’m lying, inside I’m dead
The tears in my eyes fall from books I have read
If I could talk to you and only speak the truth
All this wolf noise wouldn't start calling now
When I talk to you, when I talk to you
When I talk to you, when I talk to you
When I talk to you, when I talk to you
When I talk to you, when I talk to you
When I talk to you!

Now we're spitting blood
Like the golden sun godEmbed
