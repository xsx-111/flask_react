Concrete Gold LyricsIt was broken words that she said to me
My blood runs deep why won't you let it bleed?
The peoples crown lays at my feet
A dumb animal trying to crawl
But she comes now in the night
A blind baby walk in to the light
A life spent waiting for a volcano to blow
So the mountain can go and fall
And all the babies they're just trying, dying
To find a place to call home
And they try so they're lying, lying
I'm so sick of all these people
I wish that they would just go slow
Go sow and watch it grow
I'm so scared of all my dreams
I wish I could sleep tonight
You know it's the people
They hold you down
But you know they hold your crown
An anchor connects us with the ground
You wouldn't believe how many times
This voice has spoke and not made a sound
Oh won't you go tell a little fire for us
And all the babies they're still trying, dying
To find a place to call home
But they try so they are just lying, lying
I'm so sick of all these people
I wish that they would just go slow
Go sow and watch it grow
I'm so scared of all my dreams
I wish I could sleep tonight
But you know it's the people
They hold you down
But you know they hold your crown
(You're the light your Lucifer)Embed
