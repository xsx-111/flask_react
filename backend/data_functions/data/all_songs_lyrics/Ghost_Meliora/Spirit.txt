Spirit Lyrics
Throw yourself
Into the vessel of possibilities
Your green muse
The apparatus for soul mobility
A gateway to secrecy

Spirit, Absinthe
Spirit, Absinthe

Seven seals
Devilish creatures trumpets the end of time
Cloven Hooves
Anti-Saint wormwood catapulting your mind
Into the jaws of death

Spirit, Absinthe
Spirit, Absinthe


There's no return
From this excursion of possibilities
You're at the seventh gate
Spirit, Absinthe
Spirit, Absinthe

Let none of this earth inherit
This vision of my spiritEmbed
