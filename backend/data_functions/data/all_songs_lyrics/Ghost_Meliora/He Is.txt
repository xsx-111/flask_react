He Is Lyrics
We're standing here by the abyss
And the world is in flames
Two star-crossed lovers reaching out
To the beast with many names

He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is insurrection, He is spite, He's the force that made me be
He is Nostro Dispater, Nostr'Alma Mater
He is

We are hiding here inside a dream
And all our doubts are now destroyed
The guidance of the morning star
Will lead the way into the void

He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is insurrection, He is spite, He's the force that made me be
He is Nostro Dispater, Nostr'Alma Mater
He is

He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is insurrection, He is spite, He's the force that made me be
He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is the disobedience that holds us together
He is Nostro Dispater, Nostr'Alma Mater
And we are falling over the precipice
