Deus in Absentia Lyrics
In this your time of need
You're turning to the light
You had just begun to explore the dark
In the urban night

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
Our funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore (More)

You're so goddamn frail
Failing for a change
You just had to know all about the world
But you will never know

'Cause no one ever told you how

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forever
The world is on fire
And we are tied as one eternally
Our funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore (More)
(Deus, Deus)
All of your imaginations are now running down your face
All of your imaginations are now running down your face


Oh, you are looking good
Bareback in disgrace
And you're doing fine worshiping your lord
Standing in his grace

'Cause no one ever told you how

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forever
The world is on fire
And we are tied as one eternally
Our funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore (More)
