Absolution Lyrics
Ever since you were born you've been dying
Every day a little more you've been dying
Dying to reach the setting sun!
As a child, with your mind on the horizon
Over corpses, to the prize you kept your eyes on
Trying to be the chosen one!

All those things that you desire
You will find here in the fire

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

Even now when you're here you are moving
Hysterically seeking out what needs improving
And you're still asking for the sun

All those things that you desire
You will find here in the fire
Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

You'll cry, you'll cry, you'll cry (You'll cry–you'll cry–)
You'll cry, you'll cry, you'll cry (You'll cry–you'll cry–)

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution
Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolutionEmbed
