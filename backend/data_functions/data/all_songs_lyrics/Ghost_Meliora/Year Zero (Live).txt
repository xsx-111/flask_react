Year Zero (Live) Lyrics
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer
Sanfre
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer

Since dawn of time
The fate of man is that of lice
Equal as parasites
And moving without eyes
A day of reckoning
When penance is to burn
Come down, together now
And say the words that you will learn

Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero
Hail Satan, Archangelo
Sing it!
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero

Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus,ï»¿ Satanas, Lucifer
Crestfallen kings and queens
Comforting in their faith
Unbeknownst to them
Is the presence of the wraith
Since fate of man
Is equal to the fate of lice
As new dawn rises, you shall recognize
Now behold the Lord of Flies

Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero
Hail Satan


He will tremble the nations
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations
A daughter to fall for a son
The ancient serpent deceiver
The masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of God
Sing it!

Hail Satan, Archangelo
Hail Satan, welcome Year Zero
Sing it!
Hail Satan, Archangelo
Again!
Hail Satan, welcome Year ZeroEmbed
