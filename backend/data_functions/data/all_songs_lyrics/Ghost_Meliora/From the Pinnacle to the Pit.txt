From the Pinnacle to the Pit Lyrics
You have the power
You wear the crown
From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

You wield the scepter
You wear the gown
From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

In your empire
They stare in frown
From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crown

Cruciger globus
You stand your ground
The orb disfigured
What's flat looks round
From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crown4Embed
