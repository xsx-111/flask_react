Mummy Dust Lyrics
Dust...

I was carried on a wolf's back
Here to corrupt humanity
I will pummel it with opulence
With corpulence and greed

In God, you trust
My mummy dust
Dust...
My mummy dust

Your cavalier of crapulence
To this feast of rapacity
I'll bury you in treasures
Just to feed your incapacity

In God, you trust
My mummy dust
Dust...
My mummy dust
In God, you trust
My mummy dust
Dust...
My mummy dust

Dust...
You're the possess√©e of avarice
I'm the ruler of the earth
I will smother you in riches
Till you choke on sordid mirth
You are summoned in cupidity
Purulence and lust
I'm the magnet for stupidity
Divine, you feel my thrust

In God, you trust
My mummy dust
Dust...
My mummy dust
In God, you trust
My mummy dust
Dust...

In God, we trust (Ah)
My mummy dust (Uh)
In God, we trust (Ah)
My mummy dust (Uh)
In God, we trust (Ah)
My mummy dust (Uh)
In God, we trust (Ah)
My mummy dust (Uh)2Embed
