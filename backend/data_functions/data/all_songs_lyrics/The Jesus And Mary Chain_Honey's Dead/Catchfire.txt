Catchfire LyricsYou've been burned now
All over town
Kissin' dirt and make me baby
Even underground
No where to run to uh huh
No where to hide
Baby catch fire
Baby catch fire
Catch catch fire
Catch catch fire
Disengage you waste me baby
All over my face
Kissin' dirt and make me baby
In another place
Nothing to say now honey
Nothing to do
Baby catch fire
Baby catch fire
Catch catch fire
Catch catch fire
We're gonna crucify her, yeah
We're gonna crucify her, yeah
We're gonna crucify her, yeah
We're gonna crucify her, yeah
Crucify her (x4)Embed
