Rollercoaster LyricsWhy, keep in touch with my crimes
'Cause I left it far behind
Out of sight and out of mind
Down the gutter in the drain
Back to wherever they came
Don't put me down
I don't think that I don't know
Sometimes I feel
Nothing's good it's all gone wrong
You got respect for my mind
For I've connections too sublime
Look for something hard to find
Easy streets are not for me
When I drown I drown in sea
Don't put me down
I don't think that I don't want
Sometimes I feel
Nothing's good it's all gone wrong
Can you see her now?
Have you seen her now?
She goes down
She goes down
I can't see
What I can't see
Have you seen her now?
Have you seen her?2Embed
