Tumbledown LyricsShe's a kick I couldn't miss
Couldn't miss her little twist
Get it on and get it good
Couldn't guess she ever would
Took up time and took up space
She exists outside my space
All I wanted was too much
All I wanted was to touch
Don't expect to get inside me
Give you all I got to give
Hit me again and again
Slip right to me
And slide right through me
Oh honey you threw me
Away from you
She's a head I couldn't kick
She's a head to make you sick
It's a chance I never took
When she caught me with that look
It's a sin I've never seen
And she tells me how it's been
I'm in deep up to my head
Give it all until I'm dead
Don't expect to get inside me
This is all I've got to give
Hit me again and again
Slip right to me
And slide right through me
Oh honey you threw me
Away from you
