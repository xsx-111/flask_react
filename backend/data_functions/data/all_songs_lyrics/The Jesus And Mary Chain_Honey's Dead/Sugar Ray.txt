Sugar Ray LyricsDid you do it good?
Did you do it right?
Did you get that thing
Crawling up your spine?
Did you feel the heat
Of my sugar ray?
Swear, I saw that light
Shining on your face
All my friends have fun with guns
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want
Did you read my poem?
Did you get my poem?
Did it break your bones?
Almost broke my bones
Did you feel my lips?
Did they slide and slip?
Did you feel my head
Shaking through your wrist?
Shaking through your wrist
All those boys have fun with toys
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
God, it felt so good, oh, it felt so good
Did you feel that heat, did you feel the heat
Of my sugar ray, sugar ray?
I almost died, died, died, died, died
Come enjoy
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want
