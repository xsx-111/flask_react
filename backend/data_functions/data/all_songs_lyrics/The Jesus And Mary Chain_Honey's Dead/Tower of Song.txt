Tower of Song LyricsWell my friends are gone, my hair is grey
And I ache in all the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love, but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day in the tower of song
I said to Hank Williams, "how lonely does it get?"
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
A one hundred floors above me in the, in the tower of song
Come on
I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty seven angels from the great beyond
They tied me to this table right here in the tower of song
So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry baby doesn't look like me at all
And I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
They don't let a woman kill you, not in the tower of song
Come on
Now you can say that I've grown bitter, but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgement coming, but I may be wrong
You see I hear these funny voices in the tower of song
Now I bid you farewell I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly from my window in the tower of song
Come onEmbed
