Lowlife LyricsI've got too many troubles
Stains on my body and soul
I could run keep on running
Stains and they're starting to show
I could give it up but never lose control
She looks good when she's on it
Health shining out of her face
I think she could be on it
Talking like she's just had a taste
I could give her up and never lose control
I can't stand this compromise
Going down slow I'm hypnotised
Just can't shake this messed up scene
Doing it good on a 3D screen
Help me please cause I don't know
Just no way to save my soulEmbed
