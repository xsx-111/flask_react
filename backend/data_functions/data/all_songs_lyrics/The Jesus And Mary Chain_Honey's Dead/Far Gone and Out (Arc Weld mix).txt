Far Gone and Out (Arc Weld mix) LyricsI can't explain exactly what I'm doing standing in the rain
Don't do it for fun
Do it if you feel it
Kiss it on the tongue
I'm taking my thoughts to a railway station
Put 'em on a train just to see what's coming back
What's coming back
It's coming like a heart attack
Ice melts too fast
So nothing stays forever nothing's gonna last
She's dressed in black
A black that ends in nowhere and I just got to have her back
And I'm television sick and I'm television crazy
No one works so hard just to make me feel so bad
I'm feeling bad
Oh that's too sad
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as mean as mean
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as black as black
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as mean as mean
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as black as black
Hey. Hey. Hey. I got to get her back
Hey. Hey. Hey. I got to get her back
Hey. Hey. Hey. I got to get her back
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as mean as mean
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as sick as sick
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as cool as cool
Hey. Hey. Hey. She's as black as blackEmbed
