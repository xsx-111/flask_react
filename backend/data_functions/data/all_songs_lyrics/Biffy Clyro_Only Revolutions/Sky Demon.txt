Sky Demon Lyrics
Seen a million street lights reflecting on the back of my hand
With the lights down low
Only my fingers burn
'Cause you and me, we love each other
And you and me, we can't stand each other
When we're old we'll suffocate each other
If the bloody could talk
They would say, we're happy

I don't want us to pretend
Things will make sense ever again
Say it loud and say it proud
Nobody's special at all!

This particular girl has my heart in the palm of her hand
I hear her purr, so about you sir
Her dreams, her wants, her every need
My bones, have snapped, but can't she love me
Well it goes to the highest bidder
I want to double my chance, to win this race, win this race

I don't want us to pretend
Things will make sense ever again
Say it loud and say it proud
No one is special at all!
I don't want situations to change
Things can make sense I know they can
I'm not allowed to sing it out
Nobody's special at all!
Come on and let the door swing
Come on and let the door swing
Come on and let the door open up your mind

When we're old we'll suffocate each other
If the bloody could talk, they would say
We're happy

I don't want us to pretend
Things will make sense ever again
Say it loud and say it proud
No one is special at all!
