The Captain Lyrics
Angels fall to the floor like they would if I was captain
Silver children she roared, "I'm not the son of God"
Somebody help me sing, can anybody hear me?
Liars and lovers come by tonight, we're gonna make a scene

Somebody help me sing, woah-o-o-o
Somebody help me sing, woah-o-o-o

Help me be captain of our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath, it's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder, I can't ride your horse
I swallowed half an hourglass, so now the landscape is swollen up

I gave birth to a fire
It's like its features were burning
I'm in control, I am the son of God
Somebody help me sing, can anybody hear me?
Line up your shoulders one final time, we're gonna have a ball

Somebody help me sing, woah-o-o-o
Somebody help me sing, woah-o-o-o
Help me be captain of our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath, it's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder, I can't ride your horse
I swallowed half an hourglass, so now the landscape is swollen up

Let's lock death away
Let's lock death away
Let's lock death away
Let's lock death away
Let's lock death away
Let's lock death away
Let's lock death away
Let's lock death away
Yeah!1Embed
