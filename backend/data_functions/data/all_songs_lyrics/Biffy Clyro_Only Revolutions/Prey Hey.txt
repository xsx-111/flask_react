Prey Hey Lyrics
Conducting all your merry men
Is fun until the pigs come in
The bombs will drop at quarter to
I heard that at your trigger school

Traitors will be poised to say
We struck at your destructive ways
That's what I heard at trigger school
And who I chose to slay

A special tragedy beneath the clouds
I know, I'm leaving. Before the action is
We'll draw the crowd. It was an accident

Friends can have a massive sing
Another Numbers Casualties
Collect them in a sleeping bag
They're still asleep and not half bad

Traitors will be poised to say
We struck at your destructive ways
That's what I heard at trigger school
And who I chose to slay
A special tragedy beneath the clouds
I know, I'm leaving. Before the action is
We'll draw the crowd. It was an accident

A special tragedy beneath the clouds
I know, I'm leaving. Before the action is
We'll draw the crowd. It was an accident

Come, come, don't let me hurt you
Come, come, don't let me hurt you
Now run, hurt you now
Believe it when I say it
I won't hurt you again
I promise I can prey hey
Prey hey prey, hey, preyEmbed
