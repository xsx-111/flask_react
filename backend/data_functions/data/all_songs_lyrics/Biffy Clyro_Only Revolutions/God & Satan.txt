God & Satan Lyrics
I talk to God as much as much as I talk to Satan cause I want to hear both sides
Does that make me cynical? There are no miracles and this is no miraculous life
I savor hate as much as I crave love because I'm just a twisted guy
Is this the pinnacle? Is this the pinnacle? The pinnacle of being alive?
Now I see the light

Well I look up to God but I see trouble cause this ain't a miracle
I just want to take my chance to live through a miracle

I know for certain that someone is watching but is it from up or down?
I make you miserable, you stick with me although you know I'm gonna ruin your life
I talk to God as much as I talk to Satan cause I want to hear both sides
Does that make me cynical? There are no miracles and this is no miraculous life
We walk into the tide

When the see-saw snaps and splinters your hand don't come crying to me
I'll only see your good side and believe it's a miracle, a miracle

I slap the water and watch
The fish dance to the ripples of us
We're just dull blue duds
Blinking eyes encased in rust
This ain't a miracle, this ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle, this ain't a miracle1Embed
