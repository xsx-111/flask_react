Bubbles Lyrics
Well how's your view of things today?
Got up young to fade away
The sinners sin but aren't aware
Our fables take us everywhere
I can't keep up with you
I can't keep up
I can't compete with history
We'll film it live but dub our tale
The mystery must stay inside
Look at our homes, look at our lives
In control of the morning
In control of the sea

You are creating all the bubbles at night
I'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time
We don't need to trust a single word they say
You are creating all the bubbles at play

There's a girl, there's a girl
There's a girl, there's a girl
And she's down by the river
In her own creepy world
There's a girl, there's a girl
And she's down by the river
It's time to consider
That baby is a sinner
She'll wash away your sins (wash away your sins)
She'll wash away your sins (wash away your sins)
She'll wash away your sins and go home
I only once upset my kin
Accused him of a moral slip
He came back and claimed a change
I know his life's the same again
I can't ask him again
I should let it go

You are creating all the bubbles at night
I'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time
We don't need to trust a single word they say
You are creating all the bubbles at play

There's a girl, there's a girl
There's a girl, there's a girl
And she's down by the river
In her own creepy world
There's a girl, there's a girl
And she's down by the river
It's time to consider
That baby is a sinner
There's a girl, there's a girl
There's a girl, there's a girl
She'll wash away your sins
She's face down in the river2Embed
