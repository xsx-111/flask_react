Booooom, Blast & Ruin Lyrics
I've had enough
You burn the bridge, I'll cut the boat in half
Control
You've said enough
You keep the secrets, I know you'll never spill
So...

Boom, blast and ruin girl
Causes distractions
You're rooted in hell...

I can't surprise you girl, the truth is in motion
You cover it well, but you're praying for some action
So you won't realize...
You used to be wrong, I used to be right

I flick a switch
I wake up in a corpse of sweat and tears
Soaked
I swallow truths
We fit like ice cream on an open wound
It soothes
Sink like cathedrals girl
Into the ocean
We rise like the sun...

I can't surprise you girl, the truth is in motion
You cover it well, but you're praying for some action
So you won't realize...
You used to be wrong, I used to be right

Boom, blast and ruin girl
Causes distractions
You're rooted in hell...

I can't surprise you girl, the truth is in motion
You cover it well, but you're praying for some action
So you won't realize...
You used to be wrong, I used to be right
You used to be wrong, used to be right1Embed
