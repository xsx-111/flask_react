Shock Shock Lyrics
Well you scratch and your scratch 'til your face comes away
Replaced by a hole a vortex just waiting to play
I commend your violence
Well I enter a cave with my wrists sticking out
The soles of my feet worn down to a dusty mess
I'll stay numb to these accidents

Well you talk and you talk like you're trying to shock me
I don't even know what the fuck we're still arguing about
Maintain my silence

You're a shame to your dad 'cause you're killing his days
Irresponsible life you've only yourself to blame
Maintain your friendliness

Well you talk and you talk like you're trying to shock me
I don't even know what the fuck we're still arguing about
Maintain my silence
You're wondering why you're exhausted, exhausted
From using these lies, I'm sure you'll regress again
Maintain your silence
I've been crippled by shock, shocked again
I'll continue to douse your violence
With kisses of hate and silence
I've been crippled by shock (shock shock shock)Embed
