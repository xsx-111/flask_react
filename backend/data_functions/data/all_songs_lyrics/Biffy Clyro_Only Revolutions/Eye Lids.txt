Eye Lids LyricsYou are
My lover
You are my lover
If you're really in love
Then babe, you gotta show me
It's real tough when you're not around
The cradle it swings
In rhythm to your pulses
It seems to be the day to jump down
The dreams are old and they've
Divided the two of us
Exposing the both of us
Take them to the fire
Something's got a hold of
My heart, it's bitter
I've had a burst of clarity
Take it to the cornerstone
I've had a burst of clarity
Let them all roam
You're gonna find out, baby
How you make me feel
It's just the two of us swinging
From the branches of this tree
She's not got her eyelids
So she can see everything
But she's invisible to the touch
If you're crazy in love
Then babe, you gotta hold me
'Cos we're stuck in the middle
The dreams are old and they've
Divided the two of us
Exposing the both of us
Take them to the fire
Something's got a hold of
My heart, still bitter
I've had a burst of clarity
Take it to the cornerstone
I've had a burst of clarity
Let them all roam
You're gonna find out, baby
How you make me feel
It's just the two of us swinging
From the branches of this tree
Listen to the beat
I can't see her eyes
She can see everything
You are
My lover
You are my loverEmbed
