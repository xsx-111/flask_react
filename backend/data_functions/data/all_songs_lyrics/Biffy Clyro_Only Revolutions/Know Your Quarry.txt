Know Your Quarry Lyrics
When I was young, I first encountered my crippled lungs;
I felt them burn, and cursed them ever since
I was turning blue, in a match right in front of you
And I slithered to the floor, hope I score some more

I won't go where the sun doesn't shine
Go crazy in the evening if we sail upright
Love is a shadow, in the brightness it dies;

Because tonight
We raise the sun, and we shine it over everyone
If we want a gradual hush
Our lips should kiss each other so;
I just want to feel your body
I want you to know your quarry

You can see the world looking down from a different universe
Can we save every single one of them, if we only have five hands
My father cradled us; we're bright blue and we're covered in blood
We staggered through the door, trouble's taken score

I won't go where the sun doesn't shine
Go crazy in the evening if we sail upright
Love is a shadow, in the brightness it dies;
Because tonight
We raise the sun, and we shine it over everyone
If we want a gradual hush
Our lips should kiss each other so;
I just want to feel your body
I want you to know your quarry

I just want to, feel your body; I want you to, know your quarry
I just want to, feel your body; I want you to, know your quarry1Embed
