Many of Horror (When We Collide) Lyrics
You say "I love you, boy"
I know you lie
I trust you all the same
I don't know why
'Cause when my back is turned
My bruises shine
Our broken fairy tale
So hard to hide

I still believe
It's you and me 'till the end of time

When we collide, we come together
If we don't, we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard

Sittin' in a wishin' hole
Hopin' it stays dry
Feet cast in solid stone
I've got Gilligan's eyes
I still believe
It's you and me 'till the end of time

When we collide, we come together
If we don't, we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard

'Cause you said love
Was letting us go against what
Our future is for
Many of horror
Our future's for
Many of horror
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I still believe
It's you and me 'till the end of time
When we collide, we come together
If we don't, we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard
