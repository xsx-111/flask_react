Mountains Lyrics
Took a bite out of a mountain range, thought my teeth would break the mountain down
Let's go, I want to go all the way to the horizon
Took a drink out of the ocean and treading water there before I drowned
Let's dive, I want to dive to the bottom of the ocean
Took a ride, I took a ride, I wouldn't go there without you
Let's take a ride, we'll take a ride, I wouldn't leave here without you

I am a mountain
I am the sea
You can't take that away from me
I am a mountain
I am the sea
You can't take that away from me

Cause you tear us apart
With all the things you don't like
You can't understand, that I won't leave
'Til we're finished here and then you'll find out
Where it all went wrong

I wrote a note to the jungle and
They wrote me back that I was never crowned
King of the jungle so, there's an end to my horizon
Took a ride, I took a ride, I wouldn't go there without you
Let's take a ride, we'll take a ride, I wouldn't leave here without you
I am a mountain
I am the sea
You can't take that away from me
I am a mountain
I am the sea
You can't take that away from me

Cause you tear us apart
With all the things you don't like
You can't understand, that I won't leave
'Til we're finished here and then you'll find out
Where it all went wrong

Nothing lasts forever, except you and me
You are my mountain, you are my sea
Love can last forever, between you and me
You are my mountain, you are my sea

I am a mountain
I am the sea
You can't take that away from me
I am a mountain
I am the sea
I am a mountain
I am the sea2Embed
