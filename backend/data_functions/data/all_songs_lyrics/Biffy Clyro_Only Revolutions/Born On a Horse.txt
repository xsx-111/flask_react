Born On a Horse Lyrics
I pronounce it aluminium
Cause there's an I next to the U and M
Now write it down slowly
And read it out fast
She's got eyes
Preposterous eyes
I've never had a lover who's my sister or my brother before
I've been counting on the wrong things
To make life feel alright
You could be
My acid queen
Until the end of time

'Cause you can have it all
You're stuck in the middle
Racing one and all
I was born on a horse that's all

I like to think I'm just a thoroughbred
In all but name and with no horse's flesh
We're galloping slowly
Through this broken glass
She's got hooves
Preposterous hooves
I've never had a lover who's my sister or my brother before
I've been counting on the wrong things
To make life feel alright
You could be
My acid queen
Until the end of time

'Cause you can have it all
You're stuck in the middle
Racing one and all
I was born on a horse that's all
'Cause you can have it all
You're stuck in the middle
Racing one and all
I was born on a horse that's allEmbed
