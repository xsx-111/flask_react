Liar LyricsI haven't time to sympathise
With all this nonsense and your lies
You are the king of nothing
But you shall hold me
You've got your finger on the pulse
And in my pocket, yes, of course
I am the voice of treason
But you betrayed me
I used up nearly all my luck, I didn't have to try
But yesterday is gone, and now I need an alibi
If this gets any stranger things are gonna change
'Cause I can't stand the music, always lying
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)
I'll keep on right on through it (on through it)
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)
I'll keep on right on through it
So, please, believe me when I say
I wouldn't give the time of day
Because then I'd be faking
When I could tell the truth
Were you abandoned in your youth
Because, if not, you will be soon?
I'm growing tired of waiting
For you to say goodbye
I used up nearly all my luck, I didn't have to try
But yesterday is gone, and now I need an alibi
If this gets any stranger things are gonna change
'Cause I can't stand the music, always lying
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)
I'll keep on right on through it (on through it)
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)
I'll keep on right on through it
I used up nearly all my luck, I didn't have to try
But yesterday is gone, and now I need an alibi
If this gets any stranger things are gonna change
'Cause I can't stand the music, always lying
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)
I'll keep on right on through it (on through it)
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)
I'll keep on right on through it
(Do do)
(Do do-do do do)
(Do do)
(Do do-do do do)
(Do do-do do-do do)
(Do do-do do-do do)
(Do do-do do do)Embed
