Chelsea Hotel No. 2 LyricsI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Givin' me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
Those were the reasons, that was New York
We were runnin' for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left
Yeah, but you got away, didn't you babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
When you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you
I don't need you
I need you
I don't need you
And all of that jivin' around
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again, you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said "Well nevermind
We are ugly but we have the music"
And then you got away didn't you babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
When you got away I never once heard you say
I need you
I don't need you
I need you
I don't need you
And all of that jivin' around
I don't mean to suggest
That I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't think of you that often8Embed
