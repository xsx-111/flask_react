Lover Lover Lover Lyrics
I asked my father
I said, "Father, change my name
The one I'm using now it's covered up
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame."

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

He said, "I locked you in this body
I meant it as a kind of trial
You can use it for a weapon
Or to make some woman smile."

Yeah and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

"Then let me start again," I cried
"Please let me start again
I want a face that's fair this time
I want a spirit that is calm."
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

"I never turned aside," he said
"I never walked away
It was you who built the temple
It was you who covered up my face."

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

"And may the spirit of this song
May it rise up pure and free
May it be a shield for you
A shield against the enemy."

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
I went down to the desert
To help my brothers fight
I know that they weren't wrong
I know that they weren't right
But bones must stand up straight and walk
And blood must move around
And men go making ugly lines
Around the holy ground3Embed
