Is This What You Wanted Lyrics
You were the promise at dawn
I was the morning after
You were Jesus Christ, my Lord
I was the money lender
You were the sensitive woman
I was the very reverend Freud
You were the manual orgasm
I was the dirty little boy

And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
Is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?

You were Marlon Brando
I was Steve McQueen
You were K-Y Jelly
I was Vaseline
You were the father of modern medicine
I was Mr. Clean
You were the Whore and the Beast of Babylon,
I was Rin Tin Tin
And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?

You got old and wrinkled
I stayed seventeen
You lusted after so many
I lay here with one
You defied your solitude
I came through alone
You said you could never love me
I undid your gown

And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
I mean, is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
That's right, is this what you wanted
To live in a house3Embed
