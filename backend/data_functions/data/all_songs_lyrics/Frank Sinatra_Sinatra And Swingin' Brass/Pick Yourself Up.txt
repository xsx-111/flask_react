Pick Yourself Up LyricsNow nothing's impossible, I've found for when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up, dust myself off, and start all over again
Don't lose your confidence if you slip, be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up, dust off, start over again
Work like a soul inspired until the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired, but you be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall to rise again
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, start all over again
(musical interlude)
You gotta work like a soul inspired until the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired, but you be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall and then to rise again
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again
(musical interlude)
Once again now:
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall and then rise again
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again
(coda)
That's enough nowEmbed
