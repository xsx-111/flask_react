I Love You LyricsI love you, I love you
Is all that I can say
I love you, I love you
The same old words I'm saying in the same old way
I love you, I love you
Three words that are divine
And now my dear, I'm waiting to hear
The words that will make you mine
Little girl, I love you
Can't you see I love you
I love you
Can't you see I love you
I love you, I love you
Three words that are divine
And now my dear, I'm waitin' to hear
The words that make you mineEmbed
