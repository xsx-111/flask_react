Serenade In Blue LyricsWhen I hear that serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world
Alone with you
Sharing all the joys we use to know
Many moons, ago
Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten, melodie
In the album of my memory
Serenade, in Blue
It seems like only yesterday
A small caffee, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye;
But you remained in my heart
So tell me darling is there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame, we knew
Should I go on whisteling in the dark?
Serenade in Blue
*MUSIC BREAK*
It seems like only yesterday
A small caffee, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye;
But you remained in my heart
So tell me darling is there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame, we knew
Should I go on whisteling in the dark?
