Goody Goody LyricsWriter(s): Mercer/Malneck
So you met someone who set you back on your heals - goody, goody
You met someone and now you know how it feels - goody, goody
You gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
Now how do you do
You lie awake just singing the blues all night - goody, goody
And you think that loves a barrel of dynamite
Hooray and hallelujah
You had it coming to y'a
Goody goody for him, goody goody for me
I hope you're satisfied you rascal you
I hope you're satisfied, 'cause you got yoursEmbed
