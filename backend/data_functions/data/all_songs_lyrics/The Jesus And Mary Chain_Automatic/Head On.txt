Head On Lyrics
As soon as I get my head 'round you
I come around catching sparks off you
I get an electric charge from you
That secondhand living, it just won't do
And the way I feel tonight
Oh, I could die and I wouldn't mind
And there's something going on inside
Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground
As soon as I get my head 'round you
I come around catching sparks off you
And all I ever got from you
Was all I ever took from you
And the world could die in pain
And I wouldn't feel no shame
And there's nothing holding me to blame
Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
And I'm taking myself to the dirty part of town
Where all my troubles can't be found


Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground
Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground

I said head
Ohw, head
Eah, head
Ohw, head
Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Ohw, head
Ohw, head
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ahh yeah, yeah, yeah...3Embed
