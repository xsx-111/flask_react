Coast to Coast LyricsFeels like something's pumping through my veins
I got a junk-gun fever sinking to my brain
Feels like God in heaven's gone insane
I got a cat-scratch engine, takes me on the road
Wheels get rolling back to the world I know
Takes me just as far as I can go
I got my senses strung out to the sky
That desert city's got me reaching high
Here I come, here I come
Feels like something's pumping through my brains
I got a junk-gun fever sinking through my brain
Feels like God in heaven's gone insane
Junk town nothing, got to keep it coming
Hip-shake gunning, kick-start and I'm running
Just don't make it, guess you got to fake it
Here I come, here I come
On the road
Under a sky
Coast to coast
Shake it, baby, shake it
Shake it, if you tryEmbed
