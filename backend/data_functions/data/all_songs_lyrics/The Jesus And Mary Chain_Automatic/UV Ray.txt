UV Ray LyricsThere's treasure in the pit of the hideous sin
Unpeel ice cool velvet skin
Junk eats trash in a chemical kiss
T.V. poison tastes like this
Broken down jesus with a taste for trash
Ice cool hip swinger moves too fast
Tear stained nightmares in the cold light of day
Sick sick nightmares just won't go away
You gotta kick it while it's on
You gotta take it while it's going
You gotta walk before you run
You're getting fun fun fun
There's treasure in the pit of the hideous sin
Unpeel ice cool velvet skin
Junk eats trash in a chemical kiss
T.V. poison tastes like this
You gotta kick it while it's on
You gotta take it while it's going
You gotta walk before you run
You're getting fun fun funEmbed
