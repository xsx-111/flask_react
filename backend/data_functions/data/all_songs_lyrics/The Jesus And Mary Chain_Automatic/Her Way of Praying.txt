Her Way of Praying LyricsFall to her call on a Saturday night
She's got the hip dippin' trick of all time done right
She's got her lips sticking tight to her find tonight
She's keeping time keeping time with the mystery rhyme
And she's crazy to want me to taunt me
Deep on the scene she is waiting for me
Like a sin scraping skin she is screaming for me
Hope in hope in the sky she is talking to me
She's keeping time keeping time with the image of me
And she's crazy to want me to taunt me
It's her way of saying a prayer for me
It's her way of saying a prayer for me
It's her way of talking to God for me
It's her way of talking to God for me
It's her way of talking to Jesus Christ
It's her way of talking to Jesus hey
Talking to you now
And I just can't take it anyhow
Talking about your prayer
And I just can't take it anyway
Anyhow I see it
Any kind of way she tells me
All the things I'm trying
