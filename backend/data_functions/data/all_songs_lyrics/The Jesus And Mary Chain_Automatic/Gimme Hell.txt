Gimme Hell LyricsGimme hell, gimme hell, gimme hell
She said as she fell
Tongue tied, tongue tied, tongue tied
She could never lie
So come on
So come on little sugar
Let me get your soul
Dig deep crazy like a success show
She can't bawl and she can't shout
She can't bawl and fuck it out
So come on
Gimme hell, she gives me hell
I'm fucking up anyway
Well I've been good
And I've been mean
And I've been looking for a Coke machine
So come on
So come on
So come onEmbed
