Drop LyricsThe way you drop is like a stone
Making out you're flying
But you've just been thrown
Till kingdom comes
And through bitten tongues
These eyes get stung
With every curse that's sung
These twisted times
Can't compare to mine
And heaven knows where loving goes
I should have guessed
When I took that pill
Do I love her still
Well did Jesus killEmbed
