Take It LyricsShe could take my time and that's okay
You got to get right down and show me what's the way
I got what she gives me and that's okay
Shake up baby and wake up to what is real
Stand up tall to shout out what she feels
What she don't she don't have time to steal
She could take my time and that's okay
You got to get right down and show me what's the way
I got what she gives me and that's okay
I got what she gives me and that's okay
She gives me what I need and that's okay
Oh, she gives me what I need and that's okay1Embed
