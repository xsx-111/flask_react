Here Comes Alice LyricsHere she comes walking down the street
She's got something you would love to meet
It's her heart and her heart is black
Think of ice cream sliding into a crack
The heat sticks to summer's heavy sweat
Hang around it'll get hotter yet
You got the shakes and it's gonna get worse
Don't you know it's all a part of the curse
She's got the hit that takes you into space
Suck mud and make a deal for that taste
You got nothing but you're riding on a star
You couldn't guess that she could take you that far
Some things are so hard to say
Even though you'd say them every day
Don't let your life be the butt of a joke
Get your lips round a cool black Pepsi Coke
Oh here she comesEmbed
