Work Lyrics
If you only once would let me
Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's going to happen tonight
Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

All I can say I shouldn't say

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time

All the best DJs are saving their slowest song for last
When the dance is through, it's me and you
Come on, would it really be so bad?
The things we think might be the same
But I won't fight for more
It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve
Count on that for sure
All I can say I shouldn't say

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
Yeah, we still have time

I can't say I was never wrong
But some blame rests on you
Work and play, they're never okay to mix the way we do

All I can say, I shouldn't say

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
And we still have time4Embed
