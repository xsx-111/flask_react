Just Tonight... Lyrics
I was scared but once I thought about, I let it go
Everything she said to me I guess I ought to know
We're all tired talk when it comes to shove
Put up, put out or stay at home

We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again. Just tonight? Okay

All at once the music stopped, the feeling went away
An ugly picture, me and you, but nothing I can change
You know what happens with the lights back on
The less you know the more you want
You want, you want

We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again. Just tonight? Okay
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again. Just tonight? Okay
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
Never again. Just tonight? Okay2Embed
