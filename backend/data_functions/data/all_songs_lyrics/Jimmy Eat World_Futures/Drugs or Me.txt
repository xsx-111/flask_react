Drugs or Me Lyrics
Stay with me
You're the one I need
You make the hardest things seem easy
Keep my heart somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sunshine slows
Always keep me close

If only you could see the stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs

Don't let go
We'll dig a great big hole
Down an endless hole we'll both go
You're so blind!
You can't save me this time
Hope comes from inside and I feel so low tonight

If only you could see the stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
I wish that you could see this face in front of me
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs

(Take me) I need your hands
(So far away) To pull me up
(Take me) Out from me
(So far) Out from me

(Take me) If only you could see (I need your hands)
(So far away) The stranger next to me (to pull me up, take the wheel)
(Take me) You promise, you promise that you're done (out from me)
(So far) But I can't tell you from the drugs (out from me)
I wish that you could see (I need your hands)
This face in front of me (to pull me up)
(Take me) You're sorry you swear it you're done (out from me)
But I can't tell you from the drugs (out from me)

Keep my heart somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sunshine slows
Always keep me close3Embed
