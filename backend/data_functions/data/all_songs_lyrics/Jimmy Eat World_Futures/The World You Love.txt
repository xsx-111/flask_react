The World You Love Lyrics
I got a story, it's almost finished
Now all I need is someone to tell it to
Maybe that's you
Our time is borrowed and spent too freely
Every minute I have needs to be made up
But how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say, "I'm out."
I want out

I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know, I feel safe
I'm gonna call this home
The open road is still miles away
Hey, nothing serious
We still have our fun
Oh, we had it once

But windows open and close
That's just how it goes

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are
I'm in love with the ordinary
I need a simple space
To rest my head
Then everything gets clear
Well I'm a little ashamed for asking
But just a little helps
It gets me straight again
Helps me get over it, over it

It might seem like a dream
But it's real to me

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we loved, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are

You should see the canals are freezing
You should see me high
You should just be here
Be with me here
It doesn't seem there's hope for me
I let you down
But I won't give in now
Not for any amount
Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else thinks
Now, don't that feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we areEmbed
