Kill Lyrics
Well you're just across the street
Looks a mile to my feet
I want to go to you
Funny how I'm nervous still
I've always been the easy kill
I guess I always will

Could it be that everything goes round by chance?
Or only one way that it was always meant to be
You kill me, you always know the perfect thing to say
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't walk away

I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go to you
I'll pick up, put down the phone
Like your favorite Heatmiser song goes
"It's just like being alone."

Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means
You kill me, you've got some nerve but can't face your mistakes
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't turn away
So go on, love
Leave while there's still hope for escape
Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead and so much regret
I know what you want to say
I know it but can't help feeling differently
I loved you and I should have said it
But tell me just what has it ever meant?

I can't help it baby, this is who I am
Sorry, sorry, but I can't just go turn off how I feel
You kill me, you build me up but just to watch me break
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't walk awayEmbed
