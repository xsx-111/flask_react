Nothing Wrong Lyrics
Hold them down, our bleeding suspects
(Just because, just 'cause, just who are you?)
Like candle light, burn burn burn, baby
(Burn, burn, whose turn, who gets a taste today?)

We've done nothing wrong
But we've done nothing
We can't look away
But we're just looking
It's second nature to say
"Hey hey hey, we've done nothing wrong!"

Turn them off, our blacklist singers
(Don't ask why, don't cry, don't make a scene)
A forty-five, spin spin spin, give in
(Spin spin, who wins, who's not afraid to play?)

We've done nothing wrong
But we've done nothing
We can't look away
But we're just looking
It's second nature to say
Hey hey hey, we've done nothing but
Nothing but take what's handed down
Said nothing but words approved to shout
We want to know that we own the cake we're eating
Spit it out!
Out, out

Hold them down (burn, burn)
Hold them down our bleeding suspects
Turn them off (turn, turn)
Turn them off our blacklist singers

We've done nothing wrong
But we've done nothing
We can't look away
But we're just looking
It's second nature to say
"Hey hey hey, we've done nothing wrong!"

We've done nothing wrong!
We've done nothing wrong!Embed
