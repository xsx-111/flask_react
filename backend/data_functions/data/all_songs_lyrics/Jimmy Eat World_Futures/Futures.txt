Futures Lyrics
I, I always believed in futures
I hope for better in November
I try the same losing lucky numbers
It could be a cold night for a lifetime

Hey now, you can't keeping saying endlessly
My darling, how long until this affects me?

Say hello to good times
(Say hello)
Trade up for the fast ride
(We close our eyes)
We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely

I, I always could count on futures
That things would look up, and they look up
Why is it so hard to find a balance between living decent and the cold and real?

Hey now, what is it you think you see?
My darling, now's the time to disagree
Say hello to good times
(Say hello)
Trade up for the fast ride
(We close our eyes)
We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely

Hey now, the past is told by those who win
My darling, what matters is what hasn't been
Hey now, we're wide awake and we're thinking
My darling, believe your voice can mean something

Say hello to good times
(Say hello)
Trade up for the fast ride
(We close our eyes)
We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely
We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely1Embed
