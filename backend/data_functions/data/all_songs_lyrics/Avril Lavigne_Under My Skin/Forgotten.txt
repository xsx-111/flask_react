Forgotten Lyrics
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I'm givin' up on everything
Because you messed me up
Don't know how much you screwed it up
You never listen
That's just too bad
Because I'm movin' on, I won't forget
You were the one that was wrong
I know I need to step up and be strong
Don't patronize me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Gotta get away
There's no point in thinking about yesterday
It's too late now, it won't ever be the same
We're so different now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I wanna run away
I know I wanna run away, run away
If only I could run away
If only I could run away, run away
I told you what I wanted
I told you what I wanted, what I wanted
But I was forgotten
I won't be forgotten
Never again
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Do you get it now?

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Have you forgotten?
Do you get it now?

Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah4Embed
