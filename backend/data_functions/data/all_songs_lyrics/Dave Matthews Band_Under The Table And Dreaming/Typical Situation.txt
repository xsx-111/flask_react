Typical Situation Lyrics
Ten fingers we have each
Nine planets around the sun repeat
Eight ball is the last if you triumphant be
Seven oceans pummel the shores of the sea

It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
Everyone will come around
Why are you different?
Why are you that way?
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
It all comes down to nothing

Six senses feeling
Five around a sense of self
Four seasons turn on and turn off
I can see three corners from this corner
Two iss a perfect number
But one, well
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
Everyone will come around
Why are you different
Why are you that way
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
Everyone will come around
Why are you different
Why are you that way
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
It all comes down to nothing
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
We can't do a thing about it
Too many choices
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
We can't do a thing about it
Too many choices
