Warehouse Lyrics
Said I'm leaving
This warehouse frightens me
Got me tied up in knots, can't rest for one moment
Said I'm going
Now I'm slipping slow away
Hoping to find something better than I've got inside of here
And the warehouse slips away


Hey reckless mind
Don't throw away your playful beginnings
You and I, will fumble around in the touching
And be sure to leave all the lights on
So we can see the black cat changing colors
And we can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide turns you around and around  , love
Hey we have found
Becoming one in a million
Slip into the crowd
This question I found in a gap in the sidewalk
Keep all your sights on
Hey the black cat changing colors
And you can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide choose to turn you away
Said, Life goes on
End of tunnel, TV sets
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistical bit
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away
Oh, but this I admit tastes so good
Hard to believe an end to it
Smell touch feel
How could this rhythm ever quit
Bags packed on a plane
Hopefully to heaven, yeah

Shut up I'm thinking
I had a clue, now it's gone forever
Sitting over these bones
You can read in whatever you're needing to
Keep all your sights on
Yeah man the black cat changing colors
When it's not the colors that matter
But that they'll all fade away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, Life goes on
End of tunnel, TV sets
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistical bit
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away
Oh, and this I admit seems so good
Hard to believe an end to it
Warehouse is bare
Nothing at all inside of it
The walls and halls have disappeared
They've disappeared where?
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
In a corner and wondering
If a change can be better than this
Oh, and then worry
Maybe things won't be better than they have been here in the warehouse
At the warehouse
At the warehouse
Oh, how I'd love to stay here at the warehouse
Every man and woman, get alive


That's our blood down there
Seems poured from the hands of angels
But trickled into the ground
Leave the warehouse bare and empty
And my heart's numbered beats
Still echo in this empty room
And the fear wells in me
But nothing seems good enough to them
So I am going away
I'm going away
And I'm not giving in5Embed
