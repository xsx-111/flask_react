Riverbed Dry Lyrics
Conspired against, you protest in vain
That you'll never feel that way again
Despair and desire are both hard to sustain
You'll never sink this low again
Bitter as children we are now too much of the time
What god would punish such sweet children
For such a sweet crime?

Wrong as the world and right as rain
We'll never feel that way again
Riverbed dry, this is my terrain
I'll never feel that way again
But I've tired of the city never blessed
With respite from rain
Or has that changed too?
Is the riverbed dry?

Is the riverbed dry?
Is the riverbed dry?

Conspired against, you protest in vain
That you'll never feel that way again
Despair and desire are both hard to sustain
You'll never sink this low again
But I tried of your city never blessed
With respite from rain
Or has that changed too?
Is the riverbed dry?Embed
