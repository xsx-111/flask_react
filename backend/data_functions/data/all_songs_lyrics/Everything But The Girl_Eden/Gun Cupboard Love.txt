Gun Cupboard Love Lyrics
Was a time I cried be the anchor to my keel
But time away you spent
Learning to sink and how not to feel
Guns I heard in my dreams
Saw you torn at the seams
Green bag on your shoulder slung
I watch you stoop to your new son
He wouldn't know you from Adam anymore
And I'm not the Eve you left to go to war
He wouldn't know you from Adam anymore
And I'm not the Eve you left to go to war

Was a time I cried any man is better than none
But time alone I spent
In dread of the day a battle was won
Rejoice he could be dead
Who? This stranger in my bed?
Greets me with a carefree laugh
Swings me round the garden path
I wouldn't know you from Adam anymore
And I'm not the Eve you left to go to war
I wouldn't know you from Adam anymore
And I'm not the girl you left to go to war
And I thought I knew the man you were
But nightmares of the things you must have done will recur
And I feel sick in arms
That could so lovingly hold a gun
And I won't trust those arms to hold
Those hands to mould my son
I don't want him to worship you
'Cause I don't want him to group up like you
I don't want him to worship you
'Cause I don't want him to group up like youEmbed
