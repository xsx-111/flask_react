Even So LyricsIf I say I'll always stay by your side
Stupid things say some night
Can you tell me I am wrong till I cry
Tell me do you have the right
If I say that seas could never sweep me
Overboard and far away
Do you still say you wouldn't try to keep me
If I lost the will to stay
You won't promise this will last much longer
Than the time it takes to stay
You excuse is that my heart's much stronger
And some of you love has been drained away
I can't bear it when the tears fill your eyes
And I've said too much once more
Don't be angry now you must realise
My only fear's of losing something I adoreEmbed
