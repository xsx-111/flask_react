Native Land LyricsStone the crows if you've done it again
If I've told you once, told you a thousand times
Sometimes I am so convinced we're casting pearl amongst the swine
Don't ever let me hear you say this is the life we folks must lead
We shun the limelight, shun the glare
And the circus built on a bigot's creed
Heaven is a place I've heard
But we haven't been there yet, I fear
We may have opened pearly gates
But sometimes hell stills steals in here
Don't ever let me hear you say this is the life we folks must lead
Do you think silver turns our locks?
What gold do you think paves our streets?
You say we're in a different world now
Where money and love go hand in hand
But can't you see we share this town
So why should we fight on our native land?
Can't you see we share this town
So why on earth should we tear it down?Embed
