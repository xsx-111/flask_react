Tender Blue Lyrics
And still he lies awake at night
Restless while every silence screams
And still she sleeps turned to the wall
He fears the onslaught of his dream

Touches her back but she doesn't stir
Then round her hands his fingers close
Feeling the ring that cost more than the car
All of those questions that never arose

And still she lies awake at night
Silently stares at the bedroom wall
Feeling his hand dare to touch her back
It's been a month since he started to paint the hall

And brightly burns the landing light
The baby's screaming down the hall
She shuts her eyes and she shuts her ears
She's had it up to here 'cause it's not his baby after all
