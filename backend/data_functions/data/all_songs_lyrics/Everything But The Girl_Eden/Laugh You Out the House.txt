Laugh You Out the House Lyrics
Don't show your tears boy
They'll laugh you out the house
Got to be a man now
Anything less is just not allowed
But don't keep it quiet girl
Don't rest until
They come 'round to your way of thinking
Soon enough they will

And all this talk of love
When that's something you've never known
It's too undignified, and much too close
It's much too close to home

Times are tough and
That's no way to live
Well you may be right
But I don't like your alternative
And times like these
They sort the boys out from the men
And down here with the girls
Is where I end up again
And all this talk of love
When that's something you've never known
It's too undignified, and much too close
It's much too close to home

Well should I say well done
When I know how he was stung
You were his prize and jewel
You turned out to be cruel
But I always rejoice
To see us win some ground from off the boys

And all this talk of love
When that's something you've never known
It's too undignified, and much too close
It's much too close
Much too close, it's much too close to homeEmbed
