Never Could Have Been Worse Lyrics
Each day she loves you more but you couldn't care less
You left me open-mouthed and I couldn't eat a thing
Oh, dark glasses hide an eye thickened with pain
She said she fell downstairs but I've seen the size of your fists

Oh, could have been better
Never could have been worse

Dead years like pages missing from a book she knew
Makes no sense without them, left her still like a child

Oh, could have been better
Never could have been worse


Oh, could have been better
Never could have been worse

Could have been better
Could have been better
Could have been better
Could have been betterEmbed
