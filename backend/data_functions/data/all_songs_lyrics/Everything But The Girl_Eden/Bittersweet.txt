Bittersweet LyricsDon't talk to me in that familiar way
When the keys are in my hand
Don't say that everything is here to stay
And I must try to understand
When I'm trying not to look into your eyes
Trying not to listen to your lies
Trying just to keep hold of myself
Oh but it's hard when you leave me on the shelf
You say that I set a path for you to follow
And I've already given in
But I only meant for you to taste not swallow
Where I end is where you must begibn
So try not to look into their eyes
Try not to listen to their lies
Try just to keep hold of yourself
Oh I know it's hard when they leave you on their shelf
She's such a sweet girl
Free of the taints of this world
Think that's a compliment
Don't be so full of sentiment
Why you worship sweetness
What virtue's there in weakness
Being pushed about is nothing much to shout about I knowEmbed
