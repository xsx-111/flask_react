Another Bridge Lyrics
Your words stung me to the heart
I hadn't even noticed how far we had drifted apart
Can I still count you as a friend
Or have I done too much now to ever make amends?
'Cause I once needed just an open mind
Well that's no reason why I now should leave you behind

A word from out of the blue
Reminds me how much I once needed you
Oh but that's all in the past now
So much so that I can scarcely remember how
I once needed just a hand to hold
'Cause now the few times we meet
All I sense is love grown cold

You can't hold on to everything
And I've forgotten what we talked about a long time since
Can't recall days with regret
Tomorrow remember today
And all the rest forget
'Cause time's gone by and all the things we did
Are now so much water
Under another bridge
