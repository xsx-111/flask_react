Frost and Fire Lyrics
You take the name of a man you hardly know
And then you grow up and that name has to go
Married with kids and they don't want to know
About the dreams you had let go
You're still waiting for a knight in shining armour
To steal you against your will
And while you're waiting and doing no harm
You know there's plenty of time to kill

And when you claim you wouldn't change a day
Makes me wonder where I went astray
Happy with things that leave me tired
We're as unlike as frost and fire

And now yourself you start to see in me
Pictures of things which you could've been
Torches I find I am bearing for you
When you know you could've carried them too
We give up so easily
What little they leave us to lose
And if I didn't have the fire to struggle
I could freeze in your shoes
When I say I couldn't live that way
You must wonder where I went astray
Happy with things that leave me tired
We're as unlike as frost and fire


When I say I couldn't live that way
You must wonder where I went astray
Happy with things that leave me tired
We're as unlike as frost and fireEmbed
