Fascination Lyrics
I won't try to stop you
When you speak of the past
Doubt is over now
And I can join in when you laugh
Fascination makes us ask for more
Than we'd like to know
I needn't explain
I think you know

Reassure me when my heart's
Not bold enough to bear her name
If you were in my shoes
And scared I would do the same
And though I may ask
There's no need for past details
For though I may laugh
Alone my courage fails
Did you know?

See how I've changed now
My heads so clear
Still there are some things
That I don't want to hear
There must be so much I know
That you cannot forget
And I mustn't wish your life began
The day we met
Places we go remind you
Of when you were here before
So you talk and tell me
You don't think about it anymore
There is something I know
Hasn't quite been left behind
So I'll ask you once again
To prove that I don't mind
To prove that I don't mindEmbed
