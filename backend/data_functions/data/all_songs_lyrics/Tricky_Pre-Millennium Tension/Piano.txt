Piano LyricsTo the noose, to the neck
To the boost, to the check
To the micic, to the psychic
To the circuit, to the games
Pays to blame, to the freedom
Make it rain, make it sane
Make it dance, not a chance
See her run, see her come
Take me cunning, she's darker
Never saw, never saw
She's lifelike to the heartbeat
Can't feel the heartbeat
To the flowers, to the bunches
To the lunches, to the punches
To the noose, to the neck
To the boost, to the check
To the micic, to the psychic
To the circuit, to the games
Pays to blame, to the freedom
Make it rain, make it sane
Make it dance, not a chance
See her run, see her come
Take me cunning, she's darker
Never saw, never saw
She's lifelike to the heartbeat
Can't feel the heartbeat
To the flowers, to the bunches
To the lunches, to the punches
To the good, to the clean
And I'll be your ugly
To the occasion, to the lie
Kiss beneath bridge of sighs
Not some moaning until they homing
And they spoil it all
To the noose, to the neck
To the boost, to the check
To the micic, to the psychic
To the circuit, to the games
Pays to blame, to the freedom
Make it rain, make it sane
Make it dance, not a chance
See her run, see her come
Take me cunning, she's darker
Never saw, never saw
She's lifelike to the heartbeat
Can't feel the heartbeat
To the flowers, to the bunches
To the lunches, to the punches
To the good, to the clean
I'll be your ugly
To the occasion, to the lie
Kiss beneath bridge of sighs
Not some moaning until they homing
And they spoil it all
Not some moaning until they homing
Not some moaning until they homing
To the good, to the clean
And I'll be you're ugly
To the occasion, to the lie
You kiss beneath bridge of sighs
Not some moaning until they homing
Not some moaning until they homing
To the noose, to the neck
To the boost, to the check
To the micic, to the psychic
To the circuit, to the games
Pays to blame, to the freedom
Make it rain, make it sane
Make it dance, not a chance
See her run, see her come
Take me cunning, she's darker
Never saw, never saw
She's lifelike to the heartbeat
Can't feel the heartbeat
To the flowers, to the bunches
To the lunches, to the punchesEmbed
