Operation LyricsOperation, cover your ears
You're not gonna like what you're gonna hear
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
Operation, you're not here
You can't love what you can't like
What you fear, what you fear
What you fear, what you fear
Operation, cover your eyes
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna feel you
Not near me, not near me
Not near me, not near me
Operate, operate
Operate, operate
Operation, operation
Operation, operation
Operation, cover your ears
You're not gonna like what you're gonna hear
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
Operation, cover your eyes
You can't love what you can't like
What you fear, what you fear
What you fear, what you fear
Oh
How did you know
It was so easy
To destroy her
Oh
How did you know
It was so easy
To destroy her
Operation, cover your eyes
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna feel you
Not near me, not near me
Not near me, not near me
Operation, cover your ears
You're not gonna like what you're gonna hear
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate youEmbed
