Stay, I need you to stay
Stay, I don't want you to stay
Stay, I need you to stay
In my room, oh, it's true
Stay, I don't want you to stay
Stay, I need you to stay
Stay, I don't want you to stay
Stay, I need you to stay
In my room, oh, it's true

Start over, start over
Start over, start over
Start over, start over
Start over, start over
Start over, start over1Embed
