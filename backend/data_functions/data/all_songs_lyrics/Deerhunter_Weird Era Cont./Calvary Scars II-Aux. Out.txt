Calvary Scars II/Aux. Out LyricsCrucified on a cross
In front of all my closest friends
Crucified on a cross
In front of all my closest
Crucified on cross revealed
With finest wood and rope so thick
My arms, my wrists would bleed for weeks
My arms, my wrists would bleed for
Crucified on a cross
In front of all my closest friends
Crucified with backstage pass
Crucified on drum throne1Embed
