Christian Woman Lyrics
Forgive her, for she knows not what she does


A cross upon her bedroom wall
From grace she will fall
An image burning in her mind
And between her thighs

A dying God-man full of pain
When will you come again?
Before him, beg to serve or please
On your back or knees

There's no forgiveness for her sins
Prefers punishment?
Would you suffer eternally
Or internally?

For her lust, she'll burn in Hell
Her soul done medium well
All through mass manual stimulation
Salvation

Corpus Christi
Body of Christ
(She needs)
Body of Christ
Body of Christ


She'd like to know God
Ooh, love God
Feel her God
Inside of her, deep inside of her
She'd like to know God
Love God
Feel, feel, feel her God
Inside of her, deep inside of her
Inside of her
Deep inside of her


Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, ah
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, yeah
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, yeah
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, uh4Embed
