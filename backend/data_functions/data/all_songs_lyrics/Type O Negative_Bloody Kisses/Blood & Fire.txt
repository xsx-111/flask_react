Blood & Fire LyricsNo more nights of blood & fire
No more nights of blood & fire
I always thought we'd be together
And that our love could not be better
Well with no warning you were gone
But I still don't know what went wrong
You don't know what I've been through
Just want to put my love in you
No more nights of blood & fire
No more nights of blood & fire
All those special memories
Now I bleed for you, burn for me
Perhaps I was just dreaming
When I think these things had real meaning
You don't know what I've been through
Just want to put my love in you
Love eternal
Lust infernal
Bleeding, burning
Needing, yearning
I see your face in every flame
With no answers I have only myself to blame
Of all the women that I have known, they're not you
I'd rather be alone
No more nights of blood & fire
No more nights of blood & fire
No more nights of blood
No more nights of fireEmbed
