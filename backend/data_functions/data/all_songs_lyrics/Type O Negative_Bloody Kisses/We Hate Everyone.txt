We Hate Everyone LyricsRight-wing commies
Leftist Nazis
Point their fingers
Rumours linger
We don't care what you think!
We don't care What you think!
Branded sexist
Labelled racist
Want it clearer?
Check the mirror
We don't care what you think!
We don't care (we don't care)
What you think!
Lies and slander in vain try to shame us
Riots, protests, violence just makes us famous
TV interviews, free publicity
Increase record sales dramatically
The left, they say I'm a fascist
The right calling me communist
Hate, hate, hate, hatred for all, one and all
No matter what you believe
Don't believe in youâ€”and that's true, yeah
We hate everyone
Some would say that we're biased
Accusations that we are racist
Well shit, shit, shit comes in all hues: now this means you
'Cause things ain't always like they seem
Like they seem
We hate everyone
We hate!
We hate!
We hate!
We hate!
We don't care what you think!
We don't care what you think!
We don't care (we don't care)
What you think! (what you think!)
We don't care (we don't care)
What you think! (what you think!)1Embed
