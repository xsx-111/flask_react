Too Late: Frozen Lyrics
Fuck, man, you suck!
Hahaha!
Fuck you!

Too late for apologies, uh
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
One, two, three, four!

So, you've come to say you're very sorry
"Won't happen again - forgive me?"
Time will not heal these wounds
And I'm bleeding, bleeding
(Because of you)

It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
Too late for apologies, uh

Was everything we had just a joke?
I've run out of patience, tears, and hope
Love does not conquer all
And I'm screaming, screaming
(Because of you)
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
Too late for apologies, uh

Full stop
Yuh-hoo, yuh-hoo (Full stop)
Yuh-hoo, yuh-hoo (Flow)
Yuh-hoo, yuh-hoo (Full stop)
Yuh-hoo-ooh
In the shadow of the light from a black sun
Frigid statue standing icy, blue, and numb
Where are the frost giants I've begged for protection?
I'm freezing, ah
Yuh-hoo, yuh-hoo (Full stop)
Yuh-hoo, yuh-hoo (Flow)
Yuh-hoo, yuh-hoo (Full stop)
Yuh-hoo-ooh
Cold winter winds that chill my heart with sleet and snow
Not from the North come to this glacial abode, ah
But from your dimension, cryogenic limbo
I'm freezing, ah
Frozen, frozen
Frozen, ah
Frozen, frozen
Frozen, ah
Frozen, frozen
Frozen
I'm freezing
Too late for apologies, uh

It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
Five, six, seven, eight!

It's too late (Too late)
It's too late (Too late)
It's too late (Too late, too late)
It's too late (Too late, too late)
Too late for apologies, uh, uhEmbed
