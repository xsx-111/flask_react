Roller Coaster LyricsRoller coaster roller coaster
Roller coaster roller coast
Rise dip rise dip
Your life's a roller coaster she said
And I want to get off
It's just hurting my head
And I want it to stop
Roller coaster roller coaster
Roller coaster roller coast
Rise dip rise dip
I know I hurt your head
But if you leave I'll be dead
You're the only thing I'd get out of bed for these days
Please stay forever more
Is there someway to work it out
Please say there is
I'm begging you darling
I know it hasn't been so great
It's not too late
Come to me
Stay with me
Roller coaster roller coaster roller coaster
Roller coaster roller coaster roller coast
Roll with me darling
Is there someway to work it out
Please say there is
I'm begging you darling
I know it hasn't been so great
It's not too late
Come to me
Stay with me
Roller coaster roller coaster roller coaster
Roller coaster roller coaster roller coast
Roll with me darlingEmbed
