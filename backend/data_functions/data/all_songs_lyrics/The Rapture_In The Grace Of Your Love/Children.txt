Children LyricsWait for me my only son
I can see you from above
I'm so proud of what you've done
Wait for me my only son
Children breathe
Children leave
I can see you and me
Wait for me before you die
I can see the pain in your eyes
As you watch me walk away
I can see a mother's pain
Children breathe
Children leave
I can see you and me
Now you're gone and all that's left
A piece of you I can't forget
Soft and sweet nature's voice
Can't go back we've got no choice
Children breathe
Children leave
I can see you and meEmbed
