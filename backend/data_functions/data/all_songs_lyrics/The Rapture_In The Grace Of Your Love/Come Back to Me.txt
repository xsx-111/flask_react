Come Back to Me LyricsI welcome you back into my feet
My spirit
Loving spirit
I welcome you back into my hands
My spirit
Frustrated spirit
I welcome you back into my heart
My spirit
Nourishing spirit
I welcome you back into my legs
My spirit
All loving spirit
Aren't we all children
I welcome you back into my ears
My spirit
Vibrating spirit
I welcome you right into my head
My spirit
Strengthening spirit
Aren't we all children?2Embed
