Sail Away Lyrics
Sail
Sail away
Sail away
With you
With you

Stay
Gonna stay
With you
On an ice covered hill
And don't never come down

These people
They don't know
How it feels
How it feels
With you

I look away
I see sadness
I see pain
But with you
I see hope
I see shame disappear
I see shame disappear
I see shame disappear
I see shame disappear
I see shame disappear
I see shame disappear

These people
They don't know
How it feels
How it feels
With you
With you

Sail
Sail away
Sail away
With you
With you

Stay
Gonna stay
With you
On an ice covered hill
And don't ever look back
I don't ever look back
I don't ever look back
I don't ever look back
I don't ever look back
I don't ever look back
I don't ever look backEmbed
