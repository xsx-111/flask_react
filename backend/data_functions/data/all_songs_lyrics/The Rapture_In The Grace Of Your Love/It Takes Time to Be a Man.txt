It Takes Time to Be a Man LyricsWell we're all getting bigger
But it takes time to be a man
And it's more than you figure
Well take it slow and take my hand
And there's room at the mountaintop
For everyone in God's plan
So just trust in your brother
Let me help you if I can
Oh yeah
I bet you can't get what you want
Come on baby come on darling
I bet you can't get what you need
Come on sugar and try
And there's faith in the answer
We all swear on this land
And the birds they are singing
From the place that we stand
Oh yeah
I bet you can't get what you want
Come on baby come on darling
I bet you can't get what you need
Come on sugar and try
Well there's room in your heart now
For excellence to take a stand
And there's tears that need shedding
It's all part of the plan
Oh yeah
I bet you can't get what you want
Come on baby come on darling
I bet you can't get what you need
Come on sugar and try
Hallelujah hallelujah1Embed
