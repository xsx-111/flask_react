Can You Find a Way? Lyrics
Can you find a way
To love yourself?
A way to let yourself go
Maybe if you tried it
You would even like it
Maybe if you try yourself

Can you find a way
To hurt yourself
A way to let yourself fall
I hope it's in your mouth
It's gonna keep you down and
Drown you until you die
I hope it's in your mouth
It's gonna keep you down and
Drown you until you die

Can you find a way
To let yourself go?
Just let go, just let go
Can you find a way that
Maybe looks away from all the things you've ever known
Can you find a way that
Maybe looks away from all the things you've ever known
Can you find a way
To be yourself
A way to put yourself down
Hang it up so high
High in the sky
A way from all the people that lie and
Why don't you just be here now and
Why don't you just be here now and
Why don't you just be here now and
Why are you so proud?

Can you find a way
To live your life
That doesn't break you up inside?
Maybe if you tried it
You would even like it
Maybe you could let yourself go
Maybe if you tried it
You would even like it
Maybe you could let yourself go
(x2)
Maybe if you tried it
You would even like it
Maybe you could let yourself go
Maybe you could let yourself go
Maybe you could let yourself goEmbed
