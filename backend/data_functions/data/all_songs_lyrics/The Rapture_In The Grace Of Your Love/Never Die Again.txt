Never Die Again LyricsYou got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love
Every day you pick me up and
Put me down
Feels so good inside while
You're around
Lift me high and hold me there
Safe and sound
Feels so good inside while
You're around
You got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love
Never never never gonna see ya
Never gonna die again
You got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love
Every day you pick me and
Put me down
Feels so good inside while
You're around
Lift me high and hold me there
Safe and sound
Feels so good inside while
You're around
You got me flying
Flying in your love
Your love is high and
Shining from above
The life I'm trying
Smiling in your love
You got me flying
Flying in your love
Never never never gonna see ya
Never gonna die againEmbed
