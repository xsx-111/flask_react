Blue Bird LyricsBlue bird on my shoulder
Let me tell you
What I did
My heart got broke
I wrote a note
It didn't change a thing
Woke up one day
The sky was black
I couldn't remember anything
Sparrow on the wind
Life is narrow
When you carry every thing you did
It'll beat you up
And put you down
Your head will be
Far underground
But don't give up
Look the light
I'll see you on the other sideEmbed
