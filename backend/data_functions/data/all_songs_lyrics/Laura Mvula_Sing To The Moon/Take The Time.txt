Take The Time LyricsTake the time out, take some time
Take the time now, take some time
Sit back and think about nothing
Take the time out, take some time
Take the time now, take some time
Lay down and dream 
And it’s alright to be still
Let all around you fade away
See the world around you move fast
Listen to the sound of stillness
Close your eyes
(Take the time out, take some time)
(Take the time out, take some time)
(Take the time out, take some time)
It’s alright to feel tired
‘Cause a happy heart needs time to raise
A noisy  space
Take the time out, take some time
Take the time out, take some time
Sit back and think about nothing
‘Cause a happy heart needs time to raise
A noisy  space
To breatheEmbed
