Something Out Of The Blue Lyrics(Verse)
I opened my mind, peace I could not mind
Then something out of the blue
Said I needed you
Time swept me away, merged me into pain
Then something out of the blue
Said you need me too
(Chorus)
Oh, what joy it brings to me
To know that heaven's wrong
Oh, what gladness in my heart
To know my love's been found
(Verse)
Chain still told my claim, I was pushed out of time
Then something out of the blue
Said you'd see me through
Now when hope was lost, lost paid the cost
And something out of the blue
Said my love is you
Something out of the blue
Said I needed youEmbed
