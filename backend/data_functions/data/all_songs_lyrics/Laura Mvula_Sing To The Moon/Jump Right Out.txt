Jump Right Out Lyrics(Verse)
Thought it'd be easy, thought you might know me by now
But we got caught up in the green water down in the deep
We go the long way, headed to nowhere, right from the start
How did we get here, wish I could tell you
I thought we had time
(Chorus)
You jumped right out again
You say you can't pretend
Said you didn't need me, love
The grass needed rain
You was hoping that one day
Maybe things will change
You jumped right out again
You say you can't pretend
(Verse)
So maybe one day we'll find the answers out in the blue
And maybe we'll get there holding another's marvelous dreams
We ride the seasons, soul changing colors, we never could know
We're nearly drowning, fighting for something
You said we'd be fine, I thought we had time
(Chorus)
You jumped right out again
You say you can't pretend
Said you didn't need me, love
The grass needed rain
You was hoping that one day
Maybe things will change
(Verse)
We ride the seasons, outchanging colors
We never could know
How did we get here, wish I could tell you
I thought we had time
(Chorus)
You jumped right out again
You say you can't pretend
Said you didn't need me, love
The grass needed rain
You was hoping that one day
Maybe things will changeEmbed
