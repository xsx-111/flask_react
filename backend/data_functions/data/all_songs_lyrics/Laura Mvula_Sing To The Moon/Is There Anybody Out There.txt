Is There Anybody Out There LyricsIt's too late for me now
Can't be undone in me now
Gone down deep within me now
Come take it out on me now
I was young and free then
Like a child I loved to love then
Now there's nothing left in me but fear
I can see the end is all near
This is the end before it's even started
I can't survive this pain, I'm brokenhearted
I believed in you then
You believed in me then
You took everything I had and more
Each day I live to give you my all
This is the end before it's even started
I can't survive this pain, I'm brokenhearted
Is there anybody out there
Who knows
Is there anybody out there
I won't make it out here alone
Keep on judging to forever
Take a good thing, let it start
Keep on judging to forever
Take a good thing, let it start
Is there anybody out there
Who knows
Is there anybody out there
I won't make it out here alone
Is there anybody out there
Who knows
Is there anybody out there
I won't make out here alone
Keep on judging to forever
Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there
I won't make it out here aloneEmbed
