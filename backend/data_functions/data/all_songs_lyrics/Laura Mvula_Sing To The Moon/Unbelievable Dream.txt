Unbelievable Dream LyricsTogether let's take the long road
Be part of a story to be told
Together let's take a long road
Just sit and wonder
Unbelievable dream
Don't wrap it up and throw it away
Unbelievable dream
Out of the blue can it be true?
Out of reach it might seem
Upon a cloud a color of doubt
Unbelievable dream
Don't throw it away
Sunshine bright on the mountain
Impossible beauty to be found
We fly higher than ever
Open your eyes wide
Unbelievable dream
Don't wrap it up and throw it away
Unbelievable dream
Out of the blue can it be true?
Together let's take a long road
Together let's take a long road
Together let's take a long road
Together let's take a long road home
Unbelievable dream
Don't wrap it up and throw it away
Unbelievable dream
Out of the blue can it be true?
Out of reach it might seem
Upon a cloud a color of doubt
Unbelievable dream
Don't throw it awayEmbed
