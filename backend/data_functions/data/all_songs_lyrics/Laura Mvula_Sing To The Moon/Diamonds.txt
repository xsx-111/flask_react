Diamonds LyricsSometimes the grass ain't greener on the other side
Maybe the sky is clearer in another place
But you got diamonds under your feet
But you got diamonds in your heart
Waiting for a day of change to come
And you're beautiful, dancing in a gloomy store
But you got diamonds under your feet
But you got diamonds in your heart
But you got diamonds in your heartEmbed
