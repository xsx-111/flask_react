Like the Morning Dew Lyrics
Our love feels like the morning clouds
Like the morning dew that goes away
Our love feels like the morning clouds
Like the morning dew that goes away

Nothing lasts but memories
The best ones seem to go by slow
Tried to write the perfect song for you
Then I realised it didn't belong to me
It didn't belong to me

Our love feels like the morning clouds
Like the morning dew that goes away
Our love feels like the morning clouds
Like the morning dew that goes away

Heaven knows how long to go
We never have a thing to show
Every day seemed like the same
Then I realised I didn't belong to you
I didn't belong to you
Our love is like the morning clouds
Like the morning dew that goes away
Our love is like the morning clouds
Like the morning dew that goes away

Like the morning dew
Love is like the morning clouds1Embed
