Father, Father LyricsFather, father, let me love you
Saw you wandering in my dream last night singing
Wonder, wonder what you might do
You can't simply hide our dream in the blue

Don't try to fight; don't let me go
You've gone too far from what I know
I lost my heart in the dark with you
Father, father, why you let me go
Father, please don't let me go
Brother, brother, let me love you
Whisper all your deepest fears
You can trust me
And when it's over we can begin
Finally to make amends
Try to save us

Let me love you
