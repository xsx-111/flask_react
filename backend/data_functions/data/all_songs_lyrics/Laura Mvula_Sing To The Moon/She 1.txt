She 1 LyricsShe walked towards you with her head down low
She wondered if there was a way out of the blue
Who's gonna take her home this time?
She knew that this time wouldn't be the last time
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There she waits looking for a savior
Someone to save her from a dying self
Always taking ten steps back and one step forward
She's tired, but she don't stop
Oh, oh, oh, she don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
Oh, oh, oh, she don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
Every day she stood, hoping for a new life
She closed her eyes, and she heard a small voice say
You don't stop no, you belong to me
She cried, maybe it's too late
Don't, don't stop, don't, don't stop
She don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
She don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
She don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
She don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
She don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
She don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
She walked towards you with her head down low
She wondered if there was a way out of the blue
Who's gonna take her home this time?
She knew that this time wouldn't be the last timeEmbed
