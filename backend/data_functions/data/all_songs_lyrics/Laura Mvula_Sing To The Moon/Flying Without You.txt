Flying Without You LyricsHe was a boy in love, just not with me
I did not see how hard it would be
To love alone without another
Crushed my heart, I fell into pieces
I was a girl in love
Gave my heart
Lost my soul
And even though
I was not enough for him back them
I wonder how it could've been
I'm flying without you
I'm right now without you
I found something better
I love more than ever
I love more than ever
You were my fantasy
You gave me something no one else could ever give
Seemed like a dream back then
Another story, we were young and innocent
We were a perfect picture
Make believe I could not see it in went
Time and time again you left me there
Another happy memory
I'm flying without you
I'm right now without you
I found something better
I love more than everEmbed
