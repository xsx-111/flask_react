Make Me Lovely Lyrics
I can't make you love me
You can't make me lovely
Please don't try to hold me down
It's over now
I will go where you can't find me
I don't think I can trust you
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
We got lost when we went too far
Give back my soul and take my heart


Don't want to
Lose my soul
Don't want to
Lose my soul

I don't need love to rescue me
I'll be all that I choose to be
When the sky fills with falling stars
Give back my soul and take my heart
