She Lyrics
She walked towards you with her head down low
She wondered if there's a way out of the blue
Who's gonna take her home this time?
She knew that this time wouldn't be the last time

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

There she waits looking for a savior
Someone to save her from her dying self
Always taking ten steps back and one step forward
She's tired but she don't stop

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh-ooh, she don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
Ooh-ooh, she don't stop, she don't stop, she don't stop
Every day she stood hoping for a new light
She closed her eyes and she heard a small voice say
You don't stop, no, you belong to me
She cried, maybe it's too late

Don't, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't-
She walked towards you with her head down low
She wondered if there's a way out of the blue
Who's gonna take her home this time?3Embed
