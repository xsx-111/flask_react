Fire Burns Below Lyrics

Stand and face each other
Don't know what to say
But that look in your eyes
Gives it all away
You say you've got these feelings
You can't put into words
But you don't have to say a thing
'Cause I've already heard

Give me one good reason
Why this has to be
That's all I'm asking for

Don't say that it's over
When you and I both know
You can't put out this love
The fire burns below

You can't put out this love
The fire burns below
We've been through so much together
We've laughed and we've sometimes cried
To say our love ain't working
Well, we haven't really tried
Come on, let's talk things over
Love can't be bought and sold
One more night together's what the future holds
What the future holds

Well, give me one good reason
Why this has to be
I said that's all I'm asking for
Can't you see, I said

Don't say that it's over
When you and I both know
You can't put out this love
The fire burns below

You can't put out the fire down below

Well, give me one good reason
Why this has to be
I said that's all I'm asking for
Can't you see, I said

Don't say that it's over
When you and I both know
You can't put out this love
The fire burns below

You can't put out the fire down belowEmbed
