Treatment Bound LyricsWe're gettin' noplace
Fast as we can
Get a noseful
From our so-called friends
We're gettin' nowhere
Quick as we know how
We whirl from town to town
Treatment bound
First thing we do when we finally pull up
Get shitfaced drunk, try to sober up
There'll be no pose tonight
No money in sight
Label wants a hit
And we don't give a shit
'Cause we're gettin' noplace
As fast as we can
We get a noseful
From our so-called friends
We're gettin' nowhere
Quick as we know how
We whirl from town to town, Duluth to Madison
Treatment bound
Gettin' nowhere
(Keep goin')
Second thing we do is walk around
Go to the job or try to hold one down
There's no mass appeal
Carton's asleep at the wheel
Yesterday's trash
Too bored to thrash
We're gettin' nowhere
Fast as we can
We got a noseful
Of them so-called friends
We're gettin no place
As quick as we know how
We're gettin' nowhere
What will we do now?
Take it, Scotty
(Tommy: What are the chords at that one part you just fucked up?
Paul: Fucked 'em up)Embed
