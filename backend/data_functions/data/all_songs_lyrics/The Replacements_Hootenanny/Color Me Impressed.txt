Color Me Impressed LyricsEverybody at your party
They all look depressed
Everybody dressin' funny
Color me impressed
Stayin' out late tonight
Won't be gettin' any sleep
Givin' out their word
Cuz that's all that they won't keep
Like a monkey on the mirror
Oh shit, pass the bill to Chris
Intoxicated lover ending our french kiss
Can you stand me on my feet?
Can you stand me on my feet?
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody at your party
They don't look depressed
And everybody's dressin' funny
Color me impressed
Color me impressed
Color me impressed
Color me impressed
Color me impressed
I call it outEmbed
