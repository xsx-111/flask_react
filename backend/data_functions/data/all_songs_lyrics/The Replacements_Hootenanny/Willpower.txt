Willpower LyricsWillpower
Changed my mind
Willpower
Changed my mind
Stop it, stop it
Stop it anytime
Stop it, stop it
Stop it just in time
Willpower
Could change your mind (my life)
Minutes seem like hours
Take yours, take yours don't take mine
Stop it, stop it
Stop it, here it comes
Stop it, stop it
Stop it just in time
Willpower
Changed my mind
Willpower
Stop it, stop it
Stop it, here it comes!
Stop it, stop it
Stop it just in time!
I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna, I don't wanna stop it
Stop it, I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop it, I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop it, I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop it, I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop it, I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop it, I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop it, I don't wanna stop it
I don't wanna stop itEmbed
