Mr. Whirly Lyrics(Wait wait wait do the whole thing)
Now come on baby do the twist
Now come on baby do the twist
Shake it around
It goes like this
Now come on baby do the twist
Now come on baby do the twist
Shake it around
Mr. Whirly
Please don't call me
I've been drinkin' alone
Whirly
Please don't follow me home
Mr. Whirly
Please don't call me

Whirly
Surely you know by now
Come on, Whirly
Whoooo
Go on baby
You're cool
Shake it around
1, 2, 3 strikes
And you are
I said you're theEmbed
