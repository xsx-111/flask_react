You Lose Lyrics(Are we gonna record this one
I see well actually)
Yeah
You lose
You lose
Yeah
You lose
You lose
It's a game show or a video
It's all the same don't you know
Spend your money doin' that
You'll lose your mind you won't get it back
Yeah
You lose
You lose
Yeah
You lose
You lose
Hypnotize them VHO
Even still your mind's on hold
Reaction distraction
Win or loss and I don't even know how much I cost
Yeah
You lose
You lose
Yeah
You lose
You lose
Winner losers all the same
Make your bet that's my
Degeneration
Oh no
Winner losers Kodachrome
Yeah
You lose
You lose

You lose
You lose
Sucker
