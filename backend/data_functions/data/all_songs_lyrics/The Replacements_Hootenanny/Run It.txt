Run It LyricsRed light, red light, run it
Red light, red light, run it
Lyndale, Garfield
Back up now 'cept
Engine stopped runnin'
There ain't nobody watchin' -- run it
There ain't nobody watchin' -- run it
Lyndale, Garfield
Back up now 'cept
Engine stopped runnin'
Ain't no truth -- run it
Ain't no good -- run it
Lyndale, Garfield
Back up now 'cept
Engine stopped runnin'
Run it
Run, run, run itEmbed
