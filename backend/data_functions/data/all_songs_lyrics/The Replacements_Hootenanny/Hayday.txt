Hayday Lyrics(Hit it ... Bob!)
Sittin' at home, I'm so excited
Goin' to the party though we weren't invited
Times ain't tough, just tedious
Get up -- heyday
Heyday
Don't hate it
Mamamama heyday
Geniuses act like idiots
Idiots act like geniuses
Heyday
My heyday
Heyday
Mamamama heyday
It ain't gonna last
Ain't yo
It ain't gonna last
It's my heyday
My little heyday
It's your heyday
Babadaba heyday
My heyday
Your heyday
My heyday
Mamamama heyday
It's your heyday
It's your heydayEmbed
