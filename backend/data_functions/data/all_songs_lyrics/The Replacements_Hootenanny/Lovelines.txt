Lovelines Lyrics(Stop it)
Slightly overweight girls need sex also
Send your note and desires
Means of contact P.O. Box 8941
Baby you have been along
I'll read another
As soon as it comes around
Feeling pressure?
Call Lovelines
JD if you need a fishing partner
Please let me know
Visitors welcome instruction
From five-generation Master Gin Foon Mark
Hey Ellen
Mark says hi
Tom what else can I say
I love you very much
I'm glad we're together
Miss you a lot
Love Kitten
Oh yeah oh yeah Kitten
Oh yeah oh yeah
Lurkin' lizards lyin' under Lake Tanners door 306
Awaiting for the return of the crawling kingsnake
John Lee
Okay
Grin & bear it
Fantasy Phone Swingers' Hotline
Pure silk, pure seduction
G-strings in petal pink
Yeah
Attract some women
Scientific formulated spray
The conductive male hormone
Work
Turn the lights off
Ooh baby, let's turn a page
Person-to-person
And it's all a bunch of shit
