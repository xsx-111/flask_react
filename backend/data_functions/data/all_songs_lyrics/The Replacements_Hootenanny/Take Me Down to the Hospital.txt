Take Me Down to the Hospital LyricsWell, I can't breathe
I can't swallow
Here today
Going back tomorrow
Lyin' in the back
With your heart attack
In the front seat
With Pete Pete Pete
Red light running
Drag me in
Move the seat back
It's Saturday night
Take me down
To the hospital
Take me down
To the hospital
Prop me up
Throw me out
Jockey the phones
Fill out these forms
Take off your shirt
Where does it hurt?
Get outta them slacks
Outta them slacks -- cut the belt!
Take me to -- hospital
Take me to -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Take me to -- hospital
I don't wanna
Ride no car
Makin' love
In my own backyard
Take me to -- hospital
Take me to -- hospital
Take me to -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Hospital
Hospital
Hospital
Hospital!
I don't wanna
Die before my time
Already used
Eight of my lives
Eight of my lives
Eight of my lives
Take me to -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
Take me down -- hospital
I've got blisters. I've got blisters on my palmsEmbed
