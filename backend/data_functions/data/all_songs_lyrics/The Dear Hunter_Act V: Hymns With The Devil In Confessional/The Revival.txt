The Revival Lyrics
It took a little longer than we hoped, but it was worth it
You know, it takes a village to raise a scheme, to patch the holes of a mausoleum
Well, we’re packing in the patronage like it's a lotto (and everybody wins)
Now take a seat so the show can start, and will you welcome these works of art?

Isn’t she beautiful?
No? Maybe another one here could entertain
Ah, yes, we swear that every minute's worth the wait

Hey! It's a cry you can’t contain
A release you couldn’t estimate
And the secret's safe as long as you pay
It's so good to be so bad
You can leave it when you walk away
And pretend you’ve washed your hands of it

Last call for the Sunday squaws and there's no room left for the hem and haw
We’ll give a gift long overdue and make a sultan out of you
That’s right, yeah, any troglodyte can have a life in the party as a socialite
Or if you’re looking to efface, you can retire without a trace

Don’t you bother with doubt
Hey! It's a cry you can’t contain
A release you couldn’t estimate
But the secret's safe as long as you pay
It's so good to be so bad
You can leave it when you walk away
And pretend you’ve washed your hands of it

Another candidate for giving her bruises
Another night that she’ll dissociate
Another man who thinks the rules don’t apply to him
Another candidate for giving her bruises
Another night that she’ll dissociate

Long was this road I’ve wandered, but short did my temperance live
Here I’ve helped him build a temple to deify this czar of sin
Now who to blame but I for tying these knots so well at my wrists?
The noose would surely find me if I’m too wily, but what of the life I’d live?

The sale of a soul that falls
As foolish as young Esau
It's better if I withdraw
Hey! It's a cry you can’t contain
A release you couldn’t estimate
But the secret's safe as long as you pay
It's so good to be so bad
You can leave it when you walk away
And pretend you’ve washed your hands of itEmbed
