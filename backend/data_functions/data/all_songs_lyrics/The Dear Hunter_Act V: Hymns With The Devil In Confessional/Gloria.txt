Gloria Lyrics
Open-eyed oversight led me to here
Looking for an avenue to simply appear
One too many steps into the wrong direction
Leading me to throw up my hands

Soon, I'll know exactly where I stand
Found in a flood of incendiary plans
Oh, I've been falling fast into the rhythms without rhymes
I won't be giving up again
Yeah, I'll be getting up again

I heard a voice; it said: "e dolore magna gloria
Bring me your heart, and then you will awake
In a state of surprising euphoria
But don't tell anyone"

I was in love with inner ambiguity
Then I learned to turn emotions into weaponry
One too many words said with the wrong inflection
Leading me to throw up my hands

Am I giving up the ghost again;
Surrendering, so that my evils will amend?
Oh, I've been falling fast into the space between the lines
But I'll be getting up again
I won't be giving up again
I heard a voice; it said: "e dolore magna gloria
Bring me your heart, and then you will awake
In a state of surprising euphoria
But don't tell anyone what you saw here"

Now, I've never heard that sound before
I am nothing but an infant wave stuck in a savage ocean

Soon, I'll know exactly where I stand
Found in a flood of incendiary plans
Oh, I've been falling fast into the space between the lines
But I'll be getting up again
I won't be giving up again

I heard a voice; it said: "e dolore magna gloria
Bring me your heart, and then you will awake
In a state of surprising euphoria
Don't fear the words that I say"
I heard a voice; it said "e dolore magna gloria
Bring me your heart, and then you will awake
In a state of surprising euphoria
But don't tell anyone what you saw here"Embed
