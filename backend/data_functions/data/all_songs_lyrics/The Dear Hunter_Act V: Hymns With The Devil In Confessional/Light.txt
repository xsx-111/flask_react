Light Lyrics
Son, your father's not all good
But still, I love you more than I thought I could
And when the menace in my mind
Finds me, I simply look to your eyes

And boy, someday I hope I do
See the man you will grow into
And when your heart's in disarray
Know that your father, too, has made mistakes

Son, your father's lost his head
Still, I mean every word that I've said
Though, the truth can truly cut
Here in this confessional, with my blood

And boy, someday I hope I do
See the man you will grow into
And when your heart's in disarray
Know that your father, too, has made mistakes

I've been cruel to the ones who have stayed by my side
And foolish enough to believe in my pride
But vanity never could keep me from caring for you
I've strayed too far away from the trees and the lake -
The innocent road that I chose not to take -
But still, I can bring you to bathe in the river;
To wash out the world long before your heart's withered away
And boy, someday I hope I do
See the man you will grow into
And when your heart's in disarray
Know that your father, too, has made...
He's made mistakes1Embed
