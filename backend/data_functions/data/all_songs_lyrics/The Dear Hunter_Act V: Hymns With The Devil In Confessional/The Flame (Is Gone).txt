The Flame (Is Gone) Lyrics
I see you trembling like the Earth is falling from your feet
Like you've never felt the ground before
An indication that you're over your head again
That you don’t know how to settle the score
I would be lying if I told you that I didn't know
The way that you could fix it all
If you're stacking your problems like a pile of bricks
You've gotta knock down the wall

Before someone, like you, breaks you and puts you in the ground

Do the heavens ever spare the crop when the winter falls?
Could we really hide if the reaper calls?
And so it goes, the lamb will be lead to the loam
And you will return

I see a hesitating grimace held above your chin
Like you haven't thought of this before
And though the sentiment keeps you from letting go
You know it's irresistible
To hear those voices hush, you must be cold
In times when peace of mind is bought and sold

Cause someone, like you, would break you and put you in the ground

Do the heavens ever spare the crop when the Winter falls?
Could we really hide if the reaper calls?
And so it goes, the lamb will be lead to the loam
And you won't return

Don’t you want to see him fall apart
So you can pick the pieces up and put him back together?
Finally building up the perfect pawn
Another shadow lost in the dark, another shadow lost in the dark
