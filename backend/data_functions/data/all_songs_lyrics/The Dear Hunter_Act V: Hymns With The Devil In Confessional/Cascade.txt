Cascade Lyrics
I heard a call in my sleep again; I brought my body to the altar
But a good man said that I raised the dead
I'm seeing forgotten forms from a different age
Half-hearted truths hanging in the air with the Holy Ghost
I'm singing hymns with the devil in confessional

I've been running through the night again
Trying to find where the wild things wouldn't go
But I'm keeping it in
Hate the sinner, never hate the sin

I keep waking in the strangest states, and drawing lines around my body
To recall my place; I feel the heat of a thousand breaths upon my neck
And the gaze of a thousand eyes burning holes into my back
And now I'm stuck between alive and after

I've been running through the night again
Trying to find where the wild things wouldn't go
But I'm keeping it in
Hate the sinner, never hate the sin
I've been searching for a remedy
Hands to guide where the shadows never show
I'll never know
I keep looking for a quicker fix
But I'm afraid of finding what it is
I know that I just need a quicker fix
Hate the sinner, not the sin
I keep looking for a quicker fix, but
I wouldn't know just what to do with it
Hate the sinner, not the sin!

I've been running through the night again
Trying to find where the wild things wouldn't go
But I'm keeping it in
Hate the sinner, never hate the sin
I've been searching for a remedy
Hands to guide where the shadows never show
I'll never knowEmbed
