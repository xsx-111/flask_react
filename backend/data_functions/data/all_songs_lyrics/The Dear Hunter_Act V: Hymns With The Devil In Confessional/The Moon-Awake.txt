The Moon/Awake Lyrics
This soul's a stowaway
At the heels of a gaze, their eyes betrayed in the arcade
Misdirection pervades, and my image fades of you
(Where are you?)
Could we return to the hymn of the Lake?
Grave refrains of impossible love, not believing what they'd say
Haunting heralds whose words were lost on you
(Where are you?)

I'd bare you my heart, if I knew that it still was there
I'm too nervous to look, too afraid to close the book
So take all the wind from my lungs, if you're out of air
Just deliver me truth, deliver me you

How'd we lose our place? Who decided our fate?
Decay until we we're erased, idly wasting away?
Well, the nightmare's ending soon
(Where are you?)

I'd bare you my heart, if I knew that it was still there
I'm too nervous to look, too afraid to close the book
So take all the wind from my lungs, if you're out of air
Just deliver me truth, I'll deliver me you
(Who are you waiting for?)
(Who are you waiting for?)
If the younger me just could have seen the trouble I'd create
He'd never have agreed to carry on
(Who are you waiting for?)
When sins of sons to fathers come, too heavy is the weight
The spirit split in two

Dear apparition, in this fleeting flash
Must I burn the earth, before you turn to ash?
Would such extremes repair our broken past?
The silver lining seldom lies in sight too plain to see
But trust our story's end can bring redemption for the pain endured
