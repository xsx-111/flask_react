The March Lyrics

If one and all who hear my call could lend their ears to me
Then you could hear the crooked tale of how this fire has come to be
I must admit that the manipulator's fate was resting at my feet
But all of his intimidation brought me to my knees when he said
"Keep this secret safe, or watch your flock devoured by the flame
Left in my wake; I'll burn through you."

There is a vision you have come to know and love
(The deft defender with a heart of gold)
An imitation of a man he left to die face down in the mud
(Such venom coursing through his veins)
And now the mimic is a cynic who laughs while the house of God is reduced to ash
Well, I won't let corruption carry on

Come out from the dark and claim your light
Before you all but fall apart
We can keep this wolf far from our flock
So raise your voices, torches, rocks
And follow me into the night
We'll bring this evil to the light
You tried to take control
But you couldn't with a stolen soul
So we're coming after you tonight
Coming after you tonight
No word he could uphold
'Cause the only truth he ever told
Was that there's far too many ways to die
Far too many ways to die
Lost in his memories, the end in sight

Come out from the dark and claim your light
Before you all but fall apart
We can keep this wolf far from our flock
So raise your voices, torches, rocks
And follow me into the night
We'll bring this evil to the light
