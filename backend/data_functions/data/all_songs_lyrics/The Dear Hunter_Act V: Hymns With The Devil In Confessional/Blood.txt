Blood Lyrics
Silence slights spirits of those gone into the night
But what was the cost? Do I justify the loss
When a loss of control would be digging myself a hole?
It couldn't be worth it

I'm a killer, I'm a killer, I'm a killer
But I've been killing myself all along
Had I done my best to protect innocence
Or did I lead the wolf to the fawn?

Watch your words, keep them from bothering the herd
Provoking the stones that they all can throw
No, I won't carry on living this life that I stole
It just isn't worth it

I'm a killer, I'm a killer, I'm a killer
But I've been killing myself all along
Divining the right from the wrong
Had I done my best to protect innocence

Or was something more wicked in store?
Is there villainy inside of me?
In search of worth, have I burned the earth?
There's no passion in being passive
And no inaction could bring an answer
So for you, I am a killer
