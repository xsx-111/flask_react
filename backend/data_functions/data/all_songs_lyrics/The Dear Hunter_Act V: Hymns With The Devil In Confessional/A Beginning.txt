A Beginning Lyrics

The silence dominates, divining resolutions from my hands
Lines drawn in the sand
But my volition's wry, my temperance twisted, faced with failing light
Nothing in my sight

If I fall into the ocean, send my soul into the sea
Will these reflections trouble me? Will I dream my final dream?

I sensed this silhouette who's standing vigil growing very sore
Just one moment more
Before I close the curtain, fate uncertain; spirit to the dark
Endlessly apart

Can I fall into the ocean, send my soul into the sea?
No distant echoes haunting me, no further phantoms will I see
This silence held eternally

But what if the silence is broken by the ones you've loved
Incredibly present, with a heavenly breath to wake you up
With nothing left to poison, a portrait of who I've become
Only elation remains, protecting us from this neverending night
Dear apparition, while my senses last
Is absolution far too much to ask?
Will you forgive a truly troubled past?
The silver lining still remains, the sights I've left to see
So trust that with this end, a new beginning's waiting patiently
