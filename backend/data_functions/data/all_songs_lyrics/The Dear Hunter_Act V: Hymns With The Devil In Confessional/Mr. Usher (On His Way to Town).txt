Mr. Usher (On His Way to Town) Lyrics
The shutters close when he's around
The children shut their eyes
In fear of what they must surmise
When all the gentlemen hang their heads down, down, down
Yeah, Mr. Usher's on his way to town

He keeps his sights set straight and true
His idle hands won't flit or flutter
Never does he slip or stutter
Still his mind is menacing away
Yeah, Mr. Usher's on the prowl today

He needn't dirty up his hands
He'll twist your heart until you're manic
Lost in endless streams of panic
Pray you're not the one he finds
If Mr. Usher's got you on his mind

Any time the plan'll get a bit off track
He's the only one who can bring it back
The main manipulator, yeah
The wolf who leads the pack
You better lock your doors and shut your windows tight
Pull the shades down and turn off the lights
Always feed the hand that leads to teeth that bite
Because, if he has no use for you
He'll take you to the river
Take you to the river
He'll have you hanging by a string
Or noose, if he prefers you perish
All your dreams become nightmarish
If you block his path or plan
Yeah, Mr. Usher always gets his man

Mr. Usher always gets his man
Yeah, Mr. Usher always gets his manEmbed
