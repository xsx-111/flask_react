The Most Cursed of Hands / Who Am I Lyrics

The devil went down to the river
And he came to fall; to lose it all;
To fool the fool too quick to call
While the gambler's stacks grew bigger;
He had lost his sights through narrowed eyes;
Too tempted by his wry desires

Damned across fated paths
The time to fold had come to pass

With gambler's glory delivered
He had thirst for more; a bigger score;
A trophy no one could ignore
And the devil's wealth had withered
So with cunning class he offered fast his soul;
The wager had been cast

The gambler called, the river fell
And now the hand from out of hell
The devil smiled, looked in his eyes;
He knew the loss was glorified
The devil said "Revel in your victory;
You've earned your damning, pack your things and leave."
But, the gambler only stood and stuttered
Stammering on words in disbelief
"Now you've won a new vocation
Pray to me that you can stand the heat!"
And that, the gambler saw
Meant he had gone and finally set the devil free

Damned across fated paths
The hand he played would be his last

Who am I? Who am I?
Just a gambler, holding aces in the devil's eyes?
What is wrong? What's the sin?
Where's the answer? Where the hell do I fit in?
Or could it be, there's just a little demon lost in the debris
And I, should idly bide my time until a wager releases me?
Hey! It can't remain unknown...Embed
