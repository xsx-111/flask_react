The Fire (Remains) Lyrics
For so long have my teeth held my tongue from a venomous voice (From a venomous voice)
But the poison has passed from my lips to my hands, an incendiary ploy
(And Hell will open up its flue) I bare my soul through the flames before me
(And you will witness what the fire can undo)

Far from the ash, I will be born again
Where every debt is repaid
Nothing left to keep me out of paradise
As portraits of the past fade away

The id dots the i's of antiquity
While the ego, of late, has held sway
Too foolish to stray past the line, but too weary to stay
Too weary to stay

Far too long have I waited to witness the balances bend (The balances bend)
In the favor of wrongs being remedied, wickedness coming to an end

Far from the ash, I will be born again
Where every debt is repaid
Nothing left to keep me out of paradise
As portraits of the past fade away
Far beyond the act, I will be whole again
A phoenix out of the flame
I'm burying that menace in a memory
A funeral held in my name

The ritual pyre's sending smoke to the sky
As the building continues to burn
The wrath in the ruin, the pain in the grave
As the lies are retired to the urn
But we can't keep the embers from catching
The truth from destroying us all
Do I die as the martyr or miscreant? I'll make the call
I'll make the call

Far from the ash, I will be born again
Where every debt is repaid
Nothing left to keep me out of paradise
As portraits of the past fade away

Far beyond the act, I will be whole again
A phoenix out of the flame
I'm burying that menace in my memory
A funeral held in my name
Held in my name
Brothers and sisters...Embed
