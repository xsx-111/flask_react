Back Home LyricsIf you wanna know my secret
What are you waiting for
If you wanna ask me something
I can tell you so much more
If you wanna cause me trouble
It's not up to me
I know that there's something missing
Does it mean you're leaving me?
How can we fix our love
Now that we know it’s broken
I can only take so much
Your kiss and your touch are both like a poison
Where did it all go wrong
Why is this what we've chosen
I can only do so much to fix
All the things that went unspoken
How can we fix our love
Now that we know it’s broken
I can only take so much
Your kiss and your touch are both like a poison
Where did it all go wrong
Why is this what we've chosen
I can only do so much to fix
All the things that went unspoken3Embed
