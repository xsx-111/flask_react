Your Love Will Set You Free LyricsI can’t tell you
How hard it has been since I left you
You’re my sweet thing
The only thing I want is to caress you
In my dreams dear
You are here beside me in my bedroom
All night dear
Hold each other like I never left you
I can’t tell you
How hard it has been since I left you
You’re my sweet thing
The only thing I want is to caress you
In my dreams dear
You are here beside me in my bedroom
All night dear
Hold each other like I never left you
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free
Your love will set you free...2Embed
