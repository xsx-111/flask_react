Second Chance (Cyril Hahn Edit) LyricsI really wanna show you now
Nothing you could say I don't already know
That I don't get that second chance baby
Yeah you know I'll just keep on waiting
I don't have to make up my mind
At the way you talk to me
Just tell me if you want my love
Cause oh you know that I keep on waiting
Just be careful what you do to me
Oh oh
Just be careful what you do
Oh oh
Please tell me there's a second chance baby
If you really really want it
Boy you let me know
If it's cold you know I'm waiting for the moment
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you really want it
Cause boy you know I do
Tell me now cause I'm just waiting for the moment
Tell me if you want
You know you make my love come down
Just in how you talk to me
And I could wait forever here for ya
Yeah you know I'll just keep on waiting
Cause I don't have to make up my mind
Not if you could still believe
That I'm the one who'll be around
I can see that we both are changing
Just be careful what you do to me
Just be careful what you do
Please tell me there's a second chance baby
My love's for ya
Boy you know that it's all for real
My love's for ya
You know that it's all for real
Don't you know that it's for real
If you really really want it
Boy you let me know
If it's cold you know I'm waiting for the moment
Tell me if you want
Tell me if you really want it
Cause boy you know I do
Let me know cause I'm just waiting for the moment
Tell me if you wantEmbed
