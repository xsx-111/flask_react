Silver Lyrics
I can make things silver
Give me a little bit of sympathy

Every time I leave you girl
He's the one that's near you girl, oh, I
Even as I drive away
I can hear the words he'll say, oh, I

I guess I don't need her
It doesn't mean I can't get over her
Where you gonna go without me tonight?
Don't you know what that means to me?

I can make things silver
Give me a little bit of sympathy

I can make things silver

You were in my dream again
And I could see you kissing him, oh, girl
Why'd you have to change your mind
Just as I was changing mine? Oh, girl
I wish I'd never met you
It doesn't mean I can't get over you
What you gonna do without me tonight?
Don't you know what you did to me?8Embed
