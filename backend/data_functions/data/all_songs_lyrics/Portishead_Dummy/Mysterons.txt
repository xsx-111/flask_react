Mysterons Lyrics
Portishead
Portishead
Portishead

Inside, you're pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere
Where they can forget

Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean
Will not be grasped

All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares
Who dares to condemn?
All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want6Embed
