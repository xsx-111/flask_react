Strangers Lyrics
Ooh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you?

Ooh
Just set aside your fears of life
With the sole desire

Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side
Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side

Done it warning, done it now
And it ain't real
Done it warning, done it now
'Cause this ain't real on this side

Ooh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you?6Embed
