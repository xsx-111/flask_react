Biscuit Lyrics
I'm lost, exposed
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt a long time ago
I can't make myself heard

No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

Full fed, yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Haunted, I tell myself, yet I still wander
Down inside

It's tearing me apart, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)

At last, relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson tastes divine
I can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)2Embed
