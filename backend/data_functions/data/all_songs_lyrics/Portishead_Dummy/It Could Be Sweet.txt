It Could Be Sweet Lyrics
I don't want to hurt you
For no reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear

I'm sorry to remind
But I'm scared of what we're creating
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
Like a long forgotten dream

And we don't need them
To cast the fate we have
Love don't always shine through

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet

But the thoughts we try to deny
Take a toll upon our lives
We struggle on in depths of pride
Tangled up in single minds

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet3Embed
