Pedestal Lyrics
How can I believe this miracle
Where the wind blows dry?
Through the force of a man
Undenied by his eye?

Oh, you abandoned me, how I suffer
Ridicule breathes a sigh
You abandoned me, lost forever
Hush, can you hear

Enter and rejoice this pedestal
Where the rainbows hide
Your destiny
Mystery of all time

Oh, no time, make, or reason
Ridicule breathes a sigh
No time, make, or reason
Hush, hear him cry

No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason1Embed
