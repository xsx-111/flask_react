God, Drugs, & Sex LyricsVerse 1:
A grand blank look on your face
When you learned it was over
Do you ever question why?
What could have been different?
We were so comfortable
Living in each others skin
I was dying from within
Chorus:
Cause God, drugs, and sex don't mean a thing
To you now, do they now baby?
I don’t mean anything
By it now, do I now sweetheart?
You should have thought about then for now
God drugs and sex don’t mean a thing
To you now, do they now baby?
You should have thought about then for now
But I’ve gotta leave
I’ve gotta leave
Verse 2:
Tell me where did you learn to love?
(Maybe you don’t want to know)
Tell me when did your hands grow cold?
(It might tell you something)
If you could go back to yesterday
Would you change it all for me?
If you thought we could be together
Would you believe that
Chorus:
God, drugs, and sex don’t mean a thing
To you now, do they now baby?
I don’t mean anything
By it now, do I now sweetheart?
You should have thought about then for now
God, drugs and sex don’t mean a thing
To you now, do they now baby?
You should have thought about then for now
But I’ve gotta leave
I’ve gotta leave
Bridge:
Did you not hear me coming around, around?
Did you not see me coming along the way?
Were there brighter lights  leading you astray
Were there brighter lights to guide you away from your love
I don’t mean anything
(Did you not hear me coming around alone?
Did you not see me coming along the way?
Where the bright lime lights are leading you astray
Where the bright lime lights to grant you a way from your love)
Would you change it all for me?
Outro:
Let go, let go of me
I’m not here
Let go, let go of me now
Cause I'm already goneEmbed
