Self-Starter LyricsLast night rolled over beside my bed
That sort of madness could leave one dead
Our eyes deceive we were on fire
Mistook for love and love desire
I still can’t feel nothing
Just want to hold something
Tell me again what’s real?
Tell me again what to feel?
I still can’t feel nothing
Just want to hold something
Tell me again what’s real
Tell me again what to feel
Why do you stay until you see blood?
Why does the weight fall upon us?
We’re on the same side in the same war
Why stay til you see blood?
Where are we that we digress
Long for love but then undress
Our hands, no bounds, our hearts detached
We grasp for all that will not last
I still can’t feel nothing
Just want to hold something
Tell me again what’s real?
Tell me again what to feel?
I still can’t feel nothing
Just want to hold something
Tell me again what’s real
Tell me again what to feel
Why do you stay until you see blood?
Why does the weight fall upon us?
We’re on the same side in the same war
Why stay til you see blood?
Fall
Falter on my chest
Feel
Failure to progress
Why do you stay until you see blood?
Why does the weight fall upon us?
We’re on the same side in the same war
Why stay til you see blood?
I still can’t feel nothing
Just want to hold or something
Tell me again what’s real? (We’re on the same side in the same war)
Tell me again what to feel?
I still can’t feel nothing (We’re on the same side in the same war)
Just wanna hold something (Why stay til you see blood?)
Tell me again what’s real
Tell me again what to feelEmbed
