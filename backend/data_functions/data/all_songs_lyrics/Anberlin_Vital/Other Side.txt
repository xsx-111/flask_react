Other Side Lyrics
Solitary views of the other side of a plane we’ve yet to know
Will we ever get the chance to walk alone
In this life or when we find out that we’re home
What will we hear there

Love me, love me
Why don’t you know me, know me
Hold me, hold me
And trust me, trust me

Inhabitations through
I can finally forget a past you say you never knew
I reach my hands to the sky

Love me, love me
Why don’t you know me, know me
Hold me, hold me
And trust me, trust me
Love me, love me
Why don’t you know me, know me
Hold me, hold me
And trust me, trust me
There’s a time and place
An unknown region of space
I can meet you all there
Throw your arms in the air
Hands towards the sky
And you’ll hear
Hands towards the sky
And you’ll hear

Love me, love me
Why don’t you know me, know me
Hold me, hold me
And trust me, trust me
Love me, love me
Why don’t you know me, know me
Hold me, hold me
And trust me, trust meEmbed
