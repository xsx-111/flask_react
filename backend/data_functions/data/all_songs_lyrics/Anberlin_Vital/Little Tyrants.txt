Little Tyrants LyricsSoft spoken straight forward
Tell me all the ways in which you feel
So broken lying helpless
Can you even tell me what's for real?
Great divide, great divine
Great divide, great divine
Am I alive?
Someone tell me
Am I alive?
You are the king of an island of one
Alone in a world that lost its only black sun
You are the king of an island of one
A tyrant soon to come undone
All hail the king
No motives just cover
Justify the things that come to mind
All pictures no color
All the wrong that you think youâ€™ve made right
Dead inside, yours is mine
Dead inside
Are you alive?
Someone help me
Are you alive?
You are the king of an island of one
Alone in a world that lost its only black sun
You are the king of an island of one
A tyrant soon to come undone
All hail the king
Dead inside, yours is mine
Dead inside
You are the king of an island of one
Alone in a world that lost its only black sun
You are the king of an island of one
A tyrant soon to come undone
All hail the kingEmbed
