Desires Lyrics
Now who are you to be the death of me
Stealing what life you need
Roadside while you watch me bleed
I've got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here

Well where do you get off that we revolve around your wants and needs
There's no way I would change a one time catastrophe
You are the only one in this room that is still the same
You're still the one night catastrophe

A liar, a liar, that’s what you made of me
A wire, a wire, that’s what were walking on
Desires, desires, it's all dressed down
Heavy lies the crown, heavy lies the crown

Thought you were the one I figured out
With no creeping doubts, no hiding ins or outs
But I was so wrong, I was so wrong
The knife that’s resting in my back is proof enough for me
That you’re a one time catastrophe
A liar, a liar, that’s what you made of me
A wire, a wire, that’s what were walking on
Desires, desires, it's all dressed down
Heavy lies the crown, heavy lies the crown
A liar, a liar, that’s what you made of me
A wire, a wire, that’s what were walking on
Desires, desires, it's all dressed down
Heavy lies the crown, heavy lies the crown
A liar, a liar, that’s what you made of me
A wire, a wire, that’s what were walking on
Desires, desires, it's all dressed down
Heavy lies the crown, heavy lies the crownEmbed
