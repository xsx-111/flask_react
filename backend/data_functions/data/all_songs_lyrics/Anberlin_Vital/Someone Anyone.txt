Someone Anyone Lyrics
Thought we were past this
Thought we moved on
But I guess I was wrong
Do we not learn from mistakes?
Do we not have what it takes?

Are you the cure or disease?
Do you still take as you please?
Are you the cure?
Or are you the disease?

Someone, someone tell me what we’re fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive
Someone, someone, tell me why we need this?
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive

Forward we find, yesterday’s gone
And I hope that I’m wrong
If we don’t learn from their past
We’ll repeat their history oh at last
Are you with us or without?
Scene is set but fading out
Are you with us
Well are you with us?

Someone, someone tell me what we’re fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive
Someone, someone, tell me why we need this?
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive

Are you the cure or disease?
Do you still take as you please?
Are you the cure?
Or are you the disease?

Someone, someone tell me what we’re fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away truly alive, truly alive

Someone, someone tell me what we’re fighting for
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive
Someone, someone tell me why we need this?
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war
I don’t see a reason, tell me why we need a reasonEmbed
