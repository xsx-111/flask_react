Innocent Lyrics
Laying you down one last time
On machines that will never give
A touch that woke you gently
I'll never know if you saw me
Did your eyes ever meet mine
We see what we want to see sometime
I believe now, yes I believe

We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
You will live on in the hearts of men
Constantly
We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
I will hold on until the end
There will never be an end

There are few words that are left to say
That have not already been said
Your shadows they will follow me
Long after I have confessed
Do your lips feel this kiss
Do your hands feel this touch
I miss you here
I miss you so much
We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
You will live on in the hearts of men
Constantly
We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
I will hold on until the end
There will never be an end


We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
You will live on in the hearts of men
Constantly
We are all born the innocent
We were born to run carefree
I will hold on until the end
There will never be an end1Embed
