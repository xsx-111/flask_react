Intentions LyricsThey say my vice should be vanity
But I'll stay calm in industry
I'll motivate you till you think I'm right
I'll leave exactly where we started tonight
Where we started tonight
My ambition is all that I have
There’s a tension when you want it so bad
We will move on, we will move on
We will move on, we will move
I want a love that I don’t deserve
I want the gold that I didn’t earn
I want a fire that will never burn
I want you there, I want you here tonight
(I want you there, I want you here tonight)
My ambition is all that I have
There’s a tension when you want it so bad
We will move on, we will move on
We will move on, we will move on
Your attention to the matters at hand
Your intentions are yet to be had
We will find you, we will find you
We will find you, we will find...
My ambition is all that I have
There’s a tension when you want it so bad
We will move on, we will move on
We will move on, we will move on
Your attention to the matters at hand
Your intentions are yet to be had
We will find you, we will find you
We will find you, we will find...
We will move on, we will move youEmbed
