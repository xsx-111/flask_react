Modern Age LyricsWhy so afraid to fall?
That was then this is now
Horizons look different in a modern age
Are we all lost, are we all lost again?
Fall asleep alone
Safer than the off chance of getting
Your heart attacked one more time
Will you ever come
Will you ever come alive again?
Don’t we all want to belong?
Don’t we all write our own song?
Let our silence break tonight
Don’t we all learn right from wrong?
And don’t we all want to be loved
Let our silence break tonight
Come now elusive sign
Open up their eyes to see
So many of us are just the same as you
Have we all hid ourselves from friends?
So much else to give this is her and that is him
Close your eyes imagine them holding you
Will you ever find the words again?
Sing it
There is so much less that we have to lose here
The more we give away
Futures will never keep their promises
If all we hold is yesterdayEmbed
