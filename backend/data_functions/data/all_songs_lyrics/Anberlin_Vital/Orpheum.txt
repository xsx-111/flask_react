Orpheum LyricsThought I knew will and self
Thought I could tame the rest of me
Then you waltzed onto the floor
Danced to your own beat
Am I losing control?
Make me want this here so much more
It's in the way you move
Am I moving your soul?
You are the breath I hold
To every risk that I want to take
The way you spin around
Deadened every other sound
Am I losing control?
You make me want this here so much more
It's in the way you move
Am I moving your soul?
I want out of control
Make me want you here so much more
It's in the way you move
Am I losing my soul?
I want out, I want out of control
Want it all mind body and soul
Here and now more than youâ€™ll ever know
Am I losing control?
Make me want this here so much more
Am I losing my soul?
Am I losing control?
Make me want this here so much more
It's in the way you move
Am I moving your soul?
I want out of control
Make me want this here so much more
It's in the way you move
Am I losing my soul?Embed
