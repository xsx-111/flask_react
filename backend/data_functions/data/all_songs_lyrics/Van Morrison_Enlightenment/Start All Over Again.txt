Start All Over Again Lyrics
The way you see me walking on
That's why I'm telling you in song
There's only one way to get ahead
You've got to give it up instead
Start all over again

You see me standing on the bridge
I see the sunset in my view
The field looks colorful to me
I know there's more than I can see
We can start all over again

Made it, made it, made it
Made it through the wintertime
Made it through the spring
Made it through the summer
And the fall

That's why I'm giving you the time
You always wanted your own mind
The way is up to you and me
And there's horizons yet to see
When we start all over againEmbed
