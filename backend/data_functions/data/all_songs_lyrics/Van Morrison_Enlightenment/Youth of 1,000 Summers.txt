Youth of 1,000 Summers Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, watch it

He's the youth of a thousand summers
He's the youth of a thousand summers
Like a sweet bird of youth
Like a sweet bird of youth
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul

And he looks so radiant
And he shines like the sun
And he looks so radiant
And he lights up the world

He's the youth of a thousand summers
He's the youth of a thousand summers
Like a sweet bird of youth
Like a sweet bird of youth
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul
Yeah in my soul, in my soul, in my soul

Yeah, love it, yeah, love it
Yeah, alright
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul
He's the king of the mountain
And the clear crystal fountain
He's the saint of the river
He's the ancient of days

He's the youth of a thousand summers
He's the youth of a thousand summers
Like a sweet bird of youth
Like a sweet bird of youth
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul
Yeah in my soul, in my soul, in my soul

And he makes you go skipping
And he makes you go dancing
And he gets you in rhythm
And he moves you in song

He's the youth of a thousand summers
He's the youth of a thousand summers
Like a sweet bird of youth
Like a sweet bird of youth
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul
Yeah in my soul, in my soul, in my soul
Oh in my soul, in my soul, in my soul
And a sweet bird of youth
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
Shh
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
In my soul
It makes me, yeah
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul, in my soul, in my soul
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
In my soul, in my soul, shh
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
In my soul
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
Shh
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)
Yeah, love it
(in my soul, in my soul, in my soul)Embed
