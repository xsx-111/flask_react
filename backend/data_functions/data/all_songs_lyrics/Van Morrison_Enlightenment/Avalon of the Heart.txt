Avalon of the Heart Lyrics
On down by Avalon
Avalon of the heart
On down by Avalon
Gonna make a brand new start

Oh the holy grail
Baby behind the sun
Oh the holy grail
Down by Avalon

Well I came upon the enchanted vale
Down by the viaducts of my dreams
Down by Camelot hangs the tale
In the ancient vale

Oh the Avalon sunset
Avalon of the heart
I met my lady
Goin' down by Avalon

Well I came upon the enchanted vale
Down by the viaducts of my dreams
Oh, near Camelot hangs the tale
Of the enchanted vale
In the upper room
Ah there the cup does stand
In the upper room
Down by Avalon

Goin' down by Avalon
Oh my Avalon of the heart
Goin' down by Avalon
Gonna make a brand new start
(Okay, go)

Oh down by Avalon
Oh baby behind the sun
On down by Avalon
Well the journey's just begun

Goin' down by Avalon
Sweet Avalon of the heart
Goin' down by Avalon
Gonna make a brand new start1Embed
