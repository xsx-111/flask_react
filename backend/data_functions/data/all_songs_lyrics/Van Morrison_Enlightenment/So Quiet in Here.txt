So Quiet in Here Lyrics
Foghorns blowing in the night
Salt sea air in the morning breeze
Driving cars all along the coastline
This must be what it's all about
Oh this must be what it's all about
This must be what paradise is like

So quiet in here, so peaceful in here
So quiet in here, so peaceful in here

Warm look of radiance on your face
And your heart beating close to mine
And the evening fading in the candle glow
This must be what it's all about
Oh this must be what it's all about
This must be what paradise is like

So quiet in here. so peaceful in here
So quiet in here, yeah, so peaceful in here

All my struggling in the world
And so many dreams that don't come true
Step back, put it all away
It don't matter, it don't matter anymore
Oh this must be what paradise is like
This must be what paradise is like
It's so quiet in here, it's so peaceful in here
It's so quiet in here, it's so peaceful in here

A glass of wine with some friends
Talking into the wee hours of the dawn
Sit back and relax your mind
This must be, this must be what it's all about
This must be what paradise is like
Oh this must be what paradise is like, yeah

It's so quiet in here, it's so peaceful in here
So quiet in here, so peaceful in here

Big ships out in the night
And we're floating across the waves
Sailing for some other shore
Where we can be what we wanna be
Oh this must be what paradise is like, yeah
This must be what paradise is like

Baby it's so quiet in here, so peaceful in here
So quiet in here, peaceful in here
So quiet in here, so peaceful in here
So quiet in here
It's so quiet in here, so peaceful in here
So quiet in here, so quiet in here
So quiet, it's so quiet in here
It's so peaceful, so peaceful in here
Shh, so quiet
Ah, it's so quiet
You can hear, you can hear it's so quiet
It's so quietEmbed
