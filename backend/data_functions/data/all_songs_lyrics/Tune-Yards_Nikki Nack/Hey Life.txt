Hey Life LyricsHey life, I am still here
Hey life, I am still here
Hey life, I am calling your name
But all I hear is an echo
Unless your voice and mine sound the same
But hey life, I love you so much I scream and shout
But I'm one foot in, one foot out
Just kinda like running on a roundabout, you know
Now I don't wanna run out
But I'm runnin' runnin'
I don't know where to go
But I can't seem to go slowly, no
I don't wanna run out
So I'm runnin' runnin'
Hey hey hey hey life
Why do you keep me around?
I can never seem to focus on the task at hand
Ten times a day, I don't seem to understand
I've spent twelve thousand, nine hundred and forty four days alive
Amazing how a human being can still thrive
But I know my days are numbered
I should enjoy the climb
I like to smell the roses but I'm runnin' runnin
All of the time
I don't wanna run out
But I'm runnin' runnin'
I don't know where to go
But I can't seem to go slowly, no
I don't wanna run out
So I'm runnin' runnin'
Hey hey hey hey life
Why do you keep me around?
I don't wanna run out
But I'm runnin' runnin'
I don't know where to go
But I can't seem to go slowly, oh
I don't wanna run out
So I'm runnin' runnin'
Hey hey hey hey life
Why do you keep me around?
I woke up feeling albatrossy
Flossing my teeth
I look fine on the surface
But I'm worried about what's underneath
I woke up with a heartbeat
Like a panic attack
Yackity yackity yackity yackity yack
I can't tell my brain to not talk back
But hey life
Won't you push me around
Like a baby in a carriage
'Till you pull me underground
Like a kid who is lost
Waiting to be found
One two three o'clock
Four o'clock
Walk and walk
And talk and talk
And walk and talk
And then five six seven
Seven seven
Heaven heaven
Take me again

I don't wanna run out
But I'm runnin' runnin'
I don't know where to go
But I can't seem to go slowly, oh
I don't wanna run out
So I'm runnin' runnin'
Hey hey hey hey life
Why do you keep me around?Embed
