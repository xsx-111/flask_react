Time of Dark LyricsI know you're carrying me under a blanket of gold!
I feel you carrying me under a blanket of gold!
Living in the time of dark
And I don't dare to look very far
The map
She's just a whisper
Step too loud, the sound of the ground
Will just eclipse her
I leave all my doubts behind
(See through me)
I'll give up my sight
I'll clear it out so I can see the signs
My steps are small
(See through me)
Walking blind
Screaming to the clouds
Hoping I don't choke on all the truth that they bring

See me over the mountain
I know you're carrying me under a blanket of gold
See me over the mountain, yeah
I know you're carrying me under a blanket of gold
If you see me to the top this time
There'll never be a mountain that I cannot climb
See me over the mountain
I know you're carrying me under a blanket of gold
See right through me to the sky
Down is up and up is down
I crumble climbing high
I've met you twice before
When you put the breath in my lungs when my own kin had me gagged
When you taught me to breathe underwater
When I had myself drowned
So don't cry
It's nothing
(See through me)
Even in silence
There are voices who will sing
(See through me)
But oh little child
Understand a single thing
Your music's in your pocket
With the power you can't even imagine it would bring

See me over the mountain
I know you're carrying me under a blanket of gold
Won't you see me over this mountain
I feel you carrying me under a blanket of gold
If you see me to the top this time
There'll never be a mountain I'm not willing to climb
See me over the mountain
I know you're carrying me under a blanket of gold
Hey hey hey, hey-o
(Hey hey hey, hey-o...)
See through me
See me over this mountain, yeah
Living in the time of dark
And I don't dare to look very farEmbed
