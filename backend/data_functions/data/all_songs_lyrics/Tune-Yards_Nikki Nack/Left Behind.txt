Left Behind LyricsMy mind
This place has really changed its ways
Luckily there's only really rich folk living here
Remember what you used to do to me?
Remember the way it used to be?
Cruisin' in the block
Burnin' like it was all meant to be
Burnin' all the rubber in the fucking land of the free
Nikki Nikki Nack
She told me "never bend back"
That Nikki Nikki Nack
Turn her around and spit on her back
We said we wouldn't let 'em take our soil
We said we wouldn't let 'em take our soil
These days don't it just make your blood boil
We said we'd never let 'em take our soil
Been
Left behind
Been, been been
My my
On my mind
This place has really changed its ways
And it's been ruined by the boats of rich folks coming here
Remember what he used to do to me?
Remember the way it used to be?
Micky D milkshake and a cigarette
Every Sunday a little bit of lightning
Good ol' Michael Mack
He said we'd better fight back
Checkered suit and tie to match
Then turned around and shot him in his back
We said we wouldn't let 'em take our soil
We said we wouldn't let 'em take our soil
With a swipe and a poke the land that we toiled
We said we'd wouldn't let 'em take our soil
Been
Left behind
Been, been been
My my
On my mind
Been
Left behind
Been, been been
Holiday, holiday
Let's go crazy

Now I'll never know
What's going on
Been
Left behind
Been, been been
Holiday, holiday
Let's go crazy

Let's go cra-3Embed
