Sink-O LyricsPeace
Peace and love
Love is waiting
For the feeling of discomfort to pass before killing

We argue round then
Unrolls the ground and
The Earth curls up and
The mulch slaps down
Oh the white face brown
World upside-down
World upside-down
Ring-a-ding a dinner bell loud
Sink-O! The Earth will swallow you up
Sink-O! The Earth will swallow you up
It literally ate him up
It literally ate him up
Hmm, it wants your first born kid
Hmm, it's time you ran and hid
Hmm, it will eat you up
It literally ate him up
Peace, peace and love
Love is waiting
For the feeling of discomfort to pass before killing
You'll be ok, you'll be ok
Turn into the sun when the sky goes grey
Turn into an egg when the sky goes salt and pepper
Say nothing and you let her (this time won't last forever)
Sink-O! The Earth will swallow you up
Sink-O! The Earth will swallow you up
It literally ate him up
It literally ate him up
It literally ate him up
It literally ate him up
Sink-O! The Earth will swallow you up
Sink-O! The Earth will swallow you up
I'm holed with popcorn
Holed up with Pop Tarts
VHS The Voice can't wait 'til it starts
Tweedle-deedle oh diddy oh didee-ay
Cannot fall asleep but cannot face the day
If I went up to your door
You wouldn't let me in
So don't say you don't judge by the color of skin

Peace
Love is waiting
Peace
Peace and love
Love is waiting
Peace, peace and love
Love is waiting
For the feeling of discomfort to pass before killing

There was one part on there where I didn't unmute the claps...Embed
