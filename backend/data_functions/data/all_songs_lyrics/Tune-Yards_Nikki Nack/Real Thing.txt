Real Thing Lyrics
Givin' up what you've got
What you are, you're simply not
Aren't you tired of this game?
And all the emptiness of your fame
You can't hold tight to what you have
Cause there is nothing there to grab
Now life is a shadow of the thought
You never did have what you thought you got

I'm no real thing
They say I'm the real thing
(Oh no)
I sound like the real thing
(Oh no)
Sing it real loud like the real thing
Makin' 'em proud like the real thing
(Lalala)
I come from the land of slaves
(Lalala)
Let's go Redskins
Let's go Braves
(Lalala)
You want the truth in tomes
Dig this dirt and sift out the bones
They said I'm the real thing
(Oh no)
I sound like the real thing
(Oh no)
Joke's on you
All askew
Heard my name in Timbuktu
(Lalala)
Now I got it
All mangled
(Lalala)
Cut it out it's all tangled
Star spangled
Givin' up what you've got
And what you are, you're simply not
Aren't you tired of this game?
And all the emptiness of your fame
You can't hold tight to what you have
Cause there is nothing there to grab
Now life is a shadow of the thought
You never did have what you thought you got

Oh, I'm no real thing
Water ain't water if water is wet
(Oh no)
Don't ever pay me
I look good in debt
(Oh no)
Red, white, blue course through my veins
Binge 'n purge the USA
Why are you afraid about pants size ten?
Humadum, rumadum
They're chosen girls
While you worry about dress size 6
They're winning the tricks
Those tricks, those tricks, oh
Just what is the real thing?
(Oh no)
Don't call me the real thing
(Oh no)
The search for the real thing
(Oh no)
The curse of the real thing
Lalala
I come from the land of shame
Blood and guts are all I claim, singing

Givin' up what you've got
Aren't you tired of this game?
You can't hold tight to what you've got
You never did have what you thought you got

Oh my god I use my lungs
(Bless my lungs, bless my lungs)
Soft and loud, anyway feels good
(Bless my lungs, bless my lungs)
Oh my heat up in my bones
(Bless my lungs, bless my lungs)
Perched atop my drumming flam
(Bless my lungs, bless my lungs)
Ate food that fed me
(Bless my lungs)
Seed planted itself in my stomach and bled me
Read some words that led me
Knee ache, skin leathery
Put up a fight and you're my pride
Swell, my fist right through a tube
Glory, glory it's good to be me
Ugly one be you, who you are
Ugly one be you, who you are
Ugly but pretty overrated
It's complicated
I'm a real thing
Real thing (real thing)
Real thing (real thing)
Real thing (real thing)
Real thing (real thing)
Real thing (real thing)
Real thing (real thing)
Real thing (real thing)
Real thing (real thing)1Embed
