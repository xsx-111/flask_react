Wait For A Minute LyricsWait for a minute
Monday I wake up with disgust in my head
Could not forgive myself another moment spent in the bed
Monday the mirror always disappoints
I pinch my skin until I see the joints
Today I'm feeling like I live on the ledge
Any moment I just know I'm gonna fall off the edge
They say, "hang on"
I promised them I will but I don't know for how long
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait
Why do I spend the soul of my day
Looking for any way to waste away?
The pain is in the empty time
Just twiddling my thumbs and hoping for the words to rise
Today I couldn't stand to be all alone
And sick of hearing my voice on the telephone
A thousand roads to injury
Most of them so smooth
It doesn't feel they are hurting me
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Oh, I'll still try to leave the high of violence behind
I'll wait for relief but the illness is my mind
Why should I wait?
I'm already too late
Why should I wait?
Not knowing what the future will bring
Is always wrecking my day
I guess I'll drown my fear and seal my fate
A haze of cravings
Easier to do it then it is to try sit here and wait
Easier to do it then it is to try sit here and wait
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Easier to do it then it is to just sit here and wait!1Embed
