Look Around LyricsThere will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
There will be
Always something you can rely on
I will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
I will be
Always something you can rely on
There will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
There will be
Always something you can rely on
I will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
I will be
Always something you can rely on
Never thought I'd call you baby
But look around, look around, look around
We are the dreams that we were made of
Our friends have died
Waging war against their rulers
Come here, don't cry
We won't let anybody fool us
There will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
There will be
Always something you can rely on
I will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
I will be
Always something you can rely on
You wouldn't believe what I saw in the city tonight
The most brilliantly rhyming terrors
I come home, zipped up so tight
Bear my metal teeth to you
The power went out, so I started hoarding water
How do you open your arms so wide?
Never turn my fear in fire
Cause I never knew
Oh, I never knew
(Never knew, never knew)
(Never knew, I never knew)
On the one hand, there's what sounds good
On the other hand, there's what's true
Beware the empty promise
All around me, all around you
Let's not pretend
That the world around us isn't falling
But look around, look around, look around
All we need is all that we can see
(There will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
There will be
Always something you can rely on
I will be
Always something you can lean your weight into
I will be
Always something you can rely on)
(Never knew, never knew)Embed
