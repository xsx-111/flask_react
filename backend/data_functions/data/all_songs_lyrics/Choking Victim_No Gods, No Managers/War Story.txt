War Story Lyrics
You thought Uncle Sam wanted you
But you were used, you were just abused
I tried to tell you time and time again
The only war worth winning is the war that's within

You played right into Uncle Sam's hands
Where is the glory in complying with demands?
You were used to defend world domination
Where is the honor in being an abomination?

I don't see the glory
In your war stories
It was just your turn
To burn and get burned

You thought that you had something to prove
But yer just seeing colors, not red & white just blue
Your whole life has always been the same
First you were tamed, then you were ashamed
