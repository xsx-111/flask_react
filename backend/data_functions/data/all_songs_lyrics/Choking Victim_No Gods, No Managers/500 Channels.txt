500 Channels Lyrics
500 Channels
500 channels of a day-dream stimulation
Helps me to resent my life and raise my expectations
Locked into re-runs, your memories repeating
And all your ideals seem so self defeating
For you and yours, the pepsi generation
And when you're discontent, you change the T.V. station
And when you hate your life, no qualities redeeming
A million brainwashed zombies will always be heard screaming...

And when there is no hope
"I'll smoke some crack, I'll shoot some dope!"
When there's no enemies
"I sit and stare at my T.V
And in my ignorance
I'll be a slave and sycophant!"

And in a perfect world devoid of all temptations
The good leftover crizack could unite the nations
But now the war machines are mapping our destructions
With poisons over flowing in the chemical seductions

And when there is no hope
"I'll smoke some crack, I'll shoot some dope!"
When there's no enemies
"I'll sit and stare at my T.V
And in my ignorance
I'll be a slave and sycophant!"
With my credit and my bank
My mind will draw a blank
I'll block out history
And stare at my T.V
For me there is no way
500 channels waste my life away, away...3Embed
