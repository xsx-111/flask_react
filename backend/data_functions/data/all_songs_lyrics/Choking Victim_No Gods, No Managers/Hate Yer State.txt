Hate Yer State Lyrics
You think you're alive motherfucker
You're just the walking fucking dead
You're fucking sheep, stepping on my back to stay alive
West coast, east coast, you're all bunch of fucking fools
You and the rest of this greedy fucking world
Kill yourself, stay in school, say no to drugs and oh yeah
Hail Satan
Goodnight boys and girls.. pleasant dreams

The public is shocked by the peoples opinions
They crush yer dreams and foreclose yer dominions
You always stand there a reader digesting
You never bother to ask any questions
Hate your state!

Now I know my rights, get out of my way
I won't fall for the lies that you say
You want me to kneel down, you want me to pray
Now you're laughing cut it's me that will pay
Hate your state!
The people, stupid and happy and set in their ways
Content as their lives grow sick and decay
The readers all stand there, digesting the system
You don't have to be choking to become a victim!
Hate your state!
Hate your state, hate your state
Hate your state, state, state, state, state, state, state, state!Embed
