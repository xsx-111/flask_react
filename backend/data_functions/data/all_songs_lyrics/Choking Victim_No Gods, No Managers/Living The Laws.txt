Living The Laws LyricsLies equal destruction
Greed and your eviction
Yer living the laws (x6)
Blind exploitation
Sublime elimination
Beside myself, I'm all alone... the lights are on but no ones home
Your history, laws and policies, y'know they never meant that much to me
I know it isn't much, I know its all we had... and now it's all spoiled and bad
In everyday theres hell to pay
And all I see is wasting away
Facade is sick beneath
Crass smile with rotted teeth
Living the laws
Living the laws
Living the lice
Living the laws
Beside myself, I'm all alone... the lights are on but no ones home
Your history, laws and policies, y'know they never meant that much to me
I know it isn't much, I know its all we had... and now it's all spoiled and bad
In everyday theres hell to pay
And all I see is wasting away
Now you have nothing
Now you're worth nothing
(yer) living the laws
Living the laws
Living the lies
Living the lawsEmbed
