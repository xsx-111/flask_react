Money Lyrics
The function of that police action—those interventions in Central America and the Middle East—the function is system sustaining
It is to maintain that overall system!
And you don't look at the particular cost!
I could demonstrate to you that every single bank robbery, that in every single case practically, the cost of the police was more than the actual money that the robbers took from the bank
Does that mean, "Oh you see, there's really no economic interest involved then
They're not protecting the banks, the police are just doing this cause they're on a, a power trip or they're macho, or they're control freaks, that's why they do it."
No, of course it's an economic—of course they're defending the banks—of course, because if they didn't stop that bank robbery, regardless of the cost, this could jeopardize the entire banking system
You see, there are people who believe that the function of the police is to fight crime, and that's not true
The function of the police is social control and protection of property

I am sick and tired and my money's always spent
Although their jobs be killing me their money pays my rent
The fuel of world hate, although it's just a seed
But when it grows and flowers it becomes the world's greed

Money for the rich, money for the fed
God supplies the money, and God supplies the dead
When you're dead and ready, "exploited" be thy name
After you have money things are never quite the same

I don't care for money, and money's not for me
Their money fueled this empire and our racist history
Although I'm forced to use it, the rules have all been set
But life is not worth living when your soul's in debt
Money for the rich, money for the fed
God supplies the money, and God supplies the dead
When you're dead and ready, "exploited" be thy name
After you have money things are never quite the same
Never quite the same!

Money kills!
Money rapes!
Money lies!
Money hates!Embed
