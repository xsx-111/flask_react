Fuck America Lyrics
I don't like to use the word "U.S. interests," that's why I wish some other critics - friends of ours - would stop saying "We go into this country, we go into that country; we do this and we do that." And I'm going "Shh! Shh! We don't do anything, they do it to us. We are part of the victims, we are not part of the victimizers."

Greed from deep inside
Fuels this government of lies
They never tell you
While they buy and sell you
All they can to make more money

T.V. tries to sell me stuff that I don't really need
The government's hypocrisy is intertwined with greed
All I need now is another media blitz
About a Jesus down in Waco and the odor he emits

Whoah!
Fuck world trade
Fuck the state

The trade center is bombed and the FBI is pissed
So they act the good Americans, blaming muslim terrorists
People so caught up in this media T.V
So quick to pull the trigger claiming they are guilty

The goal of U.S. global policy is to make the world safe for the fortune 500s. It's to protect the overall global capital system

McDonald's will bloom as the major competition
Between Jesus and the devil for this government's religion
People so caught up in the freedom that they see
While America's fucking over every single country
