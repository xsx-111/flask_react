Suicide (A Better Way) Lyrics
Swillin' on the dragon yesterday
Tompkins Square Park, up by Avenue A
Halfway down the 40 and a pig come up to me
He said "Listen here boy, gotta show me yer ID."
But living in a police state
I tell you man, it ain't that great
I know it doesn't even matter what I say
But don't ya know there's gotta be a better way

I'm all alone, I'm feeling bad
I'm by myself, all I ever had
I hate my life, I'm such a mess
I wanna die, I'm so depressed
And every time I look at you
I know exactly what to do
I didn't want to be born, the pleasure all has died
So now I'm gonna snuff it with a suicide

Suicide
The best!
No better way

Sit in a hot bathtub, razorblade and slit yer wrists
Watch your life fade to black
You have this power to kill yourself called suicide
And no one can take that back
There is no better way to kill yourself than suicide
There is no sweeter death
(Never is a name; the name of never is Death. Uh, the angel of Death.)

A better way
Suicide
A better way
Do it, kill yourself!Embed
