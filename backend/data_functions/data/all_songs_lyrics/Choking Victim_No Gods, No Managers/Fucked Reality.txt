Fucked Reality Lyrics
It feels like Jesus on the cross
It's so religious in it's loss
A graven image in the mud
Like when I shed my precious blood

I am a loser
I am Satan
I am Jesus Christ
I'm me
There are no winnners in this fucked reality
I am a loser
I am Satan
I am Jesus Christ
I'm me
There are no winnners in this fucked reality

Atrophic interludes weave through my life far too often
For me to fight the biggest enemies
I have no feelings, like love or pain, it makes me go insane
When I see what's happening to me, I say

I am a loser
I am Satan
I am Jesus Christ
I'm me
There are no winnners in this fucked reality
I am a loser
I am Satan
I am Jesus Christ
I'm me
There are no winnners in this fucked reality

There are no idols, no heroes in a world of death
It's all a joke and so are you
And so am I, think, just look and see
It's a fucked reality
Fucked reality
Fucked reality
Fucked reality
Fucked realityEmbed
