In My Grave LyricsAll the times that were good or bad
And the thought of a future that I never had
With the promise of heaven, and the threat of a hell...
A reality I did dwell
And I did thrive on apathy
And ignorance taught me the way it should be
All along, all the lies I was fed
Would reassure I'd rather be dead
All will die with their memories
Little lives of misery
Thirst for power = starve for pain
All your money goes down the drain
Like your life in your grave
None of the power or the money is saved
And you will die in your pain
As all of it goes down the drain
Now I'm dead to no dismay
My body reeks, my flesh decays!
All is gone now, the hate and the pain
Reality down the drain
And I will rot in my grave
And I will see that nobody is saved
All is gone now, the hate and the pain
All of it, gone down the drain
In my grave...
No one's saved...
No more pain...
In my graveEmbed
