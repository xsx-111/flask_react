Lose That Long Face Lyrics(Verse)
If, as, and when you've got a long face
Rearrange it
Don't be contented with the wrong face
There's a way to change it
Does the day look painful?
The future glum?
Does the sky look rainful?
Hey there, say there, are you in a vacu-um?
All is stuff and nonsense
You can overcome
A long face gets you nowhere
You will lose that month of May
Like Peter Pan
The sweeter pan
Wins the day
(Chorus)
So lose that long face
That long face
Go long and get that long face lost
The blues black out when they can see
A smile that says, "Move on, no vacancy!"
This panacea idea
I'm handing you without any cost
There isn't any tax on it
So just relax on it
If you want trouble double-crossed
Don't give into a frown
Turn that frown upside-down
And get yourself that long face lost
(instrumental break)
This panacea idea
I'm handing you without any cost
There isn't any tax on it
So just relax on it
If you want trouble double-crossed
Don't give into a frown
Turn that frown upside-down
And go and get yourself that long face
Get that long face
Go, go, go, and get that long face lostEmbed
