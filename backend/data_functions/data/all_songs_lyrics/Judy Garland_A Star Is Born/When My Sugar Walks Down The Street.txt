When My Sugar Walks Down The Street LyricsWhen my sugar walks down the street
All the little birdies go tweet, tweet, tweet
And in the evening when the sun goes down
It's never dark when she's around
She's so affectionate and I'll say this
That when she kisses me I stay kissed
When my sugar walks down the street
The little birdies go
The birdies go
All the little birdies go tweet, tweet
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet!Embed
