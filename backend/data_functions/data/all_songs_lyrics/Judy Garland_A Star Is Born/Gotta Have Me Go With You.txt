Gotta Have Me Go With You Lyrics(Verse)
What a spot, this
Not so hot, this
Hey there, shy one
Come be my one
Please don't rush off
Want no brush-off
I can't compel you
To buy what I sell you
But I'd like to tell you
My song
(Chorus)
You wanna have bells that'll ring
You wanna have songs that'll sing
You want your sky, your baby blue
You gotta have me go with you
(Verse 2)
Hey, you fool, you
Why so cool, you?
When I'm ready
To go steady
(Chorus 2)
You wanna have eyes that'll shine
You wanna have grapes on the vine
You want a love that's truly true
You gotta have me go with you
(Verse 3)
Why the holdout?
Have you sold out?
Time you woke up
Time you spoke up
This line I'm handing you
Is not a handout
As a team, we'd be a standout
(Chorus 3)
You wanna live high all the time
You wanna have two hearts in rhyme
You gotta have me go with you
You gotta have me all the time
(scat break)
You wanna have bells that'll ring
You wanna have songs that'll sing
You want your sky, your baby blue
You gotta have me go with you
Hey, you fool, you
Why so cool, you?
When I'm ready
To go steady
You wanna have eyes that'll shine
You wanna have grapes on the vine
You want a love that's truly true
You gotta have me go with you
Why the holdout?
Have you sold out?
Time you woke up
Time you spoke up
This line I'm handing you
Is not a handout
As a team, we'd be a standout
You wanna live high all the time
You wanna have two hearts in rhyme
You gotta have me go with you
You gotta have me all the timeEmbed
