Someone at Last LyricsLights!
Camera!
Action!
I’m discovered sitting on a rather simple divan
Somewhere there's a someone
Who's the someone for me
Someday there will come one
And my lover he will be
Somehow I shall know him
From the moment he's in view
And he'll know affection
He's never known hitherto
I pay no mind to the waiting
Let the clock tick-tock away
The dream I'm contemplating
Will be here to stay
Oh, somewhere in the sometime
When my humdrum days have passed
With my someone, I'll be someone at last
With my someone, I'll be someone at lastEmbed
