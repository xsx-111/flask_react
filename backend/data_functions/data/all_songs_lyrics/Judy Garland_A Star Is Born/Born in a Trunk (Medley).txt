Born in a Trunk (Medley) Lyrics
(Spoken Intro)
Thank you, thank you very much
I can't express it any other way
For with this awful trembling in my heart
I just can't find another thing to say
I'm happy that you liked the show
I'm grateful you liked me
And I'm sure to you the tributes seemed quite right
(Song)
But if you knew of all the years
Of hopes and dreams and tears
You'd know it didn't happen overnight
Huh, overnight!
I was born in a trunk
In the Princess Theater in Pocatello, Idaho
It was during a matinee on Friday
And they used a makeup towel for my didee
When I first saw the light
It was pink and amber
Coming from the footlights on the stage
When my dad carried me out there to say hello
They tell me that I stopped the show
So I grew up in a crazy world of dressing rooms
And hotel rooms and waiting rooms
And rows behind-the-scenes
And I can't forget the endless rows
Of sleepless nights and heatless nights
And nights without a nickel in my jeans
But it's all in the game and way you play it
And you've gotta play the game you know
When you're born in a trunk at the Princess Theater
In Pocatello, Idaho
At first I just stood and watched from the wings
That's all my mom and dad would allow
But as I got older, I got a little bolder
And snuck out for their second bow
They kept me in the act because they needed me
To milk applause
Until one night, they did a crazy thing
They left me out there all alone
Mama said "you're on your own!"
And Papa shouted "this is it, kid, Sing!'

I'll get by
As long as I have you
Though there be rain and darkness too
I'll not complain, I'll see it through
I learned very quickly the tricks of the trade
I practiced after everyone was gone
And with the tricks, I learned traditions
And the hardest one of all, is no matter what
The show must go on!
As time went by, I looked for jobs
And was kicked from pillar to post
I haunted all the agents' offices
And I almost ended up a ghost!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of tryin' not to fall
I have no will, you made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me
(AGENT)
No!
(ESTHER)
I'm just like an apple on the bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So what's the use, you cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me
(AGENT)
No!
(ESTHER)
I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear
Suffer something awful each time you go
But it's much worse when you're near
Here am I with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors, call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me
(AGENT)
Yes!
(ESTHER)
No!
So I got into a tab show
All I did was kick my feet
You'd hardly call it a chance to sing
But at least it was a chance to eat!

They call it black bottom
A new swisher
A sure galloon
An old sister
They clap their hands and do a raggedy trot
Hot!
And young fellows with flamenco
And young fellows the way they go
They jump right in and give it all that they've got
(Spoken)
Then one night something happened
Dame fortune showed her face
The star got sick and I was told to go on in her place
But she recovered
Oh, well!
(Song)
Black bottom, a new rhythm
When you spot 'em, you go with 'em
And do that black, black, black, black bottom
You won’t be blue when you have got ‘em
If you do that black, black, black, black bottom all day
But finally I got an offer to sing in New York
And I wired them I'm on my way
I had visions that this would be
A fabulous, famous cafe
Filled with high society
Elegant, and spruce
And I pictured me the epitome
Of a very chic chanteuse

Peanuts!
Through every city, town, and country lane
You hear him sing his
Plaintive little strain
And as he goes by, to you he’ll say
(Male voice speaking):
Sing Melancholy Baby
(ESTHER)
Peanuts!
The little children like to trail along
They like to hear the peanut vendor's song
They all laugh with glee when he will say
(Male and Esther’s voice speaking):
Sing Melancholy Baby

(ESTHER)
Come to me my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancies, maybe
You know dear, that I'm in love with you
Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through
Smile my honey, dear
While I kiss away each tear
Or else I shall be melancholy too
(Spoken)
My benefactor appeared with his card
And at first, I thought he was fresh
Huh, fresh!
(Song)
He was fresh from heaven all right
He produced the show that gave me the chance
To sing for you tonight

Swanee, how I love you, how I love you
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be among the folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven now my mammy's waitin' for  me
Prayin' for me, down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore
Swanee, Swanee, I'm coming back to Swanee
Mammy, Mammy, I love the old folks at home
I loves ya Swanee!
How I love you, how I love you
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world if I could only be
Sittin' on my mammy's knee
I love the old folks, I love the young folks
Oh my honey lamb, I love 'em all in Alabamy
Mammy, Mammy, my dear old mammy
Your wanderin' child will wander no more
When I get to that Swanee shore

So I can't quite be called overnight sensation
For it started many years ago
When I was born in a trunk at the Princess Theater
In Pocatello, IdahoEmbed
