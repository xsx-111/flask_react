Changing Colours LyricsYou look at me with uncertainty
You look at me with urgency
You look at me with fear in your eyes
Like you're about to fall away
But don't be afraid to change your colours now
I've known you all Summer, and you rose above it all
I see you hesitate to fall now
But it's a pretty good view from down here, too
And when the wind takes you, it takes me, too
When you change colours, I change mine, too
Try not to think, and I will try, too
When you let go, I will let go, too
I knew you when you were green and strong
You were like a feather on a wing, so long
You know I will miss you when you are gone
But don't be afraid if you just can't hang on
'Cause when the wind takes you, it takes me, too
When you change colours, I change mine, too
Try not to think and I will try, too
And when you let go, I will let go, too
The cold air is pushing hard on you
I know what you're saying; I can feel it, too
You'll go through changes, and I'll go through them too
Don't be afraid now, don't be afraid
'Cause when the wind takes you, it takes me, too
When you change colours, I change mine, too
Try not to think and I will try, too
And when you let go, I will let go, tooEmbed
