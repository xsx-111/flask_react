Where in the World Are You LyricsI've been looking in churches and looking in bars
Thought that I saw you in the oncoming cars
It was your reflection cast off by the light
And into the sky of this dark city night
And I thought that I saw you in the tallest of trees
Swayed back and forth in the mid-autumn breeze
When the leaves reddened and left too
I knew then that it wasn't you
Where in the world are you now?
Where in the world are you now?
Oh where in the world are you?
Oh where in the world are you?
Where in the world are you now?
And I looked for you there in music and song
'Cause I thought I could find you there
They were only notes pulled from the air
Not the kind I could read or breathe if I dare
Where in the world are you now?
Where in the world are you now?
Oh where in the world are you?
Oh where in the world are you?
Where in the world are you now?Embed
