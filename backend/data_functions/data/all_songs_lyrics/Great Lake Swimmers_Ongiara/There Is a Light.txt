There Is a Light LyricsThere is a light in you
I have fallen into
There is a light in you
I have fallen into
Fallen in too
Put all your weapons away
I won't fight you just to spite you
Put all your weapons away
And your mask, it's failing anyway
Falling away
Stop, listen, feel
Stop, listen, feel
Stop, listen, feel
Believe, believe
And if love is a war
I won't have any more
If this is what we call a war
I won't have it anymore
Stop, listen, feel
Stop, listen, feel
Stop, listen, feel
Believe, believe
Put all your weapons away
And end all your casual ties
Put all your weapons away
And end all your casual ties
Casual ties
Believe all your lives
Believe in your lives
Believe all your lives
Believe in your livesEmbed
