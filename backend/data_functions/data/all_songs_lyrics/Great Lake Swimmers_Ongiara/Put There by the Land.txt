Put There by the Land LyricsThere's a mark on my hand put there by the land
There's a mark on my hand put there by the land
There's a mark on my hand put there by the land
There's a mark on my hand put there by the land
Can't you see it's in me, can't you see?
Can't you see it's in me, can't you see?
Can't you see it's in me, can't you see?
Can't you see it's in me, can't you see?
And there's a mark on the land put there by my hand
There's a mark on the land put there by my hand
There's a mark on the land put there by my hand
There's a mark on the land put there by my handEmbed
