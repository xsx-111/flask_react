Passenger Song LyricsOne thing I'll say for the less traveled way
Doesn't have subtlety
Has twice the gravity
Get in and go and your one with the now
Turns inconsistently
Arcs in a symphony
Make your mind sharp and aware of the holes
Fall through them steadily
Slip through them readily
Watch and watch spiraling out of control
It's beyond all that anyway
Time is dead anyway
Passenger song on the dark radio
Wheels in your other head
And holes in your other mind
Lights on the screen and then shut by the door
Voice their inner frames
The eyes have jar all the same
Follow the path until it falls away
Hurry it's dangerous
Some say it's glamorous
Charge through the past and the future of now
Come to it sparingly
With what you are carrying
Notes on the pages and notes in the bars
And chasing without it scars
It might make you see the stars
Show me and told me then show me to bed
Collapsing anyway
The edge is starting to fray
Oh right, you are right, you are right, you are right
Left from the interstate
â€˜Cause you can hardly wait
One thing I'll say for the less traveled way
Doesn't have subtlety
Has twice the gravityEmbed
