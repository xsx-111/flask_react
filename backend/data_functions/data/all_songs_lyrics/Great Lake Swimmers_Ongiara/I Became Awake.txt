I Became Awake LyricsI became awake
From a very dark place, a patchwork of fear, of poorly conceived ideas
With a blister of water, the mark of working hands
Ready to catch, or cut
The senses aligned, the animal urgency, and voices picked up
Flowing over the static, late, quiet
I became awake
Fingers are open, eyes they are open, the firing if images, an orchestra of scribbles
The guts of an engine, the veins of a leaf, light onto paper, exposed
A filament in a bulb, up above or in the ground
Together we are magic, together we are dreaming, together we reach enlessly
The centre of a seed, so full of possibilities
I became awake
I thought I was sleeping, but I was only forming a structure with no ceiling
With words like a runway, a cloud of a person drifting away
I was heavy, but now I am light
I was heavy, but now I am lightEmbed
