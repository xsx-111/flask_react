I Am Part of a Large Family LyricsWhy are we fighting, why are we fighting?
Kicking and screaming, scratching and biting
Keeping it going, wherever we're going
Generations are generating
And what am I supposed to do
But take good care, good care of you?
We have a lot of work to do
Me and you, and you, and you
Brothers and sisters are in my arms
Brothers and sisters are up in arms
Mothers and fathers, sons and the daughters
Up in the army, the men and the ladies
And we have a lot of work to do
Me and you, and you, and you
Out of the money and into the storm
Brothers and sisters are in my arms
I am part of a large family
I am part of a large family
I am part of a large family
And that's enough for me
Drop the axes, and recheck the facts, I said
Brothers and sisters, telling the story
Out of the money, and into the storm
I said my peace, I said
I said my piece, I said peace, I said peace, I said
I am part of a large family
I am part of a large family
I am part of a large family
And that's enough for meEmbed
