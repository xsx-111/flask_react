ROYGBIV LyricsColour
Red, Blue
Orange, Violet
Green, Blue, Red, Blue
Grey Blue White
Yellow Blueberry Turquoise White
The world of colour
Colour, the touchstone of reality
Colour to excite the mind
The vivid, pulsating miracle that gives substance to shadow
One of the outstanding scientific and artistic triumphs of the twentieth century
Now there is colour everywhere
Colour within the reach of everyone
It happened with a suddenness that rocked the civilised world
The entire world will stream into our living rooms with the velocity of light
Spectacularly
The cube with the heart of a rainbow
All the glory, all the reality of nature
I believe in this world to come, I think itâ€™s going to be a pretty good world
Who knows what miracles are yet to come
A bright new era dawning
Colour, the fabric of the rainbow riding piggyback on that invisible stream of electrons
When the magic light of tomorrow comes into its own
Our era, a new era of television
Red, Blue
Orange, Violet
Green, WhiteEmbed
