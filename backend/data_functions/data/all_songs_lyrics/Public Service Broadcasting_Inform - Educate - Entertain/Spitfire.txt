Spitfire LyricsThe birds fly a lot better than we do
See how they wheel and bank and glide: Perfect
All in one
Wings, body, tail – all in one
Someday, I’m going to create a plane that flew just like a bird
It isn’t exactly a bird I’m creating, is it?
At least it’s a curious sort of bird
A bird that breathes fire and spits out death and destruction
A Spitfire bird
A Spitfire bird
Faster, always faster
What a strange looking machine
You can’t see a Spit in the air without getting a kick out of it
Why it is like a bird
A Spitfire bird
A Spitfire bird
It’s tiring stretching out for something that’s just out of reach, but I’ll get it
After all, what I want isn’t as easy as all that
It’s got to do four hundred miles an hour
Turn on a sixpence
Climb ten thousand feet in a few minutes
Dive at five hundred without the wings coming off
Carry eight machine guns
Hello Hunter Leader, Hunter Leader
Bandits approaching Beachy from southeast; angels one-five, over
Bandits are now about three to four miles south of Beachy
You should see them any minute; they’re down sun of you
Hello Hunter Leader, Hunter Leader; Flapper Control calling
Can you see them? Can you see them?
A Spitfire bird
A Spitfire birdEmbed
