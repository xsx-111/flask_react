Inform - Educate - Entertain LyricsOut of the past and into your future comes this news
And the news is Public Service Broadcasting
A bright new era dawning
The vivid, pulsating miracle that gives substance to shadow
Who knows what miracles are yet to come?
It’s tiring always stretching up for something that is just out of reach, but I’ll get it
After all, what I want isn't as easy as all that
Two very small men cutting steps in the roof of the world
Public Service Broadcasting
They say something about the spirit of our own time
Something that will still be worth saying a hundred years hence
Trains from Bristol, Cardiff, Manchester, Stoke, Liverpool and Birmingham bring a thousand bags of mail to the north
It can't go on, you know
It’s the end this time
I’m sorry; I was telling people to shut up talking
What I mean to say is
There’s nothing between us and heaven
Nothing at all
C’mon, I’ll give you a real ride
Here we go again
I believe in this world to come, I think it’s gonna be a pretty good world
