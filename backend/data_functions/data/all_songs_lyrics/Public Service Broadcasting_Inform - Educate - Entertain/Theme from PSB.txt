Theme from PSB LyricsShortly before the beginning of this century, a small group had a vision of a great human service
These dreamers were pioneers; they envisioned a great institution
Today I want to show you this world famous institution
I deem it a privilege to be able to serve

Public Service

I deem it a privilege to be able to serve Public Service Broadcasting
So settle down, listen a while
Public Service Broadcasting
It’s like a welcome knock on the door
The sound of the familiar voice
An old friend
Let me put it this way
Public Service

I’m not going to tell you our record by eminent people
You’ll remember though
But I've told you a few of the many hundreds we are making
They’ll improve with each moment of intense personal experience
And I think, together, they say something about the spirit of our own time
Something that will still be worth saying a hundred years hence

Just once in a while let us exhort the importance of ideas and information
This instrument can teach
It can illuminate and yes it can even inspire
But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it towards those ends
Otherwise it is merely wires and lights, in a box
Today I want to show you this world famous institution
Public Service Broadcasting
These dreamers were pioneers, they envisioned a great institution
Public Service Broadcasting
I deem it a privilege to be able to serve Public Service broadcasting
