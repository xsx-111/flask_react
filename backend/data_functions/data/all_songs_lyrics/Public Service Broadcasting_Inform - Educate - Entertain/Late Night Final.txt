Late Night Final LyricsNo use, is it
I tell you, things have never been as bad as this
Seen the headlines?
There’s nothing left this time
It can't go on, you know
It’s the end this time
I sometimes catch myself thinking it will be better the second time round
But this is it
This has been my go
Late night final
Late night final
Final
