The Now Generation LyricsHello everyone; thanks for coming to our little fashion show
What to wear?
How about these slacks and this shirt?
How do I look?
You’re so attractive
Clothes pressed and mended
Shoes polished
How do we look?
Good enough in that outfit
The cost of corduroy
The fabric woven for the now generation
It’s the new fashion to look old-fashioned
A girl could be crazy about it
Out of the past and into your future comes this news
And the news is pleats
I say, you look smooth
You look mighty elegant yourself, if I may say so
Not only smart, it’s comfortable too
A dress of aluminium
A future bride in a wedding dress of love
The skirt would disappear entirely
An electric belt to adapt the body to climactic changes
An electric headlight to help her to find an honest man
The finish is going to be ecstatic
The now GenerationEmbed
