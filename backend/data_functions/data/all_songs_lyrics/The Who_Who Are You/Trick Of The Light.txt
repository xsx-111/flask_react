Trick Of The Light Lyrics{Intro: bass riff by John Entwistle}

Wide awake in the middle of the night
I wonder how she's feeling
Is it just a trick of the light
Or is her ceiling peeling?
She's sitting up in bed, shaking her head
At a copy of "True Confessions"
Oh it must seem like a fairy tale
To a woman of her profession

But was I all right? (was I all right?)
Did I take you to the height of ecstasy?
Was I all right? (was I all right?)
Did a shadow of emotion cross your face

Or was it just another trick of the light?
{Bass solo: John Entwistle}


What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
They don't make girls like you no more
And I'd like to get to know you on closer terms than this
But I guess you've heard it all before

Lady of the night
Won't you steal away with me?
Lady of the night
Won't you steal away with me?
The money's lying on the floor
She looks at me, shakes her head, and sighs
Out of time, out the door
Red light shining in my eyes


All right?
But was I all right?
All right?1Embed
