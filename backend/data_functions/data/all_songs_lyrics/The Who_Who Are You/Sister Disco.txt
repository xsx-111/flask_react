Sister Disco Lyrics
As I walked through that hospital door
I was sewn up like a coat
I got a smile from the bite of the wind
Watched the fresh fall of snow
I knew then that my life took a turn
I felt strong and secure
And with adhesive tape over my nose
I felt almost demure

Goodbye Sister Disco
With your flashing trash lamps
Goodbye Sister Disco
And to your clubs and your tramps
Goodbye Sister Disco
My dancing's left you behind
Goodbye, now you're solo
Black plastic; deaf, dumb and blind

Bye, goodbye Sister Disco, now I go
I go where the music fits my soul
And I, I will never let go, I'll never let go
'Til the echo of the street fight has dissolved
I will choose nightmares and cold stormy seas
I will take over your grief and disease
I'll stay beside you and comfort your soul
When you are lonely and broken and old
Now I walk with a man in my face
Ooh, a woman in my hair
I've got you all looking out though my eyes
My feet are a prayer
