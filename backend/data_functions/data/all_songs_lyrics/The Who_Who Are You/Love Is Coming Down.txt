Love Is Coming Down Lyrics
Surrounded by people
A real heavy crowd
But inside I still feel lonely now
Should I get away
From the high heels so proud
Is there something different life can show me now

First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again
Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said
Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge
Fourth chance - Ooh, I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge

And I'm going down (I'm going down)
Going down (I'm going down)
Ooh, down

I'm not a loser
But did I really win?
Can I afford to go through it all again?

I hope I don't sound
As immature as I feel
But when I get wise, I'll give you a call, my friend


Love is coming down on me, ooh yeah
Love is burning, teaching, turning out in me
Love is coming down, down
Down, down
I'm not a loser
But did I really win?
I'm looking forward to doing it all againEmbed
