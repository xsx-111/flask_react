Had Enough Lyrics
I've had enough of being nice
I've had enough of right and wrong
I've had enough of trying to love my brother
I've had enough of being good
And doin' everything like I'm told I should
If you need a lover, you'd better find another

Life is for the living
Takers never giving

Suspicion takes the place of trust
My love is turning into lust
If you get on the wrong side of me you better run for cover
I've had enough of being trodden on
My passive days are going to be long gone
If you slap one cheek, well, I ain't gonna turn the other

Life is for the living
Takers never giving

Fooling no one but ourselves
Good is dying
Here comes the end
Here comes the end of the world
I'm getting sick of this universe
Isn't going get better; it's going to get worse
And the world's going to sink with the weight of the human race
Hate and fear in every face
I'm getting ready and I've packed my case
If you find somewhere better, can you save my place?

Fooling no one but ourselves
Good is dying
Here comes the end
Here comes the end of the world1Embed
