The Red Shoes Lyrics
Oh, she move like the Diva do
I said, "I'd love to dance like you"
She said, "Just take off my red shoes
Put them on and your dream'll come true

"With no words, with no song
You can dance the dream with your body on
And this curve, is your smile
And this cross, is your heart
And this line, is your path

"Oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be
But it's gonna be no illusion
Oh it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it
But it's gonna be really happening to you

"Really happening to you
Really happening to you"

Oh, the minute I put them on
I knew I had done something wrong
All her gifts for the dance had gone
It's the red shoes, they can't stop dancing
Dancing
"And this curve, is your smile
And this cross, is your heart
And this line, is your path"

"It's gonna be the way you always thought it would be
But it's gonna be no illusion
Oh, it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it
But it's gonna be really happening to you"

She gotta dance, she gotta dance
And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off
These shoes do, a kind of voodoo
They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off

Feel your hair come tumbling down
Feel your feet start kissing the ground
Feel your arms are opening out
And see your eyes are lifted to God

With no words, with no song
I'm gonna dance the dream
And make the dream come true
I'm gonna dance the dream
And make the dream come true
She gotta dance, she gotta dance, yeah
And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off
These shoes do, a kind of voodoo
They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off
Call a doctor, call a priest
They're gonna whip her up like a helicopter

"Really happening to you
Really happening to you"

You gotta dance
You gotta dance
You gotta dance
Yeah2Embed
