The Song of Solomon Lyrics
Song of Sol
The Song of Solomon
Solomon
The song of everyone
Everyone
Who walks the path
Walks the path
Of the solitary heart
Of the heart
The soul cries out
Soul cries out
Hear a woman singing

"Don't want your bullshit, yeah
Just want your sexuality
Don't want excuses, yeah
Write me your poetry in motion
Write it just for me, yeah
And sign it with a kiss"

Mmm, just take
Mmm, just take any line
Any line
"Comfort me with apples
Comfort me
For I am sick of love
Sick of love
His left hand is under my head
His left hand
And his right hand
His right hand
Doth embrace me"
Solomon
This is the Song of Solomon
Song of Sol
Here's a woman singing
"Don't want your bullshit, yeah
Just want your sexuality
Don't want your excuses, yeah
Write me your poetry in motion
Write it just for me, yeah
And sign it with a kiss"

And I'll do it for you
I'll be the Rose of Sharon for you
I'll do it for you
I'll be the Lily of the Valley for you
I'll do it for you
I'll be Isolde or Marion for you
I'll do it for you
Ooh, I'll come in a hurricane for you
I'll do it for you
Wop bam boom
Wop bam boom

Don't want your bullshit, yeah
Just want your sexuality1Embed
