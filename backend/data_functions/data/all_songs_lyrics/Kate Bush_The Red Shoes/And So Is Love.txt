And So Is Love Lyrics
And you, huh?
You do, huh?

We let it in
We give it out
And in the end
What's it all about?
It must be love

I give you my
I give you my
You give me your
You give me your joy

We used to say
"Ah, Hell, we're young"
But now we see that life is sad
And so is love

Ooh, baby, live your life for love
Ooh, baby, live your life for love
We used to say
"Ah, Hell, we're young"
But now we see that life is sad
And so is love

Ooh, baby, for the sake of love
Ooh, baby, for the sake of love

And whatever happens
What really matters?
It's all we've got
Isn't that enough?

Life is sad and so is love

You let it slip
You let it slip
I love you more
I love you more for it

Life is sad and so is love
All for love
Just for the sake of love
You set me free
I set you free1Embed
