Why Should I Love You? Lyrics
This chapter says
"Put it out of your mind
And give it time"

The fine purple
The purest gold
The red of the sacred heart
The grey of the ghost
The "L" of the lips are open
To the "O" of the host
The "V" of the velvet

Of all of the people in the world
Why should I love you?
There's just something about you
There's just something about you
Of all the people in the world
Why should I love you?

Have you ever seen a picture
Of Jesus laughing?
Mmm, do you think
He had a beautiful smile?
A smile that healed
Of all of the people in the world
Why should I love you?
There's just something about you
There's just something about you
Of all the people in the world
Why should I love you?


Of all of the people in the world

The fine purple
The purest gold
The red of the sacred heart
The grey of a ghost
The "L" of the lips are open
To the "O" of the host
The "V" of the velvet
The "E" of my eye
The eye in wonder
The eye that sees
The "I" that loves you
Of all of the people in the world
Of all of the people in the world
Of all of the people in the world

Of all of the people in the world
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?

Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?

Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?

Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?
Why should I love you?4Embed
