Rubberband Girl Lyrics
See those trees
Bend in the wind
I feel they've got a lot more sense than me
You see I try to resist

A rubberband bouncing back to life
A rubberband bend the beat
If I could learn to give like a rubberband
I'd be back on my feet
A rubberband hold me trousers up
A rubberband ponytails
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband
I'd be a rubberband girl

A rubberband girl, me
A rubberband girl, me
Oh, I wanna be a rubberband girl
A rubberband girl, she

When I slip out
Of my catapult
I gotta land with my feet firm on the ground
And let my body catch up
A rubberband bouncing back to life
A rubberband bend the beat
If I could learn to give like a rubberband
I'd be back on my feet
A rubberband hold your trousers up
A rubberband ponytails
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband
I'd be a rubberband girl

A rubberband girl, me
A rubberband girl, me
Oh, I wanna be a rubberband girl
A rubberband girl, she

Give like a rubberband
Twang like a rubberband
Snap like a rubberband

Rub-a-dub-a-dub-a-dub
Rub-a-dub-a-dub
Rub-a-dub
One rubberband won't keep you up
Two rubberbands won't keep you up
Three rubberbands won't keep you up

A rubberband girl, she
A rubberband girl, she


Here I go!
A rubberband girl, she
A rubberband girl, she
Yeah!
A rubberband girl, she

One rubberband won't keep you up
Two rubberbands won't keep you up
Three rubberbands won't keep you up

A rubberband girl, she
A rubberband girl, she
A rubberband girl, she
A rubberband girl, she2Embed
