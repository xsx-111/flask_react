Bones Lyrics
How can you always be late for your arrival?
You know I'd forgive you every single time
Retreat, retreat, I've fallen at the low tide
Oh retreat, retreat and meet me by the quayside

In the end all you can hope for
Is the love you felt to equal the pain you've gone through
Are your eyes showing off for mine?
Your face in my hands is everything that I need

The system's put in place, put there to protect us
For you I'd throw a lifeline every time
Oh, retreat, retreat, I've fallen at the low tide
Oh, retreat, retreat, and meet me by the quayside

In the end all you can hope for
Is the love you felt to equal the pain you've gone through
Are your eyes showing off for mine?
Your face in my hands is everything that I need

Bones, starved of flesh
Surround an aching heart, full of love
Oh, bones, starved of flesh
Surround your aching heart, full of love
Bones, starved of flesh
Surround your aching heart
Bones
Oh bones
I watch as your eyes show off for mine
I watch as your eyes show off
I watch as your eyes show off for mine
I watch as your eyes show offEmbed
