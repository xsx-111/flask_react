Spiders Lyrics
There's spiders in your room
But there always will be
There's people to be fooled
And there always has been

Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
I will carry you
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Come back to me
Come back to me

With your back to the wall
You've got one place to fall
Sometimes its all better unknown

Every little piece pulls
In its own direction
Please love don't be scared
It's just your own reflection
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Or we'll carry you
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Come back to me
Come back to me

With your back to the wall
You've got one place to fall
Sometimes its all better unknown
With your back to the wall
You've got one place to fall
Sometimes its all better unknown
With your back to the wall
You've got one place to fall
Sometimes its all better unknown1Embed
