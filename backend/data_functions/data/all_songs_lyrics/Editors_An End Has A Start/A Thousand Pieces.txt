A Thousand Pieces Lyrics
My heart has burst into a thousand pieces tonight
My heart has burst into a thousand pieces tonight
London hides her starry night
She covers them all up with light
My heart has burst into a thousand pieces tonight

Please, would you watch over me if I sleep?
Pull me from the safety zone when I'm weak

Imagine how a father feels to witness his son in a fight
Imagine how a father feels to witness his son in a fight
London hides her starry night
She covers them all up with light
My heart has burst into a thousand pieces tonight

Please would you watch over me if I sleep?
Pull me from the safety zone when I'm weak
Please, would you watch over me if I sleep?
Pull me from the safety zone when I'm weak

I made my place at this table
I'll pass the tears if I'm able
Don't pick up the pieces
Don't pick up the pieces
Don't pick up the pieces
Don't pick up the pieces
My heart has burst into a thousand pieces tonight
My heart has burst into a thousand pieces tonight

Please would you watch over me if I sleep?
Pull me from the safety zone when I'm weak
Oh please, would you watch over me if I sleep?
Pull me from the safety zone when I'm weak
Don't pick up the pieces
Don't pick up the piecesEmbed
