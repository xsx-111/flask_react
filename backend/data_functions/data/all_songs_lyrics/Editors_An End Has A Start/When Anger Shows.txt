When Anger Shows Lyrics
It creeps all over you like a dull ache
Think of all the things your hands could make
It pulls you to the ground like soaking wet clothes
The change in your face when anger shows

In that moment you realise that
Something you thought would always be there
Will die like everything else

These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I need you to tell me it's OK
These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I need you to tell me it's OK

You are a sleeping lion in your bed, I will not wake you
You're the moment love has passed, we all must learn to hate you
You're a memory from before, please don't let me forget you
You're the wolves at my door

In that moment you realise that
Something you thought would always be there
Will die like everything else
These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I need you to tell me it's OK
These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I need you to tell me it's OK

How can you know what things are worth
If your hands won't move to do a day's work?
How can you know what things are worth
If your hands won't move to do a day's work?
How can you know what things are worth
If your hands won't move to do a day's work?
How can you know what things are worth
If your hands won't move to do a day's work?
How can you know what things are worth
If your hands won't move to do a day's work?
How can you know what things are worth
If your hands won't move to do a day's work?
How can you know?
How can you know?
How can you know?

These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I need you to tell me it's OK
These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I just need you to tell me it's OK1Embed
