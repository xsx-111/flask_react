My Queen is Doreen Lawrence Lyrics

Don't wanna hear that racist claptrap
Anybody chat that crap get clapped back
Don't wanna take my country back, mate
I wanna take my country forward
Don't wanna hear that racist claptrap
You chat that chat, get clapped back
Don't wanna take my country back, mate
I wanna take my country forward
Cha!


Yeah
To want to know you're in safe hands
Whether you utter a bang
Or a whimper you'll be heard in this wasteland
To believe in due process
Lawman, your man, either side of the fence
Is regarding the other as suspect
To approach the killer of your child, demand the respect
Pressure underwater like Loch Ness
A few choice words will calm the unrest
And react to the 
To want
And say "fuck it"
Brush aside all notions of justice
Make good the engine for vengeance
To be surrounded by strangers
United in a wordless statement
It is frightening having this much presence
To belong to something bigger than a Jobcentre queue
See the wall from a not-so-desperate point of view
Wash your grievances in public
With a horde to your sides and your back
Go menace
Cause mayhem, make madness
To hurt your own home so hard that
The whole world knows you're alive
And to not give a damn if it doesn't
To say something, anything I like
Face down the law even if it's just for one night
Go ahead
Put your lips to my power and sip
Feel big like Caesar
Roman road
Stride not, run
Do not just be there when Rome burns
But to hold the torch now
Hulk smash, grab cash
You're not a fool brother, just brave
Just foolish and, let's face it:
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loots behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop, leaves the loot behind?
Who raids the shop and leaves the loot behind?
