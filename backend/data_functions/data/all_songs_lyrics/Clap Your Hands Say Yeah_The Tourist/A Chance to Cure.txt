A Chance to Cure LyricsLove or loss, can’t tell anymore
Wind crept in to capture the beginning of a fever
Warning sign
Still don’t give a hot shit about appearing in a childhood skit
Little boy who gets it all and then
Gets out alright
When you don’t know where you’re running
But you’re trying to get there first
This ambulance is bigger than I remember it was
End up alone, great pretender
See, the bitch don’t know he’s a bitch but bends his head to justify
College try
Drifted off in the middle of a sonnet
And when the thing don’t turn out the way you want
You let the tears begin
The endless nights
But I know where you’re going
With a sigh that says it all
I can’t help that it’s snowing
I tried to break your fall
Pain is not the reason
That I can’t let you be
This ambulance is big enough to carry meEmbed
