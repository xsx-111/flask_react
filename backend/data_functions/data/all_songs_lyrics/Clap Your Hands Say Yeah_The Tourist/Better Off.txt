Better Off LyricsRan a little bit away but
Lately just enough
We did it to ourselves this time
Better to keep moving
Better just to hold still
Better off than lonely
Better off
Ran a little bit away but
We still keep our hopes up
It cannot be the same out there for everyone
Better this than nothing
Better them and not me
Better now until it comes, it comes, it comes, the earth just cracks, falls apart
Turns out you were a little vicious
Hey, you hit me with a flower
But for everyone a second chance for what they've done
But it came out all wrong
It came apart
All of any, all of any, all of any, all of any, all of anyone
Now that the past is on fire
How can I look around and find I can’t remember where I was
Holy poses might be too dignified to describe the way we were
Ran a little bit away where
We can let our heads down
Look up to see the same old fog of war
Better off than doing nothing, doing what I’m doing now, doing what I’m doing now
Doing what I’m doing nowEmbed
