Ambulance Chaser Lyrics
Back to the beginning, collecting the dust
Does anybody need it to get out of a tough spot?
You're getting used to me going away
I'm getting used to taking the blame
Of career opportunity, get in the mood
Make no apology, singing the vessel
Oh and there is a limit to how much I can endure
I take my medicine and you just hope for the worst

Ambulance Chaser
Running down an injury
Ambulance Chaser
You're all I'll ever really need

Now on the radio station belligerent bully
Sacrifices innocents and turns them into tattoos
He needs to entertain anybody now
How could a needle and the  allow you
Sink your spine right into my neck
You tell your friend its alright, that someones gotta pay
But there is a limit to how much I can endure
I'll take my medicine and you'll just hope for the worst
Ambulance Chaser
Running down an injury
Ambulance Chaser
You're all I'll ever really need
All I'll ever needEmbed
