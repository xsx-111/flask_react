Unfolding Above Celibate Moon (Los Angeles Nursery Rhyme) LyricsWeakness, I wouldn’t pay them any mind
Not to what Hollywood says or what Hollywood does
You see it’s no good trying to be someone you’re not
Half-baked prejudice, capture the flag
It seems that I’ll be your mirror, I’m still your fag
The drugs out here are too strong or they’re never enough
And when Annabelle cried for the sixth time
I fled to the stoop to take in nursery rhyme
Unfolding above celibate moon that would hide away
Right there in front of me
Annabelle said, “Back inside.  What you want with the moon?”
Covered up in television interview smoke
I could be in LA, Ma, I really don’t know
Anyway, it’s somewhere there’s no telling who does the selling and who gets straight bought
Lately, the stars have all been swallowed by the clouds and
The charlatan whispers replaced by the sound of your castaway cry
Neither lost nor found but forever learning
These days I take my time (maybe too long) and shine my shoes first
As the wine stains me toothless, and your crying don’t hurt
The lie that takes me home could well wrap around the earth
As your eyes speak of darts in the sky we through ages before
We through ages before
We through ages before
We through ages beforeEmbed
