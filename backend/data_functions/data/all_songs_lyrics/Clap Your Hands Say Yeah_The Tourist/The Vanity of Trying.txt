The Vanity of Trying LyricsSome of us stay to get carried away
The fog it came without any warning
Some of us here are never going to change
Everyone keeps saying sorry
One look
One day
One smile
One way to decide
Complacency, bad taste
The vacant patience of the shattered stooge
I late arrived to the supermarket to the find that you had bought up all the food
One look
One wave
One mile
One way to decide where we stand right now
Going looking for easy solutions
Clicking heels and telling me no place like home
And that time is an illusion
And we can be whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever we want
Do something, always gotta win
Like a teenage promise on a faded tattoo
Sometimes I’m under the pressure
Other times I’ve nothing to lose
Tough love
Take it
In stride
One way to decide
Always, now never gonna change
We can beat around this bush together
Sometimes it’s all I think of
Other times I can forget
Takes two
To fake
A smile
Takes two
Two we are
Two we are
Going looking for easy solutions . .
