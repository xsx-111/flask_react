The Pilot Lyrics
What could I say? What was I after?
I forgot, but you figured it out for me again with your radio silence
Who could I've been?
Taken a number, taken no more
But can I get up to be the tourist?
Or am I the pilot?

I know, I know, I know, I know better than to think at all
A tough-love motherfucker, who was born a clown

And what was this, but a natural disaster?
Caught up with the pickets
He was flying half-mast
A little dangerous, but you had to try it
I can see
You don't know how to steer
The car off the road
It was found without a spare
You play the victim
And I play the blind man

I know, I know, I know, I know better than to think at all
A tough-love motherfucker who was born a clown
I know, I know, I know, I know better than to think at all
A tough-love motherfucker who was born let down1Embed
