Loose Ends LyricsLyrics	String	You kept your dark promise
And put a spark into my chest
Now I can't take a breath and settle down
'Cause the revolution
Was only in my head
The loose ends are all coming for me now
They're coming for me now
Someone exposed herself in a magazine
Someone exposed them self on a TV screen
There's always someone who's to blame for what is going 'round
An opportune that you never left
But I will have mine
The loose ends are all coming for me
Oh, the old friends all go running from me
Yeah, the loose ends are all coming for me now
They're coming for me
You kept your dark promise
And put a spark into my chest
Now I can take a breath and settle down1Embed
