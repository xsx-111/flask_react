Down (is where I want to be) LyricsBlack cat, let’s not split hairs
I’m tethered to the weather
I assure you I don’t care about no lucky streak
You’re out of luck, kid
Use your sense
You can’t expect the government to lend you a hand
Who am I to sympathize when …
Down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down is where I want to be
I called upon a Buddhist monk
He said the trick is not to think, boy, leave it alone
Soon you will feel next to nothing
Humanity, catastrophe
Alright, humanity, insanity
I gotta believe that I’m doing alright . . 
Down and down . . 
Is where I wanna beEmbed
