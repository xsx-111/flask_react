Fireproof LyricsThe elastic of my snap stick seems to snap down on the fuse
I take a drastic little matchstick and set fire to the tears
I will go around backstage in just my birthday suit
Now that I'm fireproof
It's a candle that you bring to the table
But it's not enough for me
Small favor, my neighbor
My savior you will be
The ring of fire is growing high
But we will never leave
No, no, no...(repeat)
And I know, I know it's hard to win
But how could I have thought we'd ever lose?
Oh, what a drag it is to win
If I were you, I'd love me, I would love me too
So don't be alarmed, don't be afraid
When it is just a little fire
I'm teaching myself to be sane
And waiting for you to regain your sight
We were in a fire last night
I just lost one tooth
Turns out I'm fireproof
Now that I'm fireproof
Now that I'm fireproof
Now that I'm fireproof
