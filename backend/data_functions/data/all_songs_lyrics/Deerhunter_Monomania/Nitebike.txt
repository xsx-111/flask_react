Nitebike LyricsI was spinning my big wheels
They were stuck and I was stuck to them
The night was clear
And I was queer
And I was only of age one year
I was on the cusp of a breakthrough
When they took me out
And stuck it in
It went so deep, man
It leaves scars you relate to
Are only burdens to me
I was a dream, a dream, a dream of my self
I was no longer in good health
Have you ever been here?
Or someplace else you can relate to
Out of fear
Out of trials and error
I was no longer mine
I had pantomimed
I had felt for lights
I had grown to find
I had no place in mind
When I began to drive
No destination
No destination
You can feel my pain?
You want to relate
You want to stay
I was feeling real bad
And I had found all my problems
I had found all my problems
They came flying up to me1Embed
