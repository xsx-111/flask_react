Monomania LyricsMy only boy couldn't leave his lady, well uh
Come on boy let me show you that uh
If you wanna be with me, hey
I can be your home away
Come on god hear my said prayer
If you can send me an angel
If you can't send me an angel
Send me something else instead
Send my heart to the sea
Oh the empty sea
But there's a light in the core
And there's nothing left no more
No more no
If you can't choose me
Then you can't see
There's a light in my heart
And it won't be there tomorrow
There is a man
There is a mystery whore
And in my dying days
I could never be sure
Well never mind
And then they take me away
And then they take you away
They'll never take me away
And in my head
There is something rotting dead
I can't compete with her
Let me be released from this
