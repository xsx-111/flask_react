Dream Captain LyricsDream captain take me on your ship
I've been feeling like I'm gonna be sick
I've been landlocked for too many weeks
I've been feeling like I'm leaving
I'm a poor boy from a poor family
There's nobody left to take care of me so
Dream captain take me on your ship
Dream captain take me if you wish
I'll do anything that you need
There's nothing that's left of me
I'm a poor boy from a poor family
I can see where I come from easily
I don't need nobody to tell me what I want
I've already been giving up from my birth
Could take me, hold me, while I see in you
Or would you give me wings so I could fly, fly, or sink and die please!
Dream captain take me on your ship
If you feel that I am best
To belong in the company grip
I want to be on the company ship
I'm a poor boy from a poor family
I ain't got nobody left to take care of me
I can feel it in all my extremities
They're going numb and I don't know how long I can breathe
Dream captain take me on your ship
It's my only, my only wish
I can do whatever you command
I'm a boy man, and you're a man man
I'm a poor boy from a poor family
I ain't got nobody left to take care of me
I'm a poor boy, I'm so dirty
I'm a poor boy, well look into my eyes, look into my eyes...1Embed
