T.H.M. LyricsI tried to keep him straight
Ever since the day he was born
He came out a little late
Maybe that's where frustration's born
My head was like a wound
When they called me and said
"It's happened much too soon"
Took two bullets to the brain
My kid brother, he was insane
Was insane
When you find a way
Call and tell me when the time's arranged
I had no cause to be awake
The phone rang, it was 3am
Oh it was T.H.M
Where is T.H.M
Ever since I was born
I have felt so forlorn
I always knew this day would come
Hey you lose and you win some
T.H.M
T.H.M
T.H.M
