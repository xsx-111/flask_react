Pensacola LyricsTake me on the trip man I’ll never get sick
Take me wherever you go and I won’t complain along the way
Well, I’ve been waiting so long to say bye bye bye
This town ain’t gave me nothing but a bald head and trouble
Well, if it can’t be better if it can’t be tried
Doesn’t matter much boy and I will dry my eyes
Well, I could be your boyfriend though I could be your shame
Until I see your eyes in the beltway, babe
Let’s go
Hey, I came from the delta down to the plains
Well, I came round from the delta right through the plains
Right through the plains, right through the plains
Right through the plains, right through the plains
Well, I came from the delta down to the plains
When I got back home there was nothing I had arranged
The woman that I love took another man
When nothing ever ends up quite like what you planned
They took me to the central station and I jumped on board of that bus the long way
Time to take my trip; give me that ticket, man
Straight to Pensacola1Embed
