Neon Junkyard LyricsFinding the fluorescence in the junk
By night illuminates the day
Finding ancient language in the blood
Fading a little more each day
And if you've got a lot of pain
You remember how to speak
And if you got a lot of rain
Yeah it's still coming down in sheets
Neon rust is coloring the blood
Call upon the words to speak
Everything is the same as it was
But now there's nothing left to change
And if you got a ritual
We've drowned by rain
And if you memorize the words
They will show you the wayEmbed
