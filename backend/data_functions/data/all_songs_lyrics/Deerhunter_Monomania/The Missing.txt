The Missing Lyrics
Open up my thoughts
Oh tell me if you see
Some meaning
Oh take me all apart
Oh so that I can see
The pieces
And I could walk for miles
And on every street
Is the same scene
Follow the telephone wire
Until I feel this air
Beneath me

Oh and if you don't mind
Would you show to me the missing?
Oh with my weak eyes
I would only see the missing

Open up my thoughts
Oh tell me if you see
Some meaning
Oh take me all apart
So that I can see
The bleeding
Oh and if you don't mind
Oh could you show to me the missing?
Oh with my weak eyes
I would only see the missing
The missing
The missing
The missing
The missing
The missing

And I would understand
(I would understand)
If you show to me
The missing
And I could understand
(I could understand)
If you showed to me
The missing
And I would understand
(I'd understand)
If you show to me
The missingEmbed
