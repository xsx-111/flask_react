Back to the Middle LyricsBack to the middle
This is where love has left me
It's an endless cycle
Please don't take it away from me
And look at me
My hair is falling out now
You're two by four
You left me doubting
Back to the middle
Everyone knows your name now
It's all accidental
Your love is such a sick sick game
How could he?
The basic way you used me
Why does it have to be so brutal?
Back in the middle
Take me where I can see some stars
Take me to your cabin
Like you promised so many times
You and me
You broke free
You broke me
And you left these little piecesEmbed
