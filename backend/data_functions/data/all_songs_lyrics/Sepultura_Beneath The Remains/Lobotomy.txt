Lobotomy Lyrics
I've seen you fighting through the time
I've followed your steps, full of pain
Unnamed hero that's challenged the human ego

Victim of cowardice
Of strong manipulation
A system that was made to lie and to deceive

Screams of agony
Satisfy the proud
But these screams still echo inside the conscience

Contradiction, aggression, desolation, illusion

Nonconformity takes my mind
Too much injustice to forget so fast
My disgust is greater than my compassion
Feel the pain upon your final hour

Self-blame can't hurt me, eye for an eye
You receive your just reward
Now I'll live my life with indifference
I've tortured without remorse
I've slaughtered without fear
Brain killing brain
Brain killing brain
Brain killing brain
Brain killing brainEmbed
