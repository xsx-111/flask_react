Looking inside, your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured
The silence agonizes, the words sound strong
Look inside the eyes, leave this world

Hate through the arteries
Mass hypnosis

Uncertain of being back
They make you feel so good
Everything's darkened
Obey like a fool

Hate through the arteries
Mass hypnosis

Soldiers going nowhere
Believers kneeling over their sins
Inhuman instinct of cowardly leaders
Make the world go their own way
Tens of thousands hypnotized
Trying to find a reason why
Look inside your empty eyes
Obey till the end

Looking inside, your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured
The silence agonizes, the words sound strong
Look inside the eyes, leave this world

Hate through the arteries
Mass hypnosis

Soldiers going nowhere
Soldiers blinded by their faith1Embed
