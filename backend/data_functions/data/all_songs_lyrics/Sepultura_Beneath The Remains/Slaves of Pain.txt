Slaves of Pain Lyrics
All of us are victims
Confined by enigmas
Without solution
Your frozen thoughts don't let you evolve
A prisoner of your own trap
Slaves of an infinite pain
What will be the limit?
What will be the end?

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain

Seeking new paths
Don’t be tied to your mistakes
Run away from this
Uncured sickness
Open your eyes
Don’t lose your steps
Liberty is a dream
And it also is real
To die, to run away
To forget what I’ve been
To erase my past
To kill my guilt

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of painEmbed
