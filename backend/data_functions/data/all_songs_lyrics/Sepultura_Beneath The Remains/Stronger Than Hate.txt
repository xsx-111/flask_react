Stronger Than Hate Lyrics
I shall redeem myself from
The clutches that grasp at my inner self
No tomorrow will ease my oppression
My streak of hate leads my way

Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate

I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between

Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate

I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between

A lifetime of remorse
There’s no place that I’ve never been
Go

I stand above the remains
My vengeance I have regained
I don't know what lies on the floor
I won't be locked anymore

Standing here, I’ve lost all faith
I have no social equality
To live again would be a lie
My life is not worth the pain
