Cruel Sister Lyrics
There lived a lady by the North Sea shore
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
Two daughters were the babes she bore
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

As one grew bright as is the sun
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
So coal black grew the elder one
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

A knight came riding to the lady's door
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
He'd travelled far to be their wooer
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

He courted one with gloves and rings
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
But he loved the other above all things
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

"Oh sister, will you go with me"
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
"To watch the ships sail on the sea?"
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

She took her sister by the hand
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
And led her down to the North Sea strand
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

And as they stood on the windy shore
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
The dark girl threw her sister o'er
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
Crying, "Sister, reach to me your hand!"
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

"Oh sister, sister, let me live"
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
"And all that's mine I'll surely give"
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
"Your own true love that I'll have and more"
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
"But thou shalt never come ashore"
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

And there she floated like a swan
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
The salt sea bore her body on
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la


Two minstrels walked along the strand
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
And saw the maiden float to land
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

They've made a harp of her breastbone
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
Whose sound would melt a heart of stone
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
They took three locks of her yellow hair
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
And with them strung the harp so rare
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la


They went into her father's hall
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
To play the harp before them all
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

But as they laid it on a stone
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
The harp began to play alone
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la


The first string sang a doleful sound
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
"The bride her younger sister drowned"
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

The second string as that they tried
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
"In terror sits the black-haired bride"
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

The third string sang beneath their bow
Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
"And surely now her tears will flow"
Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-laEmbed
