Juanita: Kiteless: To Dream of Love Lyrics
Your rails
Your thin
Your thin paper wings
Your thin paper wings
In the wind
Dangling
Your sun, fly
Your window, shattering
Your rails
Your thin paper wings
Your thin
Sugarbox - sugarboy
Riding in
Riding in
Sugarbox - sugarboy
Handheld candle sugarboy
Your rails
Your thin
Your thin paper wings
Your thin paper wings
In the wind
Dangling
Your sun, fly
Your window shattered in the wind
Your cocacola saint
Rattlin
Rattlin
Resonator...
Homeless strays
Gatherin
Outside your window
Bootleg babies call to you lying among the mosquitos
That summer's fever coming
Cats are gathering
Outside your window
Homeless strays
Bootleg babies
Lying among
Calling to you
Lie among the mosquitos
Your thin
Your rails
In the wind
Your thin paper wings
Your sun, fly
Danglin
Danglin
Your window shattered in the wind
The sun lying
Your cocacola sign
Your thin
Your rails
Paper wings
Paper wings
Resonator...
Homeless strays
Gathering
Outside your window
Bootleg babies call to you
Lying among the mosquitos
And the summer's fever coming
Cats are gathering
Outside your window
Homeless strays
Bootleg babies
Calling to you
Lying among
Lying among the mosquitos
Your rails
Your thin
Your sun, fly
Your thin paper wings
In the wind
Dangling
Dangling
Your window shattered in the wind
The sun and on your cocacola saint
Your thin paper wings
Your rails
Paper wings
Talk to me...
There is a sound on the other side of this wall
Burning singing on the other side of this glass
Silence is preserving the voice
Footsteps concealed
Walking in the wind at the water's edge
Comes close to covering my rubber feet
Listening to the barbed wire hanging
There is a sound on the other side of this wall
Burning singing on the other side of this glass
Footsteps concealed
Silence is preserving the voice
Silver chain
Thrown away
Broken wing

Silver and blue and blue and denim
And silver and red and silver and red
And blue and yellow and white and blue
And blue and red and grey and red and
Green and blue and yellow and black and
Black and red and green and white and blue
(and blue)
And grey and blue and white and yellow
And black and white and blue
And red and white and red and grey
(and blue)
And grey and red and red and yellow and
Green and grey and blue and blue and grey
And yellow
(and white)
And silver and black and green and
(and white)
Red
And black and silver and white and
Grey and blue
(and blue)
And grey and silver and white and white
(and brown)
And red and curry and green and grey
And green and white and black and silver
And white and green and red and red
And black and red and white and grey and
And silver and green and grey and black
Red and blue
(and blue)
And blue and blue1Embed
