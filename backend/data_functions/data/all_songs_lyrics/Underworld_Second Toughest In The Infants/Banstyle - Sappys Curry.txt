Banstyle / Sappys Curry LyricsBanstyle
If they don't know and they don't know they're gonna find out soon enough
I'm so hot. As if that hurt
Did you wash it. Fester it around some
You don't even have to mind your own stuff, bring in the marines
I've heard so many other things and it was all brown
With the suction ones, the ones that suck it up
And I don't ever do the eye till I did that thing
I bet you like a blue boost. Try a noose
Loosen the strap where the two metal ends
Rest your head against the steel, blow in to the tube, show me your legs
Help me, show me a pink smile. Walking up the aisle
Show me the things underneath your seat
Show me your tiny plastic soft drink
A song like a squealing pig. Like a train with wheels
In the dark with the lights off
Concealed I'm thinking of you still

Sappy's Curry
White room, little legend, fishman, Nike man
Red stripe, blue Mercedes, big dog, salty man
Full moon rising, old boy, salty girl
Bunny girl, happy shopper, bouncing ball, city sun
Think I found the real stuff
I think I found the real stuff
White room, little legend, fishman, Nike man
Red stripe, blue Mercedes, big dog, salty man
Full moon rising, old boy, salty girl
Bunny girl, happy shopper, bouncing ball, city sun
Think I found the real stuff
I think I found the real stuff
White crumbs across your bed
Gray clouds cover Bethnal Green
White jeans, black top, nice shape
Cracks a blue bitch till the son come sliding
Naked beneath the knee
Reflect black eyes, your knee talking
I think I found the real stuff
I think I found the real stuff1Embed
