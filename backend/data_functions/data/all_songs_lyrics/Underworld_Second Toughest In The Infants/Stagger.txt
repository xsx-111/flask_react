Stagger LyricsOrange, orange, orange in the mouth again straighten
Wearing stone washed demin again straighten
Carrying something wrapped in plastic straighten
Curled on the blue velveteen again straighten
Straighten
Sightless yellow highrise bethnal green straighten
Corner tubeless dark and wet straighten
Ten tons slowly then again straighten
With its glass eyes and blue Formica halo
Stainless steel between the fingers straighten
Piston leaning ponytail licking colonel sanders fingers
The naming of killer boy
Everything's going west, nothing's going east straighten
There's no need to be so uptight straighten
Make up for all their messes I could listen to you all day
What a laugh, cut me I bleed like you, ha ha
The naming of killer boy
Cover your teeth, I love you
Don't bite me yet, I believe in you, I found you
Shopping in Europa on Warder Street
Not phoning packwidth
Guilty as sin straighten
Scratches on paper pissed in a tubehole straighten
Smelling of deep-fried beans and whispering your name
Tubehole wind in my face thunder in gentle distance
Reactor, reactor, do you mind straighten?
