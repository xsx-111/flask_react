Cockroach LyricsO loathsome crawling thing
Be done with your miniscule affairs
O hungry creeping speck
I release you from your cares Be gone Roach!
You live on carrion That's outrageous
You're probably contagious
Blind crippled and half-squashed
And yet you carry on
Your persistence is disgusting
I could never find myself trusting
A creature that would rather live in the trash than in the lawn
Cockroach your problems are not mine
I love life but with you I draw the line
Not to flaunt my superior design
But next to you I'm practically divine
Cockroach your problems are not mineEmbed
