Babydoctor Lyrics(BABYDOCTORâ€”Three ways of staring at the sun)
Thank you Thank you Babydoctor
Babydoctor Thank you
And you count out the years you have been here
In this foreign land
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Fourteen years Here Jalal Jalal Babydoctor
And you count out the years you've been deprived
The use of your hand
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
Thirteen years Stroke
Staggering walker it takes you two lights
To cross the street
Traffic is backed up here at the place
Where cars and people meet
The very fast and the very slow
Beg for a ride and choke out a stream of words
As I drive
A mantra of thanks and counting out years that buries me alive
In the light of your humble and proud handful of
Mispronounced words
And I fall to my knees in the shade of a tree and
Cry Thank you
I look into the sun until it blinds me
I look into the sun until I go blind
I am raped by the light of the light until I am the
Son of the sun
I am replaced
Hail and praise the all-seeing eye of Pelton & Crane
I open my mouth to the all-seeing eye of Pelton & Crane
Pelton & Crane I am replaced
Thank youEmbed
