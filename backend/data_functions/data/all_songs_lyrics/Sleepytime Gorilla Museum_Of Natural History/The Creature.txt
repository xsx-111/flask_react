The Creature LyricsThere is a creature. It has to feed
It stops at nothing to fill its need
The people live in gruesome squalor
So that the creature may grow taller
Those with nothing have to bleed
To help the creature spread its seed
They learn to dine on fecal matter
So that the creature may grow fatter
The creature tells of evil gnomes
Coming to destroy our homes
And trolls who come with gun and knife
To threaten our way of life
The creature has enslaved our town
But no one thinks to bring it down
Provided with so much distraction
The people can't be moved to action
And when the people are all dead
Still the creature needs its bread
When we've been sucked completely dry
The creature needs its food supply
(a parasite cannot survive unless its host remains alive.)
It has amassed such awesome wealth
Maybe it can eat itself

He had one of my shirts on
Feel like I'm such an idiot that I don't see that
I guess must really be some kinda idiot hillbilly
I'm just gonna stand around 
Well, I'm not mad at him
And I don't wanna commit no violence or nothin'
I'd rather keep my knife than-than-than him run off with it in his back
