The Donkey-Headed Adversary of Humanity Opens the Discussion LyricsThe Donkey-Headed Adversary of Humanity opens the book
The Donkey-Headed Adversary of Humanity opens the discussion
I am the adversary
And must remain the adversary
I am not yours to embrace
I am not yours to invoke
The Donkey-Headed Adversary of Humanity sleeps in the hall
Watches for signs of our imminent demise in the scratchings on the wall
The Donkey-Headed Adversary of Humanity sleeps in the park
Listens for sounds of our eminent decay in the singing of a solitary lark
Mankind is a plague
Breathing hell into every corner of the rotting earth
Even now in this our finest hour
I feel the hate of every stone, tree and flower
Even now we fall under the long shadow of the donkey's ears
Even now we listen for the slow grinding of the donkey's teeth
Lalala, we weep in the din of the stomping of the donkey's black hoof
Lalala, we weep for the slow coming of the dance of our doom
Mankind is a plague
Breathing hell into every corner of the rotting earth
Even now in this our finest hour
I feel the hate of every stone, tree & flower
Eaters of the soil take us into the ground (death by worm)
Eaters of the air drive us from the blue (death by sparrow)
Eaters of the sea take us into the green (death by eel)
Eaters of the scraps take in our beds (death by dog)
Eaters of the soil take us into the ground (death by sand)
Eaters of the air drive us from the sky (death by flower)
Eaters of the green take us into the sea (death by water)
Eaters of the scraps take us in our beds (death by stone)
Death by silence
Death by sorrow
