All the Same Lyrics
There goes the day, oh what a shame
It's OK, that's all the same
It's alright, it's OK, because the night is just another day
Oh there's the night, oh what a shame
It's alright, that's all the same
It's OK, it's alright, because the day is just another night
Oh when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody
Oh I know it's hard but you stay with me, oooh ooh, we've got a memory

Oh there's the day, oh what a shame
It's OK, that's all the same
It's alright, it's ok, because the night is just another day
Oh when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody
Oh I know it's hard but you stay with me, oooh ooh, we've got a memory

Oh when you came back from the scene, it's true, you brought a melody
Oh I know it's hard but you stay with me, oooh ooh, you got a memory
Oh when you came back from the scene, it's true, you brought a melody
Oh I know it's hard but you stay with me, oooh ooh, oooh ooh
