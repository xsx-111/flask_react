Municipality LyricsDriving past hotels
In the night
Your words don't sit well
How can I feel free?
When all I want to be
Is by your side
In that municipality
Up in that farm land
Past the houses and gardens
Dozens of shade trees
Are waiting there for me
That's not anything like my reality
To be by your side
In that municipality
That's not anything like my reality2Embed
