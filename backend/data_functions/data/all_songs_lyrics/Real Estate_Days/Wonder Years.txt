Wonder Years LyricsI'm not trying to be cool
I only want to be kind
I know that I've pissed you off
Babe I better rewind
But I'm not yours
And you're not mine
No I'm not OK
But I guess I'm doing fine
Jealous lovers left behind
Wonder years passed me by
Far away but still on the mind
Think of you from time to time
But I'm not yours
And baby you're not mine
No I'm not OK
But I guess I'm doing fine3Embed
