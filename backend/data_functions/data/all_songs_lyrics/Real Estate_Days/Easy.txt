Easy LyricsBack when we had it so easy
I would surrender completely
I built a shelter from green leaves
In the sun, in the sun
Around the fields we'd run
With love for everyone
Dreams we saw with eyes open
Until that dream was done
I used to be so confused
But I knew just what to say to you
I was just floating on an inner tube
In the sun, in the sun
Around the fields we'd run
With love for everyone
Dreams we saw with eyes open
Until that dream was done
Around the fields we'd run
With love for everyone
Dreams we saw with eyes open
Until that dream was doneEmbed
