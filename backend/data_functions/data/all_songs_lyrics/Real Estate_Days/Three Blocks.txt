Three Blocks LyricsMonday morning, dirty sidewalks
Waiting for me outside the door
Walking slowly up those three blocks
Things won't be like they were before
Endless autumn under pine trees
And a springtime spent by the sea
All those people all around me
Were they strangers or was it me?
Figured out where I want to be
All in the time allotted me
Figured out where I want to be
All in the time allotted meEmbed
