Green Aisles LyricsUnder dormant trees
Under bright lit skies
Mountains of maple leaves
Standing side by side
The phone lines
The street lights
Led me to you
And if you
Just sit tight
I'll be there soon
All those wasted miles
All those aimless drives
Through green aisles
Our careless life style
It was not so unwise
No
I rode right past
The train tracks on
Ancient as the stone
Blacked out on a bicycle
I made my way back home
The houses were humming
All through the night
And winter was coming
But that was alright
All those wasted miles
All those aimless drives
Through green aisles
Our careless life style
It was not so unwise
No
The phone lines
The street lights
Led me to you
And if you
Just sit tight
I'll be there soon
All those wasted miles
All those aimless drives
Through green aisles
Our careless life style
It was not so unwise
No
All those wasted miles
All those aimless drives
Through green aisles
Our careless life style
It was not so unwise
