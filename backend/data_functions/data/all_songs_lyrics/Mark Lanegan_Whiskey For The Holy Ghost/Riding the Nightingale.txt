Riding the Nightingale LyricsDyin' mama barely breathin' in a bed of nails
To wander through the ruin smokin' and pale
Came upon an angel and a nightingale
Back where the darkness comes
Between the earth and skies above
Dead weight on my body's bones
I think I dug too deep a hole
Think I dug too deep a hole
Better run for cover, babe, you better hide
Don't do no good to wait 'til time decides
Time decides
Time
Time
I need a little more time
Riding on my nightingale
So many years to, to ride
Riding on my nightingale around my heart
Climbing down the stairs at last
I wouldn't touch me right
You're too proud and I'm too scared
And I'm neither here nor there
It's only fear
Well open up the doors
And let me breathe that air
Better run for cover babe you better hide
Just don't do to wait til time decides
Time decides
Time
Time
I need a little more time
Mama I'm gonna cry now
Cry, I'm gonna cry now
Oh you're makin' me cry now
Cry, I'm gonna cry now
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
I'm gonna cry
Cry
I'm gonna die cryin'
Better run for cover, babe, you'd better hide
Just don't to wait 'til time decides
Tied around my nightingale
So many years to, to hide
Fly my nightingale
Around my heart
Who's riding on my nightingale (7x's)Embed
