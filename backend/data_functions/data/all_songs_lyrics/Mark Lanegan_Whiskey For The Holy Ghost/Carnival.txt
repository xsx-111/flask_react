Carnival LyricsWhere in the world have you been
It's as strange as I've ever lived
So you're comin' along to the sideshow
I'll be fallin' all over like dominos
For girls are sad in their eyes
They're all standin' around bein' hypnotised
And walkin' me back to the firin' line
Ya smile to get in the door
Ya can't keep it closed anymore
Tell your ma that you're gone to the freakshow
I'm crawlin' all over the carnival
Just scratchin' a stitch in a skin
I'm moanin' for more of the medicine
In the mornin' you're wonderin' where ya been
Just turnin' your back to the ghost
And tryin' to look like you just might know
That all of the good that you've seen
Just went down and into the drain
Oh kids am I straight out for now
In the mornin' I'm gonna find it on out
What in the world can it be
It's as strange as I've ever seen
The girls are dead in their eyes
Just standin' around like they're hypnotised
Who'll follow me back to the freak show
I'm crawlin' all over the carnival
And I am gone
The kid's in a straight out for now
In the mornin' I'm wanna find it on out
What in the world can it be
It's as strange as I've ever seen
The girls are dead in their eyes
Just standin' around like they're hypnotised
Who'll follow me back to the freak show
I'm crawlin' all over the carnival
And I am goneEmbed
