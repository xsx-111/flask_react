El Sol LyricsThe sun is gone, and that's all I really know
No angels in the air
With hearts as good as gold
The closer you stand to the gates
The more the gates are closed
These darkened days
Make somebody's hunger and thirst
The blessed burns the sun
He's throwin' shadows on the earth
The shadow you find at the gate
And all the gates are closed
Oh yeah
Anytime you find your race is run
Felt much colder standin' in the sun
Waitin' for some warmth and comin' down
Felt much older than I really was
Waitin' for some warmth and comin' down
The sun is gone, yeah that's all I really know
No angels in the air
With hearts as good as gold
The closer you stand to the gates
The more the gates are closed
Anytime you find your race is run
Felt much colder standin' in the sun
Waitin' for some warmth and comin' down
Felt much older than I really was
Waitin' for some warmth and comin' down
Felt much older standin' in the sun'
Waitin' for some warmth and comin' down (repeat)Embed
