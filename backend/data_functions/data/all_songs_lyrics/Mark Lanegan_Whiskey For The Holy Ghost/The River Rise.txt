The River Rise LyricsOh the river rise
And it's a mile high
Is this worth tryin'
Is this worth tryin'
'Cause I could fall
Like a tear
Well there's nothing else I can do
When I'm not alone
Nothings beside me
What one eye sees
The other's blind in
Well I could fall
As if I was young
With a lifetime to think of you
Fire one for losing
And two for hiding
Keep river moving
Movin' right by me
I could fall
And there's nothin' else I can do
Ah the river rise
And it's a mile high
Has this world turned
Has this world tried
'Cause I could fall
Like a tear
Well there's nothin' else I can do
Up on the river rise
She's a mile highEmbed
