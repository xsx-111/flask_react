Judas Touch LyricsPut out the lions and close the door
I need you more than I did before
Old Jack's been killed and buried away
Let's hang alone outside the gate
Flames scare the lions as do their dreams
That's the way it'll always be
Better close the door
That's the way it'll alway be
Better close the door
Some fools forever don't ask for much
With frozen hand, calm Judas touch
Some towers of fire can be redeemed
Just let me burn high worlds awayEmbed
