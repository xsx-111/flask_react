Shooting Gallery LyricsI'll tell you how I woke up on the line
My sister, I almost saw the light
Look, my hands are tied
I'll see you in another hallway some other time
Well I don't understand this big parade
It's a five star decoration day
Look my hands are stained
I was washin' 'em, the water, well the water fell away
I'll tell you how I woke up on the line
Sorry for a soul in heaven passin' by
Look my hands are tied
I will see you in another station some other timeEmbed
