Sunrise LyricsSunrise, forgot to cover up my eyes
Sunrise, should've covered up my eyes
Beauty wasted on me
Winds are shakin' my tree
With a woman too good to believe
Take the first ride out that I see
Sunrise, skies are servin' my plan
Grounds are movin' where I stand
Pull an airplane down with my hand
And take the first flight out that I can
Sunrise, forgot to cover up my eyes
Beauty wasted on me
Winds are movin' my trees
With a woman too good to believe
Take the first ride out that I see
