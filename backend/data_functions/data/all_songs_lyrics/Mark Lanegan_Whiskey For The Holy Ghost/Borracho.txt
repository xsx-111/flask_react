Borracho LyricsOh....oh (4x's)
Trouble comes in slowly
An everlasting light come to shine all over me
Bright in the mornin'
Like all of heaven's love come to shine on me
And to you who never need
Fuck yourselves, I need some more room to breathe
Here comes the devil prowl around
One whiskey for every ghost
And I'm sorry for what I've done
'Cause it's me who knows what it cost
It breaks and it breathes
And it tears you apart
It bites and it bleeds
And this desert turns to ocean over me
Here come the devil prowl around
One whiskey for every ghost
I'm sorry for what I said
I said I just don't care anymore
A fool can feed on the notion
Sees and believes
And this desert turns to ocean over me
Trouble comes in slowly
An everlasting light come to shine all over me
At the dead end to mornin', darlin'
With all of heaven's love come to shine on me
The fool that feeds on the notion
Sees and believes
And this desert turns to ocean over me
Here come the devil, buy the round
One whiskey for every ghost
And I'm sorry for what I done
Lord, it's me who knows what it costs
The fool that feeds on the notion
Sees and believes
And this desert turns to ocean over me
Here come the devil prowlin' round
One whiskey for every ghost
And I'm sorry for what I said
I said I just don't care anymore
It breaks and it breathes
And it tears you apart
Gonna bite, gonna bleed
'Til this desert turns to ocean over meEmbed
