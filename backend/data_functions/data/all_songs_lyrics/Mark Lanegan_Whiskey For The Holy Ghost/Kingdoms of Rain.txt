Kingdoms of Rain LyricsAre those halos in your hair
Or diamonds shining there?
Without a hope
Without a prayer
This rain beats down like death
You turn your eyes to better men
Before I go, I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you now
Girl, lay your shame to rest
Then hold the lies close to your breast
You stoop to feed the crows
Some scraps of truth already cold
Before I go, I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you now
And every kingdom of rain comes pourin' down
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long
Would you put halos in your hair?
Without a hope, without a prayer
What lies close to your breast
Finally lay your shame to rest
Before I go, I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you now
And every kingdom of rain comes pourin' down
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so longEmbed
