What Is This Note? LyricsWhat is this note?
The sun kisses the morning dew
Just the way that I'm kissing you
The birds are tweeting in sweet harmony
Teaching the free world how to be free
The day is new and a good one too
How can I prove my love to you?
I wanna give you everything
Me and the birds, now we're gonna sing
When I wake up to your beautiful smile
Sometimes it takes me a little while
To realize that I am awake
And that living today will be a piece of cake
And I won't keep you for myself
No, you're not a toy on my shelf
The world needs to know that you're here
So spread your wings and fly, my dear
The day is new and a good one too
How can I prove my love to you?
I wanna give you everything
Me and the birds, now we're gonna sing
The day is new and a good one too
How can I prove my love to you?
I wanna give you everything
Me and the birds, now we're gonna singEmbed
