Teenage Witch LyricsLookin' downtown sun-riser sam
Bring it on down now i'm in a jam
Where did you find such a rockin' vest?
So get away kid, you've become a pest
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Silky gown
Pink and brown
Shut you down
And shut you up
Little lizard legs and rubber lizard tails
Always taste better when you're sittin' in jail
Still I don't think that I can resist
After all the times that I had to kiss
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Keep at arms length from the long armed law
Goin' to the bank for a $50 withdrawl
Gonna find the place where the weirdos hang
Knockin' on the door for a $50 bang
Silky gown
Pink and brown
Shut you down
And shut you up
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch
Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditchEmbed
