Souljacker Part II LyricsSouljacker can't get my soul
Ate my carcass in a black manhole
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can shoot me up full of bullet holes
But the souljacker can't get my soul
Souljacker can't get my soul
Left my carcass with the worms and moles
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can hang my neck from the old flagpole
But the souljacker can't get my soulEmbed
