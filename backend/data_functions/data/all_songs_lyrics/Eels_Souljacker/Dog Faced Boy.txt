Dog Faced Boy LyricsComing home from the school today
Crying all along the way
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Begging, "Mama, shave me please."
You little punks think you own this town
But someday someone's gonna bring you down
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
You take back what you said now
Thats the last time I cry
You dont know what it is to be a friend, now
Till I walk beside you on the street and now
Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Going back to the school tomorrow
Hang my hairy head in sorrow
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Ain't no way to set me free, now
Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boyEmbed
