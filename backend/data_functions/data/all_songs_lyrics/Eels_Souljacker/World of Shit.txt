World of Shit LyricsIn this world of shit
Baby, you are it
A little light that shines all over
Must take over and see us through the night
Daddy was a troubled genius
Mama was a real good egg
Why don't we just get together
For whatever and see if it's all right
I spent so many days just starin' at the haze
I think that's a book that I don't have to write again
And when I rise, I shine; I've got you on my mind
And the question isn't, "if", the question is merely "when"
Baby, I confess
I am quite a mess
So let's get married and make some people
More than equal in this world of shit
I will make a pledge
To get down off the ledge
You and I belong together
And forever we will have our lifeEmbed
