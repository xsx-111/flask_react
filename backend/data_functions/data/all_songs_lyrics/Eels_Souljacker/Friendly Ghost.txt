Friendly Ghost LyricsIf you're scared to die
You'd better not be scared to live
I've been spending all my days
Giving all I can give
Last night I heard someone walk in
Through my bedroom door
What they wanted I'm not exactly sure
A friendly ghost is all I need
A friendly ghost is all I need
Marking time on a broken watch
Counting days till the old pawn shop
Sells me back my saxophone
Then everyone's gonna leave me alone
Two times I thought I heard someone
Knocking on the glass
I hid my head and prayed that it would pass
A friendly ghost is all I need
A friendly ghost is all I need
If you're scared to die
You better not be scared to live
I've been carrying round a grudge
Think I better forgive
Last night I heard footsteps walking
On the attic floor
I got up and I opened up the door
A friendly ghost is all I need
A friendly ghost is all I need
A friendly ghost
(If you're scared to die)
Is all I need
(You'd better not be scared to live)
A friendly ghost
(I've been spending all my days)
Is all I need
(Giving all I can give)Embed
