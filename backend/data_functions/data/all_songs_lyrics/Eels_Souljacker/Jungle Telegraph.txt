Jungle Telegraph LyricsMama had a epidural
Hoping I would be a girl
The night was black, the sky was blue
The darker clouds are showing noon
I heard screaming, the doctor shouts
Didn't give in, I came out
And here I am
I found my way down the street
Chicken hawks, filled with meat
The man was big, the gun was loaded
She had cash, but never showed it
I heard screamin', bleeding throat
And baby I got on that boat
And here I am
Now im up here in the trees
Shaking off the bugs and fleas
The days are long, the sun is beating
Each day I don't die is cheating
Send me some lovin'
Send me some lovin'
Send it now
Send it by giraffe or jungle telegraph
Or jungle telegraph
Or jungle telegraph
Or jungle telegraphEmbed
