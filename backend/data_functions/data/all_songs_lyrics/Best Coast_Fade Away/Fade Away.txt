Fade Away Lyrics
People they change
And love, it fades
My brain is gray from all the things I take
I want to sleep
But all I do is dream
Sick of you being mean
I didn't do anything
My heart it melts
For those who weep
Sick of you being mean
I didn't do anything

I could stay I could stay I could stay
I could
Stay
But it's best to go away, go away, go away
Go away
I won't change, I'll stay the same
I won't change, I'll stay the same
Darling fade away, darling fade away

Sometimes I see
The person that's inside of me
She's real
She's mean
She doesn't say anything
My heart can tell
What she screams and yells
That inside she's cold
And she'll never grow old

My heart it melts
For those who weep
Sick of you being mean
I didn't do anythingEmbed
