I Wanna Know Lyrics
Drawing names deep in the sand
Holding on to each other's hands
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know
Teling lies its a big surprise
Gazing deep into each other's eyes
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know

It's a mystery to me
How much he really loves me
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know
And though i see you every night
I never wanna leave your sight
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know

It's alarming how charming you can be
And though i know its wrong
I've done it all along
But now it's time to say
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
I saw you out just the other day
I didn't have a clue what to say
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know
I miss the way you held me tight
I even miss our stupid fights
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know


You can have me every day
Or we could go our separate ways
You can have me every day
Or we could go our separate ways
You can have me every day
Or we could go our separate ways
You can have me every day
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye1Embed
