Fear of My Identity Lyrics
Last 30 seconds I'll wait for him
Last 30 seconds I'll wait for him
To begin, to begin
Last 30 seconds I'll wait for him
Last 30 seconds I'll wait for him
To begin, to begin

The nights are getting longer
The pain is getting stronger
But I know
The hate is getting darker
And the fear is growing larger
But I know

You taught me that I would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old, old, old
You taught me that my heart will grow old
You taught me that my heart will grow old, old, old

Last 30 seconds I watch you go
Last 30 seconds I watch you go
All alone, all alone
Last 30 seconds I watch you go
Last 30 seconds I watch you go
All alone, all alone


The fear of my identity is standing right in front of me
I want to run but I can't see
I want to scream but I can't speak
The fear of my identity is standing right in front of me
I want to run but I can't see
I wanted to be you, but I know it's me1Embed
