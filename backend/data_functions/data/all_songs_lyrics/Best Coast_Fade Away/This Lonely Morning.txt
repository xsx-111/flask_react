This Lonely Morning Lyrics
I wait for you to call but sometimes you don't call at all
I wait for you to stay but sometimes you just go away

This Lonely Morning, This Lonely Morning
This Lonely Morning, This Lonely Morning

The haze is on my mind, I'm running from myself this time
And I don't see fine, I can't walk in a straight line

:
And I don't know why I'm feeling this way all the time
You're always on my mind, I can't escape the world sometimes


I see what people say, I know I can't go anyway
These feeling never change and oh, I can't go anyway
My heart it pounds and breaks, I know I can't go anyway
And though the day is grey, I know I can't go anyway
