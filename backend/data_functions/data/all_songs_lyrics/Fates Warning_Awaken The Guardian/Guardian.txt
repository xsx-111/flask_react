Guardian LyricsThese walls are stained engraved with pain
You will find them under shadows casting shame
Some it's all they'll ever know
Angels of the fortunate sons come and go
You may not
Entities pass in the night Guardians
And the reapers fight the will to live shall win
Mares of hope ride through their dreams
Blinding light awakens sleeping dawn it seems
It was all a dream, an endless dream
I will wish upon a star
I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar
I remembered you
Will you remember me
I'm the man you sentenced
Penance Unabsolved
Answer me
Save my will
Have you forgotten me
Pace the hallway blind man
For a million miles of stars his mind has seen
Think you may he lives in darkness
We're the dark he's seen the light of dream
Karen's been asleep forever
I know she hears me
She has so much to say
A machine shoots sparks through her face
Into my hand, to my heart
I will wish upon a star
I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar
I remembered you
Will you remember me
I'm the man you sentenced
Penance Unabsolved
Answer me
Save my will
I'm a fire without a flame
Helpless child without a name
With broken wings
Catch me I'm falling
I'm a question with no answer
Who are you that takes my life away from me
Unveil the boundaries of the black
I had a dream I was you
Strong as the fire in my veins
Then when I called out your name
I would remain to witness the pain
I am beyond silent black
I will be back as your guardian
Angels in white you have sacrificed
Your witness and bury the pain
You walk hand in hand with the fear stricken child
Strengthen the weak and the lame
Have you seen the only unborn
The pillars of penance and lore
Perpetual journey into the realm
The sovereign servitor
I will wish upon a star
I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar
I remembered you
Will you remember me
I'm the man you sentenced
Penance Unabsolved
Answer me
Save my will
Have you forgotten me
Answer me
Save my will
Have you forgotten me
Answer me
Save my will
Have you forgotten meEmbed
