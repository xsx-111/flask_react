Prelude to Ruin LyricsLook to sunrise man tell me what you see
The eagle has flown underground
Abandoned you, abandoned me
Fifty two falling stars are burning up the sky
Blazing torch falls to the ocean bottom where
Black predictions lie
Have you faith in scripture visions of kings
Reaper of reality your destiny the sisters sing
Vultures scavenge the subconscious of your mind
Their ally is time for us to fall and yield
We should be held so high and not looked down upon
We are the root of the country
Roots so firm and tranquil
When will the spirits be welcomed
Listen the music is heard again
When there are lofty high roof tops
Carved walls and yielding crops
Palace is wild for lusting
When the forest is wild for hunting
Existence of any one thing has never been but the
Prelude to ruin
Wars and temper tantrums are the makeshifts of ignorance
Regrets illuminate
Depth beyond sin is fathomed wandering through the devil's field Sowing his seed
Guardian angel guide us through the night
We compel his long constant fight
The more they control eternal destiny
The sisters all of three
Clotho she spun the web to live the thread so tentative
Lachesis she measured out the years
Atropos cuts the thread with her shears
Time, time, time
An imaginary line
Mine, not yours nor yours, mine
They lead the blind back to mother's womb
Tomb of the unborn child
Coming events cast their shadows before
Wintery wind the eye of the storm
Witness the past the future holds more
Prelude to ruin
We should be held so high and not looked down upon
We are the root of the country
Roots so firm and tranquil
When will the spirits be welcomed
Listen the music is heard again
When there are lofty high roof tops
Carved walls and yielding crops
Palace is wild for lusting
When the forest is wild for hunting
Existence of any one thing has never beenEmbed
