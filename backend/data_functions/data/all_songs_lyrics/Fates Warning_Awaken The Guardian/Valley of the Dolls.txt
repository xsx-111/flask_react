Valley of the Dolls LyricsBedroom mirrors do tell who's the fairest of them all
Limelight silhouette transparent attic walls
Dancing shadows cascade paper dolls
Wailing ghost guitars send in the clowns
Send in the clowns
Painted plastic faces stealing mommies make up
Masque the false gods with mannequin smiles
Primadonnas play upon their pedestals of fame
Unborn girls false facade illegitimate child
I won't play your game
Blasphemous black bible bias you betray
Bigotry
Slay the hydra pretty fair maidens spread
Their leprosy
Hungry children feed from hype of
Perpetual ego's
I slay the hydra, burn the talisman
Holocaust
Run with the pack illegitimate child
The unborn wench at war
Tears in his eyes she became a bride
Wedlock to a whore
Shatter the dream the tangerine dream
Bow to kings not the queens
Go back where you reign
To your domain
The Valley of the Dolls!
Bow to kings of yesterday
They have given you wings to fly away
What have the phantom queens but deceived you
Armies of shadows climbing
Silvery mountains lining molten and ask kiss my
Camouflage the battle scars
With oxyten and Maybelline
Cloning the hero's in hype magazines
Pirates of underground
Lightning the speed of sound
You will prevail
Bedroom mirrors do tell who's the fairest of them all
Limelight silhouette transparent walls
Dancing shadows cascade paper dolls
Wailing ghost guitars
Run with the pack illegitimate child
The unborn wench at war
Tears in his eyes she became a bride
Wedlock to a whore
Shatter the dream the tangerine dream
Bow to kings not the queens
Go back where you reign
To your domain
The Valley of the Dolls!Embed
