The Sorceress Lyrics
I search alone, dark the night
Deep the blackest forest
Down the devil's hop yard
On my way from Salem I lit a fire
Magical brimstone sparks
Ashes from the hazel wood
Dancing with the banshee
Fire rose up to the sky

The dead of night parts the sky
The Salem Witch
Hunting eyes Malefica spells
She soars the ocean shore of Kildare
Over tombs of the harpy fields
Lonely girls ride the great beast
Virginal goddess of Hunt Diana

Through the Brocken Spectre
Rose a luring Angel
Sister of Morgana
Forever dressed in black
We journey through the witch trials
Learned of lore and wives tales
We fathomed the deepest oceans
O her darkest mind
The dead of night parts the sky
The Salem Witch
Hunting eyes Malefica spells
She soars the ocean shore of Kildare
Over tombs of the harpy fields
Lonely girls ride the great beast
Virginal goddess of Hunt Diana

Searching lands of giants and dragons
Sail the oceans of serpents and krakens
Under ages of dark the Salem witch
Burned beneath mindless torture of men
Through the castles of demons and wizards
Cast to their fate the Moerea the sisters
Two hundred fifty thousand the Salem witch
In the bog of the Witch Meadow run (The Salem witch)
Malifica revenge plague have begun (The Salem witch)
Burned alive for a crime never done

Children of the darkness dance
On the coven of the lost
In blazing pyre suspended in air
She demands holocaust
She can exorcise with the whites of her eyes
She'll devour your children
In a wink of an eye, descend from the sky
To the cauldron of the damned
Her burning lips urned the infamous kiss
She took me by the hand
In a wink of your eye she ascends to the sky
She unveiled my talisman
I'm the witch finder general

Dark the night
Deep the blackest forest
Down the devil's hop yard
On my way from Salem I lit a fire
Magical brimstone sparks
Ashes from the hazel wood
Dancing with the banshee
Fire rose up to the sky

The dead of night parts the sky
The Salem Witch
Hunting eyes Malefica spells
She soars the ocean shore of Kildare
Over tombs of the harpy fields
Lonely girls ride the great beast
Virginal goddess of Hunt DianaEmbed
