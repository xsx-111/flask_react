Exodus LyricsMorning desert sun horizon
Rise above the sands of time
Mystic journey to Arcana
I travel starry spheres in trine
Sands of the dunes dust of the bones
Swallow the trace of creatures left behind
Gods of the fire fall from the sky
Reaped all the fruit and plagued earth dry
Distant vision tempting waters
Fall to my knees I'm going to drink it dry
Blazing desert sun reflection
On the water he caught my eye
Up in a tree preying on me
Vulture of fear why don't you let me be
He said you're mine one day
Spit out the sand
Be on your way
Exodus ascend the plane
Exile this medium of bondage
Far beyond the myriads of crypt and pyramids
Beyond the harpy vultures guarding their tombs
Arcana awaits
Exodus ascend the plane
Exile this medium of bondage
Far beyond the prophecy of tyrant guardians
Traject the esoteric sisters they are mythical
Arcana awaits you
Oh guardian predestination calls
Silent wind I felt what you said
Soon I'm exhumed for consummation
He charmed my soul with his book of the dead
He read it said beat no children
He will inhere the malignant fear in man
Sovereign the force more than emotion
It controls your destiny at hand
False guardian
I will compel
False as the fear of heaven and hell
I should have known
It's all a mirage just as well
The power of good
Will not be shown by conquering fear
Let it be known its a constant resist
While facing transformation
Morning desert sun horizon
Rise above the sands of time
Mystic journey to Arcana
I travel starry spheres in trine
Sands of the dunes dust of the bones
Swallow the trace of creatures left behind
Gods of the fire fall from the sky
Reaped all the fruit and plagued earth dry
Exodus ascend the plane
Exile this medium of bondage
Far beyond the myriads of crypt and pyramids
Beyond the harpy vultures guarding their tombs
Arcana awaits
Exodus ascend the plane
Exile this medium of bondage
Far beyond the prophecy of tyrant guardians
Traject the esoteric sisters they are mythical
Arcana awaits youEmbed
