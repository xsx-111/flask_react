Fata Morgana LyricsMorrigan you come again
Morgan le Fay, raven on my sill of frost
Far away from the sea of the setting sun
Island of fire and albatross
Taught so well magic Merlin the wizard
Maiden of beauty dressed in rainbow
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
Daemon girl daughter of saul
Queen of the under world
She'll have us all
Daemon girl foul temptress of lust
Peasants to kings
Your heart she will turn to dust
Daemon she's the mortal of man
Lives in your dreams in darkness
Reaches out her hand
Come to me
Come to me
Fata Morgana
She will take you
You're a hungry scarred harlot
Hunting another heart
Morrigan fallen angel
Queen of magic
Kneeling at the widows altar
Temptress of my dreams
She's the widow in my dreams
Far beyond the realm of dream
Your wildest dream
Ascend to the plane
An imaginary game to play
Past the golden pillars of the lore
To Lemuria
Imagine your queen
Take her she's yours
Daemon upon her throne mirrored mirage
Of your desire
Of my desire
Passion slave, her life I gave
Jump into her fire
Fata Morgana
She will take you
You're a hungry scarred harlot
Hunting another heart
Morrigan fallen angel
Queen of magic
Kneeling at the widows altar
Temptress of my dreams
She's the widow in my dreamsEmbed
