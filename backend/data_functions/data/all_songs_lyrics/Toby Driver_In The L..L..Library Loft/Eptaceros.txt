Eptaceros LyricsI look down and my hoof is cloven
Black blisters on my family photographs
Blood in my mouth and shit on my fingers
I can't move till light stops touching my face, but I don't think I wanna
I'm turning into stone
Sparrows perching on my shoulder make me forget the taste of blood
My dirty body begs for curtains to be drawn
Long red ribbons touch my eyes to the floor
My bones bend each hand to six fingers
I can't move till the light stops touching my face, but I don't think I wanna
I'm turning into stone
The sparrow perching on my shoulder made me forget what I was talking about
Beware the white ghostEmbed
