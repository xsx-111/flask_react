She Needs Me LyricsShe needs me
She doesn't know it
But she needs me
And so no matter where she goes
Though she doesn't care
She knows i'm there
She needs me
I ought to leave her
But she needs me
I guess it very bright
Just to tag along
But right or wrong
I'm here, I'm hers
And I'll be a friend or a lover
Because my one ambition is
To wake her and make her discover
She needs meEmbed
