Was There a Call for Me LyricsWas there a call for me ...
I had to talk to someone
Waiting for days is drivin' me crazy
Was there a call for me?
When lovers disagree
All of your dreams come undone
I'm not denyin' its got me cryin'
Was there a call for me?
My lips are growin' cold
My two arms long to hold
And thanks to you my story is told ...
By the way ... once again I'm sayin' ...
Was there a call for me ...
Unfriendly clouds give warning
Here comes the dawning ... cold rainy morning
Was there a call for me?
Here comes the dawning ... cold rainy morning
Filled with the mist of tears I resist
Tell me ...
Was there a call for me?Embed
