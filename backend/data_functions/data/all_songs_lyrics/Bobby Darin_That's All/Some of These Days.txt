Some of These Days LyricsSome of these days
You're gonna miss me, baby
Some of these days
You''re gonna feel so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
You're gonna miss my kissin'
You'll miss me, baby
When I'm far away
You'll feel lonely
And want me only
'Cause you know, baby
You always had your way
And if you leave me
You know it's gonna grieve me
You're gonna miss your thin little daddy
Some of these days
I said some of these days
You're gonna miss me, baby
I'm talkin' 'bout days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You're gonna miss my huggin'
You're gonna miss my kissin'
You'll miss me, baby
When I'm long gone away ...
You're gonna feel so lonely
And beg for me only
'Cause you know, baby
I always gave you your way
And if-a you leave me
You know it's gonna grie-ee-ee-ve me
You'll miss-your thin, little, daddy
Some of these daaaaa-ays ...Embed
