These Days LyricsYou don't need a lover in this climate
You don't need a boyfriend in your bed
These days
Pull a blanket round you, baby
If you're looking for an early grave
Mr Anderton will lead you to it
He says
Pull a blanket round you, baby
Some have said
I'd go now rather than wait
Just to sit and watch my days slip away
So surely
You don't need a lover in this climate
You don't need a boyfriend in your bed
These days
Pull a blanket round you, babe
Jesus said
Jesus said to Mary
Lord, the things we do for love
Well, do think I seem self conscious
It's only you I'm thinking of
Well I was hiding in the bathroom
Quite unable to cry
Now I'm weeping with a vengence
Since your voice came down the line
I moved up from the country
Though I never could have stayed
I just dipped my hand in the water
And got carried away
Well would you put me down
Just for being around
At the wrong time of day?
Or would you leave me while I'm sleeping
Out through the fire escape?
They tell me swans do fly
Across a perfect sky
And it's a purist's sky tonight
So you'll desert me in the morning
On account of your cruelty and spite
I moved up from the country
To wave goodbye to all that
I just leapt up on that riverboat
And I never will look back
Jesus said to Mary
Lord, the things we do for love
Well, did she think he was self conscious
It was only her he was thinking of
Well I was hiding in the bathroom
Quite unable to cry
Now I'm weeping with a vengence
But these are tears of joy, oh my
I moved up from the country
Though I never could have stayed
I just dipped my hand in the water
And got carried awayEmbed
