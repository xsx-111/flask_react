Jennifer She Said LyricsJennifer we can't go wrong let's put it in writing
Jennifer we can't go wrong let's do it right now
Maybe you were a little hasty
But they say love is blind
Now her name's on you
Jennifer in blue
Did you ever have a bad dream wake up and it not stop?
Did you ever feel for a girl for a time and then stop?
Well it's written there in blue
With a heart and arrow through
Her name on you
Jennifer in blue
Oh, forever you said that's forever you said
Forever
And forever she said that's forever she said
Forever..
But you change with the weather
And this is the rainEmbed
