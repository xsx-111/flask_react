Mainstream LyricsWhen am I ever going to kick the curse?
I took my medication I feel worse
Swimming is easy when you're stuck in the middle of the Mississippi
All you have to do is crawl
15 years a big shot in a one horse town
Riding the elevator shafts with your hip flask and your sunbed tan
You were born stupid mister you were born cheap
All you have to do is crawl
When are you ever going to see the sense?
I kick it in and you just spit it right out again
Swimming is easy when you're headed for the deep
All you have to do is crawl
One for the money, baby, two for the money
Get back in that elevator Jack, eat up your milk and honey
Guess you were born lucky mister ain't life sweet?
All you have to do is crawl
When are you ever going to see the sense?
I kick it in and you just spit it right back out again
Swimming is easy when you're stuck in the middle of the Misssissippi
All you have to do is crawlEmbed
