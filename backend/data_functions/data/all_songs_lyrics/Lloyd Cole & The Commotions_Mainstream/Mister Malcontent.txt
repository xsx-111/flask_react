Mister Malcontent LyricsJohnny stumbles Johnny falls
Under slogans
Of the wall
He sees where's the sense
He says call me Mister Malcontent
A waste of space and alcohol
Drinking rain and eating soil
And slogans off the wall
Cannot express himself at all
Cut off my nose despite my face
And I will not more longer wait
Or should I laugh or should I cry
Or should I part my hair behind?
Or should I laugh or should I cry
As I become all I despise?Embed
