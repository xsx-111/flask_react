A Groovy Kind of Love Lyrics
When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat
I can hear you breathing near my ear

Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to you can turn me onto
Anything you want to, anytime at all
When I kiss your lips, ooh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love

When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care
Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love

We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
Oh, oh-oh-oh
We got a groovy kind of loveEmbed
