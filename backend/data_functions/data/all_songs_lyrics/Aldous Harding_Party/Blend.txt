Blend LyricsHey, man
I really need you back again
The years are plenty
Somewhere
I have a watercolour you did
I saw you walking on the sand
In Thailand
I used to watch you from the van
It was your band
Don't let us bully you, baby
Got problems of the heart
And you're the the perfect blend
Can't seem to let you off the chain
That is our name
A few of your letters came from Limoges
She's gonna struggle day to day
But she deserves a place
You and walking in the sand
And you're the perfect man
You're the perfect man
You're the perfect blend1Embed
