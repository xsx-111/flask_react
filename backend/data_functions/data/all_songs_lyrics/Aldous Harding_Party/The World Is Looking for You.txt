The World Is Looking for You Lyrics
The address is of the theatre
Albeit for me
They make me want to rest
And I've barely woken
And yes, it is true
For a lady, I'm new
But I cannot dance for your eye
When every time I try
This world is looking for you

There is no end to the madness I feel
There is no end to the madness I feel
Yes, you found me
Yes, you love me but will you stay?
Yes, you found me
Yes, you love me but will you stay?

The address is of the theatre
Albeit for me
They make me want to rest
And I've barely woken
And yes, it is true
For a lady, I'm new
But I cannot dance for your eye
When every time I try
This world is looking for you
There is no end to the madness I feel
There is no end to the madness I feel
Yes, you found me
Yes, you love me but will you stay?
Yes, you found me
Yes, you love me but will you stay?
There is no end to the madness I feel1Embed
