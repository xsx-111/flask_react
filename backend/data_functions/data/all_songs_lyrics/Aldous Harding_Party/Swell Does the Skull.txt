Swell Does the Skull LyricsSwell does the skull
I don't want to be a sinner, no
Don't want to be a sinner, no
But bourbon, always bourbon
Swell does the skull
Don't want to be a sinner, no
Don't want to be a sinner, no
But velvet, always velvet
Here he comes through the rain
With his coat and his walking cane
And he says softly to me:
"The war is over, we belong in the country."
Oooh
Ring have the bell
There's honey on the bread now
There's honey on the bread now
And music, always music
He comes home, out of the rain
I take his coat, and his walking cane
He can feel that I hold him tight
The day's over
We belong by the fireside
Swell does my skull
I'll never be without him, no
I'll never be without him, no
I'll never be without him, noEmbed
