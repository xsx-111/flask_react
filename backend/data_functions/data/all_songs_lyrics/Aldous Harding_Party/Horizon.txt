Horizon LyricsLet me put the water in the bowl
For your wounds, babe
Let me fill you up with the fingers of love
You can’t lose babe
When you watch me play, does it feel bad, darlin’
When they choose me?
Say again, this place
Say again, this place
I broke my neck
Dancing to the edge of the world, babe
My mouth is wet, don’t you forget it
Don’t you lose me
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
I’ve gotta scratch it down, I never could amount
That’s it, babe
And now the sugar’s run out
And I don’t know what to say
Say again, this place
Say again, this place
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
And every now and then, I think about
When you’ll die, babe
There’s a fall in my head
It floods what you said into the room, babe
I don’t belong in the desert
Yes, I can see it, take me home, babe
Say again, this place
Say again, this place
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizonEmbed
