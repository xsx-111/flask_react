Imagining My Man Lyrics
I'm going to answer, protected
It can be so hard to forgive
It's not what I sought, and it's not what I pictured
When I was imagining my man
You are so nervous all of the time, living the classics
I know that imagining my man
Imagining, imagining my man

All my life (hey!) I've had to fight to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, hey

You have this dream, apparently I'm not done
I leave and it's dreadful
If you get down
Be honest, respectful

All my life (hey!) I never tried to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, hey

I hope one day we'll get that way
Lucky to be given the chance
I do not have the answer
But I don't have the wish to go back
All my life (hey!) I've had to fight to stay
You were right (yes!), love takes time, hey, hey
All my life (hey!) I've had to fight to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, heyEmbed
