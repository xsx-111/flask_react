Party Lyrics
He took me to a clearing
The grass was warm
And the air was soft

He had me sit like a baby
I looked just twelve
With his thumb in my mouth

I was as happy as I will ever be
Believe in me
I will never break from you
If there is a party, will you wait for me?

I felt slow on the journey you planned
I was ashamed
When you yelled my name
Stones smell good when you cuddle them
All in a stack

I was as happy as I will ever be
Believe in me
I will never break from you
If there is a party, will you wait for me?
I wander off the journey I've planned
The doom I felt
And the death I smelled
I see now that he understands
He cannot be helped

I was as happy as I will ever be
Believe in me
I will never break from you
If there is a party, will you wait for me?Embed
