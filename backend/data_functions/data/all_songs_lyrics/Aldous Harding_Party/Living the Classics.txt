Living the Classics Lyrics
Living the classics
Pushing the limit
I'm gonna read it
As they told it
Gonna make my own
Put it on a disc
Living the classics


I'd like to try it
And know that I've done well
Grab hold of my future
Win the money back
Take mom to Paris
And jump on the big beds
We'll be alright
Put it on a disc

Can't fight the feeling
Gonna make it
I won't stop turning
'Til I'm twisted
Come find me
Drag me back to hell
