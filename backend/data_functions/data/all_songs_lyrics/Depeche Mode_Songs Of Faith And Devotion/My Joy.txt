My Joy Lyrics
My joy, the air that I breathe
My joy, in God I believe
My joy, you move me

My joy, the blood in my veins
My joy flows in your name
My joy, you move me

I'm not a mountain, no
You move me
I'm not a mountain, no
You move me


My joy, heavenly bliss
My joy, the pleasures I've missed
My joy, you move me

I'm not a mountain, no
You move me (Move me)
I'm not a mountain, no
You move me (Move me)
I'm not a mountain, no
You move me (Move me)
I'm not a mountain, no
You move me (Move me)Embed
