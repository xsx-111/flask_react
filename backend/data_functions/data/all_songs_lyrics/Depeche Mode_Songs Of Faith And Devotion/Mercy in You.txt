Mercy in You Lyrics
You know what I need when my heart bleeds
I suffer from greed, a longing to feed
On the mercy in you

I can't conceal the way I'm healed
The pleasure I feel when I have to deal
With the mercy in you

I would do it all again
Lose my way and fall again
Just so I could call again
On the mercy in you, the mercy in you

When here in my mind I feel inclined
To wrongly treat you unkind, I have faith I will find
The mercy in you

I would lose my way again
Be led hopelessly astray again
Just so I could pray again
For the mercy in you
When here in my mind I have been blind
Emotionally behind, I have faith I will find
The mercy in you, the mercy in you
The mercy in you, the mercy in you5Embed
