The Troubles Lyrics
Dee deedle lee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee deedle lee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Oh oh
Ooh aah

We're going away to Ireland soon
We're going away to Ireland Ireland
Ireland soon
Ireland soon
We'll try not to get in the way of the guns
As we always do
Try not to get in the way of the guns
Soon

We're flying across the ocean soon
We're flying across the ocean ocean
Ocean soon
Ocean soon
I dreamed I saw my guitar
Topple off onto the runway
Please be careful with my guitar
Whoever you are
We're leaving behind our boyfriends soon
We're leaving behind our boyfriends boyfriends
Boyfriends soon
Boyfriends soon
I hope they have health food in Dublin
And strawberry apricot pie
If they don't have those things in Dublin
We'll probably die

We're going away to Ireland Ireland
Ireland ocean boyfriend
Ireland ocean boyfriend
Ireland ocean boyfriend
Ireland ocean boyfriend
Ireland ocean boyfriend
Ireland Ireland Ireland
Ocean boyfriend boyfriend
Boyfriend boyfriend boyfriend
Boyfriend boyfriend ocean
Ocean boyfriend Ireland
Ocean boyfriend Ireland
Ocean boyfriend
Strawberry apricot pie
Strawberry apricot pieEmbed
