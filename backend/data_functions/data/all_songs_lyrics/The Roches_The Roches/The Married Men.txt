The Married Men Lyrics
One in Louisiana
One who travels around
One of 'em mainly stays in heartthrob town
I am not their main concern
They are lonely too
I am just an arrow passing through

When they look into my eyes
I know what to do
I make sure the words I say are true
When they send me off at dawn
Pay the driver my fare
They know I am goin' down somewhere

O the married men
The married men
Never would have had a good time again
If it wasn't for the married men

One says he'll come after me
Another one'll drop me a line
(Drop her a line, drop her a line)
One of them says all my agony is in my mind
(In her mind, in her mind)
They know what is wrong with me
None of 'em wants my hand
(Wants her hand, wants her hand)
Soloing in my traveling wedding band
O the married men
O the married men
Makes me feel like a girl again
To run with the married men

One of 'em's got a little boy
Other one he's got two
And one of 'em's wife is one week overdue
I know these girls they don't like me
But I am just like them
Pickin' a crazy apple off a stem
(Off a stem, off a stem)

Givin' it to the married men
The married men
All of that time in hell to spend
For kissin' the married men
All of that time in hell to spend
For kissin' the married
The married menEmbed
