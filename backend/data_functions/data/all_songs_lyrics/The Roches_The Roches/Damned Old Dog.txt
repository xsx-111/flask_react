Damned Old Dog Lyrics
Do I wanna be a dog?
Any diddlin' male would do
If I was a damned old dog
I wouldn't be fussy for you

Do I wanna be a housebroken dog?
Eat better than an Indian
I don't wanna be a damned old dog
(I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be)
I just wanna lick your chin again

I thought that I could convince you
And I thought that I could get through
Chew out a hole in the fence you
Barked up between me and you
Bow wow


Limpin' around in the moonlight
Coverin' (Coverin' coverin') up what I did
Words (Words words) decompose all around me
Nuisances I committed
Do I wanna be a dog?
Cut the heat out of me
If I was a damned old dog
I wouldn't have to goddamn human beEmbed
