Hammond Song Lyrics
If you go down to Hammond
You'll never come back
In my opinion you're
On the wrong track
We'll always love you but
That's not the point
Ooh
Ooh

If you go with that fella
Forget about us
As far as I'm concerned
That would be just
Throwing yourself away
Not even trying
Come on (Come on)
You're lying to me

Hmm
Hmm
Hmm

Well, I went down to Hammond
I did as I pleased
I ain't the only one (Not the only one)
Who's got this disease (Not the only one, not the only one)
Why don't you face the facts
You old upstart?
We fall apart
If you go with that fella
You'd be okay if you'd
Just stay in school
Don't be a fool

Do your eyes have an answer
To this song of mine?
They say we meet again
On down the line
Where is on down the line?
How far away?
Tell me I'm okay

If you go down to Hammond
(If you go down to Hammond, if you go down to Hammond)
You'll never come back2Embed
