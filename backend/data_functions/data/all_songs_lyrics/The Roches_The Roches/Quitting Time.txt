Quitting Time Lyrics
Quitting time, quitting time
Quitting time, quitting time

Money is not the problem
You have enough of that
Now you must close your office
Put on your coat and hat
Put on your coat and hat

Now is the hour of quitting
Twilight paints the town
Old industrial skyline
How does the sun go down?
How does the sun go down?

You can go south in winter
Be what you are: a goose
You can live near the ocean
Your clothes can fit you loose

Even as you are leaning (Even as you are leaning)
Into that glass of wine (Into that glass of wine)
Your beloved business (Your beloved business)
Will come to the end of a line
Come to the end of a line
All of the gates are open (All of the gates are open)
All of the charges dropped (All of the charges dropped)
Talks are terminated (Talks are terminated)
Payments have been stopped
Payments have been stopped

You can move north in summer
You can be in the breeze
You don't need to notify
Any secretaries

Old industrial skyline
Drawing away from you
You are the one that's moving
You are the fool that flew
You are the fool that flew

You can go south in winter (Quitting time)
Be what you are: a goose (Quitting time)
Honk all the moon out the ocean (Quitting time)
Your clothes can fit you loose (Quitting time)
You can go south in winter
Be what you are: a goose
Honk all the moon out the ocean
Your clothes can fit you looseEmbed
