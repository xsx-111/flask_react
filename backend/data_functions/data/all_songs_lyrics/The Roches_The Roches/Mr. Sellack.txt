Mr. Sellack Lyrics
O Mr Sellack
Can I have my job back?
I've run out of money again
Last time I saw ya
I was singing Hallelujah
I'm so glad to be leavin' this restaurant

Now the only thing I want
Is to have my old job back again
I'll clean the tables
I'll do the creams
I'll get down on my knees
And scrub behind the steam table

O Mr. Sellack
I didn't think I'd be back
I worked here last year
Remember?
I came when Annie
Was going on vacation
And I stayed on almost 'til December

Now the only thing I want
Is to have my old job back again
I won't be nasty to customers no more
When they send their burger back
I'll tell them that I'm sorry
Waiting tables ain't that bad
Since I've seen you last
I've waited for some things that you would not believe
To come true (Ooh)

Give me a broom and I'll sweep my way to heaven
Give me a job
You name it
Let the other forty million three hundred and seven
People who want to get famous

Now the only thing I want (The only thing, thing that she wants)
Is to have that old job back again (Gimme that old job back)
I'll clean the tables (She'll clean the tables)
I'll do the creams
I'll get down on my knees
And scrub (Scrub) behind (Behind) the (The) steam tableEmbed
