Runs in the Family Lyrics
I can't get over what I saw
I can't change the law of averages
I'm going down
My uncle did it, my daddy did it
I'm beginning to think that it runs in the family
Oh no, runs, runs in the family

One by one we left home
We went so far out there
Everybody got scared
My uncle did it, my daddy did it
I'm beginning to think that it runs in the family
Oh no, runs, runs in the family

All the boys could have gone to school
All the girls were pretty enough to play the fool
Something about the danger zone
Wouldn't leave the bunch of us alone

I remember that night
It was the one I picked a fight with you
I'm holding the bag
Just like my mama did
Just like her mama did
Now there's gonna be a new kid in the family
Oh no, kid you're gonna run in the family
Oh yeah, kid you're gonna run in the familyEmbed
