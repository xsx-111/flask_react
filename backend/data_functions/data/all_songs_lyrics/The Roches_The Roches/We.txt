We Lyrics
We are Maggie and Terre and Suzzy
Maggie and Terre and Suzzy Roche
We don't give out our ages
And we don't give out our phone numbers
Give out our phone numbers
Sometimes our voices give out
But not our ages and our phone numbers

Guess which two of us made a record?
Guess what the other one did instead?
The two who made the record
Have been a singing group for ten years
Singing group for ten years
And now a trio we are
Born on the fourth of December

We come from deepest New Jersey (Deedle-eedle-eee)
But now we live in New York City
We better get outa there
Before the shit hits the fan
Shit hits the fan (Hits the fan)
You might say where have they played?
All over the country and in England
Who have we worked with?
Do we know anybody famous?
Anybody famous
Do we know anybody famous?
Anybody famous
And as a point of interest
We spell our last name R-O-C-H-E

We are Maggie and Terre and Suzzy
(We come from deepest New Jersey (Deedle-eedle-eee))
Maggie and Terre and Suzzy Roche
(But now we live in New York City)
We don't give out our ages
(We better get outa there)
And we don't give out our phone numbers
(Before the shit hits the fan)
Give out our phone numbers
(Shit hits the fan)
Sometimes our voices give out
(You might say where have they played?)
(And as a point of interest)
But not our ages and our phone numbers
(All over the country and in England)
(We spell our last name R-O-C-H-E)
We are Maggie and Terre and Suzzy
We spell our last name R-O-C-H-EEmbed
