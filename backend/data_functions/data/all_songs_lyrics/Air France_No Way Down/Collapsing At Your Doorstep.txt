Collapsing At Your Doorstep LyricsNo, better
Sorta like a dream
No, better
(x10)
Sorta like a dream
Isn't it?
No
Sorta like a dream
No, better
(x2)
Throw bottles, throw bottles, throw bottles at your door
No morals, no morals, no morals anymore
No morals anymore
Throw bottles at your door
This place is amazing
No mo-, no mo-, no morals anymore
Throw bottles, throw bottles, throw bottles at your door
No, no, no morals anymore
Throw, throw, throw bottles at your door
Sorta like a dream
No, better
(x4)
Sorta like a dream
Isn't it?
No, better
