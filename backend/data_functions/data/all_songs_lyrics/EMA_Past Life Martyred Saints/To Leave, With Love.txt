To Leave, With Love LyricsAnd i know and i know
That i can't be free until i let go
And i know and i know
That i can't believe until i let go
But it's hard
To leave a bloody mess behind you on the floor
Walk out of that ramshackle door
With the holes in the walls that just won't close
With the mice and the rats and the baby you've known
Well it took me so long so low
But i see in the blood yeah and i see in real blood
On the walls
You gotta wake up it's time to go
You gotta wake up it's time to go
You've gotta wake up it's time it's past time
It's time to go
Well the holes in the walls didn't get me
And the --- night didn't get me
And the rats in the walls didn't get me
And the bad electricity
Didn't get me
Didn't get me
Well i shoulda walked out at any given time
Looking at what there was around me
What there was around me and i saw
The sign that i've seen it was
The sign i should've seen when
Your fist went through a plate glass window
And it was blood all over the walls
Blood all over the wall
Blood all over the wall
All over the wallsEmbed
