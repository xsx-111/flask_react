Marked Lyrics
My arms they are a
See through plastic
My arms are a secret
Bloodless, skinless mass
My arms they are a
See through plastic
They're a bloodless plastic
Skinless plastic
My arms they are
See-through plastic
They are glass
Don't you know that I would
Never hurt you
You are such a pretty thing
I know I wish sometimes just
So I could explain things
Explain things
I wish that every time he
Touched me left a mark
I fell down in the dark
Don't you start
I threw down for my love
I almost threw up on the spot
When you showed in the car
I almost threw up on the spot
And I want just to get it out
Get it out
I wish I had another hole to
Get out
These drugs they are making
Me so sad
I can't stop taking them
This night it is making me so sad
And if there was a way
To get it out
I wanna get it out
If there was a way
To get it out
I wanna get it outEmbed
