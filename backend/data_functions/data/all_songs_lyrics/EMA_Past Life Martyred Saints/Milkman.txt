Milkman LyricsDumb dumb
My lips are numb
My tongue is blazing
My tongue is plumb
Need you, come inside
I'm gasping
Your eyes
With your eyes
He's the milkman
He brings you your milk
He can see through
All your charms and still
I'm gasping
Comes at morning
He comes in the dawn
Eyes can see you
Barefoot on the lawn
He's the milkman
He knows what you do
Gives it to you
But I can see right through
I'm gaspingEmbed
