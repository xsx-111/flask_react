California LyricsFuck California
You made me boring
I bled all my blood out
But these red pants
They don't show that
My old friends though
They know that
And when I sold them
I sold that
I'm sorry Gracie girl
You're golden
I'm sorry Stephen and Andrew
That I ever left you
You’ve never seen the ocean
You’ve never been on a plane
Schizophrenia rules the brain
Aliens coming to take you away
You're still my favorite
Past Life Martyred Saint
Gimme the places
I'll give you the names
Wasted away
Alone on the plains
What's it like to be small-town and gay?
Fuck it baby
I know you'll never change
So hold me down but I got it
Quick hit to the face
Soft blow to the mouth
On Christmas morning
You're bleeding from the fingertips
You rubbed me raw
You rubbed me wrong
And I heave when I think of you
Oh! California
Now you've corrupted us all
With your sexuality
Tried to tell me love was free
Tried to tell me love was free
Us and them baby
You You You You You and Me
Oh Love! In the time of scandal
Love in the form of tragedy
Love so much so real
So fucked
It's 5150
But I'm just 22, I'm just 22 and
I don't mind dyin'
I don't mind dyin'
What does failure taste like?
To me it tastes like dirt
And I'm beggin’ you please
To look away
I bet my money on
The bob-tail nag
Somebody bet on the bay
I saw Joseph carrying the gun
I saw Mary carrying the gun
The Gun The Gun The Gun
The Gun carrying The Gun
I saw Grandpa
Carrying The Gun
I saw Grandma
Carrying The Gun
The Gun The Gun The Gun
The Gun carrying The Gun
I used to carry The Gun
The Gun The Gun The Gun
The Gun carrying The GunEmbed
