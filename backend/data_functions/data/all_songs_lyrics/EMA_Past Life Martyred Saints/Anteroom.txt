Anteroom LyricsI am in the room
I am in the anteroom
I can sense the
Ghost in the machine
No one has to shriek and
No one has to worry now
I will get exactly what's
Coming for me
Take it once
And I'll be fine
You know me
I'll be fine
Said he was a fag
But you know
He was was a pretty man
Don't you know they all
Look pretty to me?
Reach your finger out
And touch it while it's cold
No one left to see
And no one left to hold
Take it once
And I'll be fine
You know me
I'll be fine
If this time through
We don't get it right
I'll come back to you
In another life (x4)
I'll come back to you
In another life (x4)Embed
