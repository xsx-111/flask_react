Coda LyricsThey say love
Turns to rot
I'm gonna give him
All I got
When you showed up
At that spot
I almost threw up
On the spot
I wish I had
Another hole to get it out
These drugs
They are making me
So sad
And I can't stop taking them
And this night
It is making me so sad
And when I looked
On the computer
And it was just an emptiness
That made me want
To throw up on the spot
My armsEmbed
