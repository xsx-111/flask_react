Red Star LyricsA boy
A beautiful, beautiful boy
Eyes of green
Eyes of green
Mouth like the sun
Eyes of green
Eyes of green
Mouth burned my tongue
Like a red star
Like a red star
But his eyes were green
Got a strange fascination
I've been holding on the one
For that straight revelation
I've been holding on too long

But I'm sick of waiting
Round this birdhouse
For enough flesh wounds to make a kill
I know nothing lasts forever
If you won't love me
Someone will
Like a red star
Like a bruised scarEmbed
