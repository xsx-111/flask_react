The Grey Ship LyricsWhen you see that ship
It is the ship you can see
When the grey ship calls
It is a-callin’ for me
I thought it would come from
I thought it would come from
Further North than that
Blue sky is silver
Blue sky is grey
When the grey ship calls
I am a-leavin’ today
I thought it would come
I thought it would come

When you see that ship
It is the ship you can see
All of that callin’
Is a-callin’ for me
I thought it would come
I thought it would come from
I thought it would come from
Further North than that
(I hear a choir, I hear a symphony)
My mother with soft hands
My sister with none left
My best friend from long time
My mouth full of glass
(I hear a choir)
The strangers with wet hair
My old aunt a spinster
I feel all them, calming
I've run out of air
I hear a choir
I hear a symphony
I hear all them calling
The pearly gates
We've come all gone together
We've all gone to sleep

I hear a choir
I hear a symphony
Great grandmother
Lived on the prairie
Nothin’ and nothin’
And nothin’ and nothin’
I got the same feelin’
Inside of meEmbed
