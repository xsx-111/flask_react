Butterfly Knife LyricsYou were the goth in high school
You cut and fucked your arms up
You always talked about it
They thought you'd never do it
You had two pet rabbits
Named Mickey and Mallory
I been inside your bedroom
I got the same scars you see
You were the goth in high school
You cut and fucked your arms up
You always talked about it
They thought you'd never do it
But I knew I knew I knew
I knew someday ...
Night
Colors red beneath moonlight
C'mon look me in the eye
20 kisses with a butterfly knife
Child
Take the hair and turn it white
Kids beget kids tonight
We'll never tell
We'll never fight
Shy
Only God can make it right
In the desert underneath
The light it's
20 kisses with a butterfly knife
Take the hair and turn it white
Take the hair and turn it white
In the desert underneath
The light
20 kisses with a butterfly knifeEmbed
