Memories Lyrics
Pissing in plastic cups before we went on stage
Playing hackey sack back when Audioslave was still Rage
Watching all the freaky Dutch kids vomit then have sex
Listening to techno music on the bus while we earned our checks

Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again

Messing with the journalists and telling stupid lies
They had a feeling that something was up because of the look in our eyes
In fact, we didn't know what we were doing half of the time
We were so sure of ourselves and sure of our way through life

Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again

Now I got so many people that I got to look out for
Never know when I'll become awake and buy some food at the store
I can hear them babies crying and the lawn needs to be mowed
I got to get my groove on because I'm freaking bored!
Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again5Embed
