Trainwrecks Lyrics
We sleep all day and rock the night
We just get up to start another fight
We kiss and then we bite

We are trainwrecks

You don't keep house and I'm a slob
You're freaking out because I can't keep a job
We don't update our blogs

We are trainwrecks

People love to tell us what to do
That's just because they're jealous of me and you

We're digging through the couch for cash
We're taking cabs because both our cars are trashed
But we're still kicking ass

We are trainwrecks
Trainwrecks
We're still kicking ass

We are trainwrecks

We think it's uncool to be on time
Mooching off our friends is not a Federal crime

Someday we'll cut our critics down to size
And crash a Diddy party in disguise
We fall but then we rise

We are trainwrecks
Trainwrecks
That's the story of our lives
We are trainwrecks, trainwrecks
That's the story of our lives
We are trainwrecks3Embed
