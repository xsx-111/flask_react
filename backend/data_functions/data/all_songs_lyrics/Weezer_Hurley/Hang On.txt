Hang On Lyrics
Someday I'll be coming for you, you know what I'm wanting to do
I know the words to say to draw you in so close to me

Over and over, we swore it was over
But just like wild clover, love grows at light speed

Hang on until I see you again, I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end, so hang on
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)

This was just a very first start, there's more that I hold in my heart
I'm waiting for a chance to show you how I long to be

Over and over, we swore it was over
But just like I'm solar, you warm up to me

Hang on until I see you again, I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end, so hang on
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)
Hang on until the break of the day, we'll cast all our troubles away
You know that this isn't the end, so hang on
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)
Sweet thing, as long as I'm breathing
And my heart is still beating, I'm going to be coming for you
Hang on, hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on, hang on

Hang on until I see you again, I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end, so hang on
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)
Hang on until the break of the day, we'll cast all our troubles away
You know that this isn't the end, so hang on
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)

(Hang on) Hang on until I see you again
(Hang on) I'm going to be more than a friend
(Hang on) You know that this isn't the end so hang on
Hang onEmbed
