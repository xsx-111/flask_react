Unspoken Lyrics
Every morning, every day
I am hoping for the chance to get away
In the evening, every night
I am dreaming of a chance to make it right

Every chance that I get
I am placing a bet
On the sun in the sky

And if you take this away from me
I'll never forgive you, can't you see?
Our life will be broken
Our hate will be unspoken

I can feel those metal chains
And they're holding back the hope that keeps me sane
I can fight back, yes I can!
Because I'm strong enough to show you I'm a man

And I hate what you do
When your poison seeps through
And you're laughing at me
And if you take this away from me
I'll never forgive you, can't you see?
Our life will be broken
Our hate will be unspoken

Every chance that I get
I am placing a bet
On the sun in the sky
As it sets out of sight
And I hate what you do
When your poison seeps through
And you're laughing at me

And if you take this away from me
I'll never forgive you, can't you see?
Our life will be broken
Our hate will be unspoken
And if you take this away from me
I'll never forgive you, can't you see?
Our life will be broken
Our hate will be unspoken3Embed
