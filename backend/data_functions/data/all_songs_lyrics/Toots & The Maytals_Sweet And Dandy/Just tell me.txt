Just tell me LyricsJust tell me that you really love me true
Then I will know just what to do
Just tell me that you're in love with me
Just tell me that you really love me true
Then I will know just what to do
Just tell me that you're in love with me
And I will know that you want me dilligently
There is nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for you
There is nothing for you to pray to force me to do
Won't you tell me that you love me true
And I will know just what to do
Because I, I, I, I, I love you
Sing it again
