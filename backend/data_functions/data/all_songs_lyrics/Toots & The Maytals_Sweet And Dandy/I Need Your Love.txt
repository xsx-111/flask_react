I Need Your Love LyricsI heard them say you're going to leave
But I just don't know why
Somebody say you're gonna deceive someone
But I'm sure it couldn't be me
You take me by the hands
And lead me to the wonderland
Where love can be found
You should know why
You told me there will never be
No other one to hold me in your arms but you
You should know
Say that you love me
You love me, love me, love me baby
'Cause I, I need your love with me
Oh darling, yes I, I need your love with me
Darling! Your love I need
Just like I will lead a golden crown
Oh just because I know that
Your kisses keep me warm
In the time of winter
And also in the time of summer
Baby, maybe sharp light will be our secret place
And I'm sure there will be
No other way with dark, yeah
So why won't you just give up
All your love to me
And I will love you
Till the end of time, darling
You take me by the hands
And lead me to the wonderland
Where love can be found
You should know why
You told me there will never be
No other one to hold me in your arms but you
You should know
Say that you love me
You love me, love me, love me baby
'Cause I, I need your love with me
Oh darling, yes I, I need your love with me
I need your love, baby
I need it in the morning
And in the night, baby
I need your love..1Embed
