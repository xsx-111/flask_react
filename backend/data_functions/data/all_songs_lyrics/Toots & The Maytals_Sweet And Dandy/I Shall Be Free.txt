I Shall Be Free LyricsI know, oh yes, I know, I know, oh yes, I know, yeah
I'm going to live to see everyone free, free, free, free
I know, oh yes, I know, yeah, I know, oh yes, I know, yeah
I'm going to live to see everyone free, free, free
I read a Bible and I heard a song they sing
Oh Lord, I heard they're singing
They're singing Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Oh, but this is a little secret I know, I know that
So I got to tell you all that I know
I know, oh yes, I know, I know, oh yes, I know, yeah
I'm going to live to see everyone free
Oh yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, everyone shall be free, free, oh yeah, oh yeah
I says a faith can move mountains and love can set it free
Faith and love combined and that's the way we have to be
No one's from creation, it's each man's destination
True love and faith we all must have everyday
We will never grow old
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, everyone shall be free, free, free
Oh yeah, free, free, freeEmbed
