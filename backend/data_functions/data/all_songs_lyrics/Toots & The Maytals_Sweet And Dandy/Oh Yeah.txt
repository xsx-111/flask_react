Oh Yeah LyricsEverybody, give it to me, huh
Hey, hey, hey
I want you to believe every word I say
I want you to believe every thing I do
I said, "Music is what I've got to give
And I've got to find some way to make it
Music is what I've got, baby
I want you to come on and shake it"
Shake it, shake it, baby
Oh yeah, hey
Na na na
Oh yeah, na na na
Funky, funky, funky
Funky Kingston is what I've got for you, oh yeah
Funky Kingston, yeah, is what I've got for you
Funky Kingston, oh yeah
Lemme hear your funky guitar
Yo reggae
Hear the piano, stick it to me
Watch me now, you watch me now
Playing from east to west, yeah
I just play from north to south, yeah
I love black America
People keep on asking me for
Funky Kingston
But I ain't got none
Somebody take it away from meEmbed
