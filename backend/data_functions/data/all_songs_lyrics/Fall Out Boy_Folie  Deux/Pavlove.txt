Pavlove Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh

Something make my chest stir
Something make my head blur
Oh, oh, I'm not ready for a handshake with death, no
Oh, oh, I'm just such a happy mess, whoa

The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more

I'm the invisible man who can't stop staring
At the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me, so you can get
Get addicted to this, you can get, get addicted to this, now

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh

It's three drinks too late to
Talk to anyone but myself
Oh, oh, it's a three-and-two pitch to walk to anywhere
Oh, oh, else, no
The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more

I'm the invisible man who can't stop staring
At the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me, so you can get
Get addicted to this, you can get, get addicted to this, now

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh

I'm the invisible man who can't stop staring
(Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh)
At the mirror, at the mirror
(Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh)
I want to make you as lonely as me, so you can get
Get addicted to this, you can get, get addicted to this, now

I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible
I want to make you as lonely as me
Cause I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man17Embed
