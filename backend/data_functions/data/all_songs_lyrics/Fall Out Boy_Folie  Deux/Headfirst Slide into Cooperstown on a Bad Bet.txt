Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet Lyrics
Mr. Sandman showing his beam
When he walks into the room, the walls lean in to listen
Surfed-out brain waves flick back and forth like old headlights
Sniffing bottled glue again
Head like a steel trap, wish I didn't, I didn't
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't
I don't just want to be a footnote
In someone else's happiness

Does your husband know the way that
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?

But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar
This way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling, aww
Tempest in a teacup, get unique
Peroxide princess, shine like shark teeth
It's a sign (It's a sign), it's a sign (It's a sign)
It's a sign, what if you peaked early?

Does your husband know the way that
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
Does he, does he know the way
I worship our love?
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?

But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar
This way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling
Does your husband know? Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does he know? Does he know?
Does he know?

But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar
This way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through16Embed
