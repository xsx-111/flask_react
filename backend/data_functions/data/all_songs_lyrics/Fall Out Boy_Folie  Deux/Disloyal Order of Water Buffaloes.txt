Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes Lyrics
I'm coming apart at the seams
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams
Now buzz, buzz, buzz
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Doc, there's a hole where something was

Fell out of bed, butterfly bandage, but don't worry
You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry
Put him in the back of a squad car, restrain that man
He needs his head put through a CAT scan
Hey editor, I'm undeniable
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable

Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half-doomed, and you're semi-sweet

So boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy, ohh...)
Little girl, got me staring odd
Or was that just a telescopic camera nod
P-p-painted dolls in the highway, truck stop stalls
Lot lizards scales cool my nightlife moods
All the rookies, leave your badge and your gun on the desk
When you leave the room

I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half-doomed, and you're semi-sweet

Boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)

(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
So boycott love, boycott love...
(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
Boycott love, boycott love...
(Detox just to retox, detox just to retox)
So boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing)
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy, whoa...
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy...)
