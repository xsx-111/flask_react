West Coast Smoker Lyrics
Wishes bounce me weightless
The infrared scope on pointlessness
The bulls are sedated
And this fight's fixed
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats
Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right
The P.A. system keeps my heart, heart
Beating tonight, yeah...

Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

Come on in, the water's warm, come on like a sugar cube, but with A kick in the head like putting wings on lead
And your eyes are blocking my starlight
I'm the last of my kind and that's all that should matter t-t-to you
Follow the disorganized religion of my head and we'll
Never get through customs, let's just take off again instead
Got my degree in the gutter my heart broken in
The dorms of the Ivy League

Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck, huh!
I'm a n-n-nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck,  I'm a nervous wreck

Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset
(The drugs just make me reset)
Knock once for the father (for the father), twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

Three times, three times for the holy ghost
Three times, three times for the holy ghost!7Embed
