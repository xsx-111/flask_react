Wild Heart Lyrics
Something in my heart died last night
Just one more chip off an already broken heart
I think the heart broke long ago
That's when I needed you
When I needed you most
That's when I needed you
When I needed you most
I run around like a spirit in flight
Fearlessness is fearlessness
I will not forget this night
Dare my wild heart
Dare my wild heart

Where is the reason?
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on my wild heart
As do the seasons
You fought from the beginning
Long before I knew it
There was a danger
And the danger was to fall in love

In dark sorrow, they gaze down into the darkest heart
If I leave you
You say not even you can tear us apart, whoa
Say you're leaving
You say you don't even know how to start
How to start, how to start
Well, believe it then, and don't blame it on my soul
Blame it on my wild heart, ooh
On my wild heart, ooh
Fire on fire, rain on my face
Fever goes higher, what can you do?
Wild in the darkest places in your mind
That's where I needed you (Where I needed you)
Where I needed you most
That's where I needed you (I needed you)
Where I needed you most

Where is the reason?
Well don't blame it on me
Blame it on my wild heart
There is a reason why even the angels don't give it up at all
(Blame it on me, blame it on me)
Where are the children?
Well, are they hopelessly enchanted?
Blame it on the angels
(Blame it on me, blame it on me)
Where are the reasons?
Don't blame it on us (Blame it on me)
Blame it on our wild heart
Wild heart, wild heart, wild heart
On my wild heart
On my wild heart
Even in the darkest places of your mind
Even in the darkest places of your mind
Whoa, are the children, are they hopelessly enchanted?
Are the children, are they hopelessly enchanted?
Wild in the darkest places of your mind
Darkest places of your mind
No, don't blame it on me, baby
Blame it on my wild heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Blame it on my wild heart
Blame it on my wild heart (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Blame it on my wild heart (Baby, baby)
Blame it on my wild, wild, wild
Wild heart
Blame it on my wild heart
Even in the darkest places of your mind1Embed
