Enchanted Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4...

Crying in the morning, trying to be strong
Waiting for the spring to turn into the fall
Love don't mean what it says at all
And destiny says that I'm destined to fall

Enchanted
You thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted
It's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try

Why the sad face, oh, darling?
Was it my darkness shadow light?
I mean to cause no trouble for you
That is the story of my life

Enchanted
You thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted
It's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try
Enchanted
Woah, it's just a voice through the night
Enchanted
Well, I hope you make it
You were gone, you were gone from me
When I remember someone, I remember their dreams
In those dreams that no one knows of
My destiny says that I'm destined to run

Enchanted
You thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted
It's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try
Enchanted
Woah, it's just a voice through the night
Enchanted
Well, I hope you make it

Oh, enchanted
Well, I hope you make it
Woah, woah, woah
I hope you make it
Woah, woah, woah
I hope you make it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I hope you make it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I hope you make itEmbed
