Nothing Ever Changes Lyrics
If it's me that's driving you to this madness
There's just one thing that I'd like to say
Would you take a look at your life and your lovers?
Nothing ever changes
Ooh, it was just the first time that I ever played for you
I could be the dancer of your dreams

I can turn all your music on
I can make you feel alive
I am gone, but I'm never gone from you
It was just the first time

Come back, little boy
Baby, come back
Yeah, little boy

Ooh, it's just me that lies waiting
Well, it could come from anywhere
Oh, it could come straight, straight from my heart
Nothing can be saved here

I can turn all your music on
I can make you feel alive
I am gone, but I'm never gone from you
It was just the first time
Come back, little boy
Baby, come back
Yeah, little boy


Come back, little boy
Baby, come back, yeah
Little boy

Nothing ever changes, no, it doesn't
Nothing ever changes, ooh, you know it doesn't
Nothing ever changes, you know it doesn't
Nothing ever changes

Come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Come back, come back, come back, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back, yeah
Come back, come back, come back, come back, come backEmbed
