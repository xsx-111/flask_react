Nightbird Lyrics
And the summer became the fall
I was not ready for the winter
It makes no difference at all
'Cause I wear boots all summer long
My eye makeup, dark, and it's careless
Same circles around my eyes
Sometimes the real color of my skin
My eyes, without any shadow

And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
The ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight

The winter's really here now
And the blankets that I love
Sometimes I am surrounded by too much love

And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night
It's the ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight

And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night
It's the ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight
And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night

And the darkened eyes, through the net of the lace
In the darkness, it's hard to see her face
Pulls back the net
And you feel the touch  of her fingers
And you see she turns the eyes
And you see the eyes of a nightbird
The ones you dream of
Finally the night bird
Finally the night bird
TonightEmbed
