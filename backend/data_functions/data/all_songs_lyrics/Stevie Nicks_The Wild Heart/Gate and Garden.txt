Gate and Garden LyricsThere is a gate
It can be guarded
Well it is not heaven
And it has a garden
So to the red rose
Grows the passion
And the guardian...
Well it's now you know
It's just a few days...away
It's now you know
And it's then
It's just a game...that...we...play
Someone steals it...
Someone...steals it away
Scares you to death
You don't give in to yourself
You give in to your friends
Don't send an answer
How many times...have you said
Do I love you
Well I always did...everynight
Nobody knows...nothing 'bout it
Well it's now you know
It's everywhere
You say...you seek the truth
I say all is fair
Don't send an answer
How many times...
Have you said...
Do I love you...everynight
Well I always did
Nobody knows...nothin' 'bout it
Wo...do I love you
Well I always did...everynight
Nobody knows...nothin' 'bout it
They know nothing 'bout it
They know nothing' 'bout it...
Do I love you...Ooo
Wo...
Do I love you...Ooo
Do I love you...Ahh
Do I love you...OooEmbed
