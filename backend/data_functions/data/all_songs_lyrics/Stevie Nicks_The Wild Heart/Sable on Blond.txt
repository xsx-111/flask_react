Sable on Blond Lyrics
Learn to be a stranger
Blond on blond
In silence, she says, "Excalibur."
I beg of you now
What was it that fell?
Was it one fallen leaf, like the feather that it was?
Was it freedom by choice, or baby was it love?
Was it a thorn in your side?
Something that you hide
Something you don't touch because it hurts too much, ooh
Well, have you come to see that my face is not seen?
Ooh, outside my frost-covered windows

Oh, and just how deep do you hold that dream?
In your hands each night
This time
In your hands each night
This time

Oh, was it you I heard calling?
Which voice?
Well, I know that you are goin'
Which voice
Did I force you to remember in the sacred name of love?
Well to be brave, save the stranger
Sable on blond
Dark upon light
Because it hurts too much
Just how deep do you hold that dream?
In your hands each night
In your hands each night
Oh, in your hands each night

Ooh, what was it that fell?
Ooh, I beg of you now
What was it that fell

Well this time I think it was you, babe
Well, this time I think that it was you, babe, whoa, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, babyEmbed
