I Will Run to You LyricsOne so young so changed
Should not be left alone
Two in love should confess
And not be left alone
I will run to you
Down whatever road you choose
I will follow you down
I will run to you
You've had time come around
Will you please make up your mind
I stand accused on trial
Will you please make up your mind
I will run to you
Down whatever road you choose
I will follow you down
I will run to you
Make it easy for me
I been lonely baby
Show some mercy honey
I was nothing
All those lonely nights
Showed me something
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
I will run to you
Down whatever road you choose
I will follow you down
I will run to youEmbed
