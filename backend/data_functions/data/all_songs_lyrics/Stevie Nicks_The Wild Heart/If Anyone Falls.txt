If Anyone Falls Lyrics
I hear a voice in the room next to mine
Feels good, sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And then another voice comes through the door
I am dealing with a man
When away from me, stays deep inside my heart
And, he says, "If anyone falls in love, it will be one of us."

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls

And I heard someone say
As my eyes turned away, he said, "I have loved many women
I have many times run away."
Ooh, I have never known the words
Well, I have tried to be true
But I have never known what to say, how to say
Seen anything today
I've never seen anything like you

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls
So, I'm never gonna see you (Never gonna see you)
Deep inside my heart
But I see your shadow against, shadow against
Shadow against the wall
Baby, I see your shadow against the wall

I hear a voice in the room next to mine
Feels good, sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And then another voice comes through the door
Ooh, I am dealing with a man
When away from me, stays deep inside my heart
And, he says, "If anyone falls in love, it will be done to us."

If anyone falls in love (Anyone)
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind (Back of your mind)
If anyone falls
If anyone falls in love (It could be anyone)
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind (In the back of your mind)
If anyone fallsEmbed
