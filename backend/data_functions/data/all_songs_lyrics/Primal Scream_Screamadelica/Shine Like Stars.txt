Shine Like Stars Lyrics
I watch you sleep, you look so peaceful
You look so vulnerable, I feel scared for you

To me, you're precious, may you always

Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars

I watch you dance, you look so happy
Lost in the moment of abandon, you're set free

To me, you're precious, may you always

Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars

Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
