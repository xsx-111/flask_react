One Half LyricsI guess I was asleep that night
Was waiting far
I guess I was asleep that night
Was waiting far
I guess I was asleep that night
Was waiting far
I guess I was asleep that night
Was waiting far
I was waiting here
Come around me
I was waiting here
Come around me
I was waiting here
Come around me
I was waiting here
Come around me
I was waiting here
Come around me
I was waiting hereEmbed
