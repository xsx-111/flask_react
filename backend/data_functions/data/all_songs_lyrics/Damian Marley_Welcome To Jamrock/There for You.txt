There for You Lyrics
Tra la la...Tra la la...
La la la...la la

Hey!
Vexation of spirit is a waste of time
Negative thinking, don't you waste your thoughts
Verbal conflict is a waste of word
Physical conflict is a waste of flesh
People will always be who they want
And that's what really makes the world go round
Unconditional love is scarce
Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee
Now and forever more
Forever more, forever more
Yeah

You see, you gave precious life to me
So I live my life for you, you
You see, you've always been there for me
And so I'll be there for you, you
Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee

Bless your eyes and may your days be long
May you rise on the morning when His kingdom come
Good deeds aren't remembered in the hearts of men
Bless your eyes and may your dreams come true
May you rise on the morning when Jah kingdom come
Good deeds aren't remembered in the hearts of men
Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee
Now and forever more
Forever more, forever more
You see, you've always had faith in me
So I have faith in you, you
You see, you've always been there for me
And so I'll be there for you, you

Hey!
You've always been good to me
Even when I'm not good to myself
You've always been fair to me
Even when I'm not fair to myself
You've always done right by me
So I will do right by you, you
Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee
You've always been there for me, mama
So I'll be there for you, papa
You've always been fair to me, brother
And so I'll be fair to you, sister
You've always had faith in me
And so I'll have faith in you, you

You've always been good to me
You've always been to kind to me
You've always stood up for me
You've always been there for me
You've always been, oooh
You've always been, oooh
You always did care for me, yeah
You always did share with me, yeah
You always been true to me
And so I'll be true to you8Embed
