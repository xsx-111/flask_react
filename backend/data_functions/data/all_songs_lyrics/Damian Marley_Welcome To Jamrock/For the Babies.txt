For the Babies LyricsOh, no no, no
This is bad
This is real
Now I see them giving the woman abortion to kill another baby
Miscarriage and misfortune and premature crack baby
Strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will obey me
Future for the babies, hopes for the babies
Tomorrow for the babies, no sorrow for the babies
Babies having babies, raising our babies
All of these young ladies give them thanks and praises
How long can she take it?
Dreams are full of maybes Will she ever make it?
Hustles on a daily, in the club a shake it
Strip down 'til she naked, don't ever mistake it
Much too real to fake it, need it then she'll take it
She'll do it for the babies, a mother's love is sacred
Now you don't ever fail me
A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring…
Is there no other option than adoption for you babies
You're raffling and jacketing and auctioning your babies
Strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will obey me
Cowards play the game thing, Fathers do the brave thing
And that's participating
He keeps on concentrating
There is no debating
No running away thing
A new life is awakening
From his ejaculating
It's in the oven baking
Takes two for the making
He's right there through the cravings
And early morning waking
School and educating
Sports and recreating, Karate and ballet thing
Teenager of today thing
Fathers still relating, Still communicating
And they'll always embrace him
Cause they cannot replace him
A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
Cause they cannot replace him
A child needs loving, caring…
And always do your best to keep a promise to your babies
And if you can't be good at least be honest to your babies
The strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will obey me
History of the babies
Beginning of the ages
You're flipping through the pages
And up and through the 80's
Some are gang related, Drug affiliated
Some intoxicated
Headed for the snake pit
And Papa's locked in cages
And Mama's lacking wages
And this is what they're faced with
Upon a daily basis
Bleaching out dem faces
Running from dem races
Shooting up dem places
Killing other babies
As bitter as the taste is
And words cannot explain it
Just walk the narrow pavement
And speak of love not hatred1Embed
