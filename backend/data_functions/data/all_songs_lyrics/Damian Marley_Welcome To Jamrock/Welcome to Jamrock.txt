Welcome to Jamrock Lyrics
Out in the street, they call it murder

Welcome to Jamrock
Camp whe' the thugs dem camp at
Two pound a weed inna van back
It inna yuh hand bag, yuh nap sack
It inna yuh back pack
The smell a give yah girlfriend contact
Some bwoy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
'Cause Sandals ah no "Back-To"
Di thugs dem wi' do whe' dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't mek dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bear tuff thing come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block off traffic
Den dem wheel and pop-off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down and it a beat rapid
Police come inna jeep an' dem can't stop it
Some say dem ah playboy, a playboy rabbit
Get drop like a bad habit
So nuh bother pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the street, they call it murder

Welcome to Jamdown
Poor people a dead at random
Political violence, can't done
Bare ghost and Phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the king of kings ah call
Old man to pickney, so wave unno hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sick me
Dem suit nuh fit me
To win election dem trick we
Den dem don't do noting at all
Come on, let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most of the youths dem waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem tek the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Gloc, say dem a lock rocket
Dem wi full you up a current like ah shock socket
Dem wi run a road block which part the cops block it
And from now till a morning nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck-back ratchet
