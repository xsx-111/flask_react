All Night Lyrics
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right

Well now she call me on the phone and said she's home alone
And she want me to come over and make her house a home
Well I gave it to her once, and I liked how she responds
Well now I'm in trouble

Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right

It seems she need to oil her spine
Tell all a gyal toast bread can't build di putty gold mine
Need all di doctor fish with di essential slime
She tell me she want to signal the plane 'n time mi want slow wine
Turn on di HBO she want fi watch showtime
Give her di cordless microphone, she want di one with line
Seem like me and this young gyal ya just can't combine
So it's sour like lime
Running it down the line, Mr Muffin one time
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right
Said she wants my loving all night
When she get it she'll be all right

She call mi pon di I 95
How mi ah tek so long she ah wonder which car mi drive
Tired fi listen album now and she want me live
Tell me she want fi come knock her out till she can't revive
SO!Ah so my planet and the stars align
She tell me she want me know which part her hills and valley dem join
Seh she want me ride her like a Ferrari sign, put appointment aside
Nothing can't compromise fi di vibes I provide

It's alright
She wants my loving all night
When she get's it she's all right
She wants my loving all night, ay

I should make no physical contact
Tell her fi hold it down and still she just can't quiet
Seh mi take her up and tun her maniac, tellin me dat I compliment her natural habitat
WELL. . . It seem like she deaf or she blind
Want come step inna mi life when time she deh far behind
Want mi play her rhythm till di tape want rewind
And she nah watch no time
And she just nah resign
Till she see the sun shine2Embed
