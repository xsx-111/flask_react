Confrontation LyricsMr. President, Distinguished delegates...

''The security of the world
Those who disturb (terrorise) the peace at this time
We are going to describe them now''
Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of ONE LOVE
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars...
SELAH!

See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the sunday papers
Not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a Judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause
Dem inna dem churches tryin to save... saviours
Can we do it? We can do it, we shall do it!

Boom!
Tell dem fi nuh draw mi out when the world government inna falling out
Only few men survive crawling out
Run left him colleagues dem sprawling out
NEARLY DEAD!
Medic haffi haul him out
And gi him two tranquilizer fi stall him out
DEH PON BASE!
Can't get no calling out when him hear from the shout last week
Him mistress find a new shoes
Wife can't get no news and lately she starting to doubt
She still searching!
And the youth dem bawling out
Working hard not to let it all come out
Well it's not safe to go walk about
A slaughterhouse from Baghdad to Waterhouse
She start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
She start go out, start beat a darker stout
GUNS COME OUT!
Working people funds run out
Keep a show last week and no one come out
BOMBS COME OUT!
Mi gas tank just run out
BOMBOCLAAT!
The scotch tape just run out
WEED RUN OUT!
Yuh senses must dumb out, Mi have a pound round a back deh a gwan sun out
NAH COME OUT!
Till the chalice bun out
NAH COME OUT!
Till the malice bun out, A WAR!
Zimbabwe to Berlin Wall
Blazin' like a burnin' ball, loose ball...dat no work in war
Sleepin dat no work in war
Can't wear jheri curl in war
No diamond and pearl in war
Can't drink weh a serve in bar cah
Gas wi fuck up yuh nerves in war
Shot wi blood up yuh shirt in war
Can't go lift up no skirt in war
Now disease and germs in war
Can't go release your sperms in war
Stamina must preserve in war
Fire constantly burn in war
RED...IT RED...IT RED...IT RED...IT RED!

If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it...then you will die
You race of cowards, you race of imbeciles, you race of good for nothings!
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done
Then you yourself shall die!

See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the sunday papers
Not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a Judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause
Dem inna dem churches tryin to save... saviours
SEE IT DEH NOW...Hey!
Now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the skies over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up
Searching for the sign and the sign is us
Searching for the truth all you find is us
Searching for the troops still behind is us
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach killing boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you Tell-Lie-Vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up
And who calling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down...
Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl
Institute of the church in war
Preaching and researching war
Practice and rehearsing war
Teaching and dem learning war
Instigating and urging war
Always keep alert in war
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds in war
And the freaks and nerds in war
And the straight and curves in war
Forward and reverse in war
RED...IT RED...IT RED...IT RED...IT RED
