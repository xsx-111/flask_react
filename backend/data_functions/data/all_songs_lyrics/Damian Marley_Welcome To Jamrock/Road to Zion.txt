Road to Zion Lyrics
Yeah man
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there

In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety, boom

Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Raggamuffin sent to call me from di bush bungalow
Mi nuh watch it mek I clear out my voice now, Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Di hammer dem a slam and spectator getta low
Some bwoy could a big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Buss off trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi buss dem inna stereo, 'cause

I got to keep on walkin', on the road to Zion, man
Hey, we got to keep it burnin', on the road to Zion, man

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety
Single parents weh need some charity
Yutes weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan with any means and strategy, say

We got to keep on walkin', yeah
On the road to Zion, man, yeah
Been waitin' to do this track with you man
Yeah, ha ha, yeah yeah
You know, they know
You got to keep on walkin', yeah
On the road to Zion, man
You gotta keep walkin' y'all, yeah, yeah, you gotta keep

Sometimes, I can't help but feel helpless
I'm havin' daymares in daytime, wide awake, try to relate
This can't be happenin' like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin'
'Cause what I'm seein' is hauntin'
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holdin' guns to innocent bodies in Zimbabwe
They make John Pope seem Godly, sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime, I look back at paths I walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught
Prostitutes stomp in high-heel boots
And badges scream at young black children: "Stop, or I will shoot!"
I look back at cooked crack, plush cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison, trust that
So save me your sorries, I'm raisin' a army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley
We sparkin' the ions, marchin' to Zion
You know how Nas be, N.Y.C. state of mind I'm in
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety, boom

Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Ragamuffin sent to God before di bush bungalow
Mi nuh watch it mek I carry out my voice now figarow
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Di hammer dem a slam and spend day a dead now
Some bwoy could a big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Buss off trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi buss dem inna stereo, 'cause

I got to keep on walkin', on the road to Zion, man
Hey, we got to keep it burnin', on the road to Zion, man

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem tek yuh like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there!
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem tek yuh like food dem to goat
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there!
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know 'bout variety
Single parents weh need some charity
Yutes weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan with any means and strategy
Instead a broken dreams and tragedy
Yutes weh need some love and prosperity
Instead a broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan with any means and any strategy

Hey say
I got to keep on walkin', on the road to Zion, man
You know
You got to keep on walkin', on the road to Zion, man33Embed
