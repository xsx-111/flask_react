Hey Girl Lyrics
Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

She look so good in her clothes, she get dressed and roll
So much man a flay down, call the pest control
Confident princess, she address them bold
She nah manifest, fi dem sexual goal
She wish them the best, rasta bless them soul
Her mouth nah filthy, like nuh cess tank pool
Smarter than most intellectual fools
Weh spend dem time pon internet chat rooms

She said Jr. you're a genius
You think with your mind and not your peanuts
Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos
Drinking blue mountain cappuccinos
Well I seh baby you the cleanest
The true definition of what my queen is
Nothing coulda ever really come between us
Share the same room and Jah will feed us
Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

Why mi love fi all she's worth
Sitn' fi gwan she wi start it first
Wheel and pop off, supn' outta she purse
Whole heap a fool have to start disperse
Police ah come you see how fast she splurt
Can't find no sign of she khaki skirt
Light up the place like we spark there herbs
Love watch the way that she gwan
When a big tune a play pon the dance-hall set
Selector rewind every chance dem get
The rhythm design fi she dance and sweat
All when morning a shine she nuh start dance yet
Man clear the line when she walk and sweat
But she nah pay no mind to remarks dem mek
Always on time tek a chance and bet
She's a fine piece of mind with the right mindset
She said Jr. you're a genius
You think with your mind and not your peanuts
Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos
Drinking blue mountain cappuccinos
Well I seh baby you the cleanest
The true definition of what my queen is
Nothing coulda ever really come between us
Share the same room and Jah will feed us

Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

So Boom!
Animal you never know from you born place
You only see when travel channel tun on
Our means of trans-p is when the camel run on
Camouflage and fatigue is our style and fashion
"Fliminitti" weh she have and that is the attraction
What she want is what she get and that is satisfaction
Well she want it all night and not jus fi a fraction
Well too much long talking now a time fi action
Well she love fi spend money but she rather spend time
And if mi gone fi ten minutes, then she call me ten time
If mi nuh pick up then she panic then she panic then she call mi friend line
Cause she want the veteran fi come and bend up her spine
A substantial amount of african fly squat
I have to sip a roots and bun a one night cap
And she love the veteran him always hit the right spot
And the way she feel so good I have to bounce right back
Hey Girl
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey Boy
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside5Embed
