Beautiful Lyrics
And me and she we trampoose alot, several mornings she shampoos my locks
Always have my back she standing true to dat real type of loving, thank you for that
Yow. . . Run barefoot without no shoes and socks, cause she keep herself clean mi nah go catch no rash
And she love me for real mi nuh haffi have no cash, and any little thing from mi splish mi splash
Yow. . . All this blinging it's like you forgot, use cheddar as the bait den you recruit a rat
So we listen couple speech of Martin Luther chat
Dennis Brown, Bob Marley and some Super Cat
Yow. . . seem like she liveupside the duko shop, cause she don't have a scratch it's only beauty spot
When one duty start it's when one duty stop, one nine to five, one five to twelve o'clock
You see me

Beautiful, Here we go again
My love, you know, I will never let you go
My love, beautiful. Here we go

And I remember when we met and we began dating, and everything was copacet' and we began mating
And the way then the way mi love her good, she gimme don ratings
Because mi style dem plentiful and ah nuh one way thing
And she get her belly full and ah nuh pot scrapings, and the closer we become the more she gravitating
Until we buckle down and there is no escaping
Now it typically become an everyday thing, regulary physically communitcating
Sexually, scientifically penetrating, until she start spiritually resonating
Ah so mi know she real and seh she ah nuh play thing
She is the only Queen the King is desognating, I know it's kinda deep but keep on concentrating
Cause jazzy lay di beat and I am clearly stating
Beautiful, Here we go again
My love, you know, I will never let you go
My love, beautiful. Here we go

And me and she we trampoose alot, several mornings she shampoos my locks
Always have my back she standing true to dat mi ya da general I'mma chew for that
Yow. . . Run barefoot without no shoes and socks, cause she keep herself clean mi nah go catch no rash
And she love me for real mi nuh haffi have no cash, and any little thing from mi splish mi splash
Yow. . . All this blinging it's like you forgot, use cheddar as the bait den you recruit a rat
So we listen couple speech of Martin Luther chat
Dennis Brown, Bob Marley and some Super Cat
Yow. . . seem like she liveupside the duko shop, cause she don't have a scratch it's only beauty spot
When one duty start it's when one duty stop, one nine to five, one five to twelve o'clock
You see me

Beautiful, Here we go again
My love, you know, I will never let you go
My love, beautiful. Here we go7Embed
