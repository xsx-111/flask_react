Carnal Mind Lyrics
Zion
Holy mount Zion
Zion

Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire, fire
Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire

Me say dash your badness, and your bad mind
The carnal mind, have to stay behind
So honor your mamma and your father
Or else your days will feel longer

Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire, fire
Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire

Oh, when me constantly can’t, then
You can’t go to Zion with no carnal mind
Carnal mind have to be left back behind
You can’t go to Zion with no chain and ring
Your chain and ring have to go to the mountain
You can’t go to Zion with no portable phone
Portable phone have to be left back a Rome
You can’t go to Zion with no big rusty nine
Your big rusty nine have to be left back behind
Emperor Selassie so pure and divine
Empress Omega splendid all the time
Look into the scripture and see what you find
Look at the Revelations Chapters five verse five
Same root of David is Salomon line
Salomon seed, and Salomon Spine
Of ancient receipts of cure rude swine
And come down the humans say one more time

Owww, the prophet has raised again, awww
Owww, the prophet has raised again, awww

Ah when me constantly can’t then you can’t go to Zion with no carnal mind
Carnal mind have to be left back behind
Can’t go to Zion with no chain and ring
Your chain and ring have to go to the mountain
You can’t go to Zion with no portable phone
Portable phone have to be left back a Rome
You can’t go to Zion with no big 45
Your big 45 have to be left back behind

The eagle and the bear and all the dragon combined
Implied jizabell, and them Grow concubine
Can’t see the truth them must be blind, them blind
Just read about the news in Revelations Nine
And tell me how you feel about the black star line
You better pack your bag for a mountain climb
And all of them playaz and still them rewind
You walk with your nine keep one thing in mind
Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire, fire
Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire

You see, no either 
And make your life more comfortable
Chapter a day, keep all evil away
And listen to the prophet and hear what him say

Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire, fire
Better to go to Zion
More then burn in a fire

You can’t go to Zion with no carnal mind
Your carnal mind have to be left back behind
You can’t go to Zion with no chain and no ring
Chain and ring have to go to the mountain
You can’t go to Zion with no portable phone
Portable phone have to be left back at home
You can’t go to Zion with no big rusty nine
Your big rusty nine have to be left back behind
Give me the microphone and burn down Rome
And all of them Churches which cast them stone
And fight against the lion of the royal throne
And  danger zone
The world become a graveyard of skulls and bones
And mount Zion is the the safest crown
Upon a holy mountain the city was found
That’s where the  choice to wear them crown

Owww, the prophet has rised again, awww
Owww, the prophet has rised again, awwwEmbed
