Black Cat Bone LyricsI b’lieve my ol’ lady she done found my black cat bone
You know, I b’lieve my ol’ lady she done found my black cat bone
I got a funny feelin’ that, uh, somethin’s goin’ on wrong
Leave home soon in the mornin’, she walks the streets ‘til late at night
Leave home soon in the mornin’, she walks the streets ‘til late at night
When she come home in the evenin’, don’t do a doggone thing but fight
I called the operator, went ridin’ around the town
Get my business straight, find out what in the world she’s doin’ now
B’lieve my baby she done found my black cat bone
Got a funny feelin’ that, uh, somethin’s goin’ on wrong
You know my woman treats me like I was a doggone slave
You know my baby treats me like I was a doggone slave
Girl must be tired of livin’, gonna put her six feet in her grave
Y’know I’m gonna make it up to Memphis, man, and get my hambone boiled
Been layin’ ‘round here in Leland ‘til my hambone done spoiled
Gonna make it to Memphis, man, and get my hambone boiled
I done laid around here in Leland, Mississippi ‘til my little hambone done spoiled
Man, I b’lieve my ol’ lady she done found my black cat bone
I b’lieve my baby she done, Lord, found my black cat bone
Got a funny feelin’ that, uh, somethin’s goin’ on wrongEmbed
