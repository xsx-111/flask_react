Forty-Four LyricsI wore my 44 so long,it makes my shoulder sore
I wore my 44 so long,it makes my shoulder sore
I want my baby so bad-
I'm gonna tell that woman so
You know I work all night, my troubles all get in my head
You know I work all night, only trouble in my head
But when I'm by my woman, my troubles get worse instead
Well I'm so mad this morning, I don't know which way the wind will go
You know I'm so mad this morning, don't know which way the wind will go
You know I'm bleedin' in my soul, gonna let my woman goEmbed
