I Got Love If You Want It LyricsI got love if you want it baby
I got love if you want it
I got love if you want it
I got love if you want it
I got love if you want it
You just wait a little while
Quit teasing me baby
Quit teasing me baby
With your sly round frame
With your sly round frame
Let me love you, love you baby
I'll be your loving man
I'll be your loving man
Try my next door baby
Try my next door baby
If you can do things right
If you can do things right
Don't worry nobody
Then it's already time
Then it's already time
I love you little woman
I love you little woman
Wanna let it do myself
Wanna let it do myself
That you mistreat me baby
Love from someone else
Love from someone else
I love you little woman
I love you little woman
With my head hung down
With my head hung down
I know you'll be gone darling
Talk all over town
Talk all over townEmbed
