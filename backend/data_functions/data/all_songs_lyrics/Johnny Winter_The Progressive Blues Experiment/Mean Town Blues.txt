Mean Town Blues LyricsLord my mother she done told me and my
Father done told me
Grandfather told me too
My mother she done told me
And my father done told me
Grandfather told me too
It's a mean old town to live in by yourself
Yeah, I worked for a dollar could not
Save a lousy
Could not save a dime
You know I worked for a dollar could not
Save a lousy
Could not save a dime
Ain't nobody worried, man, ain't nobody crying
Everybody's got a hand out trying to
Get a hold on
Trying to get some of my cash
Everybody's got a hand out trying to
Get a hold on
Trying to get some of my cash
Smiling great big smiles, man, keep on talking trash
You know I packed up my suitcase and I
Moved on down the
Hit that lonesome road
You know I packed up my suitcase and I
Moved on down the
Hit that lonesome road
I'm still trying to make it, man, when the day is doneEmbed
