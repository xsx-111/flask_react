Help Me LyricsYou gotta help me darling, I can't make it all by myself
You gotta me baby, I can't do it by myself
If you don't help me little girl, I gotta use somebody else
You might have to curse, you have to swear, you might have to disturb
You might have to rock and roll but you gotta help me darling
I can't make it all by myself, if you don't help me little girl, I gotta find somebody else
You might have to curse, you have to swear, you might have to disturb
You might have to rock and roll but you gotta help me darling
I can't make it all by myself, if you don't help me little girl, I gotta find somebody else
Hey baby put your morning gown, woah baby put on your morning gown
I'm so sleepy little girl but I feel like lying downEmbed
