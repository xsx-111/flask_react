Bad Luck and Trouble LyricsI believe that bad luck and trouble, man is all that joins us
I mean that bad luck and trouble, people that's all that joins us
When my bad luck quit me, Lord my trouble just began
I'm travelin' the highway, since I was a child
Nobody see no woman man, nobody seems to care
Bad luck and trouble, man is all that joins us
When my bad luck quit me, man my trouble just began
Lord I'm sittin' down and thinkin', man I'm a long, long way from home
Just sittin' down and thinkin, man I'm a long, long way from home
Think about all my good times lord and my friends all want to know
They never hurt nobody, they never done nobody wrong
Other people won't accept me they say man leave me alone
Sittin' down and thinkin', Lord I'm a long long way from home
Thinkin' about my good times, man and my friends all want to know
Yeah
Man ain't nobody has this trouble, I gonna tell nobody else
Nobody else has this trouble, man ain't gonna tell nobody else
My whole life I'm livin' baby, gonna make it by myselfEmbed
