Leaving So Soon? Lyrics
You must think I'm a fool
So prosaic and awkward and all
Do you think you've got me down?
Do you think I've never been out of this town?
Do I seem too eager to please to you now?
You don't know me at all
I can't turn it on, turn it off like you now
No, I'm not like you

Now, now you're here
I bet you're wishing you could disappear
I'm trying to be kind
I get the feeling you're just killing time
You look down at me, don't you look down at me now
You don't know me at all
A slap in the face, in the face for you now
Just might do now

You're leaving so soon?
Never had a chance to bloom
But you were so quick to change your tune
Don't look back
If I'm a weight around your neck
Cause if you don't need me
I don't need you
If I don't need you

Leaving so soon, soon?
Leaving, leaving so soon?

You're leaving so soon?
Never had a chance to bloom
But you were so quick to change your tune
Don't look back
If I'm a weight around your neck
Cause if you don't need me
Then I don't need youEmbed
