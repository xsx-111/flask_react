Crystal Ball Lyrics
Who is the man I see
Where I'm supposed to be?
I lost my heart, I buried it too deep
Under the iron sea

Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall

Lines ever more unclear
Not sure I'm even here
The more I look, the more I think that I'm
Starting to disappear

Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong
I don't know where I am
And I don't really care
I look myself in the eye
There's no one there
I fall upon the earth
I call upon the air
But all I get is the same old vacant stare

Oh crystal ball, crystal ball save us all
Tell me life is beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Oh crystal ball hear my song
I'm fading out
Everything I know is wrong
So put me where I belong
