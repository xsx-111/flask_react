Try Again Lyrics
I fell asleep on a late night train
I missed my stop and I went round again
Why would I wanna see you now?
To fix it up, make it up somehow

Baby, I'll try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time

What I was isn't what I am
I'd change back, but I don't know if I can

Still I'll try, try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time

But I was made the way I am
I'm not a stone; I'm just a man
Lay down your arms and I will lay down mine
Rip back the time that we've been wasting

God, I wish you could see me now
You'd pick me up and you'd sort me out
Baby, I'll try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time2Embed
