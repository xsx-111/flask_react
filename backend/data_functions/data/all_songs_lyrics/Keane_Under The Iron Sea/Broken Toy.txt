Broken Toy Lyrics

I think you know because it's old news
The people you love are hard to find
So I think if I were in your shoes
I would be kind

I look out for you
Come rain, come shine
What good does it do?
I guess I'm a toy that is broken
I guess we're just older now

I want to stay another season
See summer upon this sorry land
So don't dust off your gun
Without a reason you understand

I look out for you
Come rain, come shine
What good does it do?
I guess I'm a toy that is broken
I guess we're just older now
Who says a river can't leave its waters?
Who says you walk in a line?
Who says a city can't change its borders?
Who says you're mine?

Oh
Ooh
Ah
Ooh
Ah

I look out for you
Come rain, come shine
What good does it do?
I guess I'm a record you're tired of
I guess we're just older now
I guess I'm a toy that is broken
I guess we're just older now
