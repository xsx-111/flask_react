Atlantic Lyrics

I hope all my days
Will be lit by your face
I hope all the years
Will hold tight our promises
I don't wanna be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home
I don't wanna be old and feel afraid
I don't wanna be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home
I don't wanna be old and feel afraid

And if I need anything at all
(Ooh! Ah! Ooh!)
I need a place that's hidden in the deep
Where lonely angels sing you to your sleep
Though all the world is broken
I need a place where I can make my bed
A lover's lap where I can lay my head
Cause now the room is spinning
The day's beginning1Embed
