Beautiful Child Lyrics
These are the things I hold onto
These are the things I use to deceive myself
I line them up in front of me
I judge them carefully
Then I throw them all away
I throw them all away
I am a small man
I am not a dangerous man

I love a child, I love a beautiful child
I love a beautiful idea

I will hold this child in my arms
I will caress his soft head
Listen to him cry, listen to him cry

I could kill the child, I could kill the child
The beautiful child, the beautiful child
The beautiful child

This is my life
This is my choice
This is my damnation
This is my only regret
This is my life
This is my life
This is my sacrifice
This is my sacrifice
This is my life
This is my damnation
This is my only regret
That I ever was born
This is my only regret
That I ever was born
This is my sacrifice
This is my life
What a beautiful idea
This is my regret
Get out of my headEmbed
