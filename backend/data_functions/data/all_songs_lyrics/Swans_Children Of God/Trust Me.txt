Trust Me Lyrics
Because I love you
I give you this
Don't be afraid of this
You can trust me now
Though we will deceive ourselves
You can trust me now
You can trust me now
Don't be afraid of this
It's not unusual
It's not unusual
Because I love you
You can trust me now
You can not trust me now
You will never know
You can trust me now
It's not unusual
It's not unusual
You can trust me now
You can not trust me now
You can not trust me now
Oh, ohEmbed
