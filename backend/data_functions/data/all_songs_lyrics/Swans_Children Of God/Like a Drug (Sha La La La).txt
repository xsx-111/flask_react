Like a Drug (Sha La La La) Lyrics
Out of our head, out of our mind
Into your hands, into your eye
Warm in your mouth, warm in your mind
Warm in your belly, just like a drug

Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Cool on your tongue, soft in your hands
Down on the floor, red in your mind
Out of our head, out of our mind
Into your head, just like a drug

Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Hard in your hands, hard in your mind
Hard in your belly, hard in your face
Down on the floor, hard in your mind
Into your head, just like a drug
Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la laEmbed
