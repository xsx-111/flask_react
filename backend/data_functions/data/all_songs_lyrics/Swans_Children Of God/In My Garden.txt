In My Garden Lyrics
In my garden
Things grow in my garden
Things will grow
Then they die
Then they fall away, fall away
Then they're gone

In my garden
In my garden
We'll never grow old
We'll never grow old

In my garden
Where the dew never dries
In my garden
In my garden
These roses
These black orchids are our friends
In my garden
When we breathe
When we breathe this air
We will breathe in these things
We will breathe in these things
In my garden
In my garden
We'll never die
We will never die
In my garden
In my garden1Embed
