New Mind Lyrics
In the place where
No one knows
Where they were before
Or what they're doing where
They are now
I will be there
With my eyes wide open

I will be there
I will be there
I will be ready
To receive
The new mind
The new mind

Now I am a man
Now I am a man
But I'm nothing now
And God is mine
Yeah God is mine
Yeah my sin is me
And God is mine
Now I am ready
Now I am ready
Now I am ready
To receive
The new mind
The new mind

Now people get ready
Now people get ready
The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
I will be there
I will be there
When he calls my number I will be there

Let the light come in
Damn you to hell
Let the light come in
Damn you to hell
Let the light come in
Damn you to hell
Let the light come in
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soulEmbed
