Our Love Lies Lyrics
We'll fall down
On broken knees
And we'll cry for you now
We'll cry for your mercy

We believe in love, we believe in love
God save us now, we believe in love

We degrade ourselves
But we dig our own grave
Jesus Christ the Lord
Save us now

We believe in love, we believe in love
God save us now, we believe in love

You said all of my life
Would be in vain
If I gave up on anything
I knew to be true
Or a provable lie
So I believe in love, I believe in love
God save us now, I believe in love

So I open the door
And there, there they lie
Twisted and misshapen
They suffer for love
And they're sick to death
Of the dreams they used to have
And they're sick to death
Of their beautiful lie

God save us now, God save us now
God save us, please, save us now
We believe in love, we believe in love
God save us now, we believe in love
God save us, please1Embed
