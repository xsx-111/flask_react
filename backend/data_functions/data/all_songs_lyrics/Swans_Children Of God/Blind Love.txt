Blind Love Lyrics
Hold onto my hand
Hold onto my unborn hand
Feel what I'll never be
Need me badly
Need what I have
Need what I am
I am a dead man
Now I am a dead man
I am selfish
I am unborn
I am unborn now
I am unborn
Need my love
Need my fake love
Hold onto my hand
Hold onto my unborn hand
Need what I make you become

Blind love
Blind love

I am a dead man
I am a cold dead man
And I am unkind
And I am unkind
Feel my hand
Feel my dead hand
Need my love
Need my blind love

Love blind
Blind love
Feel good
Feel good now
Love
NowEmbed
