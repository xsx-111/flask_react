Blood and Honey Lyrics
I found you lying where I drowned you
I found you lying where I lay with you
Where I threw you in the water
Where I drowned you in the river
Where I watched you roll away
Where I watched your body roll away
Roll away, roll away from everything we think we know
Oh, oh, oh, oh

We'll lie down in the warm green grass
And the sun will shine on your pale shape
Our blood will flow black in the dirt
And a black rose will grow where we laidEmbed
