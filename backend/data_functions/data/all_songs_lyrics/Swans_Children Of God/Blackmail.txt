Blackmail Lyrics
Close your eyes, close your eyes
Say the word I want to hear
Say the word I want to hear

Come up behind me and hold on
Come up behind me and hold on

Close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes and close in around me
Say you'll do anything for me
Say you'll do anything for me
Say you'll do what you don't understand

Close your eyes, close your eyes
Come all around me and hold on

I'll be your body when your body is broken1Embed
