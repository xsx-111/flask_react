Real Love Lyrics
My man walks on hands and knees
I am his first and only child
I am his only true love
I am his only real love
He is mine
He is my saint
He brings me roses and incense
And he closes my mind
Yes, he closes my mind

With real love, real love
Real love, real love

I will kiss the ground
Where he left a taste
Of his strength of mind
Take me down
Take me down now
Take me down
Into the cold dead earth
Take me down
Take me down
In your hands again
Take me down
Take me down
With real love, real love
Real love, real love, oh

When I dream that sweet dream
When I forget where I am
I will always remember
Your hand on my shoulder
Pulling me down
Pulling me down
Into the cold dead earth
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down there
With real love, now

Real love, real love
Real love, real love
Real love, real love
Real love, real love, oh1Embed
