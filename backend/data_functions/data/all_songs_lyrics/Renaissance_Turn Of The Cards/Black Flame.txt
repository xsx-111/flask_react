Black Flame LyricsI am words I am speaking
I never heard my conclusion
Lost the way in my confusion, in illusion
Lost inside the picture frame
I'm not to blame; I didn't see the black flame
I'm not ashamed; it's poetry, the black flame
I'm rearranged; it's changing me, the black flame
Burns my blackened brain
I am strong, I am leaving
I never knew I'd feel the need so
Where to go, I'll turn the flow, I could not know
Screams inside the burning pain
It's spinning head, it's underhand--the black flame
It lies instead, I turned and I ran--the black flame
On me it fed; I understand the black flame
Burns my blackened brain
Run from me; don't you see
That we are one and I'm a part of you?
Get away, any way
I'm still a secret in the heart of you
And I'm the burning in your soul
Now I am weak, I am losing
I never thought I'd stop trying
I'm a lie, I'm just a sigh, just a crying
Just a symbol of the game
Suspended pain, I cannot face the black flame
Intended fear, I cannot trace the black flame
Extended reaching into space--the black flame
Burns my blackened brainEmbed
