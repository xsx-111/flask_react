I Think of You LyricsI love you like a stream
Flows restless to the sea
See you like the mist
Touches clouds, touches me
See you in the stars
Whereever you may be
I think of you
Think of you
If ever you're near
And have some time to spend
I love you every way
Love you like a friend
And then when you leave
A whisper in my mind
I think of you
Think of you
When I see a bird
Fly over to the sea
And the sun in the sky
Is shining warm and free
And when I feel the wind
Blow cool over me
I think of you
Think of youEmbed
