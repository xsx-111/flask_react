Cold Is Being LyricsSo cold is being lonely
Behold the feeling lonely
The living part is done
The dying has begun
The world is spinning slow
So tired slow
So cold is being sadness
Behold the feeling sadness
Oh how can we believe
We earn what we receive
The pain it overflows
Overflows
Lord won't you help us realize
See it through your eyes
Within our minds
The earth grows old
The earth grows cold
So cold is being tired
Behold the feeling tired
Stand quietly at the side
Watch darkness open wide
The light is growing dim
So dim
WithinEmbed
