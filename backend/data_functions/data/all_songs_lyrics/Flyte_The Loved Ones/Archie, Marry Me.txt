Archie, Marry Me Lyrics
You''ve expressed explicitly
Your contempt for matrimony
You've student loans to pay
You will not risk the alimony
We spent our days locked in a room
Content inside a bubble
And in the nighttime we go out
And scour the streets for trouble

Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie

During the summer take me
Sailing out on the Atlantic
I won't set my sights on other seas
There is no need to panic
So honey take me by the hand
And we can sign some papers
Forget the invitations
Floral arrangements and bread makers
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie

Too late to go out
Too young to stay in
They're talking about
Us living in sin

Hey, hey, marry me, Archie
Hey, hey, marry me, Archie1Embed
