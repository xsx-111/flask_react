Cathy Come Home Lyrics
Maybe you’re right
We’re holding on too tight
It’s hard to say
There’s no right or wrong way
To love your child
It’s rooted in denial
Entangled wire and codependence

Cathy come home for supper
Cathy he doesn’t love you
Cathy we know you’re a dreamer
Your Daddy’s bad back, he needs you
Tell us about that suntan
Tell us all about that bruise on your arm
Oh, Cathy come home

This boy of yours
Who throws you to the floor
His car’s outside
And he’s banging at our door
The baby’s dos
And this time you’re gonna keep him
Your life, your choice
Your happy ending
Cathy come home for supper
Cathy he doesn’t love you
Cathy we know you’re a dreamer
Your Daddy’s bad back, he needs you
Tell us about that suntan
Tell us all about that bruise on your arm
Oh, Cathy come home


Cathy come home for supper
Cathy he doesn’t love you
Cathy we know you’re a dreamer
So tell us about that suntan
Tell us all about that bruise on your arm
Oh, Cathy come home3Embed
