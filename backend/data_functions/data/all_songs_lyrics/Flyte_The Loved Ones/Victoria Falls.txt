Victoria Falls LyricsShe floats
On forever
She keeps you
On the phone
She breaks
On the water
She sinks into your sofa
Like a stone
Oh when Victoria falls
No one knows
How low she goes
When Victoria falls
No one knows
How low she goes
She laughs
Like she means it
She sleeps
Behind closed doors
She skims
On the surface
She pirouettes
Across your kitchen floor
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
Overflow
When Victoria falls
No one knows
How low she goes
When Victoria falls
No one knows
How low she goes
When Victoria falls
No one knows
How low she goes
When Victoria falls
No one knows
How low she goes1Embed
