Orphans of the Storm Lyrics
Orphans of the storm, watch them sail between the waves
Orphans of the storm, say a prayer and wish the rain away
Mother's milk and angel hair, holy books and bones
The sirens on the shore calling them home
Breakfast on the lawn in the sweet September sway
Helpless and forlorn since the pills and powders passed their way

Lost themselves, forever seeking, searching pole to pole
While the needle and the thread stitches them whole

Empty shells, only the shallow know themselves
Deeper and deeper, day by day, to keep the weary world at bay
No prescription for the pain only a sky of blue and grey
No one to save them, sailing their sinking ships up and away

We lost ourselves, forever seeking, searching pole to pole
While the needle and the thread stitches us whole again

Empty shells, only the shallow know themselves
Deeper and deeper, day by day, to keep the weary world at bay
Raise your mast and fly away into a sky of blue and grey
No one to save us, sailing our sinking ships up and away
Sailing our sinking ships up and away
Sailing our sinking ships up and awayEmbed
