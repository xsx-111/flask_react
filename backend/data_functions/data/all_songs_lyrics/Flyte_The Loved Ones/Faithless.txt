Faithless Lyrics
How does it feel
Standing apart from all of the rest
How does it feel
Cutting the line in that low cut dress
No one really knows you
And no one shares your pain

I'll be there when you break their hearts
And I'll be there when you play your part
And I'll be there when they reel you in
And I'll be there when they clip your wings

And leave you faithless
Faithless
And leave you faithless
Faithless

And how does it feel
With no escape from the crowd as you walk down the street
And how does it feel
To no longer belong, to be so far out of reach
Just put the names with the faces
And learn to play the game
And I'll be there in my Sunday best
I'll be there, stood with all the rest
And I'll be there when they reel you in
And I'll be there when they clip your wings

And leave you faithless
Faithless
And leave you faithless
Faithless

And I'll be there when you break their hearts
And I'll be there when you play your part
And I'll be there to leave you faithless1Embed
