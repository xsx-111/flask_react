Sliding Doors LyricsIf I'd caught that train before it pulled out
Who knows, it really might have worked out
My Beretta held steady
I'm just about ready to blow
And for one split second
I think about ending it all
From the twenty-fifth floor
Behind sliding doors
Behind sliding doors
And if I'd chosen any other cafe
It would all change in the blinking of a blind eye
My Beretta held steady
I'm just about ready to blow
And for one split second
I think about ending it all
From the twenty-fifth floor
Behind sliding doors
Behind sliding doors
The rain on the carpet, your coat on the bed
You say you been here before
And you don't have the patience to stay with me anymore
Behind sliding doors
Behind sliding doorsEmbed
