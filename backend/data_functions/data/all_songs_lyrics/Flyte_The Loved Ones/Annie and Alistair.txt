Annie and Alistair LyricsThree pills in weekly compartments
How do three fill a one room apartment?
As we cast our vote
You light roll up under your coat
Spare time, amateur dramatics
From an old script we found in the attic
As we learn our lines
We're living it a day at a time
Sundays and Mondays with Annie and Alistair
Top of the twelfth step, a cross on the calendar
Steady and sober, talking it over, are we all right now?
Late night, a comedy open mic
We head for the glow of the exit light
And miss the joke
Downing our Bacardis and Cokes
Sundays and Mondays with Annie and Alistair
Top of the twelfth step, we fall off the banister
Steady and sober, talking it over, are we all right now?
And I thought I could help it, I thought I could hold it down
No one was closer to making the final round
Sat in a circle, a note in the journal, are we alright now?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Alright now
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Alright now
Cross, dress, a face in the mirror ball
A hot mess, a rave in the dinner hall
We'll rise up and over the houses
And we won't look downEmbed
