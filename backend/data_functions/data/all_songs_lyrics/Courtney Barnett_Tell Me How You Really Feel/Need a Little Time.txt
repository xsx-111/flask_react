Need a Little Time Lyrics
I don't know a lot about you, but
You seem to know a lot about me, so
I take a little time out
I take a little time out
I'm sorry that I lost my patience
You deserve better, it's true
I need a little time out
I need a little time out

From me (me, me, me)
And you (ooh)
You (ooh)

Open up your insides, show us
Your innermost lecherous
I'll rip it out carefully
I promise you won't feel a thing
Everybody wants to have their say
Forever waiting for some car crash
I need a little time out
I need a little time out

From me (me, me, me)
And you (ooh)
You (ooh)
Shave your head to see how it feels
Emotionally, it's not that different
But to the hand, it's beautiful
Yeah, to the hand, it's beautiful
You seem to have the weight of the world
Upon your bony shoulders, well hold on
You need a little time out
You need a little time out

From you (you, you, you)
And me (me)
Me (me)
Me (me)
Me (me)7Embed
