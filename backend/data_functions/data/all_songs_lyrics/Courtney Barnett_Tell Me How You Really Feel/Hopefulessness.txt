Hopefulessness Lyrics
You know what they say
No one's born to hate
We learn it somewhere along the way
Take your broken heart
Turn it into art
Can't take it with you
Can't take it with you

I don't wanna
I don't wanna know

Empty bottle blues
Sleep in different rooms
Hardly a maverick, lesser than average
Your vulnerability
Stronger than it seems
You know, it's okay to have a bad day

I don't wanna
I don't wanna know

Just get this one done
Then you can move along
Can't take it with you
Can't take it with you
You know what they say
No one's born to hate
I'm getting louder now
Getting louder now3Embed
