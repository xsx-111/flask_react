Help Your Self Lyrics
Darkness depends on where you're standing
Jump the creek and watch the sunshine swim
You found inner-peace in the inner northeast
Got a momentary bend
Gimme dreams upstream
Lower Dantian screaming

You got a lot on your plate
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry
Need validation

You catch the moon so carefully
Breath out, breath in
This tiger claw gets patient
Pull back and release
The sign on the shelf says:
"Please help your self"
Won't you tell me something new?
You're in tune with who surrounds you

You got a lot on your plate
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry
Need validation
You got a lot on your mind
You know that half the time
It's only half as true
Don't let it swallow you
You got a lot on your plate
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry
Need validation
You got a lot on your mind
You know that half the time
It's only half as true
Don't let it swallow you2Embed
