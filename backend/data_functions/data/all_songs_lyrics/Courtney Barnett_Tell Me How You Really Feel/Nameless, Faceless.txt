Nameless, Faceless Lyrics
Don't you have anything better to do?
I wish that someone could hug you
Must be lonely
Being angry
Feeling over-looked
You sit alone at home in the darkness
With all the pent-up rage that you harness
I'm real sorry
'Bout whatever happened to you

I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Men are scared that women will laugh at them
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Women are scared that men will kill them

I hold my keys
Between my fingers

He said, "I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup
And spit out better words than you"
But you didn't
Man, you're kidding yourself if you think
The world revolves around you
You know you got lots to give
And so many options
I'm real sorry
'Bout whatever happened to you
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Men are scared that women will laugh at them
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Women are scared that men will kill them

I hold my keys
Between my fingers

I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Men are scared that women will laugh at them
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Women are scared that men will kill them

I hold my keys
Between my fingers

Go on, tell me
You're just kidding
He said, she said
