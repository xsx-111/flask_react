Charity Lyrics
At the end of every season I'm spent up
Keep thinking this will be the one
Hesitation lingers till I'm unreasonable
As if you care, I know you got your own stuff going on

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
So subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?

Can we talk about it once we've slept?
When can we, yeah, can we work it out?
Meditation just makes you more strung out
I wish you had a guru who told you to let it go, let it go

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
So subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?

You don't have to pretend you're not scared
Everyone else is just as terrified as you
Medication just makes you more upset
I bet you got a lot to prove
I know you're still the same, still the same
You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
So subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?
You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
So subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?Embed
