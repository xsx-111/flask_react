Sunday Roast Lyrics
Don't come with your arms swinging
Throw them around me
Some kind of sweet relief
I hope you never leave
It's all the same to me

Just bring yourself
You know your presence is
Present enough
I got a front row seat
It's all the same to me

I spend a lotta my time
Doin' a whole lotta nothing
I know you're doin' your best
I think you're doin' just fine

I know it's been a long week
And now you're takin' your time
Some kindness goes around
Some kinda backfires
It's all the same to me
Ignore that voice
It puts you down
You make your choice
I'm here for you
It's all the same to me

I got a lot on my mind
But I dunno how to say it
I know you're doing your best
I think you're doing just fine

Keep on keepin' on, y'know you're not alone
And I know all your stories, but I'll listen to them again
And if you move away, y'know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me, y'know it's all the same to me
Keep on keepin' on, y'know you're not alone
And I know all your stories, but I'll listen to them again
And if you move away, y'know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me, y'know it's all the same to me
Keep on keepin' on, y'know you're not alone
And I know all your stories, but I'll listen to them again
And if you move away, y'know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me, y'know it's all the same to me1Embed
