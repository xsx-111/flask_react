See That My Grave Is Kept Clean Lyrics
Well it's one kind of favor I'll ask to you
Well it's one kind of favor I'll ask to you
One kind of favor I'll ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean

You know it's two white horses in a line
Two white horses in a line
Two white horses in a line
Gonna take me to my burying groundEmbed
