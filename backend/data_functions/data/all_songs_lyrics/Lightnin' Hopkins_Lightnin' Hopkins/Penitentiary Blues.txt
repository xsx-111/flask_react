Penitentiary Blues Lyrics
Penitentiary Blues

Big bad, yes, here I come
Oh lord have mercy
Big bad, yes, here I come
You know I'm gonna do time for another man
When there hasn't been a thing poor lightnin' done

This here oughta been on bread
19 and 10
Bud Russell drove pretty women just like you did
Ugly men, I'm big bad
Fiendin' to do time for another man
And ain't nothin' poor lightnin' done
Well you oughta be ashamed

Yeah, you know my mama called me
I answered "Mam'"
See said "You're tired of working?"
And I said "Mama, yes I am"
Papa called me
I answered "Sir"
He said "Son, if you're tired of working
When they hear you going, stay there"
I couldn't
No, I just couldn't hear myself
You know that a man can't help but feel bad
When he done time for someone else
You better watch it, all the timeEmbed
