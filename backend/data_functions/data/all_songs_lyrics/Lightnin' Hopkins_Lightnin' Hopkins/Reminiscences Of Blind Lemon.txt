Reminiscences Of Blind Lemon Lyrics
Yes, it's been a long time but you know
I can remember some things that we used to do
I was playing with him when I was 8 years old
That would've made me such a guitar player in a way
Of speaking, because he never learnt me a note
But he'd always play it in front of me
And I'd do that on my own in a way of speaking at this
We had gone a long ways together, and
And we used to play together at a place you call
Buffalo, Texas, that was our signified going towards Dallas
The last I heard of Blind Lemon, he was in Dallas
And, so I heard that he got frozen up past
So I didn't know, he was nice to me in every way
And I appreciated everything he's done
And he used to holler at me, said "Boy, you better play it right"
And I'd go 'head on and play with him, and he say
"You know there's one kind of favor I'll ask to you"
And you see me and him would just Cadillac, at you know
And I just come on up to be one of them peoples, now
I'm an old man now, nearby old
'Cause I think I'm 16 tomorrow, ha haha, yeah
(When did you first hear him
What town did you first hear him)
Well the first the man was in Waxahachie
Waxahachie, Texas, now it was fixin' to be a sensation
At the Buffalo, Texas, uh, that we come and we
So we all got together and went up there
We rode a flat back '25 truck, mall truck
Yeah, all us just crowed up on the road
Better than to hear him singin' and all, so
I played with him
(Was he well known with your buddies?)
Well known, well known up there, that was his home
Where he was bred and born, his mother, daddy
And everything
Brothers, cousins all up there, up in there
(What'd he look like?)
Oh he was a great big fat dog man with big stomach
He'd lay that guitar 'cross his stomach, man, it was a shame
See and the guitar stick out way towards his chin
Yeah, yeah he had that much stomach way back, haha
(Was anybody there leading him around
Or did he get around on his own?)
No, he wouldn't like leading 'cause you see
You called him blind, you know, don't call him blind
'Cause he done never, he did never feel like he blind
'Cause he's always like that, born like that, you seeEmbed
