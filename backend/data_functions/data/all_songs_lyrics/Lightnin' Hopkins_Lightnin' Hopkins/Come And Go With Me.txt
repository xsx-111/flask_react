Come And Go With Me Lyrics
Baby, come go home with me
Baby, come go home with me
I'll make you just as happy as any woman can be
Yes I will

My mama told me, and papa too
Told me just how that a woman do
She'll run you crazy one day
Crazy as a man can be
She said "Son, send a good one home to me"
Mama wanna chastise her

Long time, I see her that is workin' her toes
She wanna dance, go ahead and dance girl
She can cut it, don't you believe it?
Uh huh, I guess you see now
I wouldn't lie for nothin'
Before I lie, I shed my mouth
I wouldn't lie for nothin'
Before I lie, I shed my mouth
When my wife, she tell me said "You lyin', Sam
Everytime you walk about"
Don't call me no liar, make me mad
Got girls and old ladies, come on let's dance too
That's alright, and I'm gonna cut a step
She can't cut, uh oh I like to fail
My back kinda hurts too
I bet I go to the doctor and see
What done happened to me

Got back from the doctor, huh
Yes I am, what'd he say?
I better be careful, sit down and don't dance no more
He said I better be careful
Sit down and don't dance no more
My wife, she told me the same thing
And I said "Shut up, before you
Find yourself getting up off the floor"
'Cause I know she wasn't no doctorEmbed
