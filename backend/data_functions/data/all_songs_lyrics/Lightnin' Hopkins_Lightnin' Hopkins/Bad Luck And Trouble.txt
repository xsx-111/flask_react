Bad Luck And Trouble Lyrics
So long, so long
Best of friends, they got apart
So long, so long
Best of friends, they got apart
You know some may be your lover, some may be the one
Oh yes, may be the one breakin' your heart

You know I cried all night last night
'Til my pillow got soaking wet
Woah, lord have mercy
'Til my pillow got soaking wet
Yeah you know I was looking for my little woman
Poor child, she ain't made it home yet

Woah, you know bad luck and trouble
Woah, bothers me all the time
Woah, follows poor lightnin' all the time
I'm just hoping some day I'll be tough
Yes, and get trouble off my mind
Don't want to do it, but I might have to

I come home in the evening
I lay down and take my rest
I feel something heavy
Laying in my breath, feels like my baby
Just imagination come to me
Thinkin' about her all the time, and she out somewhere
Oh lordy, where in the world can my baby be?Embed
