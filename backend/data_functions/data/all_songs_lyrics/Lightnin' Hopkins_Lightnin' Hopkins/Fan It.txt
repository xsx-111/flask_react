Fan It Lyrics
You got to fan it, you got to fan it
You got to fan it, you got to fan it
You got to fan it to keep it cool
'Til your baby come home

Read what I said, you said you ain't done nothin' wrong
Why don't you fan it, keep it cool 'til I get home
You got to fan it, you got to fan it
You got to fan it 'til your baby get home

Yes you got to fan it
If you don't fan it, you must be doing something wrong
You got to fan it
You know the old hen cacklin', the rooster lay the egg
You couldn't tell the difference when
They both was in the shade
You got to fan it, you got to fan it
You got to fan it, yeah
Woo, I ain't jivin'

Woke up this mornin' 'bout the break of day
Find an egg in the bed where I used to lay
She had to fan it, she had to fan it
She had to keep it cool, 'til I come home
'Sho 'nuff
Just fan it, yes and keep it cool
Mama looked out there door said "Where Papa gone?"
She said "You know he done me a little bit wrong"
I said "Why, Mama?"
She got to fan it, I got to fan it
I got to fan it and keep it cool
'Til John Henry come homeEmbed
