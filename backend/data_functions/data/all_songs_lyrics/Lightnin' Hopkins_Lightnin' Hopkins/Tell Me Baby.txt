Tell Me Baby Lyrics
Tell me baby, darling what is wrong with you
Tell me baby, darling what is wrong with you
Well, you know you actin' so funny now
Tell I don't know what to do

You oughta be shamed of yourself
Leave poor Lightnin' like you do
Oughta be shamed of yourself
Leave poor Lightnin' like you do
Just like you leave poor Lightnin' someday, someone
Oh lord gonna leave you the same way too

You know I've been beggin' you
Woah lord, baby please don't go
Yes, I've been beggin' you
Baby please m'am don't you go
I know when you leave this time, darlin'
That you won't be back no moreEmbed
