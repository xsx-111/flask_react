Too Alive Lyrics(There's no need to fight)
(Such a long way out of my mind)
I took off
When will will make no way steal it
Like I found speed on the mic
I can't shut up
We're street illegal
Red hot
In ports
Swinger
The thoughts of scene a crime
Steal and all race out of my mind
I give up
(Swinger)
We reckless op ed
In a hot import
Now words I'll always say
Since I found speed on the mic
I can't shut up
To girls that love to haunt
(Tell em' I can't freak anymore)
The U.S. is made
To streak her letterman
Back and forth
(Swinger)1Embed
