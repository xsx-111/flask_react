London Song LyricsVictory's a blue and bruising voice
Yeah, I'm leaking pure white noise
Slipping through the states to find the static
Yeah, there's something to believe
Mercy here gets meaner overnight
It's Jersey sheer, it's outta sight
Slipping through the states to find the static
Yeah, there's something to believe
Slipping through the states to find the static
Yeah, there's something to believe
Misery's fun, I'm kissing everyone
I gotta hold my tongue
Slipping through the states to find the static
Yeah, there's something to believe
Ooh
I thought I'd know better
I thought I would know
Slipping through the states to find the static
Yeah, there's something to believe
Slipping through the states to find the static
Yeah, there's something to believe1Embed
