Forced to Drive LyricsLife forced to drive us
Spent the whole trip
Tryin' to go my own way
Pity for me
Tattoo wow
What a mile
Where are tonight's crimes going?
Out there think about your distance
We could bring it to me in the a.m
Innocent, I
Caught a lawman's daughter
Who tried
Turnin' it up to unwind
Out there in the distance
You could bring it to me in the a.m
Between the soles
Under the stories
Waiting below
A star-hit clock
If I
Offer to drive
Just know where your lifeline's going
Out there think about your distance
We could bring it to me in the a.m
Out there in the distance
You could bring it to me in the a.m1Embed
