Son of Three LyricsI got an empty case of whip-its
No more time on the meter
Daybreak
About face
I think I'm comin'
Cross another county line
Are we there?
Convertible
Cookin' with nitrous
Crackin' in the air
I am the sign of go
While last night's stars were high
Now they're popping in the sky
And the band is jammin' in
Daybreak
I don't like it
Better tonight
Better for you
Buzzing florescence
I don't what it wants from me
If I find the door
I am the son of go
While last night's stars were high
Now they're popping in the sky
And the band is movin' in
That's what you get
That's what you get
When there's no time on the meter
You get
An empty case
Of whip-its
And a boyfriend with a beeper1Embed
