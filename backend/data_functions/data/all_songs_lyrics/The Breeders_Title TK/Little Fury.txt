Little Fury LyricsRound up, holler girls
Ah, I will sing
Title TK
If I don't black out
Dumb made for fucking
And missing from the party
That boy spun out
Hold what you've got
Hold what you've got
While Xenia twists up the sky
Akron flakes out
Grindcore little fury
I feel hot tire
Why is it floating in my beer
Hold what you've got
Hold what you've got
My big drum
On your big face
The one-eyed jazz
As hickeys fade (fade)
Bound up, holler girl (bound up)
We'll all need bigger uniforms (grindcore little fury)
It's been a few days
And I know I will have spun out
Hold what you've got
Hold what you've got
My big drum
On your big face
The one-eyed jazz
As hickeys fade (fade)
Grindcore little fury
If I don't black out
Hold what you've got1Embed
