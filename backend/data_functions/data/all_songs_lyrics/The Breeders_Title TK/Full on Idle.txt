Full on Idle LyricsSay you're
One man's taste
Want what? Fall and break
We've seen the dream folks
In our day
What?
Fought the Father, the Pope
Finally sent away
Warden!
Lock it!
Free love's
Fought our battles through the day
We were full on idle
A lot of them say
Obey
Your colorist
Bleach it all away
Free reign!
Good rest!
Break!
Every brunette in the way
We were full on idle
A lot of them say
Obey
Your violence
It's kinda late
Say! You're!
One man's date
Want what?
Fall and break
We were full on idle
A lot of them say
Obey your violence
Look close!
Hate!
Tide all white
Row!
On the glass surf
He pulled the paddle
It's okay with me
What I'd like to do
With your violin
And it's bow1Embed
