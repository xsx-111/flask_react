Off You LyricsI've laid this island sun a thousand times
I'm on it, but I'm going strange
This island's chills and shell cover me
With winded rock and skies I've yet to see
I tried, I even sent in friends
They did it as a favor, 'cause I'm not that way
I am the autumn and the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes
I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin', yeah, we're movin'
This island's sun I've laid a thousand times
Fortune me, fortune me
Of all of my mistakes I think I lent you late
Now every set percent seemed to come my way
But I've never seen a starlet
Or a riot or the violence of you
I am the autumn and the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes
I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'
I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'6Embed
