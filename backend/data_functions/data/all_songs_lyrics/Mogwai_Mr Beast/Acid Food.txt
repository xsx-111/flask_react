Acid Food LyricsWhat happened after the storm?
Was everyone OK?
I tried to call again
I think they've gone away
We'll come back the other way
We'll come back the other way
We'll come back the other way
We'll come back the other way
I dreamt of an ice age today
Cold and white to see
I walked for miles and miles
They came back another way
We learnt them as we went
Forgot them straight away
The ones we left behind
The ones we sent away
We'll come back the other way
We'll come back the other way
We'll come back the other way
We'll come back the other wayEmbed
