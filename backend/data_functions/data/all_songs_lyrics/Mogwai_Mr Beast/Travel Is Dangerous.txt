Travel Is Dangerous LyricsWho might know of this?
The notes we left
Our final thoughts
And we knew they'd get us out
Sink, sink
Drowned by our country
Old machine
Is cursed and forgotten
Never surface again
The air runs out
The captain's first
So we take to memories
And layers of clothes
Up there the family waits
Outside we heard hammers
Noises sound like the end
And we will never see them
Sink, sink
Drowned by our country
Great machine
Is cursed, old and rotten
Never surface againEmbed
