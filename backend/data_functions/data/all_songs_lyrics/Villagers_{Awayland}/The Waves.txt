The Waves LyricsThere are waves
Up in the diamond sky
Stronger than you and I
Am a wave
I break through the barrier reef
Cut through the carbon sea
Approaching the shore
Look at the sky, look at the trees
Man, it's all the same to me
Look at the cars, look at the birds
And all of these invented words
One body's dying breath is another's birth
What are you running from?
What are you running from?
Sister jury, brother judge
In you I recognize this grudge
Buried deep beneath the sands
Of these ridiculous demands
No time for innocence, or sitting on the fence
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
When the waves
Cover the coastal plains
The tents and the cars and the trains
And the trace of honeybee cemeteries
Of well insulated dignitaries
All screaming of the memory of a human love
For anything, or anyone
Look at the birds, look at the bees
Madam, itâ€™s all the same to me
Look at the girls, look at the gold
Gathered, beat and bought and sold
One man's innocence is another's chance
What were you thinking of?
What were you thinking of?
Now please let me boil it down to this, my son
This party's getting wet, but it ain't over yet
So what is it gonna be?
What is it gonna be?
What is it gonna be?
Just let the waves
Cover the coastal plains
The fear and the guilt and the pain
And the trace of honeybee jealousy
Of well insulated bigotry
And if you don't agree
You better get back inside your cave
Cause we're all dancing with the waves
Up in the diamond sky
Stronger than you and I
Am a wave
I break through the barrier reef
Cut through the carbon sea
Approaching the shore Embed
