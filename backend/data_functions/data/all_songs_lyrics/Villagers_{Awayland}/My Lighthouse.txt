My Lighthouse LyricsHmmmmmmmmmmmm..
You are needing a friend
For to follow, for to fend
And I haven't got a clue
If I'm getting through to you
My lighthouse
In the violent moonlight I am searching the tide In a vessel, in the storm
And you're the kind host, in the port
My lighthouse
And we'll be there to right our wrongs
In the time it took to write this song
And we'll beat the ghost with our bare hands
And we'll skin the corpse and we'll love and laugh
And we'll dance all everlasting day
And you'll sing to me everything I meant to say
And we'll drink to the gentle, and meek and the kind
And the funny little flaws in this earthly design
From the Reeperbahn to the Sundarban I will heed your call from the dust and the sand
And I'll save all my stories for theeEmbed
