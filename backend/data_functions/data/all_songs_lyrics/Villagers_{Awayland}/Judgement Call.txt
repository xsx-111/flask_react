Judgement Call LyricsAll the dirt and the worry left when
I realized that I knew it all
How it started and how it's gonna end
And I don't need no proof
The writing's on my wall
It's a judgement
And you can come if you get behind it
And if you wear this long white shawl
Cause we're the clean and the right and the chosen ones
And I don't need no proof
The writing's on my wall
It's a judgement
And we gotta keep the wheels in motion
And we gotta get the kids before they grow
God forbid they retain their sense of wonder
Their sense of wonder
Their sense of wonder
Their sense of wonder
Now I don't need to think for myself
No, I don't need to think at all
When the team says go, I go
It's a judgement call, it's a judgement call
No, we don't need to think for ourselves
No, we don't need to think at all
When the screen says go, we go
It's a judgement call, it's a judgement call
And I believe this land is my land
And you are not the same at all
Cause the Man In The Sky has got my back
And I don't need no proof
The writing's on my wall
I don't need no proof
The writing's on my wall
No, I don't need no proof
So you better start running
It's a judgement
I made your world a living hell
I've lost the will to judge myselfEmbed
