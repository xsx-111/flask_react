In a Newfound Land You Are Free LyricsHow heavy you are my new born child
So viciously free
So careless and wild
With the eyes of a saint and the soul of a thief
In a new found land
The windows reveal the spinning sea
Which ripples and rolls as it runs underneath
And I smuggle this sense of sheer disbelief
In a new found land
Born in the birth of the mild month of May
And your gentle repulse I could never betray
But for now I am burnt by a lifetime too brief
And with this new found land
Comes a new found grief
But in a new found land
You are free
You are free
You are freeEmbed
