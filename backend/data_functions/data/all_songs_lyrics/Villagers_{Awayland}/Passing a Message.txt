Passing a Message LyricsI was carving my name out
Of a giant sequoia tree
I was blind to its beauty
Now it's all I can see
See I've learned how to listen
To the folks on TV
They are passing a message
That means nothing to me
My vertebrate evolution
Easy as ABC
Baby steps from the ocean
Feather trails to the sea
Paddlefish to salamander
Honeybee to atrophy
I guess I'm losing my trail here
But it takes loss to be free
Now I work in a nightclub
At the Burj Khalifa
And I'm blind to its beauty
But it ain't all that I have
So I'm passing a message
Like the folks on TV
Guess I'm getting the words out
But they don't come from me
Paddlefish to salamander
Little girl to atrophy
I guess we're losing our trail here
But it takes loss to be freeEmbed
