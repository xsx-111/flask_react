Earthly Pleasure LyricsNaked on the toilet
With a toothbrush in his mouth
When he suddenly acquired
An overwhelming sense of doubt
Every single piece of baggage
He'd been holding on his back
Was beginning to d-d-dig in
And then his back began (began) to crack
And when he finally broke up
He found that he'd been breaking down
Little body, little soul
Little shrapnel on the ground
And so he started to examine
From the clumsy to the cute
From the fat, fat cat to the destitute
From the chat fat cat to the mute

Oh, earthly pleasure ring out
From the rigors of this road
Earthly pleasure ring out
From the caverns of my soul
Then suddenly he found himself
In 1822
And he was in another body
In a heavy sort of suit
He was surrounded but he'd started
Making plans to make a run
When they called to him
"Son, cock your gun!"
And so he did as all the others
Had already done
He put his finger on the trigger
And he got him some
But though he don't like to admit it
It was sensual and pure
And he changed that day
Though he can't be sure
If it's the sickness or the cure

So there he was in front of her
Divine simplicity
And she was speaking Esperanto
And drinking ginger tea
As she inquired about the reason
For his visit here today
Well he just said, "No reason
And I really shouldn't stay"
And so he thought she would think that he was
Some kind of freak
And that he'd go back to the grind
And that he wouldn't last a week
But she didn't, she just sighed
And uttered softly with a smile
"Sit down, dear child
What's on your mind?"
And so he frantically described to her
The kingdom at her feet
As she continued with her manicure
And poured another tea
As he recounted tales of misery
And suffering and pain
She was yawning at the ceiling
So he had to up his game
The only thing that children cherish
Is to move up the ranks
Lucifer is in our court
Beelzebub is in our banks
And if you don't cooperate with us
We'll hound you 'til you're dead
So she granted him a wish
And let him write it on her head
And when he read it back to her
This is all it said:

Now I truly understand
That I don't understand a thing
So let this earthly pleasure sing
Earthly pleasure
