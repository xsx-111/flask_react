Rhythm Composer LyricsThere's an ancient dog dreaming of another life
But you sometimes wonder whether it should live at all
Cause when you're making up for what you lack
That old black dog is on your back
And all you're getting is a bottomless pit
But don't mind it
Cause you're a rhythm composer
Easy for you
Rhythm composer
You're a rhythm composer
You're a little tong driven through an overdrive
And your BPM got an MRI, don't know if I'm coming or going and there's a
Start/stop button on the floor
Start stop start stop button, no
Before a start/stop button
On the floor
But you're a rhythm composer
Easy for you
Rhythm composer
(You're a rhythm composer)
But in actuality
Only the rhythm composes you
Only the rhythm composes you
I said, I love how the rhythm composes you
I love how the rhythm composes you
Start/stop button on the floor
Start stop start stop button, no
The floor, start/stop button
On the floor
Cause when you're looking for what you lack
That old black dog is on your back
And all you're getting is a bottomless pit
So don't mind it
And when you're looking up for who you lack
That old black dog is on your back
And if you tame it, you can get it to sit
So don't mind it
You're looking up to what you lack
That old black dog is on your back
But all you're getting is a bottomless pit
So don't mind it
And when you're looking up to who you lack
That old black dog is on your back
But if you tame it, you can get it to sit
So don't mind it
No, don't mind itEmbed
