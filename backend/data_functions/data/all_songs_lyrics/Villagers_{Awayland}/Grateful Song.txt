Grateful Song LyricsArise my sweet conviction
Your time has finally come
Though your home is no place to speak of
It gave you the courage to run
I am grateful for your company
I am grateful to belong
I am thankful for the misery
From which I stole this grateful song
Partly written out of habit
Partly written out of need
With a blind and bold ambition
For to sow this grateful seed
May I call on you if I falter?
If I seek to be something I'm not
If I forgo a love for my brothers and my sisters
With a pledge of allegiance to god
A god of pain, a god of tragedy
A god of hatred and deceit
A god of helpless, helpless agony
One god I hope we'll never meet
We are grateful for your company
We are grateful you belong
We are thankful for the misery
From which we stole this grateful song
Yes, we are thankful for the misery
From which we stole this grateful songEmbed
