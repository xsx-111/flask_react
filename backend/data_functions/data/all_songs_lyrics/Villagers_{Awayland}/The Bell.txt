The Bell LyricsThere is a sleeping dog
Under this dialogue
Obedient only to rhyme
But if I could beckon her
If I could find the words
All they would be is lies
Tell me why this failure is making you smile?
Then off goes the bell ringing through my head
Signifies that all's been said
This failure is making you smile
Off goes the bell ringing through my head
There is a passenger
In every useless word
Can never be twisted or sold
Senator of my skin
A body of discipline
Must be a million years old
I've been told you're offering more than you owe
Then off goes the bell ringing through my head
Signifies that all's been said
You're offering more than you owe
Off goes the bell ringing through my head
Then off goes the bell ringing through my head
Signifies that all's been said
Off goes the bell ringing through my head
Then off goes the bell ringing through my head
Signifies that all's been said
Off goes the bell ringing through my headEmbed
