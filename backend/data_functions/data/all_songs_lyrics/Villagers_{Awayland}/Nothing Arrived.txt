Nothing Arrived LyricsSavanna scatters and the seabird sings
So why should we fear what travel brings?
What were we hoping to get out of this?
Some kind of momentary bliss?
I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived
It's our dearest ally, it's our closest friend
It's our darkest blackout, it's our final end
My dear sweet nothing, let's start anew
From here on in, it's just me and you
I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived
Well I guess it's over, I guess it's begun
It's a losers' table, but we've already won
It's a funny battle, it's a constant game
I guess I was busy, when nothing came
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy
I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived
I waited for something, but something died
So I waited for nothing, and nothing arrived nothing arrived4Embed
