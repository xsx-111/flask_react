April Skies Lyrics
Hey, honey, what you trying to say?
As I stand here, don't you walk away
And the world comes tumbling down
Hand in hand in a violent life
Making love on the edge of a knife
And the world comes tumbling down

And it's hard for me to say
And it's hard for me to stay
I'm going down to be by myself
I'm going back for the good of my health
And there's one thing I couldn't do
Sacrifice myself to you
Sacrifice

Baby, baby, I just can't see
Just what you mean to me
I take my aim and I fake my words
I'm just your longtime curse
And if you walk away
I can't take it

But that's the way that you are
And that's the things that you say
But now you've gone too far
With all the things you say
Get back to where you come from
I can't help it, under the April skies
Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April sun
Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies

The sun grows cold, the sky gets black
And you broke me up and now you won't come back
Shaking hand, life is dead
And a broken heart and a screaming head
Hey, hey

Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies
Under the April skies3Embed
