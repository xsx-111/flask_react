Nine Million Rainy Days Lyrics
Nine million rainy days
Have swept across my eyes thinking of you
And this room becomes a shrine thinking of you
And the way you are sends the shivers to my head
You're gonna fall, you're gonna fall down dead

As far as I can tell
I'm being dragged from here to hell
All my time in hell is spent with you

I have ached for you
I have nothing left to give for you to take
I have no more empty heart or limbs to break
And the way you are sends the shivers to my head
You're gonna fall, you're gonna fall down dead

As far as I can see
There is nothing left of me
All my time in hell was spent with you

Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall1Embed
