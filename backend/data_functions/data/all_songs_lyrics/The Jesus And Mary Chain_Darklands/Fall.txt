Fall Lyrics
Fall to my bended knees
Shoving up till I freeze
Falling on down to you
Down, down, down

So choked up in the dust
Handheld holy lust
Dragging me to her cross
Fall, fall, fall

So I dragged you down
C'mon, drag me down
So it seems to be
So it seems to me
That I just can't fail to see
That I just can't fail to see
Falling on down to you
Down, down, down

Everybody's falling on me
And I'm as dead as a Christmas tree
A tree
Oh, everybody's falling on me
And I'm as dead as a Christmas tree
Oh, everybody
Hey hey hey
Oh, hey hey hey
Hey hey heyEmbed
