Cherry Came Too Lyrics
When she walks towards me
I feel something
Crawl beneath my skin
And all the electric stars are shining
Beneath my skin and

Cherry takes me to the place above
With barbed wire kisses and her love
We're going where the oceans blue
Kick the dust and you can come too

In the light of all my darkest mornings
Things fall into place
And all the soft orange-colored dawnings
Fall into place and

Cherry's scratching like a grain of sand
The trigger itch in the killer's hand
Me and Cherry are so extreme
Making love to the sound of a scream

Oh, Cherry honey, you got me stuck on a rope
You got me running around
With the fear in my head for you
And I want you
And I'll give you my head
And all the things it said
And I'll give you my thoughts
If those things weren't lost
And I'll give you my soul
To beat it with your pole
I'm going to give you my head
You could kick it dead
And I'll give you my head
Come on and kick me dead
Come on and push me down
Come on and drag me down
Oh, Cherry be bad
Come on and kiss my head2Embed
