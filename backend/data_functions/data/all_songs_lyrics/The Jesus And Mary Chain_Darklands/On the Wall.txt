On the Wall Lyrics
Unlike the mole
I'm not in a hole
And I can't see anyway
Just like a doll
I'm one foot tall
But dolls can't see anyway
The frozen stare
The clothes and hair
These make me taste like a man
Tied to a door
Chained to a floor
An hourglass grain of sand

Life in a sack
Is coming back
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock
On the wall
On the wall
On the wall

Swim in the sea
Swim inside me
But you can't swim far away
I never grew
Covered up by you
And nothing grows anyway
Life in a sack
Is coming back
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock
On the wall
On the wall
On the wallEmbed
