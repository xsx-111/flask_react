Deep One Perfect Morning Lyrics
Deep one perfect morning
As the sun was heading up into the sky
And I'm sitting here warming
To the coldness of the things that meet my eye
Something in me's stirring
And the moon and all the stars fail to comply

And my thoughts are turning backwards
And I'm picking at the pieces
Of a world that keeps turning the screws
Into my mind

Something in me's chilling
And nothing in me's willing
To focus my attention on the sky
Past the weakened eyes that
Feel and scream into your soul
Better to paint my hate
On the walls before the picture goes

And my thoughts are turning backwards
And I'm picking at the pieces
Of a world that keeps turning the screws
Into my mind
And I can see a wide world
For me to tame
I can see a wide world
For me to tame
For me to tame
For me to tame
For me to tame
For me to tameEmbed
