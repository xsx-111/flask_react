Nub LyricsSo since the surgery
How's that ghost limb?
Hey, man, say, man, have you
Been rubbin' your nub?
Por favor
No sacar las manos
No sacar las manos
Fuera de la ventana
En tu cuenta, es mucho dinero
Lo siento
But I have got to hand it to you
You're taking this extremely well
Yeah, rub it on me
Rub it on me, Duane
So since the surgery
How's that ghost limb?
Hey, man, say, man, have you
Been rubbin' your nub?Embed
