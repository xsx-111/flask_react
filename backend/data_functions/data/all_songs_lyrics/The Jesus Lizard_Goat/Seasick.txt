Seasick LyricsI can swim, I can't swim
I can swim, I can't swim
I can swim, I can't swim
I can swim, I can't swim
Well, here's a notion
A single idea
Swing by the ocean
Because
I can't swim, I can swim
I can't swim, I can swim
I can't swim, I can swim
I can swim, I can swim
Swim
Hang by a maritime
A marine at nighttime
Waiting waterlogged
Down by the high sea
Wading waterlogged
For that guy to arrive
Oh, he don't know that
I can swim, I can't swim
I can't swim, I can swim
If there was even one chance
That he would come along
If there was even one chance
That he would come alone
If there was even one chance
That he would come along
If there was even one chance
And take a drink by the drink, oh
Fucked up in the flood
Stoned
And get soused by the sea
And take a dip, yeah
In the briny deep
Swim
Hang by a maritime
A marine at nighttime
Waiting waterlogged
Down by the high sea
Wading waterlogged
For that guy to arrive
Well, he don't know that
I can swim, I can't swim
I can't swim, I can swim
I can't swim, I can swim
I can't swim, I can swim2Embed
