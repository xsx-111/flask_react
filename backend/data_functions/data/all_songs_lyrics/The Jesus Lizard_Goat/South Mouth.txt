South Mouth LyricsDo I have to ask ya to cut the cackle
'Bout a snake in a south mouth or a cooter canal path
Milky home cookin' and ashake in the shackle
Like anervously calm noose
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
Do I have to ask ya, do I have to ask ya
Do I have to tell ya, do I have to tell ya
To avoid the sharp teeth of a suckling brat child
Help me tear the twins all away from their mothers
Give 'em some go slow, just to shut their clam traps shut
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
An off duty clown always conjures up hoopla
When she's sniffin' up snail tracks or steppin' on slug backs
Hey sometimes, hey sometimes, hey sometimes
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
Hey sometimes we act like animals
Like we act sometimes like little girls
Hey sometimes we act like...
Why do we all men pay attention to a wiggly waist line
Do I have to ask ya, do I have to ask ya
Do I have to ask ya, do I have to tell ya
Hey sometimes, hey sometimes, sometimesEmbed
