Then Comes Dudley LyricsThat woman's crazy
She's the mistress of a man who's crazy too
That woman's carryin'
Then comes Dudley
Dudley's gonna do us all a favor
And tear 'em both a new asshole
Dudley feels the time has come
To swell his balloon
Dudley feels the time has come
To clean this womb (wound)
That's right Dudley, yeah
If it had a face I won't (wanna) eat it, he said
If it had a face I won't eat it, he said
Power of the pink he said (piggy's head)
Power of the pink he said
That woman's crazy
She's the mistress of a man who's crazy too
That woman's carryin'
If it had a face I won't eat it, he said
If it had a face I won't eat it, he said
Power of the pink he said
Power of the pink he said
Power of the pink he said
Power of the pink he saidEmbed
