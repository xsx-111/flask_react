Mouth Breather Lyrics
I leave my home
I leave for a couple weeks
I leave my home
I leave it in the care of a friend

Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy, I like him just fine
But he's a mouth breather
Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy, I like him just fine
But he's a mouth breather

I expect when I return
I return to some sort of order
Such is not the case
No, such is not the case
I leave my home
I leave for a couple weeks
I leave my home
I leave it in the care of a friend

Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy, I like him just fine
But he is a mouth breather
I leave my home
I leave for a couple weeks
I leave my home
I leave it in the care of a friend
And in my basement, I found raining piss
And in my kitchen, I found my friend deceased1Embed
