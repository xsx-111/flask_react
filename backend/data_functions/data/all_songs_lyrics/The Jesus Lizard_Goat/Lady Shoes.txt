Lady Shoes LyricsThere's a girl playing her piano
There's a little girl playing her big piano
While her mother gives her an enema
While her mother
While her mother gives her an enema
While her mother
And then the daddy comes in
And jacks off on the piano
And jacks off on the piano
And jacks off on the piano
And jacks off on the piano
Meanwhile at the maternity ward
Nurse comes in with a great big sledgehammer
 kills all the babies
Destroys the monitoring system
Called the doctor, said, "Look what I've done"
She called the doctor, said, "Look what I've done"
She called the doctor, said, "Look what I've done"
Doctor comes in
Pops a boner and jacks off in her cap
And then the motel manager comes by
Takes a little shit in his hand
Then he takes a shit in his hand
Then he takes a little shit in his hand
And then he puts it on like lipstick, lipstick
He puts it on like lipstick, lipstickEmbed
