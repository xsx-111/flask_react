Rodeo in Joliet LyricsThere is no rodeo in Joliet
No great waterhole in Downer's Grove
The old windbag blows, the old windbag blows
Here the sky and the ground, here the sky and the dirt
Share the same grey, grey
No fun in the sun, no fun in the sun, where fish float
The old windbag blows, the old windbag blows, the old windbag blows, the old windbag blowsEmbed
