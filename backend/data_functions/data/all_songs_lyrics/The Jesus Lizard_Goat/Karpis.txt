Karpis LyricsAlvin's feelin' restless, cellblock H
A carton of smokes for 10 minutes of pleasure
Say, if I cannot have you, nobody will
If nobody will, what, nobody
No, no, no, yes, no, no, no
Yes, yes, no, no, yes, no (nobody)
Alvin's feelin' randy, ready to roll
Shovin' a shiv between the shoulders
Say, if I cannot have you, nobody will
If nobody will, what, nobody
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (nobody)
Do ya wanna (dance now??), I shaved my ass
Hey boy, I got no hair on my ass
I got no hair on my cock
I shaved my whole body
How do ya like that boy, how do ya like that boy
Hey come here, hey, come here
Alvin's feelin' randy, ready to roll
Shovin' a shiv between the shoulders
Say, if I cannot have you, nobody will
If nobody will, what, nobody
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no
No, yes, no, yes, no
Nobody
No, no, yes, no, no
Nobody, noEmbed
