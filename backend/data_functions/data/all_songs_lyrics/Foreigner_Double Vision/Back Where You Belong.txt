Back Where You Belong Lyrics
I felt so sure of the love that we shared
There was no reason on earth to be scared
Then I heard a rumor, it started to grow
Slowly but surely, the truth began to show
Then I started wondering, as I picked up the phone
And a man started asking, if you were at home
You treat me like a fool, but you're so wrong
I'm going to send you back where you belong
I put my trust in you, but I was wrong
I'm going to send you back where you belong
You treat me like a fool, but you're so wrong
I'm going to send you back where you belong
I never had any doubt in my mind
Now you have shown me, love can make you blind

Back where you belongEmbed
