Love Has Taken Its Toll Lyrics
Some girls you meet seem so complete
Like they don't need nothing from you
They're out to show you they don't want to know you
When deep inside they do
Well, this girl didn't want me or anyone else
She was alone, thought I'd give it a try
I was a young bull stomping in the field
I saw red when she walked by

Love has taken its toll, love has
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah

I had to think fast, I watched her walk past
I knew I would have my way
So I swaggered up, I mean I staggered up
But I didn't have a damn thing to say
Now, two handed strategy always works well for me
So I slipped my hands around her waist
I swore it was the right move, feeling so smooth
Till she backhanded me across my face

To make a long story short, she finally got caught
I had to tell her enough is enough
She said, "You're just what I needed", and boy
She nearly pleaded with me not to be too rough
