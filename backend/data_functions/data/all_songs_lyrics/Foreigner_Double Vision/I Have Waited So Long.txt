I Have Waited So Long Lyrics
I have waited oh so long
Please don't tell me baby I was wrong
Dreaming of you every night
Holding back until the time was right

I've counted the days
(Day after day)
Since we've been apart
Now I've found my way
(I've found my way)
Right back to your heart

I've been searching for you everywhere
Calling you, but you were never there
Seeking in the dark of night
Hoping one day you would shine a light

I've counted each day
(Day after day)
Since we've been apart
Now I've found my way
(I've found my way)
Right back to your heart
I have waited oh, so long
Please don't tell me baby, I was wrong
Dreaming of you every night
(Every night, every night)
Holding back 'til the time was right
Oh, I have waited so long
Ah, don't tell me I was wrong

(I dream of you)
I'm dreaming of you baby
Don't go awayEmbed
