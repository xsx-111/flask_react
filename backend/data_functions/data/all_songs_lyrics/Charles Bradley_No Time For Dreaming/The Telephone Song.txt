The Telephone Song LyricsHello, baby
Oh, it's you
Ah, man, yep, I do; this is...
To hear your voice, you know
You're way across the ocean and I'm way over here
And my love jones is coming down
I just have you no where near me, baby
I need you here
Let's talk this thing out and get this thing together
No more arguments, baby
It's me and you
I remember that time when me and you was layin' down together, side by side
And your love just hit me so strong
I want you, baby
Come on home
It can't be this way no more
I’m tired of fighting, baby
We don’t need to fight no more
We actin’ like fools, baby
Two fools, two fools in love
I bought you a ticket, baby
But you never got on that plane
We actin’ like fools, baby
Two fools, two fools in love
I wanna make right, all that I’ve done wrong
And pick up the pieces and carry on
I wanna make right, all that I’ve done wrong
‘Cos love don’t stand a chance
Unless it’s true and strong
C’mon, baby, ooh...
Give me your love, baby, c’mon, c’mon
I wanna make right, all that I’ve done wrong
And pick up the pieces and carry on
Gotta make it right, ooh
Gotta make it right, c’mon, baby
Gotta make it right, ooh
Gotta make it right, ooh
Gotta make it right, ooh baby
C'mon baby, ohEmbed
