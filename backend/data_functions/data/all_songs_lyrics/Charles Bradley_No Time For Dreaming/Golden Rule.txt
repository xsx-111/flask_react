Golden Rule LyricsRound and round the road we go again
Where we started, nobody knows
It's a cold, cold world, it's a cold, cold world
How can we stop the changes going in America today
Come back, come back to the golden rule
Come back, come back to the golden rule
Round and round the streets we go
Still see the same old thing
They still keep building more prisons
To take our kids away
Why can't we show more love to make this a better day
Oh
Come back, come back to the golden rule
Come back, come back to the golden rule
The golden rule is love, my brothers
The golden rule, oh, is love, my sisters
Now you know what I'm talking about
Now you feel my heart and know I'm for real
Look into your souls and know that the truth lies within the same
Find the love that loves a woman's sister
Oh, hear my cryEmbed
