In You (I Found a Love) LyricsIn you I found a love
Make me feel so good l, oh, man
Sometimes when I'm sleeping at night
I wake up and you're nowhere to be found
You said you love me and you'll always be around
In you I thought I found a love that's true
But you used me, I guess I'm just somebody's fool
I don't wanna be a fool no more
With me you found love and you tore it apart, oh darling
You said you loved me and you'll always be around
Wait a day, wait a second
What you gonna do baby? Stop it
Don't hurt me, stop playing with my heart
I feel, you hurting me so bad
Can't take this pain no more, no, ooh
I thought you loved me and you'll always be around
Now that you're gone, baby
You break my heart in two, oh
Again, again and again
Somehow you better stop it right there, baby
Ain't gonna give you no more tries
Stop it right there, baby no more games will IEmbed
