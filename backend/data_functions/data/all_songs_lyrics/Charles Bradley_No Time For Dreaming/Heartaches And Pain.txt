Heartaches And Pain LyricsThere a time in my life
When it ran so cold
Can't find a friend
Anywhere at all
So my brother said to me
Charles gotta stand tall
Because life is full of sorrow
Heartaches and pain
Get it again
I woke up this morning
My momma she was cryin
So i looked out my window
Police lights was flashing
People was screaming
So i ran down to the street
My friends grabbed my shoulder
And he said these words to me
Life is full of sorrow
So I have to tell you this
Your brother is gone
Heartaches and pain
Heartaches heartaches and pain
Ooooo
Ohhhhh
Ooooo
Ohhhh
Heartaches and pain
Heartaches and pain
Heartaches and pain
Heartaches and pain1Embed
