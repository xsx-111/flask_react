Why Is It So Hard LyricsWhy is it so hard to make it in America?
I tried so hard to make it in America
A land of milk and honey, a land supposed to be built with love
It takes love and understanding to live and let live
I was born and raised in Florida
I traveled far and wide
Then I moved to Brooklyn New York
Had hard times, but sometime I hold on
Why is it so hard to make it in America?
I tried so hard to make it in America
Seemed like nothing is going right
So I said to myself, you gotta move away from here
I went of to state of New York, a little town they call Poughkeepsie
Got me a job to get away from all that stress
But I couldn't get away, no matter how far I went
Seemed like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remained the same
Why is it so hard to make it in America?
I tried so hard to make it in America
Why is it so hard? Why is it so hard?
Why is it so hard? Why is it so hard?1Embed
