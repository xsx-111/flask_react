Stay Away (Bonus Track) LyricsMonkey see, monkey do - I don't know why
I'd rather be dead than be uncool - I don't know why
Every line had the rhythms - I don't know why
Let's move, love is blind - I don't know why
Stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Give it up, take a smile - I don't know why
Fashion shirt, fashion style - I don't know why
Throw it out, keep it in - I don't know why
Have to have poison skin - I don't know why
Stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Give an inch, take a smile - I don't know why
Fashion shirt, fashion style - I don't know why
Stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Stay away, yeaaah!
Stay away, ooooooh, aaah
Aaaah, ooh stay away babyEmbed
