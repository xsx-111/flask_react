Heart Of Gold (Bonus Track) LyricsI want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean
For a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
Keeps me searching
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
Keeps me searching
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting oldEmbed
