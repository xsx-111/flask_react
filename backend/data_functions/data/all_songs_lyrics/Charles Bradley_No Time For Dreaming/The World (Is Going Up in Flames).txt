The World (Is Going Up in Flames) Lyrics
This world
Is going up in flames
And nobody
Wanna take the blame
Don’t tell me
How to live my life
When you
Never felt the pain
(ooo ooo ooo)

(uuuuuh)
Come on babe
(uuuuuh)
They don’t hear me cryin'
(uuuuuh)
They don’t hear me tryin'
(uuuuuh)
They don’t hear me cryin'
For what I gonna do, yeah baby
I can’t turn my head away
Seeing all these things
The world
Is burning up in flames
And nobody
Wanna take the blame
You oh you
You oh you
Me oh me

(uuuuuh)
They don’t hear me cryin
(uuuuuh)
They don’t hear me tryin
(uuuuuh)
Don't stomp on that light
Oh you killin me
Come on babe
Get it right
Gotta be
A better world
Gotta make it baby
Gotta make it right4Embed
