No Time for Dreaming LyricsNO TIME FOR DREAMING (DREAMING, DREAMING!)
GOTTA GET ON UP (GET UP!) AND DO MY THING (WOOOO!)
NO TIME FOR DREAMING (DREAMING, DREAMING!)
GOTTA GET ON UP (GET UP!) AND DO MY THING (AND DO YOUR THING!)
DREAM WHILE YOUR SLEEPING
TIRED OF SLOWLY CREEPING
OPEN UP YOUR EYES
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
TRY, A LITTLE HARDER
STOP WASTING OVER YONDER
WAKE UP!
YOU'LL GET YOUR BREAK
NO TIME FOR DREAMING (DREAMING, DREAMING!)
GOTTA GET UP (GET UP!) GOTTA DO MY THING (WOOOO!)
NO TIME FOR DREAMING (DREAMING, DREAMING!)
GOTTA GET ON UP (GET UP!) GOTTA DO MY THING (AND DO YOUR THING!)
WHILE YOUR SLEEPING
SOMEBODY'S SCHEMING
TRY TO GETTA
WHAT I GOT
STAY ALERT
IT'S GOT TO WORK
OR YOU END UP
ON THE SPOT
NO TIME FOR DREAMING (DREAMING, DREAMING)
GOTTA GET ON UP (GET UP!) AND DO MY THING (WOOOO!)
NO TIME FOR DREAMING (DREAMING, DREAMING!)
GOTTA GET ON UP (GET UP!) AND DO MY THING (AND DO YOUR THING!)
NO TIME FOR DREAMING (DREAMING, DREAMING!)
GOTTA MAKE IT REAL (AHHHHH!)
NO TIME FOR SLEEPING (SLEEPING, SLEEPING!)
GOTTA MAKE IT RIGHT, GOTTA DO MY THING (DO YOUR THING!)
GOTTA DO YOUR THING......(REP)1Embed
