Sugar Mama LyricsSugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama please come back to me
Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama please come back to me
Bring me my granulated sugar, sugar mama, sugar mama ease my misery
You've got this new grade of sugar, sugar mama, an you done made me love it too
You've got this new grade of sugar, sugar mama, an you done made me love it too
You've got this granulated sugar, sugar mama, ain't nobody else got, but you
They been braggin' 'bout your sugar, sugar mama, been braggin' all over town
They been braggin' 'bout your sugar, sugar mama, braggin' all over town
Everywhere i go sugar mama, sugar mama you can hear your name
Read them crazy about you sugar mama
Because you ease my worried mind
Read them crazy about you sugar mama
Because you ease my worried mind
You got something something sugar mama
Ain't nobody else got but you
Now, the bootleggers want you to sell 'em enough to make whiskey
But you won't sell 'em about four or five pounds
I like my coffee sweet early in the mornin', you know, an I'm crazy 'bout my tea at night
You what i meant about that sugar mama
I like my coffee sweet early in the mornin', you know, an I'm crazy 'bout my tea at night
Don't get my sugar three times a day, oh, Lord
You don't mean you just can't get along right
Then I don't feel rightEmbed
