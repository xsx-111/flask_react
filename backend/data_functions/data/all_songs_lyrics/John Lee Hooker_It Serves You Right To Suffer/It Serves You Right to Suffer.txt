It Serves You Right to Suffer Lyrics
It serves you right to suffer
It serves you right to be alone
It serves you right to suffer
It serves you right to be alone
Because you're still livin'
The day done packed and gone

Every time you see a woman
She makes you think of yours
Every time you see a woman
She makes you think of yours
And that's why, thats why, thats why
You can't keep from crying

Your doctor put you on
Milk, cream, and alcohol
Your doctor put you on
Milk, cream, and alcohol
He told you that's why
You can't sleep at night
You're nerve is so bad, yeah

Every time you see a woman
She make you think of yours
Every time you see a woman
She make you think of yours
She treated you so bad
You just couldn't keep from crying
Your life will never be the same
You're still living in a day done packed and gone
And memories
You can't live on
In that way
In the past
Them days is goneEmbed
