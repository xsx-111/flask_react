Decoration Day Lyrics(John Lee Hooker)
People I had a woman, she was nice and kind to me in ev'ry way
People I had a woman, she was nice and kind to me in ev'ry way
But Lord, she died and she left me, I sang the blues on ev'ry Decoration Day1
Lord, I hate to see, I hate to see my baby go
People I hate to see my baby leave that mornin'
And my Lord takin' my baby 'way
She said, "Johnny Lee, don't you worry
Bring flowers on every Decoration Day"
I was 'round my baby's bedside, when my Lord takin' my baby, 'way
Lord, I was 'round my baby's bedside, when my Lord takin' my baby, 'way
It hurt me so bad, so bad, until I, just broke right down and cried
Hmm, hmm
She says, "Fare you well, I see you on every Decoration Day", I tol' them
I told my baby, I told my baby, "I bring flowers on every Decoration Day"
I bring you some flowers, babe, just to decorate your grave
People, y'all havin' a good time now, just like the flowers that comes in May
Y'all havin' a good time now, just like the flower that come in May
I think about Lou Della, Lou Della, Lou Della on every Decoration Day
Lou Della, Lou Della, Lou Della stays on my mind
Lou Della, Lou Della, people, boy
Lou Della stays on my mind
Lord, she died and she left me on one Decoration Day
Lord, Lou Della's gone and Lou Della's worryin' meEmbed
