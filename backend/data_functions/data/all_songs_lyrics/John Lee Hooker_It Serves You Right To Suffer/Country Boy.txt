Country Boy LyricsI ain't nothin' but a country boy
Driftin' from town to town
I ain't nothin' but a country boy
Driftin' from town to town
Got no place, ooh yeah
To call my home
Sometime in travellin'
I travel when nights are blue
Sometime my night
My night so dark and blue
But I keep on travellin'
No place to lay my worried head
I'm just a country boy
Driftin' from town to town
Driftin' from town to town
I ain't got no place
To lay my worried head, baby
Sometime I lay down on the highway
I cry to take my rest
I hear a freight train howlin'
I drown my head and run
I'm just a country boy
Driftin' from town to town, have mercy
Now one night I was travellin'
I saw a light in the winter
I was so cold at night
And my clothes were soakin' wet
I walked on to the door
I knocked on the door
A little girl come to the door
She said, "Mister, what do you want"
I said, "It's cold outside, baby"
She looked at me and said
"Come on in, I wanna talk to you"
I got a brother who left home
He was twelve years old
Just like the prodigal son
I know you'd find himEmbed
