Two Zips Lyrics
Big Paul went down to Don Carlo for permission to have you whacked
It came this close
I told Don Carlo you were like a son to me
That touched the old man
He told Paul to give you a pass
But if Don Carlo had said you gotta go, I would've come here today with these two zips and you would go

How you perform under pressure, that's a man's measure
Blam the Desert, you compare to me never
My pleasure, .44 you up for a small treasure
Line you up like a Wahl edger
Poor fella, in stormy wеather, walk with the umbrella
I see your еrrors more now than ever
My wolves'll snack on ya, while I relax in the sauna
Your rap's worth a glass of tap water
So back up off a black enforcer, that's an order
Five hundred stacks, that's an offer
Bassmaster, catch an orca, that'll cost ya
While I crack crab on a glass saucer
Applesauce Porsche trucks
Pull up like Chauncey Billups
Niggas is hit up, fuck penthouse, pin-ups
Pimp cups been filled up
Penny fields concealed, steel tucked
Slide dick in Brazilian cut buds, bust nuts
Trilliant cut touch, unfamiliar muggs is mugged
When stray slugs flood, play the tub
Them boys sell snow, the dough like an oil well flow
That's on the low like COINTELPRO
Shells blow, you red as Elmo, the tale's well known
I still feel compelled just to tell folks
'bout how we went from the ghetto to Melrose, get elbows
Enjoy Ls on sail boats
FILA flip-flops, felines ponder the dick size
Squander chips, live big time
Prada kicks, Swiss wristwatch, your Bentley tick-tock
Amongst men that rhyme we are demigods
Rims is 20" large, push big dog cars
Call 'em St. Bernards Benton, huh
Look. I said fuckin' look at him!
Look at what happened to ya friend 'cause you gotta go against the way the things go down
You treat what I try to do for you like shit?
You don't wanna work for me, what's wrong with you?
And then, you carry a piece, in my house!
You one of those burned-out demolished wackos in the joint?
You're scary, because you don't give a fuck
But don't come onto me now with your jailhouse bullshit 'cause you are not that guy, don't you get it, you prick?Embed
