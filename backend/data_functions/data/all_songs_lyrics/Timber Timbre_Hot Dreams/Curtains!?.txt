Curtains!? Lyrics
Picture me, a magazine
Empty in the night
No there isn't much redeeming
About this dawn's breaking light

Curtains, I could have it all
The window, the view, the second story fall

Creased and doubled up
Hung out on the tracks
She said a diamond wouldn't hurt
And that I should have rolled it back

Curtains, on the quiet side
Curtains can conceal what it is they were to hide1Embed
