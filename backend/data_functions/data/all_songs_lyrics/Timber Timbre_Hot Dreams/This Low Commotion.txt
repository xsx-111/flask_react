This Low Commotion Lyrics
What does it mean to be unhealthy badly, my love?
To be in a bad state so well
What does it mean to face desire so sadly?
To beg at the empty well

Residual images hover above
I'm just a dog, a machine for your love
D'you know every man, every place that you've been?
You turned me on, then you turned on me

This low commotion, this low commotion
This low commotion, this low commotion
Is going down, down, down, down
This low commotion, this low commotion
This low commotion

America, weren't you a miracle?
A fleeting chance at home
But this low, low, low commotion
Would not leave our paradise alone

And my two hands landed
Like two spiders on your knees
And one right ring finger branded
But two legs for two brains to please
Residual images hover above
I'm just a dog, a machine for your love
But to know every man, every face that you'd seen
Baby, you turned me on, then you turned on me

This low commotion, this low commotion
This low commotion, this low commotion
This low commotion is going down, is going down, it's gone down
It's going down, it's going down, it's going down, it's going down
Your low commotion, your low commotion
Your low commotion, your low commotionEmbed
