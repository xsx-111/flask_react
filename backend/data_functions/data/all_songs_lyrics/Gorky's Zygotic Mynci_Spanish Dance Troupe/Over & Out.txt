Over & Out LyricsAs he flew right over the ocean
Said that's it i'm over and out
Though i started young as a lover
Now i'm just burning out
And his voice used to soar so high
Close your eyes for california sky
When one day melts into the other
Children still know the way
As he flew right over the ocean
Said that's it i'm over and out
Though started young as a lover
Now i'm just burning outEmbed
