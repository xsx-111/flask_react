Spanish Dance Troupe Lyrics
Woke up on Monday and got ready for school
Put on my uniform, it was three sizes too small
I said "dear, dear, dear teacher
I've been six years away
And ain't finished my essay
Coz rock'n'roll rules ok!"

My conclusion this summer
Was there was much too much rain
So I ran off on Thursday
With a dance troupe from Spain
Where wine, dance and music
Is the name of the game
From Bilbao to Madrid
My mind ain't been the same

Oh, the rehearsals went easy
And I'd learnt all the moves
I was playing a tree trunk in a forest of fools
Now Maria moved real good, and I could if I would
But when your mind's your prison
Things just don't seem so good
And then we'll be married
Then we'll be happy
And then we'll be married
Then we'll be happy
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh1Embed
