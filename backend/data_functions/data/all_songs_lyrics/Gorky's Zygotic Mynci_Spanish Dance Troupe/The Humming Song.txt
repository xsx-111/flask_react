The Humming Song Lyrics
You moved away faster than the seasons
With the closest love in their eyes
And now that you're gone, were you ever there at all?
Only crows in the trees welcome you back home

In Summer we collapse into the sea
In Winter old times in the snow, don't know

Your face it means nothing to me
And your windows I have never seen through
And in a place nowhere no one can come together
Some people they leave home every day

In Summer we collapse into the sea
In Winter old dunes in the snow, don't know
And nothing calls you back no more

But this is the humming song
You're sing it when you're on your own
And cash back in the hand
This was your promised land
But this is the Humming Song
Sing it when you're on your own
And cash back in the hand
This was your promised land

But this is the Humming Song
Sing it when you're on your ownEmbed
