Desolation Blues LyricsHe's got the desolation blues
Here they come again
Tried to sell them even set up a stand
But no one touched them with right or left hand
The fortunes are twisting and a fixing for you
One look in her eyes and you'll know it's true
Could be a lifetime in a second or two
Where does he go nobody knows
When the stars they start to shine
Writing his songs held so dear
That no one wants to hear
Seen the sun set too many times before
Sad songs are here to stay
When you're lost at sea this way
I'd move to the country if it could do good
To get away seems the thing to do
But when i look in the mirror i see you
Where does he go nobody knows
When the stars they start to shine
Writing his songs held so dear
That no one wants to hearEmbed
