Hallway LyricsShe ain't walking down that hallway anymore
She is gone after eighteen years no more
But her memory lives on in a children's song
She ain't walking down that hallway anymore
I sometimes make out a whisper or a sigh
Then it's hard when you break down to cry
But in the summertime when the flowers bloom
I will take some time and think of youEmbed
