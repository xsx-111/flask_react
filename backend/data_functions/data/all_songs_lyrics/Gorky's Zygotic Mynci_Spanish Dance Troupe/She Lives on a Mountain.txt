She Lives on a Mountain Lyrics
She lives on a mountain
Her house only one around
And i'd seen her once or twice
When she came into town
And it was soon that I started dreaming
How my friends would laugh at me
Saying no hermit girl like she
Could fall in love with me
So I looked to the river
And I looked to the sea
I looked in my own mirror
But no traces I could see

So beautiful to see
Before the night is through
Could I fall in love with you?

And she lives on a mountain
Her house only one around
She lives on a mountain
Her face is all around
With storm clouds up above
Still no rain from above....Embed
