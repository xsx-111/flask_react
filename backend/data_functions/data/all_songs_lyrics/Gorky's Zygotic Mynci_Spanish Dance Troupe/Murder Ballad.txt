Murder Ballad LyricsDown where the eagle flies
That's where my love lies
She tastes fruit of different colours
Hand in hand with another ooh ooh
Working in the field for night three days
His return brings shame to say
His true love with his dear brother
Wrapped in his sheets holding one another ooh ooh
From that moment he saw red
Thoughts of murder plagued his head
Took the dagger from his side
Drove through the hearts of them that lied ooh ooh
Down where the eagle flies
That's where my love lies
It was just and it was right
To end their lives this winter's nightEmbed
