Faraway Eyes LyricsFaraway eyes, faraway dreams
And faraway schemes
Set out in stone
These are the rules for being alone
What happened to the time
When we came together?
We're knocking on the door so let us in
Faraway eyes, faraway dreams
And faraway schemes
Bout a year ago looked to the sky just saw lies
In the shivering cold
Love your soul dust heaped bowl
What happened to the time
When we came together?
We're knocking on the door so let us in
Faraway eyes, faraway skies turned to lies
What happened to the time
When we came together?
We're knocking on the door so let us in
Faraway eyes, faraway dreams
And faraway schemesEmbed
