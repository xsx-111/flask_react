Freckles Lyrics
Freckles come out with the sun
And we're waiting for heaven on
I bide my time kicking up the sand
Then late at night I'd ask the stars above
Where is my love? oh oh oh

So watch the sun Jody brown eyes
And you're my only one Jody brown eyes
When I was young dreamt of Jody brown eyes
No hit and run Jody brown eyes

She had her dreams she had mine too
We stuck them together and bad times you know where
Now the light of a film reflects her face
And we're waiting for heaven on earth oh oh oh

So watch the sun Jody brown eyes
And you're my only one Jody brown eyes
When I was young dreamt of Jody brown eyes
No hit and run Jody brown eyesEmbed
