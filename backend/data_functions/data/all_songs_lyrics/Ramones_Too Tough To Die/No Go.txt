No Go Lyrics
I got a call late Saturday night, alright
Yeah I got a call late Saturday night, alright
Beat, dead, burnt out from the night before
I wanted to go but couldn't take it no more
Beat, dead, burnt out you know what I mean
My brain was racing but my feet wouldn't scream

Let's go, let's go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

My brain was racing but my feet wouldn't go

Let's go, let's go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's go, let's go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

My brain was racing but my feet wouldn't go

Hey
I wanted to go
Oh no
I wanted to go
Oh no
I wanted to go
Oh no
Oh no, ho
Let's flyEmbed
