Howling at the Moon (Sha-La-La) Lyrics
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la

Ships are docking
Planes are landing
A never ending supply
No more narco
No more gangster
Conservatives can cry

I took the law and threw it away
Because there's nothing wrong
It's just for play

There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and
Give to the poor

Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
It was glowing, glowing, glowing
Glowing in the dark
It was sparkling, sparkling, sparkling
Sparkling in the night

I took the law and threw it away
Because there's nothing wrong
It's just for play

There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and
Give to the poor

Winter turns to summer
Sadness turns to fun
Keep the faith, baby
You broke the rules and won

Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Keep it glowing, glowing,glowing
I'm not hurting anyone
Keep it glowing, smoking, glowing
I'm howling at the moon

I took the law and threw it away
Because there's nothing wrong
It's just for play

There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and
Give to the poor

Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby

I took the law and threw it away
Because there's nothing wrong
It's just for play
There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and
Give to the poor

Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-laEmbed
