Daytime Dilemma (Dangers Of Love) Lyrics
She came from a happy home
A very happy home
A very happy home
Miss personality, a grade 'A' student naturally
She had it all worked out

But things aren't what they seem
Is this real or just a dream?
And things will never ever be the same again

She came from a happy home
A very happy home
A home of happiness
Miss personality, a grade 'A' student naturally
She had it all in place

But things aren't what they seem
Is this real or just a dream?
And things will never ever be the same again

The dangers
It's the dangers of love
Yeah, yeah
The dangers
It's the dangers
She came from a happy home
A very happy home
A very happy scene
She caught him with another
It turns out it was her mother
What a tragedy

Can things be what they seem?
Is this just some crazy dream?
Things may never ever be the same again

The dangers
It's the dangers of love
Yeah, yeah
The dangers
It's the dangers

Keep telling lies, but you did
You know you did
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming

The dangers
It's the dangers of love
Yeah, yeah
The dangers
It's the dangers
What went wrong, she couldn't tell
But we know it all too well

The dangers
It's the dangers of love
Yeah, yeah
The dangers
It's the dangers
The dangers
It's the dangers of love
Yeah, yeah
The dangers
It's the dangers
The dangers
It's the dangers of love
Yeah, yeah
The dangers
It's the dangers1Embed
