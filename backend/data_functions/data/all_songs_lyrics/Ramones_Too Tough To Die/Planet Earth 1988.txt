Planet Earth 1988 Lyrics
The solution to peace isn't clear
The terrorist threat is a modern fear
There are no jobs for the young
They turn to crime and turn to drugs
Battle ships crowd the sea
16 year olds in the army
Our jails are filled to the max
Discrimination against the blacks

Planet Earth 1988
Planet Earth 1988
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late!

Russian and American war machine
Will destroy mankind's dream
They shoot their missiles in the air
They do not care, they do not care
Guerrilla armies rule the street
No more Christmas or trick or treat
Is this what the future will bring?
I pray for peace more than anything

Planet Earth 1988
Planet Earth 1988
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late!
The solution to peace isn't clear
The terrorists threat is a modern fear
There is no future for the youth
There is no hope for the young
Death destruction bombs galore
The rich are laughing at the poor
Our jails are filled to the max
Discrimination against the blacks

Planet Earth 1988
Planet Earth 1988
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late!Embed
