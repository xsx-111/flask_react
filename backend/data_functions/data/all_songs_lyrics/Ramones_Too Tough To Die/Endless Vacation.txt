Endless Vacation Lyrics
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation

I kill myself I kill the pain
A suicide death a suicide game
My skull is bleaching in the dust
My rage turns to insane lust
All depressed all alone
I drift into the danger zone
Deadly spitten cobra life of crime
I want revenge I want what's mine

Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation

Like takin' Carrie to the high school prom
Something's always goin' wrong
Hair trigger temper tormented mind
Deadly spitten cobra I am losin' kind
The heart is the place devils congregate
When you're raised on andiet of bickering at hate
Hair trigger temper tormented mind
Deadly spitten cobra I'm losin' kind
One, two, three, four
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacation
Endless vacationEmbed
