Wart Hog Lyrics
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog

I take some dope, I feel so sick
It's a sick world, sick, sick, sick
Drugs and bitches and junkies and fags
Artificial phonies, I hate it, hate it
Death, death, death it's the price I'll pay
It's a sick world, what can I say?
No such thing as an even break
It's steal and cheat, take, take, take, take

Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog

I wanna puke, I can't sit still
Just took some drugs and I feel ill
It's a sick world, sick, sick, sick
It's a hopeless life, I hate it, hate it
It's a joke, it's a lie, it's a rip-off bet
It's an outlaw life, we're a renegade band
Doomsday visions of commies and queers
Artificial phonies, I hate it, hate it
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hog
Wart, wart hogEmbed
