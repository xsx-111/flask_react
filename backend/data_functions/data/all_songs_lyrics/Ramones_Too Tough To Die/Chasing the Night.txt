Chasing the Night Lyrics
Standing here in front of the mirror
It's going to be all right tonight
Feeling hot, yeah I'm on fire
I'm never ever going to tire

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's gonna be alright

Live my life as I choose
I paid the price, paid my dues
You know I need no alibi
Daytime troubles fading
Nights intoxicating
Going to have it all tonight
That is no lie

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Rock all night, sleep all day
It don't matter what they say
I'm never going to change my ways
I won't be back until Monday

Feeling exasperating, excitement generating
I'm never ever going to tire
City is overloading, the circuits are exploding
I'm not coming down, no I'm too wired

Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Tonight, it's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
It's gonna be alright
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's gonna be alrightEmbed
