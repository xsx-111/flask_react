Anti-Summersong LyricsHere now, long gone
Three freaks in a Vanagon
Went to the river but the river got dry
And all the good people were hanging around
Too little, too late
Everybody gotta medicate
Through the winter when the winter comes down
Or this city comes a hanging ground
I'm not going on
Just to sing another summer song
So long, farewell
Don't everybody fall all over themselves
I'm not (he's not) going on (going on)
Just to sing another summer song
So long (see ya later), farewell
Don't everybody fall all over themselves
I'm not going on
Just to sing another singalong suicide song
So long (see ya later), farewell
Don't everybody fall all over themselves
So, don't everybody fall all over themselves
Don't everybody fall all over themselves1Embed
