The Wrong Year Lyrics
Grey Jane was a river child
Born down by the river wild
Said, "Hey what I wanna be
Nobody's gonna intervene"

And she wants you
But you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls
On the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

Could be that he's into you
Could be that the obverse is true
Struck down as a summer child
Ten steps just to run a mile

And he wants you
But you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls
On the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
The spirit's willing
(Ohhh)
The flesh is getting bored
(Ohhh)
The speaker's blaring
Out some long-forgotten chord
Some misbegotten, long-forgotten chord

Sing me some Eidolon
And I'll sleep all the winter long
Till then I can only be
Nobody's gonna intervene

And she wants you
But you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls
On the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
