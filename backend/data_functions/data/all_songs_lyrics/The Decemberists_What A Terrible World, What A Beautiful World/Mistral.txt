Mistral Lyrics
So we already wrecked the rental car
And I’ve already lost my way
My feet entombed in this tourist bar
For a day, anyway
So lay me out on the cobblestone
And unfurl this aching jib
The streets all built on ancient bones
And the crib, are the ribs

Won’t the mistral
Blow it all away?
Won’t the mistral
Blow away?
Won’t the mistral
Blow it all away?
Won’t it blow, won’t it blow, won’t it blow

So it’s me and you and the baby boy
And a Ford to share the weight
Reeking out a little joy
What a waste, back to the States

Won’t the mistral
Blow it all away? (Won’t it blow it down?)
Won’t the mistral
Blow away?
Won’t the mistral
Blow it all away? (Won’t it blow it down?)
Won’t it blow, won’t it blow, won’t it blowEmbed
