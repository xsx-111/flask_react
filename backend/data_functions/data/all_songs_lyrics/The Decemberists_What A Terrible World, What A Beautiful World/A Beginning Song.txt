A Beginning Song Lyrics
Let's commence to coordinate our sights
Get them square to rights
Get them square to rights
Condescend to calm this riot in your mind
Find yourself in time
Find yourself in time

If I am waiting
Should I be waiting?
If I am wanting
Should I be wanting?
When all around me
All around me

Document the world inside your skin
The tenor of your shins
The timbre of your limbs
Now commence to kick each brick apart
To center on your heart
Starting with your heart (bright heart)

If I am waiting
Should I be waiting?
If I am wanting
Should I be wanting?
When all around me
All around me
When all around me
When all around me
When all around me
If I am waiting
Should I be waiting?
If I am wanting
Should I be wanting?
If I am hopeful
Should I be hopeful?
When all around me
All around me
Is the sunlight
Is the shadows
Is the quiet
Is the word
Is the beating heart
Is the ocean
Is the boys
Is you
My sweet love (my sweet love)
Oh, my love (oh my love)
And the light, bright light
And the light, bright light
Bright light, bright light
It's all around me
It's all around me
It's all around me
It's all around me
It's all around meEmbed
