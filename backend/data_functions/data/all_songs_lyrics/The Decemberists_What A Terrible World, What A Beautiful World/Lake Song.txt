Lake Song Lyrics
Down by the lake we were overturning pebbles
And upending all the animals alight
And I took a drag from your cigarette and pinched it
'Tween my finger and my thumb, till it had died
And the sun burned low on the radio

Say that you will, say you will or will you won't
Or you whatever you prevaricate your whole life, don't you?
This much I can say: I would've waited till the oceans
Fell away and all the sunken cities would reveal themselves to you
But you won't, will you? Because you never do
And the sun burned through sweet as honeydew

And I, seventeen and terminally fey
I wrote it down and threw it all away
Never gave a thought to what I paid
And you, all sibylline, reclining in your pew
You tattered me, you tethered me to you
The things you would, and the things you wouldn't do
To tell the truth I never had a clue

Now we arise to curse those young suburban villains
And their ill-begotten children from the lawn
Come to me now, and on this station wagon window
Set the ghost of your two footprints
That they might haunt me when you're gone
And when the light broke dawn, you were forever gone
But I remember you: you were full
You were full and sweet as honeydew
And I, seventeen and terminally fey
I wrote it down and threw it all away
And never gave a thought to what I paid
And you, all sibylline, reclining in your pew
You tattered me, you tethered me to you
The things you would, and the things you wouldn't do
You noticed how I never had a clue, never had a clue
You were full and sweet as honeydew
You were full and sweet as honeydew2Embed
