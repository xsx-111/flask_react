12/17/12 Lyrics
What a gift, what a gift you've been givin' me
Here with my heart so whole, while others may be grieving
Think of their grieving
And oh my boy, don't you know you are dear to me
You are a breath of life and a light upon the water
A light upon the water

And oh, my love, if you only knew how I long for you
How I waste my days wishin' you would come around
Just to have you around
What a dear, what a sweet little baby
This cannonball in the bosom of your belly
It's just a kick in your belly

And oh my God, what a world you have made here
What a terrible world, what a beautiful world
What a world you have made here
What a world you have made here
What a world you have made hereEmbed
