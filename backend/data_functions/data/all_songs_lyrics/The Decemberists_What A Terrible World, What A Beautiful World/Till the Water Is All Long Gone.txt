Till the Water Is All Long Gone LyricsThey came down from the mountain
They'd strayed too long from the fountain
And all the while, all the while they longed for us
But I won't betray
No I won't betray
No I won't betray our water
No I won't betray
No I won't betray
No I won't betray our water
Till the water's all long gone
And you, my sweet flower
And how you grew more sweet by the hour
And loath was I, loath was I to lose you
My tender rose, my limber rose
My slender loping daughter
My tender rose, my slender rose
My limber loping daughter
But my daughter's long long gone
They came down from the mountain
They'd strayed too long from the fountain
Oh my girl, oh my love I've lost you
But I won't betray
No I won't betray
No I won't betray our water
No I won't betray
No I won't betray
No I won't betray our water
Till the water's all long gone1Embed
