Carolina Low Lyrics
I am a boy from the high country
And I got a little love for the offering
I come down from the mountain
Bow to the sea
And Carolina Low, I will carry thee

Gonna take you up, gonna take you 'round
But O your poor little pant legs, all dragging down
Did you crack your lip? Did you skin your knee?
Carolina Low, I will carry thee

What is sealed with a handshake
Spoiled with a kiss
You got a ugly little mouth, boy
It's come to this
I'm bound for the hilltop
Gonna make it bleed
And Carolina Low, I will carry thee

I am a boy from the high country
And I got a little love for the offering
And I got a little love for the offering
And I got a little love for the offering3Embed
