The Singer Addresses His Audience LyricsWe know, we know, we belong to ya
We know you built your life around us
Would we change, we had to change some
We know, we know, we belong to ya
We know you threw your arms around us
In the hopes we wouldnâ€™t change
But we had to change some
You know, to belong to you
We're aware that you cut your hair
In a style that our drummer wore
In the video
But with fame came a mountain claimed
For the evermore
You know
So when your bridal processional
Is a televised confessional
To the benefits of Axe shampoo
You know we did it for you
We did it all for you
Cause we know, we know, we belong to ya
We know you built your life around us
And would we change, we had to change some
You know, to belong to you
You know, to belong to you
You know, to belong to you
You know, to belong to you
To belong, to belong, to belong
To belong, to belong, to belong
To belong, to belong, to belong
To belong, to belong, to belong
To belong, to belong, to belong
(To belong, to belong)
(To belong to you),(To belong to you)
(To belong to you),(To belong to you)
(To belong to you),(To belong to you)
(To belong to you)3Embed
