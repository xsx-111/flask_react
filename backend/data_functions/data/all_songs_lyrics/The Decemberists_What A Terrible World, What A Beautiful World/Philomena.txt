Philomena LyricsOh, Philomena, you in a tawdry gown
Lean to your window, let slip a ribbon down
A cure to your boredom, if only you’d let me go
Down, down, down
Long summer days can lead to lazy vices
Boys all in idle, left to their own devices
Open up your linen lap and let me go
Down, down, down
All I ever wanted in the world
Was just to live to see a naked girl
But I found I quickly bored
I wanted more, I wanted more
So I’ll be your candle and I’ll be your statuette
And I’ll be your lashing loop of leatherette
And oh Philomena, if only you'd let me go
Down, down, down
All I ever wanted in the world
Was just to live to see a naked girl
But I found I quickly bored
I wanted more, oh, so much more
So I’ll be your candle and I’ll be your statuette
And I’ll be your lashing loop of leatherette
And oh Philomena, if only you'd let me go
Down, down, down
Go down, down, down
Go down, down, down
To go down3Embed
