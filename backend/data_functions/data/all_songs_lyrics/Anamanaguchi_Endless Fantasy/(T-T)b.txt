(T-T)b LyricsYour natural state is enlightenment
Everything else you've ever been told about yourself is a lie
We are trying to wake ourselves up
Because we come from source energy, and we are all one
We have to realize that our brothers and sisters
That we are seeing in the dream are
Mere reflections of our inner self
Yin and yang, love and hate
People that we dislike are
Mere reflections of our own character defects
People that we like and love are
True successful manifestations
Of our deepest, most inner self
We are beings of light
Our mission is to be creation
Create positive energy on Spaceship Earth
Anamanaguchi, dude
It's all because of you that we did all this tonight
And I had a rad night
Thank you, this is The Illusion
I ran long as always, dude
'Cause I get so fired up on the dream
Endless fantasyEmbed
