Japan Air Lyrics
Through the snow we're chasing
So fast my heart's racing
Flying down mountains so tall
They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up
So fast try not to fall

Won't you ride with me?
Far away from the day
Break from the nighttime too
(Turn off the lights, let's go!)

All I want to do
Is run away
Jump on my board
And just spend time with you
And in my heart
Don't think I want to celebrate
Without you here
With me
And can you see it
That I'm falling through the snow
Without you here?
I thought I'd never be alone
Until you went away

They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up
They all try to keep up
They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up

Boy, you know I'm gonna treat you right
You're melting the ice around my heart
Hit me faster than a snowballEmbed
