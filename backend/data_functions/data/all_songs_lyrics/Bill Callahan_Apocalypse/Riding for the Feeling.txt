Riding for the Feeling LyricsIt's never easy to say goodbye to the faces
So rarely do we see another one
So close and so long
I asked the room if I'd said enough
No one really answered
They just said "Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go"
All this leaving is never ending
I kept hoping for one more question
Or for someone to say
"Who do you think you are?"
So I could tell them
With intensity, a drop evaporates by law
In conclusion, leaving is easy
When you've got some place you need to be
I'm giving up this gig for another season
With the TV on mute
I'm listening back to the tapes
On the hotel bed
My my my apocalypse
My my my apocalypse
I realized I had said very little about waves or wheels
Or riding for the feeling, riding for the feeling
Is the fastest way to reach the shore, on water or land
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
What if I had stood there at the end and said again and again
In answer to every question
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the riding
For the riding
And for the ride
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Would that have been a suitable goodbye?1Embed
