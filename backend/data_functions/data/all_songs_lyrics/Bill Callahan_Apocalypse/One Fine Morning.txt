One Fine Morning LyricsOne fine morning, I'm gonna ride out
Yeah, one fine morning, I'm gonna ride out
Just me and the skeleton crew
We're gonna ride out in a country kind of silence
We're gonna ride out in a country silence
Yea, one fine morning
Yeah, it's all coming back to me now
My apocalypse
My apocalypse
The curtain rose and burned in the morning sun
Yeah, the curtain rose and burned in the morning sun
And the mountains
And the mountains bowed down in the morning sun
Like a ballet of the heart
Yeah, the mountains bowed down like a ballet
In the morning sun
And the baby and we all lay in state
The baby and we all lay in state
And I said, "Hey! No more drovering!"
I said, "Hey! No more drovering!"
When the earth turns cold
And the earth turns black
Will I feel you riding on my back?
Yeah, when the earth turns cold
And the earth turns black
Will I feel you riding on my back?
For I am a part of the road
Yeah, I am a part of the road
The hardest part
The hardest part
My apocalypse
