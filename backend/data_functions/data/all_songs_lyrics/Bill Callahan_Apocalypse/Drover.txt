Drover Lyrics
The real people went away
But I'll find a better way someday
Leaving only me and my dreams
My cattle
And a resonator
I drove all the beasts down
Right under your nose
The lumbering footloose power
The bull and the rose
Don't touch them
Don't try to hurt them
My cattle
Tss, tss
I drove them by the crops
And thought the crops were lost
I consoled myself
With rudimentary thoughts
And I set my watch
Against the city clock
It was way off
One thing about this wild, wild country
It takes a strong, strong, it breaks a strong, strong mind
One thing about this wild, wild country
It takes a strong, strong, it breaks a strong, strong mind
And anything less, anything less, makes me feel like I'm wasting my time
But the pain and frustration is not mine
It belongs to the cattle
Through the valley
And when my cattle turns on me
I was knocked back flat
I was knocked out cold for one clack of the train track
And then I rose a colossal hand
Buried in sand
I rose like a drover
For I am, in the end, a drover
A drover by trade
And when my cattle turns on me, I am a drover double fold
My cattle bears it all away for me and everyone
One thing about this wild, wild country
It takes a strong, strong, it breaks a strong, strong mind
And anything less, anything less, makes me feel like I'm wasting my time1Embed
