America!
America!
America!
You are so grand and golden
Oh I wish I was deep in America tonight
America!
America!
I watch David Letterman in Australia
America!
You are so grand and golden
I wish I was on the next flight
To America!
Captain Kristofferson!
Buck Sergeant Newbury!
Leatherneck Jones!
Sergeant Cash!
What an Army!
What an Air Force!
What a Marines!
America!
I never served my country

Afghanistan!
Vietnam!
Iran!
Native Americon!
America!
Well, everyone's allowed a past they don't care to mention
America!
America!
Well, it's hard to rouse a hog in Delta
And it can get tense around the Bible Belt
America!
America!
The lucky suckle teat
Others chaw pig knuckle meat
Ain't enough teat
Ain't enough teat
Ain't enough t'eat
Ain't enough teat
Ain't enough teat
Ain't enough t'eat
In America!
America!
America!
America!Embed
