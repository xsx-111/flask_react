Dear Avery LyricsDear Avery, I think of you only
Were you waving, were you dead on the vine?
Oh Avery, to think of you lonely
I could just grab you by the nape of your neck
There are times life will rattle your bones
And will bend your limbs
But you're still far and away
The boy you've ever been
So you bend back and shake at the frame
Of the frame you made
But don't you shake alone
Please, Avery, come home
Head strong, you and your long arms
Listing lazily on the cusp of your teens
But you were my Avery and when you needed saving
I could just grab you by the nape of your neck
There are times life will rattle your bones
And will bend your limbs
But you're still far and away
The boy you've ever been
So you bend back and shake at the frame
Of the frame you made
But don't you shake alone
Please, Avery, come home
Don't you shake alone
Please, Avery, come home3Embed
