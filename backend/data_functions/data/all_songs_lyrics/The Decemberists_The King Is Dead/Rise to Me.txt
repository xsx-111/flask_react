Rise to Me Lyrics
Big mountain, wide river
There's an ancient call
These tree trunks, these stream beds
Leave our bellies full

They sing out, "I am gonna stand my ground
You rise to me and I'll blow you down
I am gonna stand my ground
You rise to me and I'll blow you down"

Hey Henry, can you hear me?
Let me see those eyes
This distance between us
Can seem a mountain's size

But boy, you are gonna stand your ground
They rise to you, you blow them down
Let me see you stand your ground
They rise to you, you blow them down


My darling, my sweetheart
I am in your sway
Two cold climes, come spring time
So let me hear you say

My love, I am gonna stand my ground
They rise to me and I'll blow them down
I am gonna stand my ground
They rise to me and I'll blow them down
'Cause I am gonna stand my ground
You rise to me and I'll blow you down2Embed
