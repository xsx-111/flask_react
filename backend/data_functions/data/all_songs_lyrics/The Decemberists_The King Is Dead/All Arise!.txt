All Arise! LyricsBaby wants a new spin
Baby wants a broken heart
Hear you found a lynchpin to keep it all from falling apart
But you keep on rollin'
You keep on rollin'
Better find a way
Better kick it from your big, brown eyes
Hear it tightens up when you fall after fifteen tries
Like a ship at ocean
Like a ship at ocean
Like a ship at ocean
Like a ship at sea
You spit thick and you cross your heart
But the culvert's all run dry
From keeping shotgun shy all arise
Just be mine tonight
So the dollar-shop shoppers broke the lock and they knocked you down
Better call the coppers if you need someone to push you around
But you keep on stealin'
You keep on stealin'
Yes, you keep on stealin'
Well, there's nothing left to steal
You spit thick and you cross your heart
But the culvert's all run dry
From keeping shotgun shy all arise
Just be mine tonight
Just be mine tonight
Just be mine tonight1Embed
