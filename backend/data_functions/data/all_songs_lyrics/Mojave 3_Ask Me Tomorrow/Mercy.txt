Mercy LyricsYour virgin light is a golden flame
But it's burning, it's burning fast now
You crossed the line and you made a choice
You hurt the one you love now he needs you
Mercy I can't see your heart
I can't feel your love
Mercy I can't see your heart
I can't feel your love
Your life is like a song you're living like a fool
You're living like a fool but I can't tell you right
You're taking all the time you're taking all my time
You're living like a fool
And I can't tell you right
Mercy I can't see your heart
I can't feel your love
Mercy I can't see your heart
I can't feel your loveEmbed
