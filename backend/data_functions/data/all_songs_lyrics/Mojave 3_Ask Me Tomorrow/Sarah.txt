Sarah LyricsSarah I can't see
Your hair has grown too long
Been away for such a long time
Just can't find the words
Lonesome fools build lonesome walls
To hide behind and cry behind
But I'm not one
No, I'm not one
But I can't hide
I'm hurting babe
But I can't cry
'Cause I'm not one
Drew you a picture to remember
Threw it on the fire like a piece of pine
I pictured you mad
And I pictured you cold
Pictured you mean
And I pictured you bold
But I can't hide
I'm hurting babe
But I can't cry
Lay your love on me
Lay your love on me
Lay your love on me
Lay your love on meEmbed
