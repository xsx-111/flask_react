After All LyricsShow your light to the real world
They can't see, they can't see
Show your heart to the whole world
Let them know, let them know
After all we're only looking for a light
Just someone to hold us close
After all we're only looking for a love
Just something to make it right
Show a smile if you're lonely
Don't break your heart, don't break your heart
Just find something to believe in
And hold it tight, hold it tight
After all we're only looking for a light
Just someone to hold us close
After all we're only looking for a love
Just something to make it right1Embed
