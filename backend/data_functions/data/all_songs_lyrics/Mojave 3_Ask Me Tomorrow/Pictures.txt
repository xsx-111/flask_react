Pictures LyricsThe picture you gave me seemed so sad today
Secrets still hid behind your eyes
Blinded and foolish we seemed happy then
I don't believe I realised all your worth
Picture I'm cold and I can't feel your warmth
I can't feel anything but I think it's all that I
Picture I can't see, one of us must be
Feeling down, feeling down
You took me in you gave me life
And you gave me love
I've paid you back with disregard and lies
If I love you now I loved you then
If I miss you now I missed you then
And I'm sorry, so sorry
Picture I'm cold and I can't feel your warmth
I can't feel anything but I feel okay, feel okay
Picture I can't see, one of us must be
One of us must be feeling down, feeling down
And I feel alright
I'm feeling just fine
Feeling just fineEmbed
