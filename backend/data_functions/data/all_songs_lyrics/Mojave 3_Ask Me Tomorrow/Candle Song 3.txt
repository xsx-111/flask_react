Candle Song 3 LyricsIt's christmas again so we lit all the candles
And we tried to pretend that your room was a palace
But we can't seem to shake off the fear
That nothing is different, that no-one has changed
Nothing has changed
I stand by my lover as she stands by me
Chained to my lover as she's chained to me
We've been through the past and the pain
The love that was lost
And we know all the answers
We've taken all our chances and let them drift by
It's time to be free yeah it's time to be free
Standing so close I can't see you at all
I stand by my lover as she stands by me
Chained to my lover as she's chained to me
But your books don't say much about
Living your life like a thief
Yeah we've handcuffed and chained
We play games and play them out slowly
Chained to my lover as she's chained to me
Chained to my lover as she's chained to me
Chained to my lover as she's chained to me
Chained to my lover as she's chained to meEmbed
