Where Is the Love LyricsJennifer says that you've changed
She says that you're talking so strange
She laughed when I told her I'd messed
You around, tried to be kind when I cried
Where is the life that we had
Where is the love
Where is the hand that I held
Where is the love
Sister don't ask me
I'm a fool I'm a liar
And I can't see home
I saw you last week when you cried
You threw me aside with a line
Wish that I could just tell you I care
I love you I need you and I'm still scared
Cathy I'm cold I don't mean to be bold
But I need you to find me again
I'm wasted I'm fried I'm a fool I'm a liar
But I need you to hold me again
Where is the life that we had
Where is the love
Where is the hand that I held
Where is the love
Sister don't ask me
I'm a fool I'm a liar
And I can't see home
Where is the life that we had
Where is the love
Where is the hand that I held
Where is the loveEmbed
