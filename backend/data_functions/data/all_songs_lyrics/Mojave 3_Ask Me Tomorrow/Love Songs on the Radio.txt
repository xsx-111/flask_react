Love Songs on the Radio Lyrics
She looks just like an angel
When she walks across the room
She shines tonight, her golden light
Is everything I need

Lovers all around her
She wears them like her jewels
My friend said she's all he needs to feel alive

Love songs on the radio
Your sweetheart lies in bed
She's dreaming of the things you said
She's hoping that it's meant


Love songs on the radio
Your sweetheart lies in bed
She's dreaming of the things you said
She's hoping that it's meant

She looks just like an angel
When she walks across the room
She shines tonight, her golden light
Is everything I need
