Lookout Mountain LyricsIf I throw myself off Lookout Mountain
No more for my soul to keep
I wonder who will drive my car
I wonder if my Mom will weep
If I throw myself off Lookout Mountain
No more pain my soul to bear
No more worries about paying taxes
What to eat, what to wear
Who will end up with my records?
Who will end up with my tapes?
Who's gonna pay my credit card bills?
Who's gonna pay for my mistakes?
If I throw myself off Lookout Mountain who will ever hear my songs?
Who's gonna mow the cemetery when all of my family's gone?
Who will Mom and Daddy find to continue the family name?
Who will stand there taking credit, who will lay there passing blame?
Who will lay there passing blame?
Who will lay there passing blame?1Embed
