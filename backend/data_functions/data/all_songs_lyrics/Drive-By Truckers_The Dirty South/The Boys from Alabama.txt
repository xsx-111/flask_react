The Boys from Alabama LyricsWe're gonna take you up to McNairy County, Tennessee, back in the days when Sheriff Buford Pusser ran things around there. Sheriff Buford Pusser was tryin' to clean up McNairy County, Tennessee from all them bootleggers that was bringin' crime and corruption and illegal liquor into his little dry county. And for his troubles, he got ambushed, and his wife was murdered and his house got blown up, and they made a movie about it called Walking Tall. This is the other side of that story:
Well, they caught you smoking grass and the judge threw the book
And I saw a little opportunism in your look
You can take it from me, boy, take it from a crook
I got friends on the inside and friends on the outside
They'll sneak up beside you so keep on their good side
I can see you standing there, staring down at your shoes
Thinking about your Mom and Dad and wondering what to do
Well you best look inside yourself, boy, we're all watching you
We got friends in jail who can see you through
Boy, don't forget, no matter what you do
Don't piss off the Boys from Alabama
You know we won't let it slide
They might find your body in the Tennessee River
Or they might not find it at all
There'll be no place to run and hide
And your family ain't safe at all
So don't piss off the Boys from Alabama
We're keeping an eye on you
We're keeping an eye on you
Don't piss off the Boys from Alabama
Better take it like a man
Ain't nobody gonna stick anything up your ass
If you remember who your friends are
We got good help down in Franklin County
They'll hunt you like a dog
You can take your fall or lose it all
The choice is up to you
I wouldn't piss off the Boys from Alabama if I was youEmbed
