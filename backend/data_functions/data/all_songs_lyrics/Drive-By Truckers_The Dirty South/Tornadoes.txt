Tornadoes LyricsThe clouds started forming five o'clock PM
The funnel clouds touched down five miles north of Russellville
Siren's were blowing, clouds spat rain
And as the thing went through, I swear, It sounded like a train
It came without no warning said Bobby Jo McLean
She and husband Nolen always loved to watch the rain
It sucked him out the window, he ain't come home again
All she can remember's that it sounded like a train
Pieces of that truckstop
Litter up the highway
I been told
And I hear that missing trucker ended up in Kansas
(or maybe it was Oz)
The Nightmare Tour ended for my band and me
The night all the shit went down
A homecoming concert, the night the tornadoes hit my home town
The few who braved the weather were sucked out of the auditorium
I can still remember the sound of their applause in the rain
As it echoed through them storm clouds, I swear, It sounded like a trainEmbed
