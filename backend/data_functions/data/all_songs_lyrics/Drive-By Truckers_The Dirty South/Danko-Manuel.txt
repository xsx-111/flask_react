Danko/Manuel LyricsLet the night air cool you off
Tilt your head back and try to cough
Don't say nothin' 'bout the things you never saw
Let the night air cool you off
I ain't livin' like I should
A little rest might do me good
Got to sinkin' in the place where I once stood
Now I ain't livin' like I should

Can you hear that singing? Sounds like gold
Maybe I can only hear it my head
Fifteen years ago they owned that road
Now it's rolling over us instead
Richard Manuel is dead
God forbid you call their bluff
Like the nightmares ain't enough
Remember when we used to think that we were tough?
God forbid you call their bluff
First they make you out to be
The only pirate on the sea
And they say Danko would have sounded just like me
Is that the man I want to be?
Can you hear that singing? Sounds like gold
Maybe I can make it bigger overseas
Fifteen years ago they owned that road
Now it only gives us somewhere else to leave
Something else you can't believe

Can you hear that singing? Sounds like gold
Maybe I can hear poor Richard from the grave
Singin' when to reap and where to sow
When you've found another home you have to leave
Something else you can't believe
Something else you can't believeEmbed
