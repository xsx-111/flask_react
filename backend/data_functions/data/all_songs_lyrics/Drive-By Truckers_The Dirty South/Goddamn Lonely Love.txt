Goddamn Lonely Love LyricsI got green and I got blues
And every day there's a little less difference between the two
So I belly up and disappear
Well I ain't really drowning cause I see the beach from here
I could take a Greyhound home
But when I got there youâ€™d be gone
Along with everything a home is made up of
So I'll take two of what you're having
And I'll take all of what you got
To kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
Sister, listen to what your daddy says
Don't be ashamed of things that hide behind your dress
Belly up and arch your back
Well I ain't really falling asleep; I'm fading to black
You could come to me by plane
But that wouldn't be the same
As that old motel room in Texarkana was
So I'll take two of what you're having
And I'll take all of what you got
To kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
Stop me if you've heard this one before:
A man walks into a bar
And leaves before his ashes hit the floor
Stop me if I ever get that far
The sun's a desperate star
That burns like every single one before
And I could find another dream
One that keeps me warm and clean
But I ain't dreamin' anymore, girl, I'm waking up
So I'll take two of what you're having
And I'll take everything you got
To kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
All I got is this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
All I got is this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
All I got is this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely loveEmbed
