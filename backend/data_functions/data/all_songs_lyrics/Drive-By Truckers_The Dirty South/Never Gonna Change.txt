Never Gonna Change LyricsLet this be a lesson to you, girl:
Don't come around where you know you don't belong
They're riding on the avenue, they're prob'ly coming after you
And they all look mean and strong
Mean and strong like liquor
Mean and strong like fear
Strong like the people from South Alabama
And mean like the people from here
Take it from me
We ain't never gonna change
Daddy used to empty out his shotgun shells
And fill 'em full of black-eyed peas
He'd aim real low, and he'd tear out your ankles
And rip right through your knees
There ain't much traffic on the highway
There ain't much traffic on the lake
'Cause the ATF and the ABI
Got everything they could take
Take it from me
They didn't take it from me
Take it from me
We ain't never gonna change
We ain't doin' nothin' wrong
We ain't never gonna change
So shut your mouth and play along
Well, I thought about going in the army
I thought about going overseas
I wouldn't have trouble with a piss test
Only problem is my bad left knee
My brother got picked up at Parker's
Got him a ride in a new Crown Vic
They said that he was movin' on a federal level
But they couldn't really make it stick
Take it from me
We ain't never gonna change
We ain't doin' nothin' wrong
We ain't never gonna change
So shut your mouth and play along
You can throw me in the Colbert County jailhouse
You can throw me off the Wilson Dam
But there ain't much difference in the man I wanna be
And the man that I really am
We ain't never gonna change
We ain't doin' nothin' wrong
We ain't never gonna change
So shut your mouth and play along
We ain't never gonna change
We ain't never gonna change
We ain't never gonna change
We ain't never gonna changeEmbed
