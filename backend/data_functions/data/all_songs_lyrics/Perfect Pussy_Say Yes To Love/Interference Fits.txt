Interference Fits Lyrics
I never wanted any children
Just a nice apartment with open air
And big windows and all the flowers
And I could only ever see myself there
Yeah, I guess I was too hard for my own good
And then my friends began to fall in love
First with themselves and then with each other
I met my despair at midday light
And it was amazing, and I almost cried
Nothing that comes and goes is you
But you can compensate for love's sake
And say yes, and make something together
Something new

In times of roses who amazes now and here
And friends in dresses, interference fits
A thousand little ceremonies, we admit
We dress up to confront the coming year
There's something present that wasn't before
We fade into the background, man
Of filtered light where and when we can
And live out a thousand weird lives
In conversations of churches and veils and wives
And it makes me strong and unsinkable
It makes me sick, it makes the water undrinkable
It feels like singing badly in the clear
Since we began to dress to meet the year
When did we all decide to give up?
Since when do we say yes to love?
He broke in and he'll take what he can
It burns likes a curse and it fits on my hand
A cluster of opals and diamonds and scenes
Pay you a penny and stay where I stand
Trading the diamonds for some golden band
God, what am I doing with somebody's son?
In the same way a bulldozer studies an orchid
Yes, I am a student in the teachings of love
In the same way that shame changes love and we know it
Like your body moves into mine and outgrows it
And splits me from mouth down to thigh like a gun
What am I doing with somebody's son?
We knew better, we knew we would break
We gave it until we gave up
And we know that we compensate for love's sake
Now we say yes
We say yes
And so-2Embed
