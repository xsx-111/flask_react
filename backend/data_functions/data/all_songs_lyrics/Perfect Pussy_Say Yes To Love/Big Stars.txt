Big Stars LyricsIt's not stimulating
He likes celebrating
I had that sort of heart once
Now I still have more to lose than you
Do you - do you go
To meet their highest their fullest
I can only love
And move toward everyone
I learned what I could
About mistrust and
About truth in the erotic
And how it hurts so much, and
I know why you left
I know where I stand
Still I sit in front
Still I raise my hand
Okay, I'm finally damaged
Okay, I'm finally willing to talk
When threatened with love or arrest
I've been occupied
Through the moon in Taurus
I never noticed big stars
Just blonde hair so far
That I found in our bed
You couldn't deal before
I'm so glad you're back
And it makes sense
You're still, I'm stubborn
And it felt shallow
My needing time outside of time
You said the look on my face
Was one of permanent sadness
No, nothing that sexy
I'm not afraid of losing time
Just worried about missing out
It's weirder to stay aliveEmbed
