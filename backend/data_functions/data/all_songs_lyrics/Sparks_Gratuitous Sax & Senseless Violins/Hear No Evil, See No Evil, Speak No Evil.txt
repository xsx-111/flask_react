I'm the wife of Clinton
I don't have a problem with all of this
They come and go, of course I know, I know everything
You don't know my thinking, who I dream of, or the gifts that I bring
One thing is clear, the atmosphere is thin and it's cold
I am Madame Mao
Following the Tao to the extreme
I know the score, all this and more they're still in their teens
You don't know my thinking, who I dream of, or the gifts that I bring
One thing is true, I won't leave clues to where I have been
Hear no evil (Monkey 1 says you shouldn't hear it)
See no evil (Monkey 2 says you shouldn't see it)
Speak no evil (Monkey 3 says you shouldn't speak it)
Hear no evil (Monkey 1 says you shouldn't hear it)
See no evil (Monkey 2 says you shouldn't see it)
Speak no evil (Monkey 3 says you shouldn't speak it)
We on the Potomac love good times
We on the Yangtze love good times
We on the Nile love good times
Can't get enough of good times
More than enough love to go 'round
More than enough power to go 'round
More than enough bids to be found
More than enough bids to go down
Hear no evil (Monkey 1 says you shouldn't hear it)
See no evil (Monkey 2 says you shouldn't see it)
Speak no evil (Monkey 3 says you shouldn't speak it)
Hear no evil (Monkey 1 says you shouldn't hear it)
See no evil (Monkey 2 says you shouldn't see it)
Speak no evil (Monkey 3 says you shouldn't speak it)
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
I am Cleopatra, Caesar's former lover, now I am yours
Marc Antony, you're biting off more than you can chew
Monkey 1 says you shouldn't hear it
Monkey 2 says you shouldn't see it
Monkey 3 says you shouldn't speak it
Monkey 1 says you shouldn't hear it
Monkey 2 says you shouldn't see it
Monkey 3 says you shouldn't speak it
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evilEmbed
