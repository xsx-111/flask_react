I Thought I Told You to Wait in the Car Lyrics'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
What's she doing now
Has the encore come yet
And the bravas and bouquets
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Someday I'll find a mind of my own
'Til then, I'm content to hear her say
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
I'll turn on the radio
And look at myself in the rear-view mirror
I know she has an image to protect
I know she's not just being mean when she screams
I thought I told you to wait in the car
What's she doing now
Meeting leaders of the Free World
She's dressed in black, she's their poster girl
Don't tell me, don't tell me
I know she has an image to protect
I know she's not just being mean when she screams
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
Just a glimpse of it all
Just a taste of it all
Just one foot in the door
In the door of dreamland, in the door of dreamland
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
Walking in on an afternoon tryst
Can be a source of embarrassment
Embarrassment for all concerned
Don't tell me, don't tell me
In my wildest dreams
I never thought of Warren Beatty as a rival
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'
'I thought I told you to wait in the car'Embed
