Complication Lyrics
Complication!
Complication!
Complication!
Constipation!

People cry (Complication!)
People die for you
People kill (Complication!)
People will for you
People run (Complication!)
Ain't it fun for you?
People go (Complication!)
To their deaths for you

People cry (People cry)
People die for you (People die for you)
People cry (People kill!)
People die for you (Yeah, they will for you)
People cry (People run)
People die for you (Ain't it fun for you?)
People cry (People go)
People die for you (To their deaths for you)
Ba, ba-ba-bow
Ba-ba-bow, ba-ba-bow
Ba-ba-bow, ba-ba-bow

Ba, ba-ba-bow
Ba-ba-bow, ba-ba-bow
Ba-ba-bow, ba-ba-bow

(Complication!)
People cry (Complication!)
People die for you
People kill (Complication!)
People will for you
People run (Complication!)
Ain't it fun for you?
People go (Complication!)
To their deaths for you

People cry (People cry, now)
People die for you (Yeah, they will for you)
People cry (People kill, now)
People die for you (Yeah, they will for you)
People cry (People run, now)
People die for you (Well, ain't it fun for you?)
People cry (People go)
People die for you (To their deaths for you)Embed
