Monk Time Lyrics
Alright, my name's Gary
Let's go, it's beat time
It's hop time, it's monk time
You know, we don't like the army
What army? Who cares what army?
Why do you kill all those kids
Over there in Vietnam?
Mad Viet Cong!
My brother died in Vietnam!

James Bond, who was he?
Stop it! Stop it! I don't like it!
It's too loud for my ears
Pussy Galore's comin' down and we like it!
We don't like the atomic bomb
Stop it! Stop it! I don't like it! Stop it!
What's your meaning Larry?
Ah! You think like I think!
You're a monk, I'm a monk, we're all monks!
Dave, Larry, Eddie, Roger
Everybody, let's go!
It's beat time, it's hop time
It's monk time, now!
Yeah! Alright!
Well, alright

(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Yeah, y'know, well, it's hop time, it's monk time!
(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Hey, hey, hey! It's hop time, it's monk time!
(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Hey, hey, hey! It's hop time, it's monk time!
(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Hey, hey, hey! It's hop time, it's monk time!

(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's hop time, it's monk time!
(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Oh, it's hop time, it's monk time, yeah!
(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Well, well, well, hop time, hop time, monk time
(It's hop time, it's monk time)
Yeah, yeah, well, monk time, monk time, hop timeEmbed
