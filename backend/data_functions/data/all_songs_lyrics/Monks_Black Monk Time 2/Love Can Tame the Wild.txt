Love Can Tame the Wild LyricsThru the years, smiles and tears
Live as one will come a son
Love's a thing that loves to sing
Love can tame the wild
Man can?t cry like I try
Tears don't bring, how they sting
Know your touch, love so much
Love can tame the wild
Do you know the taste of silver moonlight?
Soft and blue, I'll kiss you
So much glory not the story
Roar of star, it's so far
Love can tame the wild
Thru the years, smiles and tears
Live as one will come a son
Love's a thing that loves to sing
Love can tame the wild
Do you know the taste of silver moonlight?
Love can tame the wildEmbed
