Boys Are Boys and Girls Are Choice Lyrics
Boys are boys
And girls are choice
To you and me
They're more than toys

Gonna find one, so I won't be lonely
She'll be mine, forever only
And when I do, it'll be alright

Boys are boys
And girls are choice
(I mean what I say!)
Boys are boys
And girls are choice
(One more time, I'll tell ya!)
Boys are boys
And girls are choiceEmbed
