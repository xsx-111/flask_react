Cecilia and The Silhouette Saloon LyricsMurder = White Out
Cancer = Birth Blouse
Mirror = Perfect Glass Spouse
Oil = Sex Paint
Shower = Water Saint
Death Decodes the howls from our hands
Skull = Noise Nest
TV = Fuck Test
Mirror = Siamese Gun Kiss
Sugar = Birth Bait
Murder = Loves Fate
Death distills the camouflage from our dance
Death inverts the red from romance
Death x-rays the angels of chance
Death; the anti mirror of infants
Like a picture hiding beneath the digital Avalanche
When Cecilia's grave cracked like a dirt cocoon
She pulled up a stool at the silhouette saloon
The player piano mumbling crippled jigs
Black widows knitting victimless wigs
When Cecilia's throat slit like a second set of lips
She drooled braille bibles onto the brothel bed spread
Like an egg whose yoke defies child bearing hips
Like a ghost who fears all of the deceased and dead
(Time eats the flesh and spits out the shadow like a useless wishbone.)
But that locket spinning around her neck
Whose hearth heats a dead valentine
You know the phantom trail leads way to a muted grave
Where is his voice now?=A dead tone in the flutter of drunken wings
Where is his blushed cheek now=A face unraveled in shadow, veiled in blind laughter
Where are those sex ripened lips=His kiss print still warm on several necks
Where is love now?
Murder = White Out

Mirror = Siamese Gun Kiss

Murder = Loves Fate
Death distills the camouflage from our dance
Death inverts the red from romance
Death x-rays the angels of chance
Death; the anti mirror of infants
