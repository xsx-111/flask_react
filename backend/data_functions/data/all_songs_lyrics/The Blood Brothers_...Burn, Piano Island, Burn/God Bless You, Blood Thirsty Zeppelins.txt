God Bless You, Blood Thirsty Zeppelins LyricsBullhorn: "Save the falsetto valentines
For the black ice cube toast
For the filth roast."
Classified: You know she looks so clinique
But when you think she's asleep
We're watching from inside the pilots seat
Because unfortunately this Marilyn Monroe is a secret Zeppelin
Whose sweat rains down napalm confetti on all black tie celebrations
Bullhorn: Tear out your carnivorous toupee for the afro fire
Save your hors'dovours for the boiling lobster choir
Classified: You know she looks so vulnerable in that snakeskin shawl
But we're watching through her cut out eye holes
(because unfortunately this Marilyn Monroe is a Secret Zeppelin
Known towing a sign across the Coca-cola sky that reads S.S. Penetration)
God Bless you Bloodthirsty Zeppelins!
Technique: And now we're flying over the past
And future butchered from out brains and left to rot
And now we're flying over the television towers
Plastering the air with the filthy film of prayer
We don't need a blueprint we don't need a blue print
The blueprints me the blue prints you
Classified: We'll build our engines from hijacked hymans
Propellers churning in whispered fury
We'll pluck our bombs from the greased pouch of
Your presidents propaganda pupa louse
Message received: "Honey I'll be home late
From the office today, up to my neck in paperwork
Yeah, my boss is such a jerk."
Telephone wire: "Yeah she bought the story...
There's a motel up the street...
So show me your surrender face baby"
Bullhorn: Unfortunately this Marilyn Monroe is a secret Zeppelin
Set on a crash course with your cum shot museum with the blowjob bunny mansion
Technique: And now we're flying over factories manufacturing authentic memories
And now we're flying over the swamps that brew the biggest smiles
Cackling teeth in piles
And now we're flying over the globe de-robed all our houses x-rayed all our thoughts exposed
And all the copyrighted memories in my head spill to the ground in a puddle of hungry lead
And as the traffic weaves human tapestries we sing a chord to the frustration symphony
Unfortunately this Marilyn Monroe is a secret zeppelin...

Oh my God, the bombs! The bombs are falling!Embed
