Burn, Piano Island, Burn LyricsBulimic rainbows vomit, what?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Coconut pupils never shut?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Jigsaw babies and their bamboo stilts?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Charred toucans weaving their black sky quilt?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Bulimic rainbows vomit, what?
Coconut pupils never shut
The sea shells scream out celestial code
Melting on the shore inside a flame snow globe
Bulimic rainbows vomit, what?
Coconut pupils never shut
The sea shells scream out celestial code
Melting on the shore inside a flame snow globe
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn Burn So burn Piano island!
Torch the treasure!
Torch the shovels!
Torch these hands dipped in gold lacquer
Torch the finger-prints painting a violence portrait on spinal wings
I buried my child of eight inch fingers
Neck deep in the hungry quicksand
I buried my bride of pineapple skin where
The generic sunsets sparkle so bland
I split my grandmother like a rotten papaya
Our fright to pollinate the flowers of fire
I vomited my skeleton and donated it to the war mausoleum
I cut my will and testament along the scar tissue seam
I packaged my heart and FedEx'd it to the octopus queen
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Soured Palm trees sputter waxy wax stink?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Boiling lagoons chewing bubble gum pink?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
The vicoden volcano spews and salivates?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
It's belly bloated like a pre-teen pregnancy?
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
I fed its limp indifferent walls
Tales of an ark haunted by five howls
I tied a nervous noose of piano wire
And wrapped it around the mocking throat of the past
Its head erupted like a rabid roman candle
As I kicked the stump from underneath, yeah!
Drown all your riddles down!
Drown (Yeah!) all your riddles down!
Drown (Yeah!) all your riddles down!
Drown (Yeah!) all your riddles down!
Drown all your riddles down!
Drown all your riddles!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
Burn, Piano Island, Burn!
So drown all your fucking riddles down the throat of the sea
This one-man raft won't be coming back, so don't you talk, talk, talk out of tune to me
From a distance, the fornication of fear and flames twinkles so prettyEmbed
