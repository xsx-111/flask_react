I Know Where The Canaries And Crows Go LyricsWhy can't we let our mouths devour each other?
Why can't we turn those miles into inches
Letters into breath, years into seconds?
(We always said we'd return to the candy-coated jungle.)
Why can't we let our mouths devour?
We always said that we would return
To see what kind of orchard our heart seeds grew
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I know where the canaries go!
I know where the crows go!
So pick up the fucking phone, baby!
I wrote you a letter just the other day my friend
It said, "tonight my body lays crucified under the cactus our love grew
Tonight black feathers will float from the sky like it's raining lies
Tonight my lungs are hanging from a telephone wire
(Choking on the broken digits of a dial tone)
Tonight my lungs are hanging from a telephone wire
(Choking on the broken digits of a dial tone)
Tonight my lungs are hanging from a telephone wire
Where did our hearts go?
Where did our hearts go?
Where did our hearts go?
Where did the crows go?
Where did our hearts go?
Where did our hearts go?
Where did the crows go?
Where did our hearts go?
Where did our hearts go?
Where did the crows go?
Where did our hearts go?
Where did the crows go?
Woah, Our mouths are limp mouths
Our mouths are limp
Woah, Our mouths are limp mouths
Our mouths are limp
We said we'd return for our petrified hearts
Put our name to the parchment made a pact in the dark
Gauze gagged beaks may pump
And beat but sealed inside are secrets screaming to speak
Woah, Our mouths are limp mouths
Our mouths are limp
Woah, Our mouths are limp mouths
Our mouths are limp
Woah, Our mouths are limp mouths
Our mouths are limp
Woah, Our mouths are limp mouths
Our mouths are limp
We ate the white from the wedding
Ate the sheets from the bedding
Ate the smiles off our children
Ate the leather off our birth skin
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
I know where the canaries go!
I know where the crows go!
So pick up the fucking phone, baby!
Have we wasted our whole lives
Sucking candy-coated bullets from the chemical gun?
Every car that passes on this crooked highway bears your face on its grill
Every headlight casts your shadow onto my open heart vigil
I know where the canaries go
I know where the crows go, yeah!
I know where the canaries go
I know where the crows go, yeah!
So pick up the fucking phone!!!Embed
