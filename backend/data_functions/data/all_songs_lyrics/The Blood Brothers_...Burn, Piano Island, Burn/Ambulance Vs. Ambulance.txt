Ambulance Vs. Ambulance LyricsAmbulance X extracts several consultants
From the slow gumming death at the office orifice
Ambulance Y imprisons the sigh
Of recent amputee and dumps her in the xylophone trees
Ambulance X scours the tanning complex
For repunzels rotting in their skin cooking coffins
Ambulance Y drops the body off at door step
Ambulance X pulls you out of the party
And rubs your freckles like a DJ to his records
But Ambulance Y teaches you the word goodbye
And cuts up your hands to show you where you stand
Under the monolith, under the monolith
What is love
What is scam
What is sun
What is tan
The Ambulance Angels pull up to your doorstep
The sirens flash emergency, oh yeah, you'd better come quick
The Ambulance Angels chisel a crack in your mouth
And then they paint a landscape with your regret and shouts
Roll tape
Decode the moans
Roll tape
Decode the moans
Ventilate the scandal from these locked up mouth holes
Roll tape
Decode the moans
You'll never see your wife and children
Again so tell us what was going through your head
When you looked into their eyes and
Said, "No thanks, I'll take the hooker instead"
Roll tape
Decode the moans
Roll tape
Decode the moans
Ventilate the scandal from these locked up mouth holes
Roll tape
Decode the moans
Roll tape
Decode the moans
You'll never see that office again
So when the nurse amputates both of your thighs
Come a little bit closer to the mic and
Tell us what you miss more, your desk or the hungry sky
The Ambulance Angels pull up to the graveyard
And leave you there bubbling on broken sonnets and shards
The Ambulance Angels notify your next of kin
And show them the scrap book of your operation
His head was a faucet leaking love, laughter, and lies
All his secret wishes, all his world famous sighs
But before you give in, oh yeah, but before you give in
Just remember we're coming back for your childrenEmbed
