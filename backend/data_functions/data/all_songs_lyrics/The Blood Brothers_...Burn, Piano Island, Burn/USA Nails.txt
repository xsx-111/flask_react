USA Nails LyricsOperator, I love you
Operator, I would never leave you
Operator, I'd like to see your face pressed up against the glass
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
I need to hear the way your tongue tastes in my ear
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
The county sheriff said
That my baby's dead
They found him in some trash can, blue
All clenched and chewed up
But don't judge me, I'm not his real mother
I couldn't even recognize his face
(His skin like a subway running over spinal tracks)
Operator, can I confide in you?
They haven't got an ounce of proof
Those pigs locked me up here to see what color
I'd rot into, I'd rot into
I'd rot into, I'd rot into
I'd rot into, I'd rot into
I'd rot into
When I walk, I walk alone
Operator, come on
When I watch you through the phone
Operator, come on
And de-pupil these eyes
Love scenes grafted to the sky are
Making me cry
Baby, they're making me cry
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
I get one phone call a day from Molson County jail
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
98 cents per minute, cash or credit, check or debit
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
I get one phone call a day from Molson County jail
1-900-USA-NAILS, oh baby
98 cents per minute, cash or credit, check or debit
When I walk, I walk alone
Operator, come on
When I watch you through the phone
Operator, come on
And de-pupil these eyes
You know you're gonna
Making me cry
Baby, they're making me cry
Operator-rator, won't you tell me again?
Operator-rator, yeah, you're my only friend
Operator-rator, won't you tell me again?
Operator-rator, yeah, you're my only friend
(Do you remember that night in the back of daddy's car?
Strumming the chords of your pubic guitar
The way you tasted just like a movie star
The way the windshield reflected the sunrise
The way the light tattooed your thighs
Oh, you're the most beautiful girl in the whole wide world
Ah, your time is up
Till next time!
We'll send you the bill)
Oh, you're the most beautiful girl
In the whole wide world
Ah, your time is up
Till next time!
We'll send you a bill
We'll send you a bill
We'll send you a bill, yeah
Listen
Can you hear the buildings
Crumbling in slow motion?
Blow me up like a balloon
We'll float over the ocean!
Listen
Can you hear them taking me away?
Don't tell those fucking guards what I've said
And can you see the angels stringing wires through my face?
Meet me next week, same time, same place!
(It wasn't me it was my false tiger limbs..
It wasn't me it was the garbage gryphon!)
Meet me next week, same time, same place
Meet me next week, same time, same place
Meet me next week, same time, same place
Meet me next week, same time, same place
Meet me next week, same time, same place
Meet me next week, same time, same place
Meet me next week, same time, same place
Operator: "Put the receiver to your chest and let me know who loves you best."1Embed
