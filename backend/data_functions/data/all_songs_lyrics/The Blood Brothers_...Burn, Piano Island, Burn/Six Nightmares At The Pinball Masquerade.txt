Six Nightmares At The Pinball Masquerade LyricsWhen the french maids cigarette turns
Burns like a boiling tapeworm
(that was really something baby
That was really something baby)
When the chandeliers shatter
Your guest's gowns turn to tatters, the portraits just chatter
(that was really something baby
That was really something baby)
Can you feel your sweat beading porcelain?
Your skeleton outgrowing it's skin?
It's the pinball masquerade....
(that was really something baby)
Oh Oh Oh I saw the curtains of hair
Oh Oh Oh I saw my fingers tear
They said "we are the six nightmares (oh yeah)
We are the six nightmares (oh yeah)
We are the six nightmares (oh yeah)
Oh Oh Oh I saw the face of a girl
Oh oh oh strapped to a poison pear
Oh oh oh she said:
"we are the six nightmares (oh yeah)
We are the six nightmares (oh yeah)
We are the six nightmares (oh yeah)"
I saw a millionaire eat his shadow
I saw a water clock beat a widow
They said if one man's life is the sum of something
I want to see your fears materializing!"
Where are the six nightmares
Where are the six nightmares
Where are the six nightmares
Where are the six nightmares
At this costume bash?
Open your throat look in the raw gash!
You held each other by well groomed hands
Mumbling prayers to a neglected Jesus
The matradees quiver as they watch you shiver as the mask
And the mouth knit into each other
Our laughter was deafening but our lips
But our lips but our lips were trembling
Our laughter was deafening but our lips
But our lips but our lips were trembling
Now the lady with the peacock mask
Is writhing around in broken monocle glass
Imprisoned like a beetle laying on it's back
And the man striped up and clawed calico like a cat
Is trapped forever looking like that
"all your luxury, all your well hidden trash
All your empty wine bottles disguised as class
All the bastard children you pay off
All the money it takes for you to get off
"May i have this dance?"
The dark dealer takes your hands...
All your memories all your forgotten plans/one night stands;
They are the six nightmares at the masquerade
They are the six nightmares at the masquerade
They are the six nightmares at the masquerade
We are the six nightmares at the masquerade
We are the six nightmares at the masquerade
Oh Oh Oh I saw the mirrors cringe
Oh Oh Oh the choir voices bend
Oh Oh Oh the costume in my skin...they said
"we are the six nightmares (oh yeah!)
We are the six nightmares (oh yeah)
We are the six nightmares
WE ARE THE SIX NIGHTMARES!"
We are the six nightmares at the masquerade
We are the six nightmares!Embed
