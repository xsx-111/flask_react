The Salesman, Denver Max Lyrics(Yeah) Through the screen door your thoughts are quarantined
(Yeah) By the way you smell I can tell that you're fifteen
(Yeah) My name is Denver Max, I eat heart attacks
(Yeah) From your mouth to your hands to the floor you're babbling syntax
What the crickets see is between you and me
What scarecrows think would turn your pale cheek pink
Don't you try to call the cops little girl
Because before you pick up the phone you'll be dead
Don't you try to call the cops little girl;
Your tongue is withered it's heavier than lead
Won't you just step into the car little girl;
Your parents don't understand what's in your head
We're really onto something special little girl
You're blushing red, your head can't hide those thoughts of dread
(Yeah) Through the screen door kiss me kiss me like a queen
(Yeah) It tastes like metal in my mouth like rusty Listerine
(Yeah) My name is Denver Max please excuse the mask
(Yeah) Running down my face, bound by tacks and paste
What the crickets see is between you and me
What the scarecrows think would turn your eyeballs pink
Turn your eyeballs pink
With a face like that you'll never ever make it big
You'll never find a boyfriend unless you get it adjusted
(Yeah) My name is Denver Max and won't you come sit on my lap?
(Yeah) Because the only thing you own is everything you lack
Don't you try to call the cops little girl
Because before you pick up the phone you'll be dead
Don't you try to call the cops little girl;
Your tongue is withered it's heavier than lead
Won't you just step into the car little girl;
Your parents don't understand what's in your head
We're really onto something special little girl
You're blushing red, your head can't hide those thoughts of dread
By the time we hit Tucson your parents little girl
Parents little girl will be wondering
Where their pretty little blonde has gone
By the time we hit Mexico you'll know little girl
Know little girl that Denver Max will always be the only one
Time we hit the ocean we'll jump little girl
Jump little girl down to find the undersea sunEmbed
