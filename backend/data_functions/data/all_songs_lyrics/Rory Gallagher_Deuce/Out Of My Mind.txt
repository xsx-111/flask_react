Out Of My Mind LyricsWell you took me out of my mind baby
You took me out of my head
My friends have gone to look for me
I ain't been seen yet
No I ain't disappeared
I'm only over here
Well you found me out of my skull baby
Staring at the stars
You will appear now just in time
To what I was looking for
I had no place to run
Did not have anyone
Well I wonder
Why the day is so bright
What can the reason be
You light up the darkest night
Like a pearl out of the sea
Hope it can always be
But I must wait and see
Give me some of your love baby
That is all I need
Tell me what it's all about
Tell me what you see
Where have you been so long
My tears have dried and gone
Where have you been so long
All my blues have gone
Well you took me out of my mind baby
You took me out of my head
My friends have gone to look for me
I ain't been seen yet
No I ain't disappeared
I'm only over here
No I ain't disappeared
I'm only over hereEmbed
