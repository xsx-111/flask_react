Maybe I Will LyricsRunning through a pool of rain
I think I'll do it one more time again
I hope I always feel this way
Maybe I will
Searching for a piece of ground
Where I can lay my body down
With the earth for a pillow under my head
Wake up in the morning
It's a brand new day
And though it seems the same
It's different from yesterday
Then I read the leaves
And put my cup away
Running down a country lane
Looking on a a field of grain
Just to see you smile
Makes me feel alive again
Opening another door
I'll see what I have not seen before
Maybe I'll find what I'm looking for
Running through a pool of rain
I think I'll do it one more time again
I hope I always feel this way
Maybe I will
Maybe I willEmbed
