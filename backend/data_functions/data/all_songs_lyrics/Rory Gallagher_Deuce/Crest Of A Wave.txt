Crest Of A Wave LyricsWell you can ride on the crest of a wave if that's where you want to be
But does the look on your face mean you're really feeling happy
Or do you feel like you're standing on a wooden leg
Or a poor man much to proud to beg
Or a page from a book that can't be read at all
Well you can see by the way that they are talking
That it's time for you to pick up your grip and start walking
Cause they want to see your long ... legs flying
Go to the place where the earth meets the sky and
Don't stop to turn around and wave goodbye at all
They won't be satisfied, till you're out of their sight
But I wonder how will you feel
With a deck of cards and you're not around to deal
You're not around to deal , yeah
They won't be satisfied, till you're out of their sight
But I wonder how will you feel
With a deck of cards and you're not around to deal
You're not around to deal , yeah
You can say it's a lie, a joke that you are living
But you know one thing they don't
You won't give in
Cause you're like a cat chasin' its tail makes a million circles
But you're gonna fail
Sometimes you just don't understandEmbed
