Whole Lot Of People LyricsA whole lot of people talking
Trying to make sense
Seems everybody's living on a barbed wire fence
Whole lotta people too proud to call
'Cause it won't get no help at all
Everybody's waiting for the good news day
But it seems so far away
Wonder if it's ever gonna come
'Cause the way it's been
The restless one
Lot of things have gotta change
If it's not already too late
But it is worth the wait
So, let's not hang our heads
The light will shine one day
Lot of things have gotta change
If it's not already too late
But it is worth the wait
So, let's not hang our heads
The light will show through yet
Yeahh...
Now listen baby, and listen well
I've got only one thing to tell
Don't you worry about people telling lies
They're only catching flies
Yeahhh..
A whole lotta people talking
Trying to make sense
Seems everybody's living on a barbed wire fence
Whole lotta people too proud to call
'Cause it won't get no
'Cause it won't get no
'Cause it won't get no
Help at all
Help at allEmbed
