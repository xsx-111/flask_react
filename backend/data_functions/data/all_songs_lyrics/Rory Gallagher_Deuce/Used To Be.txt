Used To Be LyricsBaby I no longer wanna be, just a thorn in your side
Tell me what you gave me baby, and I will give you back
The troubles you gave me, gonna wrap em' up in a box
Tie em' up with string, send em' back to you
They no longer mean a thing to me
Better get used to bein' my used to be
Baby I no longer wanna be, just a cushion for your pride
Here's my fastback baby, this man's got a ride away
Before you make me change my mind
I'll be gone before you notice, that I'm not around
You'll look everywhere baby, but I just won't be found
Better get used to bein' my used to be
I used to be the hands of your clock baby
But I always knew in time
I'd no longer be the key to your lock baby
And you would change your mind
Owww...
I used to be the hands of your clock baby
But I always knew in time
I'd no longer be the key to your lock baby
And you would suddenly change your mind
Owww...
Baby I remember a time when you, really used to try
But now-a-days baby, you can't even look me in the eye
Your love is drifting with the tide
Well I ain't gonna blame you, if you ain't gonna blame me
I'll just move on down, I'm sure that you'll agree
Better get used to bein' my used to be
Well I ain't gonna blame you, if you ain't gonna blame me
I'll just move on down the line, I'm sure that you'll agree
Better get used to bein' my used to beEmbed
