In Your Town LyricsLook out baby, your man is back in town
Look out baby, your man is back in town
Look out baby, I won't stand no messin' 'round
The first man I wanna see is the Chief Police
Bring that man right over here
I wanna speak my piece
I wanna 'cause no trouble, no fuss, no fight
But look out man, you know this is Saturday night
The second man I wanna see is the old fire chief
Bring that man right over here
Stand him right in front of me
I wanna cause no trouble, no fuss, no fight
See this match, I might set this place alight
So look out...
The third man I wanna see is the old D.A.,
He was the man who sent me away
Twenty two years, twenty three days, twenty four minutes
I was locked away
You come along baby, ask me where I've been
Up-the-river-holiday, up in Sing Sing
One cold floor, four bare walls
That's all they gave me, nothing else at all
Sing Sing, Sing Sing, Sing Sing
When I came out I couldn't feel a
I couldn't feel a
I couldn't feel a thing
Couldn't feel a thing
I couldn't feel a thing
Feel a thing
Feel a thing
Feel a thing
Now I'm back in your town
In your town, in your town, your town...Embed
