Persuasion LyricsWell, I don't need too much persuasion
When I'm in your arms this way
Well, I don't need a sense of occasion
I'm ready any day
Well, just tell me your location
And I will get to you
There will be no hesitation
I'll be right there out of the blue
Perfection, you seem to me
This connection, we ought to seal
My emotions, I can't conceal
Your heart I'll steal away
Ahhh...
I won't put up too much of a struggle
When you look that way
But, I know that I'm in trouble
My defense just melts away
Well, I think that I'm in heaven
When you knock on my door
Well, I start to seeing double
My resistance is way down low
Perfection, you seem to me
This connection, we ought to seal
My emotions, I can't conceal
Your heart I'll steal away
Heart I'll steal away
Owwww...
Well, I don't need too much persuasion
When I'm in your arms this way
Well, I don't need a sense of occasion
I'm ready any day
Won't you tell me your location
And I will get to you
There will be no hesitation
I'll be right there out of the blue
Perfection, you seem to me
This connection, we ought to seal
My emotions, I can't conceal
Your heart I'll steal away
Heart I'll steal away
That's rightEmbed
