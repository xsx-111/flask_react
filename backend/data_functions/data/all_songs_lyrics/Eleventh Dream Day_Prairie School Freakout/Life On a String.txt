Life On a String LyricsI staked my life on a trip
All my records packed in the trunk
When I reached my destination
I started to feel my ship had sunk
Life can change in just half a day
As fast as water runs down the drain
And when you live without reciprocity
It will slam like a door back in your face
"You can stay here for the night
But tomorrow it has to end"
And I ran out of the room
And fell off the deepest end
Then she told me of a saying
She had just made up that day
"Nothing is for sure except nothing is for sure"
Then she said "It's not for me"
Then she said "It's not for me"
I had found love in the meantime
I had landed on my feet
I had learned the art of self-reliance
I thought I was complete
But then she said "Come back to me"
Then she said "Come back to me"
"No I can't come back"Embed
