Tarantula LyricsIn the smoldering cathedral
I prayed for a sign
My doubt came down in a downpour
It reigned in my mind
So I learned to tread water
I kept away from the bridge
With nothing to remember
And everything to forget
As the planets turn
As the planets turn
It was time that had burned
The wick it was wicked
It was time that I'd learned
It was time that was ticking
In the snow covered pure
There fell two drops of blood
That burned through the ground
And pooled into one
As the planets turned
As the planets turnEmbed
