Sweet Smell LyricsWhen the sun shined
It blinded Jane's mind
Soaked through her skin
And laid her down
Like a dream Jane drifted t hrough
To a place
Where she could feel the earth move
Jane fell into the ground
Jane soaked up the sound
She felt she found the flame
That turned love into pain
That crawled into her brain
And changed everything
But still Jane looked the same
When the sun set
Jane awoke
Her mind was clear
As she reached for a rope
Ambulance Blues filled the room
Confusion everywhere
But still the flowers bloomed
Jane fell into the ground
Jane soaked up the sound
She felt she found the flame
That turned love into pain
That crawled into her brain
And changed everything
But still Jane looked the sameEmbed
