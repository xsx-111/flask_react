Driving Song LyricsEverything's alright
But don't expect it to last
And I would drive all night
If I could capture the past
Every weekend's the same
Not a thing to do
And I would feel the same
So I go driving with you
Take a look over there
Inside that car
There's a fair-haired girl
But she won't get far
Better step on the gas
She's driving away
Follow that car
As long as it takes
Dale, what do you think
Should we turn it around
Cause it's getting pretty late
And we should be home
Every weekend's the same
Not a thing to do
I would feel the same
So I go driving with youEmbed
