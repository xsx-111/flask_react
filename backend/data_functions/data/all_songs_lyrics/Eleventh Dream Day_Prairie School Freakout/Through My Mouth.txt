Through My Mouth LyricsEveryday that goes by
And I don't know why
But I feel like I'm ten years older
My bones get brittle
Like sticks to the fire
They snap, they pop, and they smolder
I had been away for
How long I can't say
When I reached home I kissed the ground
Then out of the sun
Came this doorway bum
It was me and I didn't make a sound
The waters swirl
The light comes rushing in
And pours out of my open mouth
Rushes through my veins
And pours out of my open mouth
I couldn't sit down
My head spun around
I had seen a million miles
My throat it tightened
My spine it cracked
My last breath came as a sigh
The waters swirl
The light comes rushing in
And pours out of my open mouth
Rushes through my veins
And pours out of my open mouthEmbed
