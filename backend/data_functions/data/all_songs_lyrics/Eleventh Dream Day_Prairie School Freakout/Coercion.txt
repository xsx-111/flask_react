Coercion LyricsHis face white so placid
Her mind was a cold casket
While one counts the birds in hand
The other holds them too tight
She took all of t hem and flew off into the night
Floating like a tail-less kite
He took up all her thought
Chewed it up and then forgot
While one holds the birds in hand
The other holds them too tight
She took all of t hem and flew off into the night
Floating like a feather in flight
She sees the picture clearer
The knot shapes like fear
You feel that she has forced you
Into a corner she has coerced you
But it was her heart she gave out
And your white hand was hardly held out
She thinks of days that passed
Remembers and starts to laugh
You feel that she has forced you
Into a corner she has coerced you
But it was her heart that she gave out
And your white hand cut it out
While one holds the birds in hand
The other holds them too tight
She took all of them and flew off into the night
Floating like a feather in flight
She became the night
She became the nightEmbed
