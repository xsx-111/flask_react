Beach Miner LyricsQuarter in my hand, found it in the sand
Must have found a way to slip on by
Those beach miners
I thought I'd look for more
I drifted down the shore
It was there I found a letter she wrote
Saying we were no more
Something's got a hold on me
Sure I'm sad, I ought to be sad
Is there any good reason why I shouldn't be sad
We were getting kind of close
I was falling in love with her
But that's the way of the world I guess
And I can't change it
But you know I will miss her still
I can't avoid it
Something's got a hold on me
Something's got a hold on meEmbed
