Watching the Candles Burn LyricsWe're wasting our time
Watching candles burn
We're caught from behind
We've got a lot to learn
We've all got shades
We like the view
If looks could kill
Here's looking at you
A sick dog crawls
Turns right up the alley
He was out all night
He sure was smelly
I ain't got no matches
And what if I did?
I was home all night
Sick in bedEmbed
