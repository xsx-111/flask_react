Death of Albert C. Samson LyricsHe walked through the iron
Burned bushes behind him
In the quad cities
His throat felt like sand
So he bought some beer
And then killed the grocery man
Albert C. Samson
He washed his hands
In the cool cool water
Albert C. thought about his father
The one he never knew
The one he proved everything to
He popped the tab
And he left the scene
Drove for hours and hours and hours and hours....
It all felt like a dream
He took the exit left to Wright town
Looking for an old deserted barn
Well the town woke up
Like never before
The people of Wright town
Thought they'd live this day
Like the one before
Their town was host to a killer at large
They grabbed their bibles and guns
This all went on
For days and days
Albert C.'s head in
A mad, mad swirling haze
Laughing at the town's whole charade
Albert C. knew this barn would be his grave
The colored sun chairs
Lined the street
Cameras like stars
Blinked like Albert C.'s heart beat
Loud sharp heat filled his head
Traveling faster than the news....
Albert C. was dead
Buried beneath the blast
By his own hand he was saved at lastEmbed
