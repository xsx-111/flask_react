Among the Pines LyricsHe slipped in the shower stall
Hit his head and died
He had lost his concentration
For a moment
As the water fell on his shoulders
He thought about a time
He thought about a time
When life was painful
Like the time we walked home in the rain
A summer in Florida where he nearly froze
A morning in Chicago
When the dawn meant nothing
To nobody
A fall in the winter that killed him
He had lost his concentration
Blame it on a sharp movement
Blunt porcelain concrete thoughts
Life was getting hard
His past thoughts were meaningless
Future thoughts unheard of
Present thoughts hopeless
His head felt like a loaf of bread
With the crust peeled off
Sandwiched between the shower stall
And purgatory
His life went down the drain
A cold fall rain, a distant vague pain
A long black train
Chewed it's way
Through soggy New England forests
A chosen place of farewells
Among the pines that someday fell
Among the pines that someday fell
Among the pines that someday fellEmbed
