Funnel of Love LyricsWell, I'm going down, down, down
My mind is a wreck
My head is spinning around and around
In the funnel of love
It's such a crazy, crazy, crazy thing
I get weak in my knees
My whole head's spinning
As I go deep in the funnel of love
I tried and tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
But you just can't hide from the tunnel of love
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's such a crazy, crazy, crazy thing
I get weak in my knees
My whole head's spinning
As I go deep in the funnel of love
Funnel of love
I'm in so deep
I tried and tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
But you just can't hide from the funnel of love
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you somedayEmbed
