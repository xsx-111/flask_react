Cowboy George LyricsGeorge
Low-fat can me
I alone
Say what I want
I Hate you
Low-fat limeys
In Cavalry
Unseen footage
Unseen facts
Unseen knowledge
Low-fat limeys
I'd bite into
A mad sinner
I've lost the plot
Into the hill
Into the hill
Into the hill
Into the hill
Unseen knowledge
Unseen facts
Unseen footage
Unseen knowledge
Unseen hills
Unseen facts
On facts
On facts
On facts
I had two broken bottles
And I had two brown bottles
And a white nose as I entered
Five years of confinement
This is the story that enfolded
As it went on into the sea
Of unseen footage
And unseen facts
Unseen refinement
Unseen extension
Chicory tip in a shopping center
With a soundtrack again
All is beyond
Our equity your future again
Incensed, das Boat
Robin Redbreast
In my fate again
Unseen footage
Unseen facts
In exclamation
He is goingEmbed
