Hot Cake LyricsAh ah ah oooh
Hot came the wind
Hot came the wind
It was watery
It was Chino, like last song
Rolled oats
A man, a nasty slice of innocent
Step alligator
Or near to a skip
I went into a drip
I can't open the door
I can't open the door
My dialog is stock
My dialog is stock
Hot cake
And John said something
Bills is on TV
I can't answer the door
My dialog is declining
Oh God
Oh, a slippy
And all I got was a slippy floor
And all I get is a slippy floor
Hot cake
Slip, slide
I can't disagree
I get Mr
I get Mr
I get Mr. Spock
And for the mind
I get sloppy floor
And for the mind
I get slippy floorEmbed
