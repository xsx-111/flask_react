Y.F.O.C. / Slippy Floor LyricsTales from the Castleford crypt
Your future is our clutter
Is unable, a necessity
That doesn't involve a problem
This new approach
Is on the borders of necessity
I say to you, I say to you
Keep your own clutter
The encyclopedia of building and plumbing
Is on the CIDV, underneath you
The Masque of Red is coming around
We're gonna get married
On the floor of behest
Don't book down
Just keep and stay ahead
S.H. is a chance I get
In the land of finance retail
Slippy floor, in hospital
Talk taken on the land
I'm 95% more inside
Pay drake
I'm 95% in inside of B Drake
Walking down a little road
A beautiful lake I see and behold
Going closer, it's gorgeous
Then all I see is a slippy floor
And then I see
The slippy floor in apartment hall
You might like to scoff and guffaw
The slippy floor in view, apartment hall
Revere, wanted, two times, side gate
And you try the needle and pull on side gate
Your non-existence
Slippy floor
S.H. is a chance I take
In the land of finance retail
And all I get
Is a slippy floor in a hospital
Walking down the little road
A beautiful lake I see and behold
Going closer to inhale
Its gorgeous aroma and allure
But then I see
It's a slippy floor all over me
And all I get is a slippy floor
And all I take is a slippy floor
In apartment hall
The chance I took
Taken in the land of finance retail
A slippy floor all over me
I'm 95% inside of B Drake
Point taken in the land of finance retail
But all I see is a slippy floor
All I get is a slippy floor
All over me
One last cigarette's gonna do it
1-9-8-6 generator
That's all he wrote
1-9-8-6 generate...
"Received: Tuesday, May..."
"And I'm wondering if you happen to know his number or can get it for me? I would like to speak to him, uh, if it's not too much trouble. If you could let me know on 0161 795 5-double 1-3 and I hope you're both well. All the best to you, bye bye"
"So apart from mixing that, there's not really much more to do with it, is there?"Embed
