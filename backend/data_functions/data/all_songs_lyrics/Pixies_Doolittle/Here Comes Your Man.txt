Here Comes Your Man Lyrics
Outside there's a boxcar waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait till face turns blue
I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the boxcar waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

Big shake on the boxcar moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

Ay-yeah
Ay-yeah
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man12Embed
