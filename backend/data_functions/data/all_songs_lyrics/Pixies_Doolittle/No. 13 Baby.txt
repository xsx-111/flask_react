No. 13 Baby Lyrics
Got hair in a girl that flows to her bones
And a comb in her pocket if the wind get blown
Stripes on her eyes when she walks slow
But her face fall down when she go, go, go

Black tear falling on my lazy queen
Got a tattooed tit say "number 13"
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm...

Choir in the yard in the house next door
Where a grandma brought some songs from the shore
Six foot girl gonna sweat when she dig
Stand close to the fire when they light the pig

Standing in her chinos shirt pulled off clean
Got a tattooed tit say "number 13"
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm...
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state
