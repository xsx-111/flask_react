Dead Lyrics
"Whatchu think of nothing?"
"I'd like to do a nursery rhyme."

You crazy babe Bathsheba, I wantcha
You're suffocating, you need a good shed
I'm tired of living, Shebe, so gimme

Dead!
Dead!

We're apin' rapin' tapin' catharsis
You get torn down and I get erected
My blood is working but my, my heart is...

Dead!
Dead!
Dead!

Hey, what do you know?
Your lovely tan belly is starting to grow
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper

Dead!
Dead!1Embed
