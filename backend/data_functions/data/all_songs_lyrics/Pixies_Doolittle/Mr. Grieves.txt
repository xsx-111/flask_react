Mr. Grieves Lyrics
Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright

What's that floating in the water?
Ol' Neptuna's only daughter
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe in Mr. Grieves

Do you have another opinion? (Yup!)
Do you have another opinion?

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la
La la la la

Got bombed, got frozen
Got finally off to finally dozing
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Do you have another opinion? (Yup! Opinion!)
Do you have another opinion?
Do you have another opinion?

You can cry, you can mope
But can you swing from a good rope?
Oh, I believe in Mr. Grieves

Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright5Embed
