Gouge Away Lyrics
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm, mhm, mhm, hm
Hm-hm, mhm, hm

Missy aggravation
Some sacred questions
You stroke my locks
Some marijuana if you got some

Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
La, la
Oh, oh

Sleeping on your belly
You break my arms
You spoon my eyes
Been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm

Chained to the pillars
A 3-day party
I break the walls
And kill us all with holy fingers

Gouge away (La la)
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to12Embed
