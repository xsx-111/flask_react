Wave of Mutilation Lyrics
Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You think I'm dead, but I sail away

On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave

I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Ni√±o
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana

On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave8Embed
