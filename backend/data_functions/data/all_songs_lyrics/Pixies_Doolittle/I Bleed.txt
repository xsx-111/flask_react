I Bleed Lyrics
As loud as hell, a ringing bell
Behind my smile, it shakes my teeth
And all the while, as vampires feed

I bleed
I bleed
I bleed

Prithee, my dear, why are we here?
Nobody knows, we go to sleep
As breathing flows, my mind secedes

I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
There's a place in the buried west
In a cave with a house in it
In the clay, the holes of hands
You can place a hand in hand

I bleed (I bleed)
I bleed (I bleed)
I bleed (I bleed)3Embed
