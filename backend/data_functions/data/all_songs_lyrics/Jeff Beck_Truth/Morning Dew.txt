Morning Dew LyricsWalk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Please, walk me out in the morning dew sometimes
Can't walk you out in no morning dew, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Can't walk you out in no morning dew
Thought I heard a young man crying
Thought I heard a young man crying today
You didn't hear no young man crying
You did not hear no young man crying
Thought I heard a young girl crying
Thought I heard a young girl crying
You, you did not hear no young girl crying
I'm sorry, but you know you didn't
You did not hear no young man crying
Now there is no more morning dew
Now there is no more morning dew
What they've been saying all these god dawg years has come true
I knew it would too
Now there's no more morning dew
Now there is no more morning dew, at all, oh
Now there is no more morning dew
Because, because, because what they've been sayin'
All these years has come true
That you know, and only you know
That there's no more morning dew
Now, now there is no more morning dew
People, you know that there's no more morning dew
Because, because, because what they've been sayin'
All these years has come true
You know that there's no more morning dewEmbed
