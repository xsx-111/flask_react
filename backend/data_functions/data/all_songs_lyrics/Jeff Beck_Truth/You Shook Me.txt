You Shook Me LyricsYou know you shook me
You shook me all night long, yes, you did
You know that you shook me
You shook me all night long
And the way that you love me, baby
(You know what you do?)
You mess up my happy home
(Dig this)
You know you love me
Just like a hurricane
You know you love me
Just like a hurricane
And the way that you love me, baby
You mess up my happy home (You're so bad)
Come onEmbed
