Let Me Love You Lyrics
(Over here)
Let me love you, baby
You're driving my poor heart crazy
Let me love you, baby
You're driving my poor heart crazy
When I'm with you, woman
My whole life seems so hazy
(Ah, you don't know that?)

Baby, when you walk
You shake just like a willow tree
(Ah, yes, you do, darlin', every time I see ya, oh)
Baby, when you walk you know what?
You shake just like a willow tree
(Know, I know, I know, I know)
Ooh-ee, baby, you sure look so good to me
(Come on, babe)

(Yes, I know it, yeah)

Yeah, baby, when you walk
You shake like a willow tree
(You oughta know that by now)
Baby, when you walk
You shake like a willow tree
And ooh-ee, baby, you sure look so good to me
(Easy with this one)
Let me love you, baby
Love you, baby
Know, I know, I know
Let me love you, baby
Oh, you, let me love you
What you got?

Let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
Any old way you choose it
I don't mind what time you call
Oh, oh, yeah
You're driving my poor heart crazy

Let me love you, baby
Love you, baby
Early in the morning time
Later in the evening
Let me love you, baby
You're driving my poor heart crazy1Embed
