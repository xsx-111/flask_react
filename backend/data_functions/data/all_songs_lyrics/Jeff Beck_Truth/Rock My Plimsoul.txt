Rock My Plimsoul LyricsListen!
You can rock me, rock me all night long
Keep on rocking me baby, rock me all night long
'Cause you know what, when you rock me
My poor back it ain't got a bone
You can roll me, just like they roll the wagon wheel
Way down in the country
Keep on rollin' me baby, roll me all night long
You know, you can shake, rattle, and roll me
Till my back it ain't got a bone
And I won't mind that! Yeah!
Oww! Over here!
Keep on rollin' me baby, just roll me all night long
I won't mind it
Keep on rollin' me baby, roll me all night long
'Cause you know what, when you shake, rattle, and roll me
My old back ain't got a bone
So will you do it?
Keep on rollin' me baby
Rollin' me baby
Any old way you choose it
Keep on rollin' me
Ha, ha. Keep rollin' me honey
Till my old back ain't got a bone
Over there!
Rockin' me baby
Rockin' me baby
Rock me honey
Rockin' me baby, whoa-oh
I don't mind which way that ya, come on honey, keep on
Rockin' me baby
Rockin' me baby
Keep on rockin' me baby
You know you'd better keep on rocking' me all night long
You can rock me baby, yeah, yeah
Ow!Embed
