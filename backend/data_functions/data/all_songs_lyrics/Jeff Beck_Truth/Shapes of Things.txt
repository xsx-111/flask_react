Shapes of Things Lyrics
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just help me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here, within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
Will time make men more sane?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier, now listen
Come tomorrow, maybe I'm older than today?


Here, within my lonely frame
My eyes just heard my god darn brain
But time make men more sane?Embed
