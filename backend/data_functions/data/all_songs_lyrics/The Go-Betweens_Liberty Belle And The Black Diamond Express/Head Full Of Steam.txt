Head Full Of Steam LyricsI'd never met her type she ignored me and that's alright
Never to be friends or my body lie on her floor
Her father works
Her mother works in exports
But that's of no importance at all
I don't mind
I don't mind
To chase her
A fools dream
I'm 104 degrees
With a Head Full of Steam
All waitings up
I'm on that team
That says go forward
With a Head Full of Steam
She plays hard to get along with
But she might drop by
She never had a nickname
But then nor have I
I don't mind
I don't mind
To chase her
A fools dream
I'm 104 degrees
With a Head Full of Steam
All waitings up
I'm on that team
That says go forward
With a Head Full of Steam
Steam
Steam
Oh, I just want to know
I'd never met her type
She locked the door and the key
Opened the windows for the neighbours to see
Her climb on my knee
To chase her
A fools dream
I'm 104 degrees
With a Head Full of Steam
All waitings up
I'm on that team
That says go forward
With a Head Full of Steam
Go Forward
Go forward now
Go forward
Go forward nowEmbed
