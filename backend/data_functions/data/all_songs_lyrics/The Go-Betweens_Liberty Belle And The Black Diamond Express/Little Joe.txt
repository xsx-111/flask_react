Little Joe LyricsEveryone knows everybody else
Let's skip introductions
Talk on little Joe
His mother left for me to mind
A 100 a week
A lovely guy of 26
Loves only the lonely
Little Joe
Oh no here he comes
Laughing with an old joke
Don't you cry
Never do a days work
Nothing of value will ever get hurt
Joes no trouble he ran for mayor
The mafia car bombed my car
I said you're not running for mayor
Gave up wishing
Took up hoping
Hoping Joe will settle down
Shoe store
A movie house
Something like
Something like a french comedy
He's patronised by gentle souls
Their best intensions are their own
Don't you cry
Never do a days work
Nothing of value will ever get hurt
I've always been a man of the track
Took Joe down to the track
So here we sit
Joe and I
Joe and I
Little Joe
Don't you cry
Never do a days work
Nothing of value will ever get hurt
The whole world
Lets get our balance in the mid-night airEmbed
