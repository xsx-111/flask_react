Apology Accepted LyricsI used to say dumb things
I guess I still do
I'm doing it again
But that's what happens
When you're in view
More used to naked men
You said leave the light on
Don't be frightened
I don't know how long
I can wait to see if my
Apology's accepted
Too proud to hang my head
In shame beside your bed
But sometimes you want something
So bad, you'll grab anything
You said that's ridiculous
There's only one thing that precious
I don't know how long
I can wait to see if my
Apology's Accepted
I gotta know is my
Apology accepted
Time and time again
Your soft eyes close
In trust above me
Such a simple question
I pretended I was sleeping
I didn't know anything
But you I'm keeping
I don't know how long
I can wait to see if my
Apology's Accepted
I gotta know is my
