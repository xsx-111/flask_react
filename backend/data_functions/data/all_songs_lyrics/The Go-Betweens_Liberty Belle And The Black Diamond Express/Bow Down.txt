Bow Down LyricsYou opened my mail
Apart at the seams
Now you know I live beyond my means
Beneath my bed
There's gold in the earth
Above the price
That gold is now worth
Never to Bow Down
Don't you ever slow down
You live with a prince
You live with a cape
Yous see things my memoirs just won't say
Don't be so down
Don't be so sad
Start counting bodies
We'll both go half mad
Never to Bow Down
Don't you ever slow down
Break it to me gently
Speak in our code
We're show people
Speak in our code
Bad news I'll leave
Bad news I'll grieve
Good and bad, baby I'll leave
Never to Bow Down
Don't you ever slow down
I left the house with all the lights on
You see the lights
Nothing is wrong
The television works
The telephone rings
And late at night all good children they sing
Never to Bow Down
Don't you ever slow down
Never to Bow Down
Don't you ever slow down
Bow Down too far
Bow Down no
Bow Down don't
Don't you ever slow down
Slow down Bow Down Bow Down slow down Bow Down
Slow down Bow Down ... Slow DownEmbed
