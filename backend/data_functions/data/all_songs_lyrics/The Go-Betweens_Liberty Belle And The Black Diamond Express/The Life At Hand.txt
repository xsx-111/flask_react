The Life At Hand LyricsA ruby waistcoat won't hide my fear
At 12: 31 watch my teeth disappear
People buy watches
Then tell the time
By the punctual keeling
And crack of my spine
But if you're feeling brave
And you're feeling strong
Please pick me up and take me along
And if you're getting tired then rest for a spell
I'll carry you just as well
Because
I'll take you to the life at hand
I'll show you how to live the life at hand
I'll give you
Give my life at hand
It's raining
It's pouring
The doorbell's dead
You're an artist with your body
But you can't find your head
With your first million safe in the mattress
You've gotta give it up when the nest-egg hatches
But if you're feeling brave
And you're feeling strong
Please pick me up and take me along
And if you're getting tired
Then rest for a spell
I'll carry you just as well
Well
I'll take you to the life at hand
I'll show you how to live the life at hand
I'll give you
Give my life at handEmbed
