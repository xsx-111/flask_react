Spring Rain Lyrics
Dressed in a white shirt with my hair combed straight
Here in my black shoes and me without a date
Me without hindsight, me without
When will change come
Just like Spring Rain

Falling down like sheets
(falling down like sheets)
Coming down like love
(coming down like love)
Falling at my feet
(falling just like)
Spring Rain

Standing on the lawn with cousins and child brides
Caught for the camera on their best sides
Being caught forewarned
Their best sides
When will change come
Just like Spring Rain

Falling down like sheets
(falling down like sheets)
Coming down like love
(coming down like love)
Falling at my feet
(falling just like)
Spring Rain
Driving my first car
My elbows in the breeze
With all these people that I Never, never need
These people are excited by their cars
I want surprises
Just like Spring Rain

Falling just like sheets
(falling just like sheets)
Coming down so hard
(coming down so hard)
Falling at my feet
(falling just like)
Spring Rain
Coming down like love
(coming down like love)
Falling here so smooth
(falling here so smooth)
Falling in that groove
(falling just like)
Spring Rain
Falling down like love
(falling, falling)
Coming down so hard
(falling down)
You hear it fall falling down
Spring Rain
Falling just like love
(falling, falling)
Falling down so hard
(falling down)
You hear it fall falling down
Spring RainEmbed
