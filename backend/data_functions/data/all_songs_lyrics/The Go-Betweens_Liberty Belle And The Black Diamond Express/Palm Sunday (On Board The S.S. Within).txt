Palm Sunday (On Board The S.S. Within) LyricsI've been having bad dreams
A mother couldn't find her milk
Five days from Melbourne
I didn't feel too good myself
Wool in the hold
A blaze in the sky
The water so black
You could make a shroud
I didn't know where
I didn't know where
So come on darling, aw come on honey
From my mouth to you, for your ears only
I didn't know who to blame
I couldn't tell the time
I didn't know where I was
We'd crossed the International Date Line
Docked at Cape Town
Lost your bracelet
Drunk for days
I need that magnet
I didn't know where
I didn't know where
So come on darling, aw come on honey
From my mouth to you, for your ears only
Back when it started
Back when they took away the stone
They're laying down palms
They're laying down palms on the deck
There are times when you come home
And you can't touch the things you own
I didn't know where
I didn't know where
So come on darling, aw come on honey
From my mouth to you, for your ears onlyEmbed
