In The Core Of A Flame LyricsIf the Devil had seen your dress
He would've changed his name
Put down his fork and moved up above
Why burn in hell when you burn for love?
I know what I mean but just don't say
Cos all the old words get in the way
I'll stay with love
Cos that's the right word baby
That's the right word
Cos I love you
And that's the right word baby
That's the right word, the right word
There are two kinds of lovers in this world
Those who like diaminds and those who like dirt
Here I stand, my face is a mask
I'll take it off because you asked
I know what I mean but just don't say
Cos all the old words get in the way
I'll stay with love
Cos that's the right word baby
That's the right word
Cos I love you
And that's the right word baby
That's the right word, the right word
So hold me up on my word
And keep me down in the bed
There's one thing I should have said
Will you keep me safe from the world
And hold me just like a pearl?
The light always shines the brightest
In the Core of a Flame
After lead break sing the choruses yourselfEmbed
