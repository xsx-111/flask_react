To Reach Me LyricsNever tought I'd ever hear from you
My slapped face has healed
So has the misunderstanding
And what brings, what brings you around
Amidst this torrid time
With your heart near mine
To Reach Me keep your lover there
To Reach Me from your side of town
Never tell me you have alnight dreams
Don't talk of impulse or the lonely road
Those demons I just don't see them
Are there any here tonight?
Do they wear horns or burn bright

And the playboys have all gone to bed
They're tired and their models, drawn on a charcoal sketch
A pipe burns and the smoke goes over the calendar spread
Over the naked girls
Your family tree has never held a ghost
Did Gulliver ever bend down so far
Ruth said
Ruth said
She said
That you once disapproved
How could anyone disapprove of me?
To Reach Me keep your lover there
To Reach Me from your side of town
To Reach Me
To my side of townEmbed
