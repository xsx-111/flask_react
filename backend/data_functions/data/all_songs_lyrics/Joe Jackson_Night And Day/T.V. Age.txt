T.V. Age LyricsHere we stand –
(remote control buttons in our sweaty little hands)
As one man –
(we're lining up and waiting for someone's command)
We don't move –
(we sent out for food, get the news on video)
I can prove –
(there's no need for movies, we got HBO)
In the
T.V. age
They're out there somewhere
(you know the force has got a lot of power –
But what makes you think it gives a shit about you…
Who are you anyway?)
They're taking over
(and I believe –
The aliens have to take a physical form on our planet –
So why not one with 13 channels…)
They're out there somewhere
Times must change
(this ain't the stone age, we don't have rocks in our heads)
What's so strange –
(we don't work no more, so why get out of bed)
T.V. rules –
(pretty soon you won't be able to turn it off at all)
All you fools –
(then it'll turn you off – your back's against the wall)
In the –
T.V. AgeEmbed
