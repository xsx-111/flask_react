Target LyricsUptown – downtown
No one's fussy I'm a target
Black, white – day, night
No one's fussy I'm a target
Somebody say I'm crazy
Walking in this neighbourhood
Say you can't be too careful
But that won't do no good
I'm no one special
But any part of town
Someone could smile at me then
Shake my hand then gun me down
Uptown – downtown
No one's fussy I'm a target
Black, white – day, night
No one's fussy I'm a target
Somebody say I'm crazy
Living in this crazy town
I say maybe you're just lazy
Got to either swim or drown
I know what I'm doing
I'm happy day to day
But then something happens
Takes my nerve away
Uptown – downtown
No one's fussy I'm a target
Black, white – day, night
No one's fussy I'm a targetEmbed
