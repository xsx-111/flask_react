Slide Lyrics
I've been thinking about the way the world turns
And my stomach churns
When it finally hits me out of the sky
I knew this day would come, I'm on the front line

Woah
Don't know how to take it in, is love just suffering?
'Cause I can see where the chapter ends
I've got autumn leaves and heartbreak dreams inside, inside
'Cause you and me on this frozen sea we slide, slide

I'll wait all on my own like a flower in the snow
With just my shadow following me out into the cold
Where I walk past the trees to look for my love

Woah
And it's got me wondering, is love just suffering?
'Cause I can see where the chapter ends
I've got autumn leaves and heartbreak dreams inside, inside
'Cause you and and me on this frozen sea we slide, slide
