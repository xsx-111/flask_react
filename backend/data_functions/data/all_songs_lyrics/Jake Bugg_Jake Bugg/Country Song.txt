Country Song Lyrics
Gonna sing you an old country song, from the heart
So I can cry your name and call you when I'm sad
When you have gone, run so far from me in the trees so far

Walking down that old country lane, drops of rain
Call upon the ones who call your name
Will I see you again and please just come on back home to me
So I'm not all alone

Gonna sing you an old country song, from the heart
From the strings of this old rusty guitar3Embed
