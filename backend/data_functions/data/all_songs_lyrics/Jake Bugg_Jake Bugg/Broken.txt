Broken Lyrics
I'll wait here
For you
For I'm broken
Down, coming down
This town
For my heart lies

Far and away where they took you down
Led them over to your house
Where I'm broken
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Still my heart beats for you
Have become all I lost
And all I hoped for
But I must carry on
Always one
Never broken

Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Where soul feels
Why I'm broken
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Woah
I'm one
I am one
Break a story of
Peace and love in a future
Bright sacrifice
Came around
Never broken

Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Travelin' street that I did not go
Wheels locked on to the winter lope
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
I'm one
I'm one
I'm one26Embed
