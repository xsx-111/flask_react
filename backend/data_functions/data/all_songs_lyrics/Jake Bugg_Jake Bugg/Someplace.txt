Someplace Lyrics
It goes like the clouds
It floats like the sky
I want to go someplace and find you there

Don't go away
I need you to stay
I want to go someplace and find you there

And, yes, you just run to him
And I'll be down on my knees begging you
Begging you: Don't! I love you

I saw through your lies
I saw through your disguise
I want to go someplace and find you there

And, yes, you just run to him
And I'll be down on my knees begging you
Begging you: Don't! I love you

Don't go away
I need you to stay
I want to go someplace and find you there4Embed
