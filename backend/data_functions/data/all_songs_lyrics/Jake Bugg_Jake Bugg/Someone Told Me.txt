Someone Told Me Lyrics
Am I crazy or am I blind
Someone told me I'm out my mind
Woahoo
Someone told me a girl I liked
Fell in love and all I did was cry
Woahoo
Someone hold me
I'm done with this game
Said I'm sorry
But I'm not to blame
What a shame
Woahoo

Tryna break from this lonely pain
Someone told me I'm just insane
Woahoo
Broke my heart when I knew
That I could never be with you
Woahoo
Someone loved me
But not today
Will you show me
Show me a way
How to love
Woahoo
Someone told me
A girl I liked
Fell in love
And all I did was cry
