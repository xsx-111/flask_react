Fire Lyrics
Girl, baby girl
Will you come back home?
To me
For this darkest night won't ever let her be

And sing, fire, fire, fire
Oh I'll sing for you
My girl
Baby blue

Babe, oh babe
Will you love me so?
When I have to go
For this darkest night won't ever let her speak

And sing, fire, fire, fire
Oh my darling you, are blue
For me1Embed
