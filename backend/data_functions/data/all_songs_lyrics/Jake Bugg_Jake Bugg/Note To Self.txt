Note To Self Lyrics
Girl, you've been forgetting
Just how special you really are
And I try to remind you
Sometimes I can't find you
But the truth is in your heart
So write a note to yourself

Girl, don't beat yourself up
Your best is good enough
So pick the pen up

And write a note to yourself
A note to yourself
Don't be cruel
'Cause things do happen
And you know it's not your fault
Don't cover your wounds with the salt

Girl, let me tell you what I see
You've got to believe me
You're a thing of beauty
Girl, put it in an envelope
Put it in the post
It'll come back to your door
And read a note to yourself
A note to yourself
Don't be cruel
'Cause things do happen
And you know it's not your fault
Don't cover your wounds with the salt

And write a note to yourself
And read a note to yourself
A note to yourselfEmbed
