Trouble Town Lyrics
Stuck in speed bump city
Where the only thing that's pretty
Is the thought of getting out
There's a tower block overhead
All you've got's your benefits
And you're barely scraping by

In this trouble town
Troubles I've found
In this trouble town
Words do get around

Kick the bottom, make troubles flee
Smoke until our eyes would bleed
The spark will pop the seed
Hear the sirens down the street
The kids get light on their feet
Or they'll be in the back seat

In this trouble town
Troubles I've found]
Sitting on the pavement
Boy, you've missed your payment
And they're going to find you soon
If there's a beating in the rain
If there's a little bit of pain
Man, you're the one it happens to

If I talk of getting out
I only hear the laughter loud
It's got an ugly echo
Somewhere there's a secret road
To take me far away I know
But until then I am hollow

In this trouble town
Troubles I've found
In this trouble town
Fools I've found

Sitting on the pavement
Boy, you've missed your payment
And they're going to find you soon
If there's a beating in the street
There's a feeling of defeat
You're the one it happens to
Stuck in speed bump city
Where the only thing that's pretty
Is the thought of getting out1Embed
