War of the Hearts Lyrics
I could aim
But I could not fire
Got a bullet to spare
To kill my desire

Who's calling the shots?
One of us must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease

I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts

Who's calling the shots?
One of us (One of us) must end this masquerade
To have or to have not
Let's heal the wounds that we've made

It's a war of the hearts (It's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts
Got a bullet to spare
Don't wanna send it your way
Who's calling the shots?
One of us (One of us) must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease

It's a war of the hearts (It's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts

I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
(It's a sin) It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts (How we hit where it hurts)

One of us (One of us)
Got to end this masquerade
Got to heal the wounds that we've made
I've got a bullet to spare
Don't wanna send it your way
If you wanna end it
If you wanna end it, just say
It's a war of the hearts (It's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts
(Got to end this masquerade)

I've got a bullet to spare
And we don't wanna send it your way
If you wanna end it
(It's a war of the hearts)
If you wanna end it, just say

It's a war of the hearts
It's a war of the hearts
It's a war of the hearts1Embed
