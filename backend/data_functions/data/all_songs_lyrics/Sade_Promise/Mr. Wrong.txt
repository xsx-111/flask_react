Mr. Wrong LyricsHe don't care
Where he's been playing
He doesn't hear
A word she's saying
She's a fancy girl
So why's she staying
Hanging on for Mr. Wrong
He doesn't show her that he needs her
She doesn't know his love's a liar
She'a a fancy girl - got to be strong
Say so long - Mr. Wrong
Get out on your own girl
Show him how
You can be strong girl
You don't need him now
Run away, pretty girl
Say so long - Mr. Wrong
Run away
Bye byeEmbed
