Maureen LyricsMaureen
It's hard to explain
I'm never gonna see you again
And you'll never meet my new friends
Maureen, I miss you
I just can't explain
I'm never gonna see you again
I wish you could meet my new friends
Walking along the subway listening to
Loving you is easy acapella
You were a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-cart town
And I miss you, Maureen
We're as thick as thieves
Maureen, Maureen
Remember when my mother said to me
"Sade, don't you come home too late
'Til you're back, I stay awake"
And Maureen
With the boys you could tell at a glance
You'd say "He looks good
Let's hope he can dance"
Wicky wacky party to the...
Where are we going tonight
And what will you be wearing
Shone like a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-cart town
And I miss you, Maureen
I miss you, girl
You were my best friend
Never gonna see you again, Maureen
And you'll never meet my new friends
You really were a pearl in my world, Maureen
Maureen
It's hard to explain
You'll never go 'round to see me again
You'll never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends2Embed
