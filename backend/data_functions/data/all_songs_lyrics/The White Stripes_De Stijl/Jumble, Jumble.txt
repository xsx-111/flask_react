Jumble, Jumble Lyrics
Jumble, jumble
All at my house
Come on over
Sleep on the couch
Can't even see ya
Look like a mouse

Crumble, crumble
That bag is brown
Rip up the paper
To hear a sound
Pick the pieces
Up off the ground

Tumble, tumble
Onto the floor
Roll over
Until you're poor
Wave to me
I'm at the door2Embed
