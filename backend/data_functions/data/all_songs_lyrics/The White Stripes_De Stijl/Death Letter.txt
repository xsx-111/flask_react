Death Letter Lyrics
I got a letter this morning
What do you reckon it read?
It said, "The gal you love is dead."
I got a letter this morning
What do you reckon it read?
Said, "Hurry, hurry because the gal you love is dead."

Well, I packed up my suitcase
I took off down the road
When I got there, she was laying on the cooling board
I packed up my suitcase and I took off down the road
When I got there, she was laying on the cooling board

It looked like ten thousand people standing around the burying ground
I didn't know I loved her, 'til they began to let her down
Looked like ten thousand people standing on the burying ground
I didn't know that I loved her, 'til they began to let her down

You know, it's so hard to love someone that don't love you
Won't get satisfaction, don't care what you do
So hard to love someone that don't love you
Don't look like satisfaction and I don't care what you do
Well, I got up this morning, the break of day
Just hugging the pillows where she used to lay
Got up this morning, would you believe?
The break of day
Just hugging the pillows where my baby used to lay2Embed
