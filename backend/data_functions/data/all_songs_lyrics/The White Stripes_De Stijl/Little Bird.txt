Little Bird Lyrics
I got a little bird
I'm gonna take her home
Put her in a cage
And disconnect the phone

If you give me a look
I'm gonna get the book
I'm gonna preach the word
I wanna preach to birds
As I walk the floor
Yeah, this I know

When I get you home
This is how it goes
I got nothing to lose
I'll never let you go3Embed
