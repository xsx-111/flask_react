Sister, Do You Know My Name? Lyrics
Well, we're back in school again
And I don't really know anyone
I really wanna be your friend
'Cause I don't really know anyone
And the bus is pulling up to your house
I wish you could be sitting here next to me

I didn't see you at summer school
But I saw you at the corner store
And I don't want to break the rules
'Cause I've broken them all before
But every time I see you, I wonder why
I don't break a couple rules so that you'll notice me

Sister, do you know my name?
I've heard it before but I wanna know
I got a funny feeling that it's gonna work out
'Cause now I see you sitting here next to me1Embed
