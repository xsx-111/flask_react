Your Southern Can is Mine Lyrics
Now, looky here mama, let me explain you dis
You wanna get crooked, I'll even give you my fist
You might read from Revelation back to Genesi(s)
You get crooked, your southern can belongs to me

So, there ain't no use in bringing no jive to me
Your southern can is mine in the morning
Your southern can belongs to me

You might go uptown, have me arrested, put in jail
Some hotshot's got money, gonna pull my bail
Soon as I get out, hit the ground
Your southern can is worth two dollars and half a pound

So, there ain't no use in bringing no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I'm talking about it
Your southern can belongs to me

You might take it from the south, baby, hide it up north
Understand you can't rule me or be my boss
Take it from the east, hide it in the west
But when I get it, mama, you can't a-see no rest
So, there ain't no use in bringing no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I'm screaming
Your southern can belongs to me

Now baby, ashes to ashes, sand to sand
When I hit you, mama, then you feel my hand
Give you a punch through that barbed wire fence
When I hit you, baby, you know I make no sense

Ain't no use to bringing no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I know it
Your southern can belongs to me

Well now, look here, woman, don't get hot
I'll get me a brick outta my backyard

There ain't no use to bringing no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I'm talking about it
Your southern can belongs to me

Well, if I catch you, mama, down in the heart of town
I'm gonna grab me a brick and tear your can on down
Ain't no use to bringing no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I know it
Your southern can belongs to me

You may be deathbed sickness, baby, graveyard bound
I'm gonna make you moan like a graveyard hound, a-baby

Ain't no use to bringing no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I'm screaming
Your southern can belongs to me

"You keep moving around like you're uncomfortable. What's the matter, Willie?
Well, I was in a automobile accident last night, a little shook up. No one got hurt but it was all a jostle up mighty bad, shake up. Still sore from it but no one got hurt."1Embed
