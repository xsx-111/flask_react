Beautiful Dream LyricsDo what you want
But you gonna have to do it now
Say what you want
But you gonna have to say it loud
Runnin' around with the world on your shoulder
You look around and you're just gettin' older
Once you had a beautiful dream
Follow the sun
Oh, you know gonna live in the clouds
Oh, you know it's gonna hit the ground
Runnin' around with the world on your shoulder
You look around and you're just gettin' older
Once you had a beautiful dream
(You got a beautiful dream)
Ah, beautiful dream
(Got a beautiful dream)
Ah, beautiful dream
(You got a beautiful dream)
Ah
Runnin' around with your head full of worry
You look around and you're just bein' in a hurry
Once you had a beautiful dream
Do what you want
But you know, you gotta do it now
Kill what you want
But you better not kill this town
Runnin' around with the world on your shoulder
You look around and you're just gettin' older
Once you had a beautiful dream
(You got a beautiful dream)
Ah, beautiful dream
(You had a beautiful dream)
Ah, beautiful dreams
(You had a beautiful dream)
Ah
Do what you want, yeah
Do what you want, yeah
Do what you want, yeah
Do what you want, yeahEmbed
