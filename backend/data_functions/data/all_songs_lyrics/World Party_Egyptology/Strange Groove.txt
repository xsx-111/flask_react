Strange Groove LyricsOne, two, three
Come on everybody, whip up like a storm
In a strange groove
Take a look at Iceland, take a look over the edge
In a strange groove
Calm down you people, restlessness is here
In a strange groove
Yesterday, tomorrow, it's never really clear
In a strange groove
Holding on to millions, holding out a hand
In a strange groove
Look into the mirror, look inside the Louvre
In a strange groove
We're so far apart, we're next to each other
In a strange groove
Just a piece of rock in heaven, moving 'round a sky
In a strange groove
Dusty road, water hole, busting for a drink
In a strange groove
God's inside, God's inside, telling you that God has died
Strange groove
Miles Davis, Kentucky fries, forty fags a day
In a strange groove
Pass a law to save us all and give it all away
In a strange groove
Take a walk down by the river, nothing's really changed
It's a strange groove
Take a walk down by the river, nothing's really changed
It's a strange groove
Waking up forever, learning how to play
In a strange groove
Hit it, boys, it's after four, singing in the rain
A strange groove
Gimme, gimme, gimme every single day
Strange groove
Brain is like a chocolate fudge, thinking is a strain
In a strange groove
That's alright, don't matter much, thought brings on the pain
In a strange groove
It's a strange groove
It's a strange groove
Strange groove
Strange groove
