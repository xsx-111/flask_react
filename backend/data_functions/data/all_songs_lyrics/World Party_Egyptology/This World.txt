This World LyricsAin't no who, what, why or when
Gonna turn me round from this world
Ain't no, so I'm telling you again
Gonna make me stop into this world
So tired of hating, I'm just awaiting
You keep on walking to the end
Gonna make it work into this world
Come back, starting up again
Gonna make it right into this world
Love every hour in the tower
And you wait another day
And you know that they will say
That it's too late, yeah
They're telling you again
You turn around and nothing's right
You only got to shine your light
It's not make believe
Gonna make you believe
Ain't no who, what, why or when
Gonna turn me round from this world
Gonna get to this world
Watch every hour, we're in the tower
And you're holding on again
And you're trying to say, my friend
This will all turn out right
You know that it's the end
But the answer's here, my friend
But they're telling you
That it's just out of sight, yeah
Ain't nobody gonna put me down
Gonna turn me round from this world
This world, from this worldEmbed
