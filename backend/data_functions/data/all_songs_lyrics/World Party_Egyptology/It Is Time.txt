It Is Time LyricsIt is time to remember
It is time to forget
It is time to be dry
It is time to be wet
Look over the mountains
Look out in the sea
It is time
(It is time, it is time)
It is time to forgive
It is time to be forgiven
It is time to make play
It is time to make a living, yeah
Look out in the mountains
Look out in the sea
It is time
(It is time, it is time)
It is time
(It is time)
Time to be in
It is time to be out
It is time to stop twisting
It is time to shout, yeah
Look over the sunrise
Look out in the sea
It is time
(It is time, it is time)
Look out in the city
Look out on the beach
It is time
(It is time, it is time)
Look
It is time to be in
It is time to be out
It is time to be forgiven
It is time to shout, yeah
Look out in the city
Look out on the beach
It is time
(It is time, it is time)
Look out in the mountains
Look out over the sea
It is time, yeah
(It is time, it is time)
Yeah, it is time, yeah
(It is time)Embed
