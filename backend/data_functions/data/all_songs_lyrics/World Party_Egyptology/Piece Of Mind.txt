Piece Of Mind LyricsI'm a looking for you
What do you want me to do?
Open the door, shine a light
What do you want me for?
I just don't know anymore
Too many questions, too many chains
I'm going crazy, crazy being lazy
'Cos tomorrow it may rain
Say you know the answers
But all I see you making
Is the same mistakes again
Ooh, loving you can be so cruel
Even better than I want it to
Ooh, loving you can be so cruel
Even better than it ought to be from my mind
Ooh, my piece of mind
Going the wrong way down a one way street
I've got a feeling that you were born to cheat
No more for me, that's enough
We're on that runaway train
Going 'round in circles again
Put the brake on, stop at the light
I'm going crazy, crazy being lazy
'Cos tomorrow it may rain
Say you got the answers
But all I see you making
Is the same mistakes again
Ooh, loving you can be so cruel
Even better than I want it to
Ooh, loving you can be so cruel
Even better than it ought to be from your mind
Ooh, piece of mind
Ooh, my piece of mind
Ooh, my piece of mind
It's not in heaven, it's not the trees
Nothing's gonna happen to the birds and bees
It's not the ocean, it's not the air
The only place that matters is the place you care
In your mind
Ooh, ooh save your mind
Ooh, ooh save your mind
Ooh, ooh save your mind
Ooh, loving you can be so cruel
Even better than I want it to
Ooh, loving you can be so cruel
Even better than it ought to be for my mind
Ooh, loving you can be so cruel
Even better than it ought to be for my mind
Ooh, ooh piece of mind
Ooh, ooh my piece of mind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh piece of mindEmbed
