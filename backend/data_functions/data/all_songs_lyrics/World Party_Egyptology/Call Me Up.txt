Call Me Up LyricsCall me up when the night is over
Call me up when the night has gone
I had enough of this rolling over
Call me up and I will come along
Call me up and I will come along
Don't get me wrong
Been a long, long, long time
Since I had something that I really love
Don't get me wrong
Been a long, long, long, long, long time
Since I
Call me up when the night is over
Call me up when the night has gone
I'll turn around on the road I'm going
Just call me up and I will come along
Call me up and I will come along
Don't get me wrong
Been a long, long, long, long, long time
Since I heard something that I really love
Don't get me wrong
Been a long, long, long, long time
Since I
Don't get me wrong
Don't get me wrong
Whatever happened to those bits in the middle?
You know those crazy piano bits
I used to think that it went like that
But it really went like this
Really went like this
Call me up when the night is over
Yeah, I'm up now and the night is gone
Had enough of this rolling over
Call me up and I will come along
Call me up and I will come along
Call me up and I will come alongEmbed
