The Whole Of The Night LyricsWe got into their little black book
So, they came in a space ship to take a look
I saw them landing on Friday night
To bring love to the modern world
They're still trying to work us out
They marvel at the life we lead
'Cos they're traveling at a different speed
They think we're chasing after chicken feed
We're alive, in a modern way
We're still trying to work us out
Come round and visit please
I'll introduce you to my other family
They came from Mars tonight
To watch the human race go by
Try to make you see
There's a future here for you and me
But only love is gonna make it right
It could take all night
I keep getting so confused
But we're keeping them well amused
We're like a team that always lose
Wear our shorts in an old fashioned way
Still trying to work it out
Come round and visit please
I'll introduce you to my other family
They came from Mars tonight
To watch the human race go by
Try to make you see
There's a future here for you and me
But only love is gonna make it right
It could take all night
Come round and visit please
I'll introduce you to my other family
They leave for Mars tonight
And if we go too, it's gonna be alright
It just might take us the whole of the night
It just might take us the whole of the night
It just might take us the whole of the night
It just might take us the whole of the night
It just might take us the whole of the night
It just might take us
It just might take us the whole of the night
It just might take us the whole of the nightEmbed
