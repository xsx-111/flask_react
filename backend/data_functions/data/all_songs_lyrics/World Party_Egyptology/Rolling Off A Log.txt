Rolling Off A Log LyricsDo you remember how it used to be?
They always say
You mean those days when everybody laughed?
Well, how did they ever, ever slip away?
Just like rolling of a log
As we say goodbye to God
Yeah, the animal still feels odd
Asleep inside
Well, how it was, was how it had to be
At the end of every day
So perfect in its sense of duty
Well how did it ever, ever slip away?
Just like rolling off a log
The scientist thinks it's odd
That the animal says it's God
Asleep inside
So many fought the wars
And what was that all for?
They said, “Between good and evil?”
Well, I think they lied a little
We live in a prison, somewhat of our own design
Grab the key, unlock the door
Then you'll know what life is for
Stop rolling off a log
Yeah, the scientist says it's odd
And the animal still seems odd
Asleep inside
After such a long parade of history
So many seeing eyes
I wonder how life could do this thing to me?
How could I ever, ever lose my mind?
Just like rolling off a log
And the animal still seems odd
Asleep inside
Inside
Asleep inside
Asleep inside
It sleeps inside
It sleeps insideEmbed
