Vanity Fair LyricsMy, oh my, little girl, you should give just what you can
To the world, to your sisters, to those arms of a loving man
To your bliss, to your future, to your memories and prayers
Cause it's cold and it's changing, yeah, this place called Vanity Fair
My, oh my, little brother, can I look you in the eye?
Do you know what you're saying is it half remembered lies?
Handed down, half forgotten, re-believed and upside down
Are you sure that you get it now you live in Vanity Town?
Vanity Fair, where all you gotta do is stare
Plus you got to play unfair
So baby, lighten up your hair
Come to Vanity Town
Oh father, oh father, you said nothing of this fate
Now you smile as you sit there and pretend it's not too late
I said, “Why could you not tell me what it was that I would find”
But it's alright, I forgive you cause I know how you lost your mind
Vanity Fair; where all you gotta do is stare
Plus you got to play unfair
So baby, lighten up your hair
Come to Vanity Town
Come to Vanity Town
Oh now what will we suffer? To what fate will we be forced?
On this path was there no other way we could have got it worse?
Yes I see it now a pageantry that comes to Vanity fair
But I'm sad to say it came too late and now I just don't care
About Vanity Fair; where all you gotta do is stare
Plus you got to play unfair
So baby, lighten up your hair
Come to Vanity Town
Vanity Town, Vanity Town
Come to Vanity TownEmbed
