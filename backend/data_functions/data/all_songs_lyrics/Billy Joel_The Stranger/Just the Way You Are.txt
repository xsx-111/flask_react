Just the Way You Are Lyrics
Don't go changin'
To try and please me
You never let me down before, mmm
Don't imagine
You're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

I would not leave you
In times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mmm
I took the good times
I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go tryin'
Some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mmm mmm
You always have my
Unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever
Conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone
That I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Ahh, what will it take 'til you believe in me
The way that I believe in you

I said I love you
And that's forever
And this I promise from the heart, mmm mmm
I couldn't love you
Any better
I love you just the way you are
Right!

I don't want clever
Conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm-mm
I just want someone
That I can talk to
I want you just the way you are, ohh10Embed
