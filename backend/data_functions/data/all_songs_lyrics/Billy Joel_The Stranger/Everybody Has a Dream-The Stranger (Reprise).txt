Everybody Has a Dream/The Stranger (Reprise) Lyrics
While in these days
Of quiet desperation
As I wander through
The world in which I live
I search everywhere
For some new inspiration
But it's more than cold reality can give
If I need a cause for celebration
Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind
I rely on my imagination
And I dream of an imaginary time

I know that everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
And this is my dream, my own
Just to be at home
And to be all alone with you

If I believe in all the words I'm saying
And if a word from you
Can bring a better day
Then all I have are these games
That I've been playing
To keep my hope from crumbling away
So let me lie and let me go on sleeping
And I will lose myself
In palaces of sand
And all the fantasies
That I will be keeping
Will make the empty hours easier
Easier to stand
And I know that everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
And this is my dream, my own
Just to be at home
And to be all alone
All alone with you, oh
With you

I know that everybody has a dream
Oh, everybody has a dream
And I know everybody has a dream
Everybody, everybody, everybody (Everybody has a dream)
I know that everybody has a dream
(Everybody has a dream)
Everybody has a dream
