Get It Right The First Time Lyrics
I don't believe in first impressions
For just this once I hope
That looks don't deceive
I ain't got time for true confessions

Got to make the move right now
Got to meet that girl somehow

Get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna make the first time last

I'm not much good at conversation
I never was much good
At coming on real strong
But if all it takes is inspiration

Then I might have just what it takes
If I don't make no bad mistakes
And I
Get it right the first time
'Cause that's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna have to make the first time last

I might find the courage
Yeah, I might get up the nerve
But if my timing ain't just right
What purpose would that serve?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How to say those first few words
If I want to put myself in touch
The first few moments mean so much

So I suppose it's now or never
Before that woman
Walks right out of my life
Just let me pull myself together

I've got to give it one good try
Gotta take my chance tonight
Get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna have to make the first time lastEmbed
