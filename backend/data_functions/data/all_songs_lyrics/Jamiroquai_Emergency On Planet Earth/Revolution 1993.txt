Revolution 1993 Lyrics
Ah, let's get paramilitary
Do it!
It's time for a revolution

Yes you've got to stand up (stand up)
Stay strong (stay strong)
Start movin' in the right direction
Don't wait (don't wait)
Too long (too long)
For people promising divine intervention
Nineteen (nineteen)
Nine three (nine three)
And now I'm taking matters into my own hands
So fast (so fast)
I can't see (can't see)
A revolution is the only way that we can change, change, change
Yeah

Well it's hard times
White lines
Kids of nine getting down with gun crime
War zones, no homes
Ain't it time we gave the dog a bone
Say brothers (brothers)
Sisters (sisters)
Step up and put yourself in the picture
This time, you know
A revolution is the only way that we can change, change, change
Yeah
I wanna fight the power
Come on and fight the power yeah
Now don't you wanna stand and fight it now?
Come on, we can fight it now!

Question
Answer (answer)
Shake your hand and smile for the camera
But it's no good (no good)
You should (you should)
Spend time in your neighbourhood
Where black kids (black kids)
White kids (white kids)
And now I'm working overtime to be a crack kid
No job (no job)
No cash (no cash)
A revolution is the only way that we can change, change, change, yeah
I wanna fight the power yeah!
Let's stand and fight the power yeah!

Everything is sweet sunshine
But in the meantime (meantime)
Mankind (mankind)

We still don't (don't)

Sometimes I think that music is the only hope we have for revolution
