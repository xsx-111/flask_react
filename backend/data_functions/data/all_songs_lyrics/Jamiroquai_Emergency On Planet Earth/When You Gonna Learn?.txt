When You Gonna Learn? Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Have you heard the news today?
People right across the world
Are pledging they will play the game
Victims of a modern world
Circumstance has brought us here
Armageddon's come too near, too too near, now
Foresight is the only key
To save our children's destiny
The consequences are so grave, so so grave, now
The hypocrites, we are their slaves
So, my friends, to stop the end
On each other, we depend
Oh, we depend

Mountain high and river deep
Stop it going on
We gotta wake this world up from its sleep
Oh, people, stop it going on

Yeah, yeah
Have you heard the news today?
Money's on the menu in my favourite restaurant
Well, don't talk about quantity
Cause there's no fish left in the sea
Greedy men been killing all the life there ever was
And you'd better play in nature's way
She will take it all away
And don't try and tell me you know more than her
About right from wrong
Oh, you've upset the balance, man
Done the only thing you can
Now my life is in your hands
Mountain high and river deep, oh yeah
We've gotta stop it going on
We gotta wake this world up from its sleep
Oh, people, stop it going on

Ah-hah-hah-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh
Ah-hah-hah-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh
Ah-hah-hah-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh
Ah-hah-hah-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh

Mountain high and river deep
We've gotta stop it going on
We gotta wake this world up from its sleep
Oh, people, stop it going on
Greedy men will fade away, yeah, yeah, yeah
When we stop it going on
I know it's got to be that way
When people stop it going on
I'm askin'
Oh, when you gonna learn
To stop it going on
Now, when you gonna learn
To stop it going on
Now, when you gonna learn
To stop it going on
Oh, when you gonna learn to stop it going on?1Embed
