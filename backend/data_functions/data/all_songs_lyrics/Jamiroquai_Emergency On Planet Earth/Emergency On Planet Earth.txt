Emergency On Planet Earth Lyrics
The kids need education, Woah-ho-ho!
And the streets are never clean
I've seen a certain disposition
Prevailing in the wind (Sweet change)
If anybody's listening, oh
Emergency on planet Earth!
Is that life that I am witnessing?
Or just another wasted birth?

Now we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
Now we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
Yes we have

Think we're standing for injustice
White gets two and black gets five years
Well it took me quite a while to suss this
Now I know my head is cleared
And a little boy in hungry land
Is just a picture in the news
I won't see him in the TV advertising
Cause it might put you off your food
Now we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
Now we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
Come on!

Is anybody out there?
Is anybody out there?
Is anybody out there, yeah?
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
Ah-yes we have


Say what we got
Emergency on planet Earth is what we got
Oh, I'll tell you what we got now
Emergency on planet Earth is what we got
Is someone out there? Yeah
Emergency on planet Earth is what we got
Tell you what we got now
Oh, somebody, help me
Come on, somebody help me now
'Cause we got emergency
Come on, somebody help us now
Oh we need you
Oh, somehow the help has left me needing1Embed
