Music Of The Mind LyricsWhen it gets too ba-ad
And I never know which way to turn
There's a friend I see-ee, oh yeah
Who believes in me
He is all I have
Oh put your hand away
And bring it out
Another day
If I listen hard, if I listen hard now
I can hear him sayyy
I know somewhere we can go
So much better
Oh the music in my mind
Oh now the music in my mi-i-ind
I know somewhere we can go
So-o much better
Oh the music in my mind!
The music in my mi-i-i-ind yeah
I can take you there
I can take you there
Oh now
I wanna say that I can take you thereEmbed
