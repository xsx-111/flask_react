If I Like It, I Do It Lyrics
Whoa-ho-ho, yeah-heh-heh
Oh, don't ya know
If I like it, I just do it
Yeah

Say that we have all the time we need to make it right
Don't hurry for nobody, if it ain't the thing you like
"Know your place, and fit your space
Young man, you will conform"
I didn't hear my soul
Express those rules when I was born
Free to roam
Cause it's my home
You can't stop sweet inclination
The kids want the system breaking down
Not higher education
If it ain't no natural law, then you can keep your regulations
Cause if I like it, I do it

But I
Keep on moving, though they wanna
Bring me down
I gotta run for the cover
And I keep on smiling though they wanna
Tie me down and give me death for the lover
And I keep on losing
Though I'm proving what I'm doin'
I'm still groovin'
And if I like it, I do it
You've got to help those people
Break that legislation
We can overcome their suffocation
Execute your natural liberation
Happy to enjoy rejuvenation
All around
Hear the sound
No-one can stop us now
A thousand rules
For plastic fools
Now they can take a bow
Surely there's been time to see
It doesn't work by now
So if I like it, I just do it

Still I keep on finding that they're pushing
Those distorted visions
And I keep on living though I'm
Dying cause of their decisions
If I keep on looking
I can find a higher space
I'm still grooving
And if I like it, I do it, yeah
Do it!

Oh yeah, if I like it
Yes I know, if I like it, hey
Don't you know, if I like it
If I like it
If I like it
If I like it, I just do it
Hey, hey!
I wanna do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got to do it yeah
Come on
If you like it do it yeah (x4)
Just do it

Oh-oh, wanna do it yeah
I think I'll do it now
I think if I like it, I'm gonna do it
Say! We gotta do it now
We gotta do it now yeah
We gotta do it right now!
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha, yeah!
Oh, that's my DJ. Yeah!
You know I wanna do it!
Everybody say that if you like it
I think we'd better do it
I think we're gonna do it
I think we're gonna do it
I think I'm gonna do it!
You know I wanna do it
Come on baby, let's do it
Oh, if you like it yeah. (x3)Embed
