Hooked Up LyricsI'm so glad I've got you hooked up on my drug
Everybody dance to the music
Are you feeling well? Now you caught this bug
Everybody dance to the music
Think last time I took an overdose
Come on dance to the music
Hey, well it made me realize that I came too close
Now I'm gonna dance to the music, music, music
Yeah, come on now

Death can seem to bear no relevance
Bet you wished you'd danced to the music
What you want to do is kill yourself
Still you don't dance to the music
I can look at you and hear your scream
Come on dance to the music
And you tell me that your needle's clean
Come on dance, dance
Come on now dance to the music
I need it, need it, need it
Come on now dance to the music
I need it, need it, need it, yeah
Come on now dance to the music
