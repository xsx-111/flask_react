Weather with You Lyrics
Walking 'round the room singin' Stormy Weather
At Fifty Seven Mount Pleasant Street
Well it's the same room
But everything's different
You can fight the sleep
But not the dream

Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen
Strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar
And the Roman Empire
Couldn't conquer the blue sky

Well, there's a small boat made of china
It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece
Well, do I lie like a lounge-room lizard
Or do I sing like a bird released?

Everywhere you go
Always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather
The weather with you
1:55 - 2:14

Everywhere you go
Always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather
Take the weather
The weather with you

(Everywhere you go)

2:44 - 3:03

Everywhere you go
Always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather
Take the weather
The weather with you2Embed
