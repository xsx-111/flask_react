Tall Trees Lyrics
Watch out big ships are waiting
Salt frozen on your cheek
I saw a girl and boy arriving
And a steamer put out to sea

Tall tree
Stand in the distance
Remember
When you were green
Don't wipe
The salt from your skin
You must keep running the distance

Sun sleeps on misty morning
Light years from channel three
I feel halfway to zero
Call me a hero, I might just agree

Tall tree
Stand in the distance
Remember
When you were green
Don't wipe
The salt from your skin
You must keep running the distance
And the roses you grow
Have a powerful scent
They'll be breaking your heart
By the morning

I feel halfway to zero
Call me a hero, I might just agree

Tall tree
Stand in the distance
Remember
When you were green
Don't wipe
The salt from your skin
Tall tree
Tall tree
Don't wipe
The salt from your skin
You must keep running the distance
