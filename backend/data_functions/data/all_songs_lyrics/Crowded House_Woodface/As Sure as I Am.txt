As Sure as I Am Lyrics
Make your decision now
Rely on no help from above
Living is luxury
I want everything you throw out
I'll do anything you want to
Please let me go with you
I'll wear the smile on your face
Big, black and beautiful
I want it, everything you throw out
There must be something you can do without

'Cause I am as sure as I am
I couldn't care less
For what might go wrong
I'm as happy as sin
In a fear-shaken world

I pity the rhino
Down there it's becoming extinct
Killed for a love potion
Sad thing lookin' like a dead flower
I want it, everything that you throw out
'Cause I am as sure as I am
I couldn't care less
For what might go wrong
I'm as happy as sin
In a fear-shaken world

Oh, don't want to be there
Don't want to be spared
I'll wear the smile on your face

I am as sure as I am
I couldn't care less
For what might go wrong
I'm as happy as sin
In a fear-shaken world, world
I couldn't care lessEmbed
