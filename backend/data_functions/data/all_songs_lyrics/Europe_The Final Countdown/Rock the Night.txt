Rock the Night Lyrics
I've gone through changes
I've gone through pain
But there's not enough reason
For me to go insane
I know the feeling
Just when it grows
I'm in a rage up from my head
Down to my toes

You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want
What do you want? Whoa oh ho

You want to rock now, rock the night
Till early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
Whoa oh, whoa oh, yea
Rock now, rock the night
You'd better believe it's right
Rock now, rock the night
Whoa oh, whoa oh, oh oh, oh oh
I know my limit
Just what it takes
When things ain't good enough
I just pull the brake
Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes so tough
But just have one thing clear
I can't get enough

You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want
What do you want? Whoa oh ho

You want to rock now, rock the night
Till early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
Whoa oh, whoa oh, yea
Rock now, rock the night
You'd better believe it's right
Rock now, rock the night
Whoa oh, whoa oh, yea, yea
Oh, rock now, rock the night
Rock now, rock the night
Rock now, rock the night
Rock now, rock the night, rock it

You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want
What do you want? Whoa oh ho

Rock now, rock the night
Till early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
Whoa oh, whoa oh, yea
Rock now, rock the night
You, you'd better believe it's right
Rock now, rock the night
Whoa oh, whoa oh1Embed
