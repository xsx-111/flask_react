The Final Countdown Lyrics
We're leaving together, but still, it's farewell
And maybe, we'll come back to Earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (Leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown
The final countdown, oh

We're heading for Venus (Venus)
And still, we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all, yeah
With so many lightyears to go
And things to be found (To be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her, so

It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown (Final countdown), oh

The final countdown
Oh, it's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown (Final countdown)
Oh, it's the final countdown
We're leaving together (The final countdown)
We'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown (Final countdown)

Oh, it's the final countdown
