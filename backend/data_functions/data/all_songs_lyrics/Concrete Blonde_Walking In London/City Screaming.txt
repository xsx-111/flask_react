City Screaming LyricsBeen on the bus
Since a quarter to one
I'm bakin like a chicken
On the bus in the settin sun
Home home home
Under the window
Is that a shot or a car
I don't know i dont know i dont know
City smoke and city choke and crackin open
I hear the city screaming
I hear the city screaming
24 hours all night all day
The city hums and boils and cracks and beats away
?(stow)? them around stick em over a fire
No wonder everybody's strung up tighter than a god damn piano wire
City smoke and city choke and crackin open
I hear the city screaming
I hear the city sream
Crack the whip and
Mr. jack knife
We are doing the trip on the corner underneath the street light late night
Oneof the home boys just take it on home sweet home
Well you can blow your own self away
But leave the rest of us alone
The city die and city cry and you and I say
I hear the city screaming
I hear the city screaming
I hear the city screaming
I hear the city screamingEmbed
