Someday? LyricsSay it's been too hard
Say it's been too long
You say it's all too much
The thrill has long been gone
Well I thought you could
Yes I thought you could
And you thought you could too
But it's a place and time
Where the years behind are piled up high
But never mind
It's time to crash and burn or fly
And I thought you could
You know I thought you could
You know I thought you could too
Go to sleep now
Go on dream away
Isn't easy, is it babe?
And I hope
And I dream
And I pray
That sometime
We'll find a way
Some say easy come
Some say easy go
Some say time flies by too fast
Some say it drags on all too slow
Well I thought you could
You know I thought you could
And I thought I could too
But, if you never find
The heart to start all over again
Remember I was one
Who tried to be a friend to you ... I
Well, I know I tried
Yes, you know I tried
And I know you tried too
Go to sleep, now
Go on dream away
Isn't easy, is it babe?
And, I hope
And, I dream
And, I pray
That sometime
We'll find a way
Go to sleep, now
(Go to sleep, now)
Go on dream away
(Go on dream away)
Isn't easy, is it babe?
(Isn't easy, is it babe?)
And, I hope
And, I dream
And, I pray
That sometime
We'll find a wayEmbed
