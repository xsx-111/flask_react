Long Time Ago LyricsWhen you turned out the light
And walked out the door
I said to myself
What did I come here for?
Did you have a good time
Drinking whiskey and rye
And did you want to be
Bonnie and Clyde?
What goes on in your mind
What goes on in your head?
Who did you think I would be
Ha, well you got me instead
You think there's some connection
That I'm your female reflection
But no...
I can be loyal
And-a I can be true
But that's for somebody else
And it will never be you
You think we're predetermined
But babe you're learning
Way too slow...
But it seems such a long time ago
 Go, Fishman!
Oh, he can see things
You'll never know how to see
He's three times the man
You'll never know how to be
I'll do anything he wants
And I'll go anywhere
He wants me to go
And if that isn't love
Then I guess I'll just never know
But it seems a long time ago...Embed
