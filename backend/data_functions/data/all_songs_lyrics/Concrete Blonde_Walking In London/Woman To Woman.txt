Woman To Woman LyricsYou know your old man was with me last night
And I just want you to know I don't think it's right
Because Bessie used to sing to me
Don't ever play no second fiddle, baby
Always play lead
Talking woman to woman
Talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
Because i understand
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
You know i understand
I don't want your man
I don't need your man
You can have your man
I'm sure every word he says to me is true
Just like i'm sure they're true when he says them to you
Or a bird in a cage sure can sing
But I don't want no part of his three way thing
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
You know i understand
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
You know i understand
I don't need your man
I don't want your man
Oh yea
Heeeey yea
There's something about you
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
Cause i understand
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
I'm talking woman to woman
Because i understand
I don't need your man
Dont even want your man
You can have your manEmbed
