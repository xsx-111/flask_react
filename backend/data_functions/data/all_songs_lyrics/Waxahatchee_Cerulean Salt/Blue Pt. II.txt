Blue Pt. II Lyrics
If you think that I'll wait forever, you are right and
I'll give you everything you wanted if I can
And when I look into your olive colored eyes
I feel a breach, it makes me cry, it makes me cry
I wake up early every morning
And you sleep for hours after me
In our darkened bedroom
I can't breathe behind this curtain that we keep

We'll wake up sober two weeks later;
And we're loving
The atmosphere is fucking tired it brings us nothing
If you think that I'll stay forever you are right and
I'll give you everything you wanted when I can
And it may look like every hour is dictated
By the chance of rain
We won't melt or die
We won't even feel an ounce of pain1Embed
