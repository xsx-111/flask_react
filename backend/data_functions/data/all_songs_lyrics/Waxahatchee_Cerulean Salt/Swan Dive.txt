Swan Dive Lyrics
I cling to indifference, you to your worst memory
Dark winter morning you honk your car horn at me
And I will grow out of all the empty bottles in my closet
And you'll quit having dreams about a swan dive to the hard asphalt
Ooh, ooh...

Won't you sleep with me every night for a week
Won't you just let me pretend this is the love I need
And I will grow out of all the empty words I often speak
And you will be depleted, but much better off without me
Ooh, oohâ€¦

You hold on to the past, you make yourself miserable
And I'm ruled by seasons and sadness that's inexplicable
And we will find a way to be lonely any chance we get
And I'll keep having dreams about loveless marriage and regret
Ooh, ooh...3Embed
