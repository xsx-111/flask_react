Coast to Coast Lyrics
Treacherous, empty
Alert on the backseat
Visiting disgrace
Each dull face or first name
You scan the AM for “Coast to Coast”
I’ll try to embrace the lows

Woo ooh ooh oohhhhhhh
Woo ooh ooh oohhhhhhh

We lay at night
Cursing our stage fright
Or leading our own lives
Into the empty night
When you’ve indulged every reckless whim
What is the weight of all your weakness?

Woo ooh ooh oohhhhhhh
Woo ooh ooh oohhhhhhh
Woo ooh ooh oohhhhhhhEmbed
