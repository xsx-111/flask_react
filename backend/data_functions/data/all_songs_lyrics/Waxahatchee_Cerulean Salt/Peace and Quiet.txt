Peace and Quiet Lyrics
End up in alabaster
The radio counts your thoughts
You grow as big as the ocean
Soothing when I'm distraught

But you can't run, you can't hide
You're a giant
You defend all the damage you caused
If I muster the strength to afflict you
I won't feel any better at all

Some cosmetic illusion
You'll rest your callow bones
And blame my hardworking father
For harm you cannot atone

But you can't argue the truth you're exceeded
You will rest on your laurels and stall
If I muster the strength to afflict you
I won't feel any better at all4Embed
