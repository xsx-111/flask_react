Waiting Lyrics
Red forest
Double cross
You’ll hunt me down
Smack me around
I know you

We’ll burn down every tree
Live out a dream
And we’ll be alone
This grave is our home and we’re free

And you’ll never cut me as deep
We’ll garnish a home
But my blood is my own
And we’re free

Red forest that once stood
We come unwound
Lay on the ground
Don’t make a sound
We’re waiting
‘Cause everything has to end
So I would recommend
To be waitingEmbed
