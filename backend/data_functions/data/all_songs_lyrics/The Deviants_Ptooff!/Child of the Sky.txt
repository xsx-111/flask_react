Child of the Sky LyricsShe walks in the teeth of the city where its neon ways are warm
Through all the laughing angels, and still she comes to harm
But watch still and waiting you'll never see her cry
For the orphan of the earth is the child of the sky
All praises lead to silence
As the beast mark stands revealed
And the bearded ancient prophet
Is dragged off by his heels
And they all crowd the platform and hope to see her die
But the orphan of the earth is the child of the sky
She laughs as they play the guilt game and pile up the dead
And the flashing sign spells Zyklon as it burns above each head
But the words are all spelled backwards and there is no use to try
For the orphan of the earth is the child of the sky
There never was no rainbow ask the preacher in disguise
As he lays aside his shotgun and covers up his eyes
And the hunchback's proposition explains the reason why
The orphan of the earth is the child of the sky
In the end, the antique picture cannot force a truth to tell
And her days, each gray and mindless, form a private hell
But don't ask any questions and you won't hear a lie
Where the orphan of the earth is the child of the skyEmbed
