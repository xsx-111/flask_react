Nothing Man LyricsThe nothing man
The nothing man
The nothing man
Lives off the greed (despite of his)
And grinds the inquiring hand
Into (shhh) fingers
The nothing man
Is packed (inspected)
Is educated and processed
He is hygienic and sterile
And he watches (at the ancient story)
And the knowledge of former days (of the inappropriate celebration)
The nothing man screws but he does not love
And he picks up tools 
And wishes it were the SS man
With his whip
On the cover of the magazine
Part two
The nothing man points
Laughs
And stares
And sniggers
And greeds
More (and more)
And more (two, three, four...)
And more (two, three, four...)
And more (two, three, four...)
And more (two, three, four...)
And more (two, three, four...)
(At himself)
He is the nothing man
The nothing man, the nothing man
He is the nothing man
Who lives on you and me
The nothing man
