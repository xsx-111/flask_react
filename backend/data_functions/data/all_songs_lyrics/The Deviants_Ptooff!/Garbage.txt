Garbage LyricsWe've
Got garbage
We've
Got garbage
We've
Got garbage
We've
Got garbage
Won't you buy?
Buy some garbage
Won't you buy?
Buy some garbage
Won't you buy?
Buy some garbage
Won't you buy?
Buy some garbage
Blaaaugh! Blaaaugh!
Garbage make you feel so good
Make you feel like you think you should
Garbage can make you feel so large
Put two cars in your garage
Garbage can make you feel so good
Garbage can make you feel so good
Garbage make you feel so good
Make you feel like you think you should
Garbage can make you feel so large
Put two cars in your garage
Why can't you feel it?
Why don't you pick it up?
Why can't you feel it?
Why don't you hold it in your hand?
Why can't you feel it?
Why don't you fondle it?
Why can't you feel it?
Why don't you stroke it?
Why can't you feel it?
Why don't you suck it?
Why can't you feel it?
Why can't you feel it?
Oh, oh, feel it!
Why can't you feel it?
I can't feel it!
Why can't you feel it?
To be singing!
Why can't you feel it?
Ack, ack, ack, oughck!
Why can't you feel it?
Ock! Ock! Ock! feel it!
Why can't you feel it?
Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage
Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage
Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage
Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage
Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage
Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage
Houswife's loving, it is oh so good
Give it to your husband like you should
Garbage is so good for you
Just one thing that you should do
Make a good forethought in life
Get some garbage right awayEmbed
