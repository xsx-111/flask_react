Lovely to See You Lyrics
A wonderful day
For passing my way
Knock on my door
And even the score
With your eyes

Lovely to see you again, my friend
Walk along with me to the next bend

Dark cloud of fear
Is blowing away
Now that you're here
You're going to stay
'Cause it's

Lovely to see you again, my friend
Walk along with me to the next bend

Tells us what you've seen
In faraway forgotten lands
Where empires have turned back to sand
A wonderful day
For passing my way
Knock on my door
And even the score
With your eyes

Lovely to see you again, my friend
Walk along with me to the next bendEmbed
