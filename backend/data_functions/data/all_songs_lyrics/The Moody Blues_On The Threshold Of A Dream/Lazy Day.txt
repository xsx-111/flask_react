Lazy Day LyricsLazy day, Sunday afternoon
Like to get your feet up, watch TV
Sunday roast is something good to eat
Must be lamb today 'cause beef was last week
So full up, bursting at the seams
Soon you'll start to nod off, happy dreams
Wake up, for tea and buttered scones (It's such a crying shame)
Such a lot of work for you Sunday moms.(Week after week the same.)
Today's heaven-sent and you're feeling content
You worked all week long
Still, it's quite sad, tomorrow's so bad
And I don't feel too strong
Lazy day, Sunday afternoon
Like to get your feet up, watch TV
Sunday roast is something good to eat, (That's how your life goes by)
Now it's almost over till next week.(Until the day you die.)Embed
