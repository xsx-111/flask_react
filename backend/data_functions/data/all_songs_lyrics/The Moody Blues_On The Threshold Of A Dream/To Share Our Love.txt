To Share Our Love LyricsMakes me feel good
Now I can see
It takes more than one to give
The life we need
I can't think why (Can't think why...)
I never thought of this before (Why I never thought of this before)
Now I know what it means to me (Now I know what it means to me)
To share (To share, share all my love with you)
To share my love (To share, share all my love with you)
Now that I know (Can't think why...)
I found the answer for myself (Why I never thought of this before)
What a day it would be for me (Now I know what it means to me)
To share (To share, share all my love with you)
To share your love (To share, share all my love with you)
I can't think why (Can't think why...)
I never thought of this before (Why I never thought of this before)
Now I know what it means to me (Now I know what it means to me)
To share (To share, share all my love with you)
To share my love (To share, share all my love with you)
Now that I know (Can't think why...)
I found the answer for myself (Why I never thought of this before, never)
What a day it would be for me (Now I know what it means to me)
To share (To share, share all my love with you)
To share your love (To share, share all my love with you)
Now I know why (Can't think why...)
I found the answer for myself (Why I never thought of this before, never)
What a day it would be for me (Now I know what it means to me
To share (To share, share all my love with you)
To share your love (To share, share all my love with you)
To share, to share my love (Makes me feel good)
To share, to share my love
To share, to share my love
To share, to share my love (I found the answer for myself)
To share, to share my love
To share, to share my love
To share, to share my love
To share, to share my love
To share, to share my loveEmbed
