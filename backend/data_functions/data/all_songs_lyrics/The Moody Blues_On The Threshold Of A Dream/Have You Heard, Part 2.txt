Have You Heard, Part 2 LyricsNow you know how nice it feels
Scatter good seed in the fields
Life's ours for the making
Eternity's waiting, waiting
For you and me
Now you know that you are real
Show your friends that you and me
Belong to the same world
Turned on to the same word
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?Embed
