So Deep Within You LyricsTalk to me baby, I want to sleep at night
My heart is heavy, it's weighed down by the night
And now I'm lonely, I want to see the light
So deep within you
Cool wind is blowing through your crazy hair
Warm colours flowing, this feeling we have shared
And now I'm lonely, I want to feel the love
So deep within you
Your love's a never-ending dream
A castle by a stream of sweet understanding
I know you're thinking of me too
The messages from you are my inspiration
Love's incense lingers, it never fades away
Like you I'm waiting for our special day
And now I'm lonely I want to feel the love
So deep within you
My love is burning, like a forest fire
My heart is yearning, I feel a warm desire
And now I'm lonely, I want to touch the fire
So deep within youEmbed
