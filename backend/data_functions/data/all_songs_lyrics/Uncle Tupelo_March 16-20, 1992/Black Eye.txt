Black Eye LyricsHe had a black eye he was proud of
Like some of his friends
Made him feel somewhere outside
Of everything and everywhere he'd been
Like his brothers, he emptied himself
And played it safe
Like their father, he wanted to remember
But he almost always forgot what he was gonna say
Black eye
Black eye
When he realized that this one
Was here to stay
He took down all the mirrors in the hallway
And thought only of his younger face
Black eye
