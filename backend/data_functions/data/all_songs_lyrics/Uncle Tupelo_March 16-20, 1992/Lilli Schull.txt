Lilli Schull LyricsA great crowd has now gathered
All around the jail today
To see me executed
And hear what I do say
Now I must hang this morning
For the murder of Lilli Schull
Whom I so cruelly murdered
And her body shamefully burned
The fire where I burned her
Is again now in my sight
Her lovely face recovering
And the fire that burned so bright
The cries of poor Lilli
Again I can almost hear
As she begged me not to kill her
Her life alone to spare
Now I bow down to Jesus
In penitential grief
And I beg him now to save me
Like he did the dying thief
God bless my aged parents
Who mourn for me alone
And my wife and baby
Who will be left alone
It was then that I heard a whisper
In a most gentle tone
"My grave is one sufficient
To save the vilest one"Embed
