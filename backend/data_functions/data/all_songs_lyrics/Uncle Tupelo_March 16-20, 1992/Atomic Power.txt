Atomic Power LyricsDo you fear this man's invention
That they call atomic power?
We all in great confusion
Do we know the time or hour?
When a terrible explosion
May rain down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction
Blotting out the works of man
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
There is one way to escape
Be prepared to meet the Lord
When the mushroom of destruction falls
There is a shielding sword
He will surely stand beside you
And you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety
And eternal peace and rest
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?Embed
