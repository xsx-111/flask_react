Criminals LyricsWe've got two kinds here:
Those that bleed the blood and those that work to will it
Can't believe the big screen, there's no justice in the hall
We're all criminals waiting to be called
We've got shackles to keep the laws
Made by men who bought and sold themselves
With not a prayer to keep their powers at bay
They want us kinder, gentler, at their feet
They say, "Don't step off the sidewalk and don't cross over the line"
But we'll serve time at night when the light begins to dim
When the smoke seems to clear, you can say what you want
We're all criminals here
How many times will the teeth bite
The tongue looking for salvage in the damage that's done?
Oh, I searched for you, every place I thought I knew
Still, we're criminals looking for something to doEmbed
