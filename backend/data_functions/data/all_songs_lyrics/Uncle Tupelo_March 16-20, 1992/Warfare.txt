Warfare LyricsMy Lord told His disciples
"After I'm risen and gone
You'll meet with troubles and trials
Bear your rebukes and scorns"
"My warfare will soon be ended
My race is almost run
My warfare will soon be ended
And I'm coming home"
"You can rebuke Me all you want to
I'm traveling home to God
I'm well acquainted with the crosses
And all My ways are hard"
They say My Lord is the devil
They call His saints the same
I don't expect much more down here
Than grief and scorn and shame
God bless them holiness people
The Presbyterians too
Those good old shouting Methodists
Those praying Baptists too
And when you get to heaven
I wanna see you there
And when I say, "Amen"
I want you to say so too
My warfare will soon be ended
My race is almost run
My warfare will soon be ended
And I'm coming home
And I'm coming home
And I'm coming homeEmbed
