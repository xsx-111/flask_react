How Do the Fools Survive? Lyrics
Oh, I hand them this life
To do what they will
They've got to find their way from here
(Oh, show us the way)
If they only knew
(Oh, show us the light)
Oh, show them what light
It shines from within
They make their own day
They make their own night
And sometimes they win
(Oh, show us the way)
But they always get through
(Oh, show us the light)

Oh, why do they come and ask for more?
They've got stars they don't have wishes for
They're just givin' up their blame to me
Oh, how do the fools survive?

I'm wonderin' why, I'm wonderin' how
They're gonna bail themselves out now
(Oh, give us this day)
I'm shakin' my head
(Oh, keep us through night)
Oh, I hand them this life
To do what they will
They've got to make their way from here
(Oh, show us the way)
If they only knew
(Oh, show us the light)
Oh, why do they come and ask for more?
They've got stars they don't have wishes for
They're just givin' up their blame to me
Oh, how do the fools survive?

(It's not like it was before)
Not like it was before
(When they call I won't come running)
It was so long ago
I left them on their own
Oh, how do the fools survive?


Oh, why do they come and ask for more?
They've got stars they don't have wishes for
They're just givin' up their blame to me
Oh, how do the fools survive?
