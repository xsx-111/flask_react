Open Your Eyes Lyrics
Girl, as we take a long last look at this love
Before you go, baby, I've got to know
(I've got to know, was it ever true)
Was it ever true, baby?
(I've got to hear it from you)
Girl, I can take one more hurt in this heart
Before you go, baby, I've got to know
(I've got to know, was it ever true)
Was it ever true, baby?
(I've got to hear it from you)
Not like before
(We were lost in a whirling dance)
Never slowing down
(Long enough to give truth a chance)
To come out
So that the light could shine in

Open your eyes (Open your eyes, baby)
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown (Oh baby)
Open your eyes (Open your eyes, darling)
Let's not let what never was bring us down

I've got to know
(I've got to know, was it ever true)
Was it ever true, baby?
(I've got to hear it from you)
Not like before
(We were lost in a whirling dance)
Never slowing down
(Long enough to give truth a chance)
To come out
So that the light could shine in

Open your eyes (Open your eyes now, baby)
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown (Oh baby)
Open your eyes (Open your eyes now)
Let's not let what never was bring us down (Open your eyes, baby)
Open your eyes (Yeah, yeah)
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown (Yeah, yeah)
Open your eyes
Let's not let what never was bring us downEmbed
