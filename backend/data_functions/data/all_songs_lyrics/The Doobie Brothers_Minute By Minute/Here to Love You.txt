Here to Love You Lyrics
I've heard it said that the weight of the world's problems
Is enough to make the ball fall right through space
That it ain't even worth it to live
With all that's going wrong
Well, let me just go down as saying
That I'm glad to be here
Here with all the same pain and laughs
Everybody knows
Some men think they're born to be king now
Maybe that's true, girl
But I think passing love along
Is all we were born to do

Let them build their kingdom
Let them make the laws for this world to heed
Oh, you and I make life worth living
Right here in each other's arms

I'm here to love you, baby
No more loneliness, yeah
No more emptiness, oh no
I'm here to love you, yeah, yeah now

Let them build their kingdoms
Let them make the laws for this world to heed
Oh, you and I make life worth living
Right here in each other's arms

I'm here to love you (I'm here to love you), baby
(I'm here to love you)
No more loneliness
(I'm here to love you) Yeah
(I'm here to love you)
No more emptiness
(I'm here to love you) Oh now
(I'm here to love you)
Yeah now
(I'm here to love you)
Yeah, yeah now
(I'm here to love you)
(I'm here to love you)
I'm here to love you
(I'm here to love you)
Oh now
(I'm here to love you)
Yeah, yeah now
(I'm here to love you)
Just let me go on loving you
(Just let me go on now)
Don't stop me now that I'm feeling this way
(Don't stop me)
Just let me go on loving you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't stop me now that I'm feeling this way
(Just let me go on now)
Just let me go on loving you
(I'm here to love you)
Don't stop me now that I'm feeling this way
(Baby)
Just let me go on loving you
(Now, now, now)
Don't stop me now that I'm feeling this way
(Don't stop me)Embed
