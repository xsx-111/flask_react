Born to Lose LyricsI was brought in this world 1962
I didn't have much choice you see
But by the time I was eight
I could tell I was too late
I was already barking up the wrong tree
Well, when I was in school
You thought I was a fool
In trouble, breaking all the rules
I was absent from class
My daddy spanked my bare ass
But I sure tried hard to be cool
Born to lose, was what they said
You know I was better off dead
Born to lose, you're just bad news
You don't get no second chance
It was a hot summer night in mid July
A hangover and a black eye
Your mama said I was a loser
A dead end cruiser
And deep inside I knew that she was right
Born to lose, was what they said
You know I was better off dead
Born to lose, you're just bad news
You don't get no second chance
I tried to get myself a job
Because the way that things are
Wanna have nice things and go far
Well, I'm sorry, honey
I ain't got much money
But I can sure play this here old guitar
As the years went on
I made a few mistakes
It was troublebound for this young man
The police knocking at my door
"Well, he don't live here no more
And he's playing in a rock 'n' roll band"
Born to lose, was what they said
You know I was better off dead
Born to lose, you're just bad news
You don't get no second chance
Born to lose, was what they said
You know I was better off dead
Born to lose, you're just bad news
You don't get no second chanceEmbed
