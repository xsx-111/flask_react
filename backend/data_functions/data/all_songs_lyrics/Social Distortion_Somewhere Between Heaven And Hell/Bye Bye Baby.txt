Bye Bye Baby LyricsWell, I believed I was wrong but, baby, now I know
You and your evil ways, they gotta go
Take the key and break away these chains of love
And I'll thank the good Lord above
The radio's playing a sad song
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Well, maybe the others will believe your lies
You can tell these schoolboys your alibis
And, baby, I'll catch you later on down the line
'Cause, baby, I got better things on my mind
The band's playing a sad song
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Well, maybe I was wrong but, baby, now I know
You and your evil ways, they gotta go
Take the key and break away these chains of love
And I'll thank the good Lord above
The radio's playing a sad song
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
The band's playing a sad song
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeah
Bye, bye, baby, yeah, yeahEmbed
