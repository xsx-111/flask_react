Making Believe LyricsMaking believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe is all I can do
Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe is all I can do
I can't hold you close
Darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
And making believe
I can't hold you close
Darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
And making believe
Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe is all I can do
I can't hold you close
Darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
And making believe
Just loving you
And making believe
Just loving you
And making believeEmbed
