Ghost Town Blues LyricsEver since my baby left me
Y'know this ghost town ain't no fun no more
She stole my heart away from me
And then she dropped it on the floor
My outsides are tough, hellbent
Leather overcoat of what was once a man
But inside's a little broken hearted boy
Whose feelings he cannot stand
I've got those ghost town blues
With nothing left to lose
The noose swings high up on the gallows in the wind
I've got those ghost town blues
I feel like an undertaker dressed in black
But no one left for dead
She left me in a heartbeat
And now there's no one left to sleep in my bed
Where laughs and cries and memories were once
Now lie tumbleweeds and dust
And an empty graveyard feeling
That began once just as a childhood lust
I've got those ghost town blues
With nothing left to lose
The noose swings high up on the gallows in the wind
I've got those ghost town blues
My Pontiac spits back feelings of contempt
Out the exhaust
A hundred miles an hour down a highway
Well, I'm beat up and I'm lost
She's gone and I know it
Like an outlaw, she ran for the hills
I'll start a brand new life with a new girl
And those same old ghost town thrills
I've got those ghost town blues
With nothing left to lose
The noose swings high up on the gallows in the wind
I've got those ghost town blues
I've got those ghost town blues
I've got those ghost town blues
I've got those ghost town blues
I've got those ghost town bluesEmbed
