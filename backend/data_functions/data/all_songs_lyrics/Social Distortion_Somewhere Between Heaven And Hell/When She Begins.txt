When She Begins LyricsWell, I was feeling kinda beat
I decided to hit the streets
I was looking for a place for this heart of mine
Well, I said to myself
Oh God, this must be hell
I think I was slowly losing my mind
Well, 'round and 'round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
That woman put a spell on me
You can start me, start me, start me
You can't stop me, stop me, stop me
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll
Well, I was hanging out by the phone
Tired of sleeping alone
Baby, tell me where did I go wrong?
Well, minutes seemed like hours
And days seemed like weeks
How could a year last so fucking long?
Well, 'round and 'round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
That woman put a spell on me
You can start me, start me, start me
You can't stop me, stop me, stop me
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll
Well, I was hanging out with a couple of chicks
Man, I was just looking for kicks
I was looking for a place for this raggedy ol' heart of mine
Well, I said to myself
Oh God, this must be hell
I think I was slowly losing my mind
Oh, 'round and 'round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
That woman put a spell on me
You can start me, start me, start me
You can't stop me, stop me, stop me
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to rollEmbed
