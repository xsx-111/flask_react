Cold Feelings Lyrics
Uninvited feelings
They come without a warning and they stay too long
I don't wanna feel
If I run, it'll be just as strong

I've been awaiting
Awaiting for some kind of a sign
I try to separate
Try to separate my body from my mind

I watch the clock
As the second hand slowly goes strolling by
I don't want to feel
When a loved one's time's come to die

I've been awaiting
Awaiting for some kind of a sign
I try to separate
Try to separate my body from my mind

Cold feelings in the night
Y'know, this feeling just ain't right
And though I try, I just can't hide
Cold feelings in the night
Look out!


Yeah, I got faith
But sometimes fear, it just weighs too much
I don't wanna feel
Cold winds blowing through me like an empty touch

I've been awaiting
Awaiting for some kind of a sign
I try to separate
Try to separate my body from my mind

Cold feelings in the night
Y'know, this feeling just ain't right
And though I try, I just can't hide
Cold feelings in the night
Cold feelings in the night
Y'know, this feeling just ain't right
And though I try, I just can't hide
Cold feelings in the night
Cold feelings in the night
Cold feelings in the night
Cold feelings in the nightEmbed
