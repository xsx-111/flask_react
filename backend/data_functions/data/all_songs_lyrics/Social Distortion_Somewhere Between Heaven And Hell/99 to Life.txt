99 to Life LyricsI'm broken hearted, I'm a broken man
Driven by anger, on that night I ran
I had me a woman, I thought that she'd be true
Now she's gone and left me, you know her life is through
Lonely weekends, baby, lonely nights
The judge, he gave me ninety-nine to life
I wish she could be here, Lord, if she only could
Instead, she's laying in a puddle of blood
She was my baby, I thought she'd be my wife
I killed my baby, I killed her with my knife
Lonely weekends, baby, lonely nights
The judge, he gave me ninety-nine to life
Alone I'm sitting in my prison cell
The Lord only knows now, I'm in a living hell
The rest of my life now, in this penitentiary
The good Lord above now, please have mercy on me
Lonely weekends, baby, lonely nights
The judge, he gave me ninety-nine to life
Lonely weekends, baby, lonely nights
The judge, he done gave me ninety-nine to lifeEmbed
