Sometimes I Do LyricsSometimes I like you
And sometimes I don't
I feel like I'm gonna, then I won't
Sometimes I wanna live
To see a hundred
Other times, I wanna lay down and die
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I'm weak
And sometimes I'm strong
You know that I've loved you all along
Sometimes I'm rich
And sometimes I'm poor
Nothing really matters when you're dead on the floor
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I'm hot
And sometimes I'm cold
Other times, feel like I'm getting old
Sometimes I'm fast
And sometimes I'm slow
Other times, I don't even wanna go
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I laugh
And sometimes I cry
Other times, I sit and wonder why
Sometimes I'm up
And sometimes I'm down
Other times, I wanna blow this town
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don'tEmbed
