King of Fools LyricsI was born the king of fools
Most people think I'm just a playboy breaking rules
But they don't know that when it comes around to love, I always lose
That's why I call myself the king of fools
I was born never to care
But now I want a love that I can share
I searched in vain for a love that would never be true
That's why I call myself the king of fools
King of fools
King of fools
When it comes around to love, I always lose
I was born without one good thought
Just to live fast, to lie and break your heart
I have broken many hearts, and I've broken many rules
That's why I call myself the king of fools
King of fools
King of fools
When it comes around to love, I always lose
I was born the king of fools
At any other game, I never lose
But when it comes around to love, that's when I realize
I was born the king of fools
King of fools
King of fools
When it comes around to love, I always lose
King of fools
King of fools
At any other game, I never lose
King of fools
King of fools
When it comes around to love, I always loseEmbed
