Supernatural Superserious Lyrics
Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
That they would just soon forget
And disguise
At the summer camp where you volunteered
No one saw your face
No one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away
From this base and sheer
Humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares
No one remembers
And nobody cares

How you cried and you cried
He's alive he's alive
How you cried and cried and you
Cried and you cried

If you call out "safe"
Then I'll stop right away
If the premise buckles
And the ropes start to chafe
The details smart
But the story's the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage station
Yeah you cried and you cried
He's alive he's alive
How you cried and you cried and you
Cried and you
Realized your fantasies
Are dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets

Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
That they would just as soon forget
And disguise

Yeah you cried and you cried
He's alive he's alive
Yeah you cried and you cried and you
Cried and you cried

Now there's nothing
Dark and there's nothing weird
Don't be afraid I will hold you near
From the seance where you first betrayed
An open heart on a darkened stage
A celebration
Of your teenage station
It's an experience sweet, delirious
Supernatural, super serious
An experience sweet, delirious
Supernatural, super serious
