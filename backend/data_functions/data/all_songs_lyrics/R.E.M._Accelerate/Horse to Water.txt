Horse to Water Lyrics
I could have kept my head down
I might have kept my mouth shut
I should have held my own
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown

You're only as big as your battles
Rattle my cage with your shadow
I'm a bantamweight with a mouth full of feathers
Don't you know that what comes around goes around?

I'm not that easy
I am not your horse to water
I hold my breath, I come around, round, round

Don't darken my doorstep again
You're mixing up living in chin-chin
You're mixing up lose with win-win
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown

You stumble on glass top table
TV's chewing shotgun cable
Pump me up a beanstalk fable
And I'll call this entertainment
Cause Humpty's falling down
I'm not that easy
I am not your horse to water
I hold my breath, I come around, round, round

Pick a fight an ultra-buzzy bubble
Friday night fucking fried-up pub crawl
Bantamweight with a mouth full of feathers
Don't you know that what comes around goes around?

I'm not that easy
I am not your horse to water
I hold my breath, I come around, round, round
It's not that easy
I am not your horse to water
I hold my breath, I come around, round, round

It's going down, down, down
This runaround, round, round
Is bound to pound
The daylights out of you!Embed
