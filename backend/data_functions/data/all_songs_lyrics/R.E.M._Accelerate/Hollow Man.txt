Hollow Man Lyrics
I've been lost inside my head
Echoes fall off me
I took the prize last night for complicatedness
For saying things I didn't mean and don't believe

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man
Have I become the hollow man I see?

Mmmmmm, I see
This echoing

You have placed your trust in me
I went upside-down
I emptied out the room in thirty seconds flat
I can't believe you held your ground

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man
Have I become the hollow man I see?
I'm overwhelmed, I'm on repeat
I'm emptied out, I'm incomplete
You trusted me, I want to show you
I don't want to be the hollow man

Believe in me, believe in nothing
Corner me and make me something
I've become the hollow man
Have I become the hollow man I see?Embed
