This Gift LyricsI've got something waiting for you, that's right
I've got something waiting for you, that's right
Sending you up the wall uptight
I've got something waiting for you, tonight
I've got this gift
(from God)
I've got this gift
(from God)
I've got this gift
(from God)
Pointing my heart at you
This gift so peal, this gift so rare
Much too much, too much for you to bear
Coming down from above
I've got this gift
(from God)
I've got this gift
(from God)
I've got this gift
(from God)
Pointing my heart at you
I've got this gift
(from God)
I've got this gift
(from God)
I've got this gift
(from God)
Pointing my heart at youEmbed
