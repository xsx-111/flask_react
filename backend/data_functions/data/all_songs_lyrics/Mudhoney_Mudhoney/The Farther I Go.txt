The Farther I Go LyricsAll washed out from lack of sleep and
Promises I can't keep
So goddamned tired I can barely talk
All I've gathered together is all I've lost
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go
Burning bridges I'll never cross
Never understand that kind of cost
Touched on this and I stepped on that
Got no mind to deal with that kind of crap
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go
In a fog so thick it hurts to breathe
I find that coming a capacity
Following steps I recognize
Going in a direction I despise
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I go the further back I get
The farther I goEmbed
