Dead Love LyricsOoh
Yeah
Lost my mind
Digging a hole
Bury a heart
Bury my soul
Six feet under
In love
In love
Inch by inch
Limb from limb
You tore me apart
Pushed me in
Six feet under
In love
In love
In love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
In love
I got sucked down
And I got sucked in
I got sucked right
I got sucked you
By you
By you, yeah
Ow
Ahh
Sucked
Lost my mind
Digging a hole
Bury a heart
Bury my soul
Six feet under
In love
