By Her Own Hand LyricsShe cut her face in the mirror last night
Trying to get through to another side
She says she doesn't understand men's pride
She says she can not stand her life
She's looking for any way out
I can't stand what she's thinking about
I want to tell her everything will be all right
But I love her too much, too much to lie
She's looking for any way out
I can't stand what she's thinking about
She's looking for any way out
I can't stand what she's thinking aboutEmbed
