Get Into Yours LyricsI'm crawling out of my skin
I'm needing you again
I'm crawling out of my skin
Trying to get into yours
Got to get into yours
Got to get into yours
Now
Get me out
Let me in
I'm feeling much too thin
Get me out
Let me in
I'm losing myself again
I'm losing myself again
I'm losing myself again
Let me plug the hole in your heart
Before I tear myself apart
Let me plug the hole in your heart
Let me get into yours
Let me get into yours
Got to get into yours
Oh
Get me out
Let me in
Can't get a grip on this thing
Get me out
Let me in
I'm losing myself again
I'm losing myself again
I'm losing myself again
I'm all over your action
Brrrr-ow
Get me out
Let me in
I'm feeling much too thin
Get me out
Let me in
Can't get a grip on this thing
I'm losing myself again
I'm losing myself againEmbed
