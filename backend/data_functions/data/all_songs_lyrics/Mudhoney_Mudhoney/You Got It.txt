You Got It LyricsThey say you got it
I'll say you got it
You got it
You got it good
You got it
You can keep it
That's right
I don't want it
You give it away like free samples
But I don't want what anyone can have
You got it
Yeah, you got it
So what?
Keep it outta my face
Keep it outta my face
Keep it outta my face
Keep it outta my face
Just cause you got it
You think everyone wants you
You got it
You think that's enough
You got it
That's right you got it
You're fucked
Keep it outta my face
Keep it outta my face
Keep it outta my face
Keep it outta my face
Ow
Oh
