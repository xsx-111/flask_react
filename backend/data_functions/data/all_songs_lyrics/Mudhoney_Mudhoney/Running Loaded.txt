Running Loaded LyricsMy love is staggering
Your love is blind
And you come running like a dog
You come running
You come running
You come running like a dog
Like a dog
No one remembers how to play
No one remembers how to play
My head is spinning
Your head is mine
If I wasn't loaded I'd be gone
If I wasn't loaded
If I wasn't loaded
If I wasn't loaded
I'd be gone
I'd be gone
No one remembers how to play
No one remembers how to play
No one remembers how to play
No one remembers how to play
No one remembers how to play
No one remembers how to playEmbed
