Sour Candy Lyrics
Sou-sour candy
(Sou-sour candy)

I'm sour candy
So sweet, then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ask me to be nice, and then I'll do it extra mean
뜻밖의 표정 하나에 넌 당황하겠지
비싼 척이란 말들로 날 포장한 건 너야, 너야
If you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now
거리낌 없는 눈빛에 넌 거릴 두니까
툭 까보면 어김없이 소리질러와
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Oh)

I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside
I might be messed up
But I know what's up
You want a real taste
At least I'm not a fake
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
I'll show you what's me
Close your eyes, don't peek
Now I'm undressing
Unwrap sour candy
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
Come on, sour candy (Oh)

I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside

I'm sour candy
So sweet 'til I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take a bite, take a bite
S-sour candy (Sour candy)
Take a bite, take a bite (Uh)
S-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite
S-sour candy (Sour candy)
Take a bite, take a bite (Uh)
