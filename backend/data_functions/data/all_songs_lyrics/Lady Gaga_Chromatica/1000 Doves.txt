1000 Doves Lyrics
I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

'Cause inside, we are really made the same (Oh)
In life, waiting's just a stupid game (Oh)

Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
I cry more than I ever say (Oh)
Each time, your love seems to save the day (Oh)

Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

I've been hurting, stuck inside a cage
So hard my heart's been in a rage
If you love me, then just set me free
And if you don't, then baby, leave
Set me free

Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
Flying, flying, flying like a thousand doves
Flying, flying, flying (Doves)17Embed
