The Thin Line Lyrics
You hate me
Yeah, you hate me!

You think I don't see murder in your eye
When you're looking at me
You love me
Yeah, you love me!
You don't wanna be noticeably
Enamored of me

So bon voyage, sweet-face
Keep looking for the hole-in-one
Take a look at what you've done
Be a man in a silver trench coat
I'm feeling crazy, can you get me a gun?
Oh...

I hate you
I hate you!
You think I don't see your unlimited
Insecurities
I love you
Yeah, I love you
'Cause you know me by what I let you
By what I let you see

I love you!
I love you!
'Cause you know me by what I let you
By what I let you seeEmbed
