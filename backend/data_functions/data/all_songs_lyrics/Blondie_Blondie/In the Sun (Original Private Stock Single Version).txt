In the Sun (Original Private Stock Single Version) Lyrics
Surf's up!

In the sun, I'm waiting for the day
Having fun, and you're far away
Moonlight nights, water seems so clear
City lights while I'm still waiting here

In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love

New York isle is covered by grey
Concrete piles, blues play my way
Perfect wave, hurricane eye
Tropic haze, pineapple sky

In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love

In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love

Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?Embed
