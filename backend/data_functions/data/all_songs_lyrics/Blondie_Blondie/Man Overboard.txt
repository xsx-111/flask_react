Man Overboard Lyrics
Man overboard, sinking in a sea of love
Man overboard, he jumped, didn't need a shove
Oh, I've been sailing the sea of love, experiencing romance
With what I know (With what I know), he never stood a chance (Ooh, ooh)
He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)

Said, "Lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love
Lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love"
Yeah, I've been sailing the sea of love, experiencing romance
With what I know (With what I know), he never stood a chance

No, man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard
Man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard
Throw him a line
Man overboard

He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
(He gave it) He gave it all for love
(Man overboard, he gave it) He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
(He gave it) He gave it all for love
(Man overboard, he gave it) He gave it all for love (He gave it all for love)
(He gave it) He gave it all for love (Man overboard)
(He gave it)Embed
