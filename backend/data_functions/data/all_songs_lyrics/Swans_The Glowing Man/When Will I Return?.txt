When Will I Return? Lyrics
One, two, three, four

His hands are on my throat
My key is in his eye
I'm splayed here on some curb
Shards of glass
A starry night
When will this pig-man stop?
His stink is like a dog
My life is mine to keep
I still kill him in my sleep
The car door is open wide
The mouth of death still calls my name
I'll beat him on his face
And I stab with all my strength
And I scream until he goes
I scream until he's gone
Then I crawl across the road
Then I crawl across the road
When will I return?
When will I return?

(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm aliveEmbed
