Cloud of Forgetting Lyrics

Walking out
Counting up
Breathing
Reaching out
Reaching out

God, God
God
Leaving
Leaving now

Surrender! Surrender!
Take us! Take us!

The sun
A son
A child
A son

I see us
Take us!
I see us
Take us!
Children, children
Children, children
I am blind
I am blind
I am blind
