Finally, Peace Lyrics
With glittering hands on collapsible land
We're praising the sun for the damage he's done
A ruinous eyesore, oh what is a mind for?
Just a knife in a lake, just an arrow in space
All creation is hollow, and a picture's a shadow
Just a symptom of love, with a lack of a cause
Now the city's dissolving, and heaven's inhaling
While the ocean is thinking of a surface reflecting:

Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind, your glorious mind
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Your glorious mind (Your glory is mine)
Mine, mine
Mine, mine
Mine, mine
Mine, mine
Mine, mine3Embed
