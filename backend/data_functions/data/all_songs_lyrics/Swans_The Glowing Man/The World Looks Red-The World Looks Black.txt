The World Looks Red/The World Looks Black Lyrics
Push it away
The world looks red
People with fish eyes
The ground sucks
Walk on my fingertips
Displacing the fog (Silver, na na, silver)
The weight of my body (Silver, na na, silver)
Is too much to bear (Silver, na na, silver)
The memory drains (Silver, na na, silver)
The life from a dog (Silver, na na, silver, silver, silver)
An ocean of insects (Silver, na na, silver)
Works like a sheet (Silver, na na, silver, silver, na na)
The immoveable fact (Silver, na na, silver, silver)
Buries my mind  (Silver, na na, silver, silver, na na)
Bury my mind (Silver, na na, silver)
Bury my mind (Silver, na na)
Bury my mind (Silver, na na)
Bury my mind (Silver, na na, silver)
In a horse-hair coat (Silver, na na, silver, silver)
In a pile (Silver, na na, silver)
On the floor (Silver, na na)
On the floor (Silver, na na)
On the floor (Silver, silver, na na, silver)
Bury my mind
Bury my mind (Silver, na na, silver)
Mother, bury my mind, mother, bury my mind
Mother, bury my mind, mother, bury my mind
Mother, bury my mind, mother, bury my mind
Mother, bury my mind, mother, bury my mind
Mother, bury my mind, mother, bury my mind
Mother, bury my mind, mother, bury my mind
Bury my mind, mother bury my mind
Bury my mind, mother bury my mind
Mother bury my mind, mother bury my mind
Mother bury my mind, bury bury my mind
Bury bury my mind, bury bury my mind
Bury bury my mind, bury bury my-
