The Glowing Man Lyrics

He's a real go-getter, getter
He's a real heart-breaker, breaker
He's a real head-splitter, splitter

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!

He's a real mean keeper, keeper
He's a real deep teacher, teacher

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO NO YES!
NO NO NO NO NO NO YES!
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO!

Joseph is standing behind my back
Joseph is digging his hands in my chest
Joseph is drinking the light in my lung
Joseph is moving his tongue in my neck
Joseph is riding a vein in my head
Joseph is cutting my arm on his bed
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is making my body fly
Joseph is me and you are a liar!
Joseph is me and, ah you are a liar!
Joseph is me and, ah you are a liar!
Joseph is me and, ah you are a liar!

I am a glowing man I am
I am a growing, glowing man
I am a glowing man I am
I am a growing, glowing man
I'm a nothing, nothing man
I'm a nothing, nothing man
I'm a growing, glowing man
I'm a growing, glowing man
I am a no-no-no-no-nothing man
I'm a no-no-no-no-nothing man
What is is is is is is is is is is is is is what?
What is is is is is is is is is is is is what?
What is is is is is is is is is is is is what?
What is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is what?6Embed
