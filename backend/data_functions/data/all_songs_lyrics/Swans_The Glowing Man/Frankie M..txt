Frankie M. Lyrics

Frankie M, Frankie M
Frankie M, Frankie M
Live again, live again
Rise again, rise again
Who's your friend? Frankie M
Frankie M, Frankie M
Frankie M, Frankie M
Clean your eye, there's a sign
There's some time, clean your mind
Frankie M, Frankie M
Frankie M, Frankie M
Heroin, heroin
Opium, opium
Methedrine, methedrine
MDMA, MDMA
Butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly, butterfly
Break a glass, stab his eye
Choke his neck, nothing's left
Butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly, butterfly
Frankie M, Frankie M
Frankie M, Frankie M
Now don't die, ah, don't die
Now don't die, Frankie why?
Now don't die, now don't die
Now don't die, now don't die
Now don't die, now don't die
Now don't die, now don't die
Now don't die
Now don't die, now don't die
Now don't die, now don't die
Now don't die, now don't dieEmbed
