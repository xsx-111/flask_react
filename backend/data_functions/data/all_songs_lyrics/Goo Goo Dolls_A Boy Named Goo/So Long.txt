So Long Lyrics
Don't take much looking back to know I took my coffee black then
Nothing's different now, but nothing seems the same and it's alright
Your optimistic views, your hundred dollar running shoes and
Carpel tunnel syndrome, we all had a laugh about it

I'd love to stick around but I got to tell you all
So long
Oh so long
Oh so long
But I didn't want to tell you all so long

Don't take much looking back to know I faked that heart attack then
Nothing's different now, but nothing seems the same and it's alright
You always spoke the truth from circa disco Abba boots and
All that showbiz talk, oh we all had a laugh about it

I'd love to stick around but I got to tell you all
So long
Oh so long
Oh so long
But I didn't want to tell you all so longEmbed
