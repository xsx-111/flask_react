Eyes Wide Open Lyrics
I'm a fortunate son of a fortunate son
Living large on the wrong side of town
Too many friends and the fun never ends
Drinking and hanging around
I wanna rule the world, want to swallow it whole
At least I could kick it all down
I wanna kick it all down

Eyes wide open, I can't see
Eyes wide open, what you mean
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
My eyes wide open, I can't see
Eyes wide open, what you mean
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be

I don't take the bus and I never walk too far
The furthest I got was my own backyard
A fist full of cash that somebody else earned
Send me some more when it all got burned
I wanna take control, want to make it all mine
At least I could kick it all down
I want to kick it all down
Eyes wide open, I can't see
Eyes wide open, what you mean
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
My eyes wide open, I can't see
Eyes wide open, what you mean
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be

Never ever ever
Never ever ever
Never ever ever
Never ever ever

I get what I want if I make up my mind
I'm turning you inside out
I wanna rule the world, want to swallow it whole
I think I'll just kick it all down
I want to kick it all down

Eyes wide open, I can't see
Eyes wide open, what you mean
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
My eyes wide open, I can't see
Eyes wide open, what you mean
Eyes wide open, I can't seem to be
Eyes wide openEmbed
