Something Bad Lyrics
Well, they're shutting all the shops up on the avenue
And they're holding up for cheaper Chinese food
If I'm old then I would have a tainted attitude
Why'd those neon lights all lose their common blue?

And it's not like me to feel so important
And it's not like me to go and wreck your day
And I never thought I'd see it so exploited
Ah, but I know that something bad has got to change
Oh yes, I know that something bad has got to change

Well I see her walking round the block till six a.m
The thermometer's at minus five degrees
And I'm wondering where all that hard earned money goes
To her head or towards a shred of dignity

And it's not like me to feel so important
And it's not like me to go and wreck your day
And I never thought I'd see it so exploited
Ah, but I know that something bad has got to change
Oh yes, I know that something bad has got to change
Yes, I know that something bad has got to change
Oh yes, I know that something bad has got tochangeEmbed
