Fifteen Feet Of Pure White Snow Lyrics
Where is Mona?
She's long gone
Where is Mary?
She's taken her along
But they haven't put their mittens on
And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow

Where is Michael?
Where is Mark?
Where is Matthew?
Now it's getting dark
Where is John? They're all out back
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Would you please put down that telephone?
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow

I waved to my neighbour
My neighbour waved to me
But my neighbour is my enemy
I kept waving my arms till I could not see
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Is there anybody out there please?
It's too quiet in here and I'm beginning to freeze
I've got icicles hanging from my knees
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Is there anybody here who feels this low
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder?
Oh, my Lord (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Oh, my Lord (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Oh, my Lord (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Oh, my Lord (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

Doctor, Doctor, I'm going mad
This is the worst day I've ever had
I can't remember ever feeling this bad
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Where's my nurse? I need some healing
I've been paralyzed by this lack of feeling
I can't even find anything worth stealing
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Is there anyone here who doesn't know?
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder?
Oh, my Lord (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Oh, my Lord (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Oh, my Lord (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Oh, my Lord (Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee)
Save yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Save yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Help yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Save yourself! (Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee)
Save yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Save yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Help yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Save yourself! (Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee)
Save yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Help yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Help yourself! (Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)1Embed
