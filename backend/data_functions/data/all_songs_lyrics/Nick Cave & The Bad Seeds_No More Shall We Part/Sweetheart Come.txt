Sweetheart Come Lyrics
Come over here, babe
It ain't that bad
I don't claim to understand
The troubles that you've had
But the dogs you say they fed you to
Lay their muzzles in your lap
And the lions that they led you to
Lie down and take a nap
Other ones you fear are wind and air
And I love you without measure
Seems we can be happy now
Be it better late than never

Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come to me
The burdens that you carry now
Well, they're not of your creation
So let's not weep for their evil deeds
But their lack of imagination
Today's the time for courage, babe
Tomorrow can be for forgiving
And if he touches you again with his stupid hands
His life won't be worth living

Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come
Sweetheart, come to me
Walk with me now under the stars
It's a clear and easy pleasure
And be happy in my company
For I love you without measure
Walk with me now under the stars
It's a safe and easy pleasure
Seems we can be happy now
It's late but it ain't never
It's late but it ain't never
It's late but it ain't neverEmbed
