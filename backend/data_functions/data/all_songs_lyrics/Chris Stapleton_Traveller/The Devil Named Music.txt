The Devil Named Music Lyrics
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can’t remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I’m sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it’ll all feel the same way to me

Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
But the devil named music is taking my lifeEmbed
