More of You Lyrics
When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you3Embed
