Fire Away Lyrics
Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home

And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more

Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Aww, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Fire away
Aww, fire away
