Might as Well Get Stoned Lyrics
Well she said she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleepin' on the floor

I think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned

I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

Every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned

I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

Might as well get stoned
Oh, might as well get stoned
Might as well get stonedEmbed
