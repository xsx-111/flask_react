Sometimes I Cry Lyrics
There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face
And I can keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes
But sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Everybody keeps tellin' me move on
Aw, but I can't seem to go anywhere without you
'Cause ever since and every single night you've been gone
Sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else


Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
