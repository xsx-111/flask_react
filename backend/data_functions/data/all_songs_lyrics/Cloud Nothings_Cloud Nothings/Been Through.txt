Been Through LyricsNothing's working, nothing's working
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Do you feel alright?
You shouldn't
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Do you feel alright?
You shouldn't
Nothing's working, nothing's working
You're getting older
You're getting older
You're getting older
Now
You're getting older
You're getting older
You're getting older
Now
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Do you feel alright?
You shouldn't
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Nothing's working, nothing's working
Do you feel alright?
You shouldn't
Nothing's working, nothing's working
You're getting older
You're getting older
You're getting older
Now
You're getting older
You're getting older
You're getting older
Now
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been through
I am understanding but I can't believe what you've been throughEmbed
