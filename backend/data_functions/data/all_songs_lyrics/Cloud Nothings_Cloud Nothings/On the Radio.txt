On the Radio LyricsI wonder if it hurts to be born in this
And to know what it's like to be me and you
I wouldn't think that anyone would want to
Not even something that turns nothing for you
It is all good
Start something new
They want you
It is all good
Start something new
They want you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
I wonder if it hurts to be born in this
And to know what it's like to be me and you
I wouldn't think that anyone would want to
But even something that turns nothing for you
It is all good
Start something new
They want you
It is all good
Start something new
They want you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about you
This ending knew more about radio
This ending knew more about youEmbed
