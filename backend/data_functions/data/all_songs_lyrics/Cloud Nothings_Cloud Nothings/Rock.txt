Rock LyricsOnly break my heart
Only there to run
Can I hold your hand?
???? no, no, no
Did you break my heart?
Only there to run
Did he hold your hand?
???? no, no, no
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
Only break my heart
Only there to run
Can I hold you hand?
???? no, no, no
Can I break my heart?
Only there to run
Can I hold my hand?
???? no, no, no
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all dead
You loved me but now we're all deadEmbed
