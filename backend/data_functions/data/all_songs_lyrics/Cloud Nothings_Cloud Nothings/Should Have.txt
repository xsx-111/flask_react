Should Have LyricsWell I thought it would be you
Never told myself the truth
That I should hold your hand
That I should have asked you when
You were sitting in your room
Talking just us two
And I looked to where you'd been
I turned away again
Again
I always knew I'd follow you and now I know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now I know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
You seem too far away
When I don't see your face
Walk past me back at school
Looking at you in my room
Where we spent so many nights
Talking about sleeping right
But we never go to bed
We just stay up and talk instead
Talk instead
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much better
I always knew I'd follow you and now we know that it's much betterEmbed
