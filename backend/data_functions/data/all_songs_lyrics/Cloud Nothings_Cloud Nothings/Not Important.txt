Not Important LyricsYou're so ugly
I don't really understand
Why you're famous
I just know you're good in bed
It's a problem
That I'm trying to correct
Do you want some?
I can give you what's left
You're not that important now and it will always the same
You're not that important now and it will always the same
Do you forget
That we were never good friends
Did you forget
Or should I tell you again
You're too stupid
And I'm so lazy I don't care
About your problems
They'll just happen again
You're not that important now and it will always the same
You're not that important now and it will always the sameEmbed
