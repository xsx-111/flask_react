Understand at All LyricsMy head, my head is sitting in your room
My heart, my heart is tied to your room
My hands, my hands are reaching for you
They found, found nothing, but who knows if it's true
I don't understand love
And I don't understand at all
And I don't understand love
And I don't understand at all
And I don't understand love
And I don't understand at all
And I don't understand love
And I don't understand at all
You say, you say that I wanted you
He's better to you so you know it's not true
I'm seeing the house every day since you've been gone
It looks the same, but I know what goes on
I don't understand love
And I don't understand at all
And I don't understand love
And I don't understand at all
And I don't understand love
And I don't understand at all
And I don't understand love
And I don't understand at allEmbed
