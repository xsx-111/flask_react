All the Time LyricsMy teenage heart could ever
At least that's how I am
I'm getting old forever
So I get old so fast
I see my friends who never
Think about leaving them
I get my friends together
They tell me how I am
They say it happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
I say forget forever
I'm doing fine right now
I'm not afraid of never
Clearly it sometimes helps
I'll see my friends who never
Think about leaving them
I get my friends together
They tell me how I am
They say it happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they know
It happens all the time
At least that's what they knowEmbed
