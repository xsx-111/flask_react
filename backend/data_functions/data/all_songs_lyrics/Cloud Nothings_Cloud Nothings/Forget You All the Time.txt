Forget You All the Time LyricsI'm alright
I just forget you all the time
You were right
I should have given you a sign
Talk at all
You never talk enough with me
Love enough
You weren't in love enough with me
Well I know just what you mean
But I could never relate
Cause I don't know how to seem
Like I care enough to wait
I'm alright
I just forget you all the time
You were right
I should have given you a sign
Talk at all
You never talk enough with me
Love enough
You weren't in love enough with me
Well I know just what you mean
But I could never relate
Cause I don't know how to seem
Like I care enough to wait
I'm alright
I just forget you all the time
You were right
I should have given you a signEmbed
