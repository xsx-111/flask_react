Heartbeat LyricsAll anyone wants to do is think of sun
All anyone wants to do is live all wrong
All anyone wants to do is think of sun
All anyone wants to do is live all wrong
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?
I don't have a heartbeat, why don't you?Embed
