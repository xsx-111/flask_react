A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld (Live Mix Mk 10) LyricsLoving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
...everything that I do is out of loving you
...is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Making love with you is all I wanna do
Loving you is more than just a dream come true
Everything that I do is out of loving you
No one else can make me feel the colours that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old and we will live each day in springtime
Loving you has made my life so beautiful
And every day of my life is filled with loving youEmbed
