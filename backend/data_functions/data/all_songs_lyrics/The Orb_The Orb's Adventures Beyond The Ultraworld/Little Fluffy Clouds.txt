Little Fluffy Clouds Lyrics

Over the past few years
To the traditional sounds of an English summer
The drone of lawnmowers
The smack of leather on willow
Has been added a new noise
What were the skies like when you were young?
They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona
And the skies always had little fluffy clouds
And they moved down, they were long and clear
And there were lots of stars at night
And when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful
The most beautiful skies as a matter of fact
The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire
And the clouds would catch the colors everywhere
That's neat, cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little
You don't see that
Layering different sounds on top of each other
Layering different sounds on top of each other
Little fluffy clouds and little fluffy clouds and
Little fluffy clouds and little fluffy clouds and
What were the skies like when you were young?
They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona
And the skies always had little fluffy clouds
And they moved down, they were long and clear
And there were lots of stars at night
And when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful
The most beautiful skies as a matter of fact
The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire
And the clouds would catch the colors everywhere
That's neat, cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little
You don't see that
Little fluffy clouds and little fluffy clouds and
Little fluffy clouds and little fluffy clouds and
When I, we lived in Arizona
And the skies always had little fluffy clouds
And they moved down, they were long and clear
And there were lots of stars at night
And when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful
The most beautiful skies as a matter of fact
The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire
And the clouds would catch the colors everywhere
That's neat, cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little
You don't see that, you might still see them in the desert
The most beautiful skies as a matter of fact
Purple and red
Purple and red and yellow on fire
And red and yellow on fire
The clouds would catch the colors
Purple and red and yellow on fire2Embed
