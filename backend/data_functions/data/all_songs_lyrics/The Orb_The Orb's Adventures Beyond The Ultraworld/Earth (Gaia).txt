Earth (Gaia) Lyrics
Klytus, I'm bored
What plaything can you offer me today?
An obscure body in the S-K System, your majesty
The inhabitants refer to it as the planet... "Earth"
How peaceful it looks...
—So make gardens, and eat the fruit of them, them
And they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them
And I will plant them upon their land, which I have given them, your God
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt
And they shall build the waste cities and live in them
And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them
And live in them
And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them
—So make gardens, and eat the fruit of them, them
And they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them
And I will plant them upon their land, which I have given them, your God
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt
Jie pasirašė lyg ir sutartį su Azerbaidžiano komunistų partija
Didelį svorį pajuto tautiškai nusiteikę azerbaidžianiečiai, jų populiarusis Laisvės Frontas, kuris būtų tolygus mūsų Sąjudžiui
Jie pasirašė lyg ir sutartį su Azerbaidžiano komunistų partija
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt
And the treader of grapes shall overtake him who soweth seed
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt
And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of themEmbed
