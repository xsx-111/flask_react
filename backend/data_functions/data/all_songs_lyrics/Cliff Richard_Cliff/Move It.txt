Move It LyricsCome on pretty baby, let's a-move it and a-groove it
Well, a-shake, oh baby shake, oh honey please don't lose it
It's rhythm that gets into your heart and soul
Let me tell you baby, it's called rock 'n' roll
They say it's gonna die, but honey please let's face it
Well, they just don't know what's a goin' to replace it
Yeah, ballads and calypsos, they've got nothin' on
Real country music, that just drives a-long
Well, a-move it
Mm-mm, come on pretty baby, let's a-move it and a-groove it
A-shake, oh baby shake, oh baby please don't lose it
It's rhythm that gets into your heart and soul
Well, let me tell you baby, it's called rock an' roll
They say it's gonna die, but honey please let's face it
They just don't know what's a goin' to replace it
Ballads and calypsos, they've got nothin' on
Real country music, that just drives a-long
Oh, honey move it
Yeah, move it
Honey, a-move it
Honey, a-move itEmbed
