Down the Line LyricsThrow down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Men are tied in chains of silence
I look on violence, up, down, left and right
Is there no hope of light
The peaceful hand that once caressed me
Hurts like the rest, because it’s turned to stone
Talons of steel have grown
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Yeah, oh help me, yeah
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
See the moon, it’s getting nearer
But no more clearer than the earth below
What do we really know
I feel the stab of pain returning
Despair is burning in my heart again
Why don’t they see the end, ooooh
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Yeah, throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Yeah, throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for meEmbed
