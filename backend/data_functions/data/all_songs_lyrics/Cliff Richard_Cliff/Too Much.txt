Too Much LyricsWell, honey I love you too much
I need your lovin' too much
When I want some loving, you're gone
Don't you know you're treating your daddy wrong
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much
I need your lovin' all the time
I need you near me, say you'll be mine
I need you near me, stay real close
Oh, please, please, baby, hear me you're the most
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much
Too much, yeah
Well, I need your lovin' all the time
I need you near me, said it
I need you near me, stay real close
Oh baby, please, please, hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much
I need your lovin' too much
When I want some loving, you're gone
Baby, don't you know you're treating your daddy wrong
I'd love to get you started even though I know
I love you too muchEmbed
