Apron Strings LyricsIt's good to be free, like the water and the breeze
To come and to go, whenever I please
Well, honey your love is a clipping my wings
I just wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
Well kiss you goodnight and then what do I do
I hurry on home and dream about you
It's crazy I know, but it's one of those things
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
Well, you touch my hand and it burns like a fire
You kiss my lips and the flame grows higher
Such a lucky devil to find a little lady like you
So I'm crossing my heart and I'm telling no lies
So hold me real close and close your eyes
I'm stickin' real close, like I need to cling
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
So I kiss you goodnight and then what do I do
I hurry on home and dream about you
It's crazy I know, but it's a one of those things
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
Well, you touch my hand and it burns like a fire
You kiss a my lips and the flame grows higher
Such a lucky devil to find a little lady like you
So crossing my heart and I'm telling no lies
So hold me real close and close your eyes
I'm a stickin' real close, like a I need to cling
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron stringsEmbed
