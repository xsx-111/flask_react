Danny (King Creole) LyricsMy name should be trouble
My name should be woe
For trouble and heartache
Is all that I know
Oh-oh, Danny, oh yes, Danny is my name, oh yes
My life has been empty
My heart has been torn
It must have been rainy
The night I was born
Oh-oh Danny, oh yes, Danny is my name, oh yes
I'm, I'm so afraid of tomorrow
And, and so tired of today
They say that love, love is the answer
But love never came my way
I'm writing a letter to someone I know
So if you should find it and if you're alone
Remember Danny, oh yes, Danny is my name, oh yes
I'm, I'm so afraid of tomorrow
And, and so tired of today
They say that love, love is the answer
But love never came my way
I'm writing a letter to someone I know
And you should find it and if you're alone
Well Danny, oh yes, Danny is my name, oh yes
Well Danny, oh yes, Danny is my name, oh yesEmbed
