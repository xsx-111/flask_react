I Got a Feeling LyricsYeah, I got a feeling
That I'm gonna get you
Say, I got a little feeling
That it won't be long
I hold you in my arms and baby
That's where you belong
Say, I got a feeling
You think about me
Well, I got feeling
And I hope it's true
'Cause nobody else could want you so
And love you like I do
Well, I got a feeling that our love
Was meant to be... oh, yeah
Well it had a big wild world of happiness
Just waiting for you and me
So why don't you tell me
You love me only?
'Cause I got a feeling
Too really do, really do
And I never had this feeling
'Til I fell in love with you, yeah
. . . . .

And I never had this feeling
'Til I fell in love with you
'Til I fell in love with you
