Raise the Dead Lyrics
Rising from my deadly tomb I've got
Maddened eyes with fright
Fingers bleeding fast heart beating
The moon's my only light
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If God won't have me, then the Devil must

We will raise the dead
We will raise the dead
We will raise the dead
Stop at nothing, raise the dead

Gaze across the blackened yard
My mind is filled with dread
So give me all the powers of Hell
And I'll raise the dead
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The hotter the fire, the greater the lust

We will raise the dead
We will raise the dead
We will raise the dead
Stop at nothing, raise the dead
I hear the star of the Necromancer
My blood is black and my heart doth bleed
I am infernal and my mind's in torment
I'll raise the dead make the world unclean


Laughing as my legions rise
Control the zombie's mind
I hold Hell close to my breast
I'm leaving God behind
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'll enter hellfire, I'll break the crust

We will raise the dead
We will raise the dead
We will raise the dead
Stop at nothing, raise the dead1Embed
