Black Metal Lyrics
Black is the night, metal we fight
Power amps set to explode
Energy screams, magic and dreams
Satan records their first note
We chime the bell, chaos in Hell
Metal for maniacs pure
Fast melting steel, fortune on wheels
Brain hemorrhage is the cure

For black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Lay down your soul to the gods rock 'n' roll

Freaking so wild, nobody's mild
Giving it all that you've got
Wild is so right, metal tonight
Faster than over the top
Open the core, enter Hell's door
Black is the code for tonight
Atomic force, feel no remorse
Crank up the amps, now it's night
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal

Lay down your soul to the gods rock 'n' roll
Metal ten fold through the deadly black hole
Riding Hell's stallions bareback and free
Taking our chances with raw energy
Come ride the night with us, rock hard and fight
United my legions, we stand
Freak hard and wild for us, give up your souls
Live for the quest Satan's band
Oh

Let's go

Against these odds, black metal gods
Fight to achieve our goal
Casting a spell, leather and Hell
Black metal gods rock 'n' roll
Building up steam, nuclear screams
Warheads are ready to fight
Black leather hounds, faster than sound
Metal our purpose in life
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal
Black metal

Lay down your soul to the gods rock 'n' roll
Oh, black metal1Embed
