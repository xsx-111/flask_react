Leave Me in Hell Lyrics
Midnight - Six sixty six
Torment - Bestial sex
Mother is Screaming in pain
Father - Rules hell's domain

I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell

Danger - Gold pentagram
Sacrifice - Full blooded ram
Karma - Hell bears its child
Reaper - Sharpens his scythe

I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Let's go

Hail Satanic Majesties
Sabbath - My crucifix
Evil - Chief satanist
Demon - Possessed by hell
I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Master, cast me a spell1Embed
