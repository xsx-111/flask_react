Bottled Up Inside Lyrics
It ain't fading
Man, I gotta let it out
Am I crazy?
Screaming, nothing ever comes out
I keep feeling lost
I'll never find my way out
I'm not thanking them
Unless the truth can pour out
Give me some courage
Beating me down now for some time
Are you laughing? Am I funny?
I hate inside, I hate inside

I'll take this time
To let out what's inside
‘Cause I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride
And all this hate
Is bottled up inside
My heart's breaking
Man you really ripped it out
You take pleasure
Watching as I claw my way out
The hurt's rising
Soon it's gonna to tear my soul out
It's not kosher
Feeling like I'm on my way out
Give me some courage
Beating me down now for some time
Are you laughing? Am I funny?
I hate inside, I hate inside

I'll take this time
To let out what’s inside
‘Cause I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride
And all this hate
Is bottled up inside
Feeling the hate as they cut down my spine
Peeling your flesh like the way you've cut mine
Do you feel happy you fucked up my mind?
You're going to pay this time

I'll take this time
To let out what's inside
‘Cause I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride
And all this hate
Is bottled up inside
I'll take this time
To let out what's inside
‘Cause I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride
And all this hate
Is bottled up inside2Embed
