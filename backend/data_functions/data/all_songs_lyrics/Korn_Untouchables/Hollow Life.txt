Hollow Life Lyrics
Beating the fall, I can't help but desire of
Falling down this time
Deep in this hole of my making, I can't escape
Falling all this time

We come to this place, falling through time
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking, waiting for signs
Hollow lives

Fearing to fall and still the ground below me calls
Falling down this time
Ripping apart all these things I have tried to stop
Falling all this time

We come to this place, falling through time
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking, waiting for signs
Hollow lives

Is there ever any wonder, why we look to the sky?
Search in vain, asking why
All alone, where is God?
Looking down? We donâ€™t know
We fall in space, we can't look down
Death may come, peace I have found
What to say? Am I alive?
Am I asleep? Or have I died?
We fall in space (Haunting me), we can't look down (Haunting me)
Death may come, peace I have found
I want to say my whole life (Something takes a part of me)
Am I asleep? We fall down

We come to this place, falling through time
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking, waiting for signs
Hollow lives

Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?
Search in vain, asking why
All alone, where is God?
Looking down, we don't know
Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?
Search in vain, asking why
All alone, where is God?
Looking down, we don't know
We fall in space, we can't look down
Death may come, peace I have found1Embed
