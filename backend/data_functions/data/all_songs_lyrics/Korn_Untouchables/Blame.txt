Blame Lyrics
So I think you are a fool
Hanging on my every word
It's getting ugly
So I'm ugly
Tear me from your heart
Tearing me apart
So I thought you'd disappear
Being alone is what you fear
Are you lonely?
Yes, lonely
Tear me from your heart
Tearing me apart

Rolling and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Hoping, and scolding, revolting
Peel it back, reveal the scar
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are
The time is coming, gone insane
You're feeling happy, won the game
The time is coming, a bed of flames
Your life is over and you're to blame
The time is coming, you've gone insane
You're feeling happy, you've won the game
The time is coming, a bed of flames
Your life is over and you're to blame
Blame

Rolling and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Hoping, and scolding, revolting
Peel it back, reveal the scar
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are
Rolling and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Hoping, and scolding, revolting
Peel it back, reveal the scar
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are4Embed
