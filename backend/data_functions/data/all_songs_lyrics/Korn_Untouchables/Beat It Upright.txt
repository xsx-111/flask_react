Beat It Upright Lyrics
Are you ready for a good pounding, baby?
(Get down)
Are you ready to get it on?
(Get down, get down)
Don't pretend you're not fucking freaky, baby
(Get down)
I will spank that ass just for fun
(Get down on the ground)

Ass up high
Make a motherfucker cry
It's so good that I could die
Help me stay alive

The time is right
I wanna feel it good and tight
I'm down to do this all night
I'm gonna beat it upright

I'll behave, oh my God
Make me beg, my God
Yes, I'm ready for a good flogging, baby
(My God, get down)
Come on beat my ass just for fun
(Get down, my God, get down)
Don't let up till my ass is bleeding, baby
(My God, get down)
Don't let up until you are done
(Get down on the ground)

Ass up high
Make a motherfucker cry
It's so good that I could die
Help me stay alive

The time is right
I wanna feel it good an tight
I'm down to do this all night
I'm gonna beat it upright

We're going on a ride
I'm gonna turn you inside out, upside down
Don't try to run and hide
Yes, it's true what they say about my kind
Are you ready for a good pounding, baby?
(Get down)
Are you ready to get it on?
(Get down, get down)
Don't pretend you're not fucking freaky, baby
(Get down)
I will spank that ass just for fun
(Get down on the ground)

Ass up high
Make a motherfucker cry
It's so good that I could die
Help me stay alive

The time is right
I wanna feel it good and tight
I'm down to do this all night
I'm gonna beat it upright3Embed
