Picture Me Better Lyrics
Picture me better
I finally found the time to write you this letter
To the stars and moon for you
And it's coming back soon
Don't need no money when you're around
And you're making me act funny
Can't help to smile with those eyes that shine on me
If only you could see

You got it all in spades
Got a lot of dreams and songs to say
And hearts to break

Waiting for the call from beyond
Waiting for something with meaning
To come through soon

Picture us better
We finally found a winter for your sweater
Got a brand new big suit of armor, it's tough
Since you left, I've grown so much
If I could've seen you just once more
Tell you how much you're adored
There's no point anymore

Waiting for the call from beyond
Waiting for something with meaning
To come through soon7Embed
