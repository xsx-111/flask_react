Everyday Lyrics
Wake up, baby
It's gettin' late now
Fell so hard like I always do
I'm so scared of being alone
It's true, it's true
I see you every day
But that's not enough
I got this seeker runnin' along a lonely line
Always trying to make my keeper mine

It gets me every time
And then again, I might be fallen down

Sailing off on my ships to nowhere
Got a lot of things to clear away
Got a lot of years of bad love to make okay

It gets me every day
And then again, it might just be me
Then again, love's not easy

I need a love every day
I need
True love is making a comeback
For only half of us, the rest just feel bad
Doomed to wonder in the world's first rodeo
You never let it show
The other night, I was at a party
Someone sincerely looked at me
And said, "Is this the end of all monogamy?"
And I said, "Not today
Then again, you might be right
Then again, sleep the night"

I need a love every day
I need

Lay down, my guy
For a short time
Heart cannot see (Heart cannot see)
My love is blind
Lay down, my guy13Embed
