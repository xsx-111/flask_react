Mirror Forever Lyrics
No one's ever gonna give you a trophy
For all the pain and the things you've been through
No one knows but you
Kinda crazy when you're looking right through me
There's something forceful about your stare
Just say the word and, baby, you'll know that I'll be there
I'm not scared

And I see it so clearly
That we play hard
Yes, we love our love
Most of all
But the timing's spent
In this situation circumstance
I'll see you around
The next time you come to town
I'll see you around
The next time you call

You're a demon with a scary picture
I'm a dreamer and you're a tiger
Got a feeling our romance doesn't stand a chance
Stand a chance to last
You threw me out of the garden of Eden
You lift me up just to let me fall hard
Can't stand being your second best
And I see it so clear
We play hard
Yes, we love our love
Most of all
But the timing's spent
In this situation circumstance
I'll see you around
The next time you come to town
I'll see you around
The next time you call

Oh, baby, take a look in the mirror
Oh, baby, take a look in the mirror
Oh, baby, take a look in the mirror
Oh, baby, take a look in the mirror

And I see it so clear
That we play hard
Yes, we love our love
Most of all
But the timing's spent
In this situation circumstance
I'll see you around
The next time you come to town
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
The next time you call7Embed
