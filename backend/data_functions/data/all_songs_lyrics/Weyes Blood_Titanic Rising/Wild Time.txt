Wild Time Lyrics
Look around
There's nothing left to keep
By the bottles that broke you
From the solace you seek
Didn't know you were one in a million
Stuck inside the wall
I'm wonderin' how we ever got here
With no fear we'd fall

Taking all of our eyes
Beauty, a machine that's working
Runnin' on a million people tryin'
Don't cry, it's a wild time to be alive

Turn around, it's time for you to slowly
Let these changes make you more holy and true
Otherwise, you just made it complicated for nothing
One in all, a place for us to fall

Living in the rising tide
Our light, a feeling that's moving
Runnin' on a million people burnin'
Don't cry, it's a wild time to be alive
It already happened
Nothing you want to change more
Heaven found and the lights went down
Everyone's broken now and no one knows just how
We could have all gotten so far from truth

Lost and tangled up in you
Everyone knows you just did what you had to
Burning much more than ever before
Burning down the door
It's a wild time to be alive6Embed
