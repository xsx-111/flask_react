Something to Believe Lyrics
Drank a lot of coffee today
Got lost in the fray, I gave all I had for a time
Then by some strange design, I got a case of the empties
The ruler of my world, a lost forgotten pearl
When fire leaves a girl
Too burned to try my life
Living on the fault line
And at night

I just lay down and cry
The waters don't really go by me
Give me something I can see
Something bigger and louder than the voices in me
Something to believe

Didn't always do it right
Might've left the heat on high
Didn't know I had any left
Thought I finally met my death
Gonna do all I can
To stay away from the quicksand
Gonna do all I can
Nobody's gonna love you the same way
Some of us go astray, I walked so far from them all
Instead of dropping the ball, I seem to carry so many
The colors don't align, a question of time
I seem to lose what I find
Please give me a sign soon
Really wanna find out the truth
And at night

I just lay down and cry
The waters don't really go by me
Give me something I can see
Something bigger and louder than the voices in me
Something to believe, to believe
Something to believe
Something to believe
Something to believe
