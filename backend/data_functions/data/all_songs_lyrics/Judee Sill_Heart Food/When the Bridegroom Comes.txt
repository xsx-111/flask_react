When the Bridegroom Comes LyricsSee the bride and the spirit are one
Then won't you who are thirsty invite Him to come?
With your door opened wide
Won't you listen in the dark for the midnight cry?
And see when your light is on that the bridegroom comes
Into cold outer darkness are gone
Guests who would not their own wedding garment put on
Though the chosen are few, won't you tarry by your lamp till He calls for you?
And pray that your love endure 'til the bridegroom comes
When the halt and the lame meet the son
And He sees for the blind, and He speaks for the dumb
Let their poor heart's complaint
Like the leper turned around who has kissed the saint
Lift like a trumpet shout, and the bridegroom come
See the builders despising the stone
See the pearl of great price and the dry desert bones
By the Pharisees cursed
Be exultant with the rose when the last are first
And see how his mercy shines, as the bridegroom comes
Hear the bride and the spirit say come
Then won't you who are weary invite in the Son?
When your heart's love is high
Won't you hasten to the place where the hour is nigh?
And see that your light is on, for the bridegroom comesEmbed
