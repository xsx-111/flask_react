The Donor LyricsI'll chase 'em to the bottom
Till I've finally caught 'em
Dreams fall deep
Where voices come a-chimin'
Moanin' and a-rhymin'
Warning me
Their words are ringin' and a-whinin'
Hear 'em weep
Songs from so deep
While I'm sleepin'
Seep in
Sweepin' over me
Still the echo's achin'
"Leave us not forsaken"
Kyrie eleison, kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison, eleison
Eleison, eleison
Kyrie eleison, kyrie eleison
So sad, and so true
That even shadows come
And hum the requiem
O waters of the moon
Your vapors swirls and swoon
Your wake is wide
And sorrow's like an arrow
Shootin' straight and narrow
Aimin' true, it's sting goes
Reachin' to the marrow
Silence cried
Now songs from so deep
While I'm sleepin'
Seep in...
Sweepin' over me
Still the echo's achin'
"Leave us not forsaken"
Kyrie eleison, kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison, eleison
Eleison, eleison
Kyrie eleison, kyrie eleison
So sad, and so true
That even shadows come
And hum the requiem
Kyrie eleison...
Kyrie eleison...1Embed
