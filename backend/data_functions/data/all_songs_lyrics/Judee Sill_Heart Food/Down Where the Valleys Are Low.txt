Down Where the Valleys Are Low Lyrics
Down where the valleys are low, there's a refuge so high
And down where the coldest winds blow, there the warmest winds hide
And deep in the forest of woe, sweet deliverance is nigh
And deep in the heart there's a rose that a glimmer keeps guidin'
'Til the heaven's song begins the holy files a-burnin'
And the harmony is set to weave a silver sermon
And my heart's aflame until the blessed rhythm's churnin'
Push me on from the danger that's pullin' me
And holds me so strong
Send a song on the wind to deliver me
Take me and rise, when the fire is on
Take the reins, and the loneliness fillin' me
And make my fear fuel, and the fuel hi-octane

Down where the valleys are low, there's a refuge so high
And down where the coldest winds blow, there the warmest winds hide
And deep in the forest of woe, sweet deliverance is nigh
And deep in the heart there's a rose that a glimmer keeps guidin'
'Til the heaven's song begins the holy files a-burnin'
And the harmony is set to weave a silver sermon
And my heart's aflame until the blessed rhythm's churnin'
Lead the way thru the glories deceivin' me
And reverie's sway
Through the day when the hereafter's holdin' me
Lend me a hand and I won't delay
Send a ray thru the seven veiled mysteries
And break their sweet spell, and their links of chainEmbed
