The Pearl Lyrics
I've been looking for someone
Who sells truth by the pound
The I saw the dealer and his friend arrive
But their gifts looked grim
Now I'm tired of hanging on
Waiting for a showdown
Don't you see I gotta ride 'em out
'Cause the pearl's just around the bend

Beautiful pearl, oh when will you reappear?
Mysteries unfurl and become so clear
When I feel you near

I found a way outside myself
To make my spirit climb
And I could have shimmied on up
But my rope was made of wind
I appreciate the words
But I won't be there at showtime
Don't you see I gotta ride them out
'Cause the pearl's just around the bend

Beautiful pearl, oh when will you reappear?
Mysteries unfurl and become so clear
When I feel you near
When my backyard weeds grew high
I hoped that they would hide me
But I felt that the pearl was near
'Cause I thought I saw it shine
I was looking all around
When I felt it there inside me
And I see a possibility
That its been there all the timeEmbed
