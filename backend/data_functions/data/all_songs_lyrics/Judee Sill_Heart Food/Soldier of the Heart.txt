Soldier of the Heart Lyrics
Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so strong?
Soldier of the heart, take me along
Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so true?
Soldier of the heart, I'm marchin' with you

The battlefield's so cold
Take my heart as a token
I'd love to give it to you

Flyin' after a faraway cry
I wandered to a brink so high
Plungin' down to the last degree
The next thing I knew I came to
And saw he was carryin' me

Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so fine?
Soldier of the heart, I wish you were mine
Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so true?
Soldier of the heart, I'm marchin' with you

The battlefield's so cold
Take my love as a token
I long to give it to you
Flames arise from the sword in his hand
We'll march in over no-man's land
And burn the enemy's stolen throne
I'll carry your gun 'til it's done
And we can go rollin' back home

Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so right?
Soldier of the heart, take me tonight
Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so true?
Soldier of the heart, I'm marchin' with you

The battlefield's so cold
Take my promise to warm you
I'm gunna give it to you

Flames came rippin' thru battle torn skies
Though wounded, I tried not to cry
I said, "So long, I guess I'll be leavin' you,"
But when I peeked in on the end
I saw he was pullin' me through

Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so strong?
Soldier of the heart, take me along
Soldier of the heart, how'd you get so true?
Soldier of the heart, I'm marchin' with you
Soldier of the heart, I'm followin' youEmbed
