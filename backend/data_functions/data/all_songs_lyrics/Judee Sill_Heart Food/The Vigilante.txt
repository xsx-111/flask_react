The Vigilante LyricsI see the vigilante watching in the deep o' the night
I always find him where his heart is, he's fighting the good fight
He smells the scent of trouble and prepares to leave
He's got his eyes on the horizon, reaching higher
He's got his eyes on the horizon, and his boots on his feet
When I was stranded at the crossroads it was dismal and grey
And when I asked him for directions he showed me the good way
And if the sky is swirling still his pace never swerves
Because his heart is always faithful, reaching higher
Because his heart is always faithful to the captain he serves
So when the storm of deception is rounding the bend
Y'know the vigilante's watching, and he won't let it in
Tho' I have seen him climbing mountains with so heavy a load
He always lends a helping hand and he walks on the good road
It often makes me wonder how he wins with such ease
But then he keeps his vigil constant, and he's aiming to please
So when illusion's approaching and danger is nigh
Y'know the vigilante's watching and he won't let it by
I've seen him fight the fiercest foe until its forces divide
Cause he's the fairest of them all and he chooses the good side
So when the tempters tease and try to make him unsure
You know the fires of war are burning, reaching higher
You know the fires of war are burning, but his weapons are pure
So when the clouds of confusion can creep into view
Y'know the vigilante's watching, and he won't let them through
I see the vigilante watching in the deep o' the night
I always find him where his heart is, he's fighting the good fight
He smells the scent of trouble and prepares to leave
He's got his eyes on the horizon, reaching higher
He's got his eyes on the horizon, and his boots on his feet
He's watching 24 hours a dayEmbed
