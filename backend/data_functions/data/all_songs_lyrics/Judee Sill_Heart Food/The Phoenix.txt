The Phoenix Lyrics
The sun was red, and the fires were roarin'
Stars aligned and the webs were spun
I coulda sworn I heard my spirit soarin'
Guess I'm always chasin' the sun
Hopin' we will soon be one
Until it turns around to me, then I try to run

On phosphorous wings the phoenix floated
The fires froze and the sea was hushed
And when I tried to speak, the sun imploded
And the war will wage in my guts
Till the Devil bites the dust
I never saw him losin' a race, but I think he must

The great storm raged and the power kept growin'
Dragons rose from the land below
And even now I wonder where I'm goin'
Ever since a long time ago
I've tried to let my feelings show
I'd like to think I'm bein' sincere, but I'll never know

The sun was red, and the fires were roarin'
Stars aligned and the webs were spun
I coulda sworn I heard my spirit soarin'
Guess I'm always chasin' the sun
Hopin' we will soon be one
Until it turns around to me, then I try to runEmbed
