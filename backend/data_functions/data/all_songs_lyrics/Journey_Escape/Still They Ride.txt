Still They Ride Lyrics
Jesse rides through the night
Under the Main Street light
Riding slow
This old town, ain't the same
Now nobody knows his name
Times have changed, still he rides

Traffic lights, keeping time
Leading the wild and restless
Through the night

Still they ride, on wheels of fire
They rule the night
Still they ride, the strong will survive
Chasing thunder

Spinning around, in a spell
It's hard to leave this carousel
Around and around
And around and around
