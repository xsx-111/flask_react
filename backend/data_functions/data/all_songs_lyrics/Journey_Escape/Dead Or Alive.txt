Dead Or Alive LyricsA double secret agent
And he was paid to kill
With cold steel magnum force is
How the man possessed the skill
He shot a man in Paris
He did a job in L.A
And if the price was right, he'd surely
Take your life away
Wanted
Dead or alive
Blood for money, money
Assault
Homicide
Blood for money, money
Money, money
Wanted
He drove a Maserati
Lived up in the hills, yeah
A cat with nine lives that's gone
Too far to feel the chill
He never though it'd happen
It was his last mistake
'Cause he was gunned down
By a heartless woman's .38
Wanted
Dead or alive
Blood for money, money
Assault
Homicide
Blood for money, money
Money, money
Money, moneyEmbed
