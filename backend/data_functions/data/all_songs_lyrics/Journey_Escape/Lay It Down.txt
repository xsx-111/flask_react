Lay It Down LyricsLooking around for the feelin'
I love the rhythm and blues
The place was rockin' and reelin'
I thought I'd shake me loose
The band was pumpin' Motown
Lord how they could play
The girls a-started singin'
Rock the night away
By the midnight hour
They could have raised the dead
They were taking it higher
Higher, higher, higher, ringin' in my head
(Lay it down) Lay it down
(Lay it down) Oh yeah
(Lay it down) Lay it down
(Lay it down)
Whisky, wine and women
They get me through the night
I ain't looking for trouble
I ain't looking to fight
A little vertical persuasion
Would do me right
What I'm really needin'
A double shot tonight
By the midnight hour
We were on our way
She was taking it higher
Higher, higher, higher, I say
Ohh yeah
(Lay it down) Lay it down
(Lay it down) Oh yeah, yeah
(Lay it down) Lay it down
(Lay it down)
By the midnight hour
We were on our way
She was taking it higher
Higher, higher, higher, ohh yeah
(Lay it down) Lay it down
(Lay it down) Oh yeah, yeah
(Lay it down) Baby, lay it down
(Lay it down) Lay it down, oh yeah
(Lay it down) Lay it down
(Lay it down) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Lay it down) Baby, lay it down
(Lay it down) Lay it down, oh yeahEmbed
