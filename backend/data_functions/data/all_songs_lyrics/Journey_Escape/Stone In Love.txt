Stone In Love Lyrics
Those crazy nights, I do remember in my youth
I do recall, those were the best times, most of all
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burning love comes once in a lifetime
She found me singing by the rail road tracks
Took me home, we danced by the moonlight

Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love

Old dusty roads, led to the river
Running slow
She pulled me down, ooh, and in clover
We'd go around, yeah
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burning love comes once in a lifetime
Oh, the memories never fade away
Golden girl, I'll keep you forever

Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love
Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love

(Stone in love)
Stone in love
Stone in love
Stone in love
