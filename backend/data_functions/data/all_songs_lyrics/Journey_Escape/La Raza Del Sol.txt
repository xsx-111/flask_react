La Raza Del Sol LyricsBorn on the east side
In the barrio badlands
Juan Cortez walks the streets
He's a proud man
He loves a girl
With eyes that sparkle like diamonds
Troubled world
Makes him fight for his woman
La raza
From the south blows the wind of la raza
The legends all told
Follow the sun to the great river valley
La raza del sol
Bold & strong
Find a life 'cross the border
It ain't easy hassling with law & order
In the soul stands the strength of the family
Holding on with the spirit and glory
La raza
From the south blows the wind of la raza
The legends all told
Follow the sun to the great river valley
La raza del solEmbed
