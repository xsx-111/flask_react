Mother, Father Lyrics
She sits alone, an empty stare
A mother's face she wears
Where did she go wrong?
The fight is gone
Lord, help this broken home

Hey, mother, father, sister
Hey, come back, trying, believing
Hey, mother, father, dreamer
Don't you know that I'm alive for you?
I'm your seventh son
And when lightning strikes the family
Have faith, believe

With dreams he tried, oh, lost his pride
He drinks his life away
One photograph, oh, in broken glass
It should not end this way

Through bitter tears
And wounded years, those ties
Of blood were strong
So much to say, those yesterdays
So now don't you turn away
Hey, mother, father, sister
Hey, yeah, come back, trying, believing
Oh, hey, mother, father, dreamer
Don't you know that I'm alive for you?
I'm your seventh son
And when lightning strikes the family
Have faith, believe

Don't you know that I'm alive for you?
I'm your seventh son
And when lightning strikes the family
Have faith, believe
Have faith, believe
