On the Sly Lyrics
Wipe it up, you're capable of putting back a few when you have to
Re-memorize the history of your body, like a virgin
Ladies' night, '80s night
The kids get high and eat TV
So do we
For Halloween, I want to be Lenny Bruce

I want them to hate me
(I want them to hate me)
I want them to hate me
(I want them to hate me)
I want them to hate me
So you can love me on the sly

My old flame broke the 12 bar blues just to prove he could
He pays the airline DJs now
He is everywhere

I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
So you can love me on the sly
I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly

Fill me in on horrible
How much is there?
Where else can I live?
The dirty sugar factory on the water
(On the water)
Should smell sweet

I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly
I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly
I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the slyEmbed
