Hardwire Lyrics
Giving for chances to leave the basement life
I'm not the landlord's wife
Furnished room
Celebrate the first flight window
Bird's eye view

You hardwire, I'll try to play the guitar
Stay smoothly stoned, postpone the morning
Though we both see it coming, we don't run
Let the silence settle in our bones

You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are every night
Fade to light
Fade to light the room
Daylight writes a new light on you

Giving for chances to take it all in stride
Why'd we walk a broken line of minus signs?
You hardwire, I'll try to play the guitar
Stay smoothly stoned, postpone the morning
Though we both see it coming, we don't run
Let the silence settle in our bones

You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are every night
Fade to light
Fade to light the room
Daylight writes a new light on you

You leave your eyes there for me to memorise
I can see you happy in the shadows I despise

You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitarEmbed
