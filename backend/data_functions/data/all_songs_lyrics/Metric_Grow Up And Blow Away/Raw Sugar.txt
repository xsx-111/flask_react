Raw Sugar Lyrics
Sort of wonder why
No one said a word
Don't you like it on the sly?
Don't you like it 'til it hurts?
Have I been on your mind?
What's a voice without a song?
Something in your head
You've been fighting all along

I don't want to say it
The news is not so good
We'll never get away
And even if we could
We'd just play the tambourine
Around an open flame
Oversleep and burn
To be back in the game

'Cause summer never comes
Nowhere near high noon
And winter never comes
Nor the harvest moon
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave

No, I'm not complaining
Yes, it could be worse
Ferment on the wishbone
Match the lips to the purse
Neighborhood's a runway
Fry the ass and thighs
Dirty denim dealers
Pushed behind the eyers

And summer never comes
Nowhere near high noon
And winter never comes
Nor the harvest moon
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave

Still, I wear the red dress
Paint my toes and twirl
Take it back to old times
When I was still a girl
'Cause now, I'm all baboon boys
Coochie coochie coo
Sort of wonder why
I missed a kiss for you

'Cause summer never comes
Winter never comes
Summer never comes
Winter never comes
Summer never comes
Summer never comes
The summer never comes1Embed
