Rock Me Now Lyrics
The town where she was born, like the town where I was born was built by white settlers seeking gold and other treasures
Like me, she feels uncomfortable in the clothing of her ancestors
"It's not easy," she would say, ripping her fingers into the ashtray, "It's not easy to erase your blood."

Rock me now (sing with me)
In the arms of cobwebs
Roll me out in the arms of cobwebs

Once, she found a man to treasure and together they'd planted flowers of warning, fearing frost
Late on shallow evenings while their enemies slept, they hammered the soil asking for answers in green
His value declined when he offered his name
Why did he offer?

His value declined when he offered his name
His value declined when he offered his name
(His fend gets spread on
Sitting on the avenue
Blame it on the dump truck
Blame it on the fuel
Transient, Transient
Everybody owes
Living on the dump truck, Living on fuel)
When she was seven years old, she saw a man get shot, but no one came for a long time because it happened in a remote parking lot in Las Vegas
And she was waiting for her mom to come back from working the blackjack table at the Circus Circus casino
And that night, her mom said that the two of them and the now dead guy were the only three people who ever really lived in Las Vegas
Everybody else just arrived, ate their complimentary shrimp cocktail, and left

Rock me now in the arms of cobwebs (it's a one room city, yeah)
Roll me out (so can you roll with me?)
In the arms of cobwebs (it's a one room city, yeah)
His value declined when he offered his name

It's a one room city, yeah
It's a one room city, yeah
The wall to wall to wall to wall goes to street to street to streetEmbed
