London Halflife LyricsMiddle-aged, do the low rise on the waist
London half-life
Middle-aged, you the low-riser?
A little over wise, up late
And if you compromised
Drive your car through the rain
And if you've been beaten
Drive your car through the rain
Until you wash off the boss
Don't pull over 'til you're sure
One that wanted the floor
One that won't know the street
One that wanted to land
On the hearth with his feet up
Won't watch out
You're only better off in half your life
Over wise wasted
Over wise wasted
House of cards, you fall hardEmbed
