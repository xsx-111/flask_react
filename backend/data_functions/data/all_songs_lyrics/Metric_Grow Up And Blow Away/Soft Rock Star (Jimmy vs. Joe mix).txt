Soft Rock Star (Jimmy vs. Joe mix) Lyrics
Climbed the wall to make the sunrise in time
But the night had already begun
Climbed the wall to make the sunrise in time
But the night had already begun
Now here I am, I am the one
So hang high, soft star
Don't shine for swine

Not a lot of room to move us
Where is my guide?
I tried looking up to you, girls
Please correct me, but didn't you let the work slide?
Capitalize on a novelty, cheap pink spotlight
Is it alright?

"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls but failed now
The check is in the mail

Bubble gumbo martini
Is nothing like d√©panneur red wine
Travel through time
Who were you after you were mine?
"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls, haven't they?
Choose the brightest future
Pay the debt and try to buy the better girls, but fail until now
The check is in the mail

So hang high
Soft rock star
Hang high
Soft rock star
Don't shine before swine

"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls, haven't they?
"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls but failed now
The check is in the mailEmbed
