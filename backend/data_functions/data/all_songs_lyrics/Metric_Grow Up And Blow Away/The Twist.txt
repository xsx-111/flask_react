The Twist Lyrics
We were too wasted to close the window
Friends and family looking in to my only hiding place
The rhythm of a stranger's skin
Infidel to die for what I am doing
Will happen in the morning
When the mirror won't recognise me

He knows a certain gesture
When we're loving to ask each other
Do you want it?
Do you want me?
I want it
It is you
You are where I want to be

Who is he? (oh)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride? (the)
I can drive (twist)
Who is she? (oh)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride (the)
When I can drive? (twist)
Somebody put me back in school
I forget everything I used to know
How to leave the boy behind without having to watch him go
Oh, infidel to die for what I am doing
Will happen in the morning
When the mirror won't recognise me

He knows a certain gesture
When we're loving to ask each other
Do you want it?
Do you want me?
I want it
It is you
You are where I want to be

Who is he? (Circumstantial)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride? (the)
I can drive (twist)
Who is she? (Circumstantial)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride (the)
When I can drive? (twist)
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the)
Do the twist (twist)
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the twist)
Always
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the)
Do the twist (twist)
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the twist)
