Breathe LyricsYou came here to tell me something I already know
The dark before the dawn is the darkest I can go
The calm before the storm is what leaves me here to breathe
So breathe
Us of constant banging throwing fists against the wall
Screaming at the Earth for what it's done to one and all
I came here to tell you something you already know
Just breathe
Breathe
How cruel I am to you
Cruel things I do
How cruel you were to me
How cruel time can be
I wrote you a book but I left it out in the rain
Left it there to dry but it got rained on once again
Us of constant banging throwing fists against the wall
Breathe
Breathe
How cruel you are to me
How cruel time can be
How cruel I was to you
How cruel things I do
When you wake you'll know I'm gone and
Where I'm going there's no one
So don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see
Don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or seeEmbed
