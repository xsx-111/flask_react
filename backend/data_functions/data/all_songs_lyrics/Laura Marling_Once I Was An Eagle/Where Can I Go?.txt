Where Can I Go? LyricsI was a daddy's girl sometime
But I loved my mama 'til the end of the line
I am cold and I am bright
It's a curse of mine to be sad at night
It's a curse of mine to be sad at night
Late at night he'll come to me and he'll tell me I'm alone
Don't you think I don't already know?
All I see is road
No one takes me home
Where, where can I go?
Truth about desire they say
Is a need to breathe for another day
Truth I heard about regret
It's the hardest truth I've come to yet
It's the hardest truth I've come to yet
Late at night he'll come to me and he'll tell me I'm alone
Don't you think I don't already know?
All I hear are wars
There's something I don't know
Where, where can I?
All I see is road
No one takes me home
Where, where can I?
If I feel like I want to be alone
If I feel like I'm better fought than won
Pick up your rope and jump for Rosie
She's just a sweet thing with her curls
Just about a woman with her clothes on
You take 'em off and she's a girl
All I hear are words
There's something I don't know
Where, where can I?Embed
