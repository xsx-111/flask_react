Master Hunter LyricsI am a master hunter
I cured my skin
Now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries
You want a woman cause you wanna be saved
Well I tell you that I've got a little lo-lot on my plate
You want a woman who will call your name
It ain't me babe
No no no it ain't me babe
I don't stare at water anymore
Water doesn't do what it did before
Took me in and to the edge of insane
When I only meant to swim
I nearly put a bullet in my brain
When the rhythm took me in
I am a master hunter
You let men into your bed
Do they not know you well?
They can't get into my head
They don't have a hope in hell
You see the thing is we are so alone
There's nothing we can share
You could get me on the telephone
But you won't keep me there
No no no you won't keep me there
Take me somewhere I can grow
Give me something let me go
Tell me something I don't know
I have some news
I have some news
Is this what you think I do?
In life when I'm not being used
You see you're not sad you live for the blues
You're not sad you live for the blues
I have some news
Wrestling a rope from darkness is no fucking life that I would choose
I am a master hunter
I cured my skin
Now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries
I am a master, I am a master
I am a master hunter
I am a master hunter
I cured my skin
Now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries
You want a woman cause you wanna be saved
Well I tell you that I've got a little lot on my plate
You want a woman who will call your name
It ain't me babe
No no no it ain't me babe
I don't stare at water anymore
Water doesn't do what it did before
Took me in and to the edge of insane
When I only meant to swim
I nearly put a bullet in my brain
When the rhythm took me in
I am a master hunter
You let men into your bed
Do they not know you well?
They can't get into my head
They don't have a hope in hell
You see the thing is we are so alone
There's nothing we can share
You can get me on the telephone
But you won't keep me there
No no no you won't keep me there
Take me somewhere I can grow
Give me something let me go
Tell me something I don't know
I have some news
I have some news
Is this what you think I do?
In life when I'm not being used
You see you're not sad you live for the blues
You're not sad you live for the blues
I have some news
Wrestling a rope from darkness is no fucking life that I would choose
I am a master hunter
I cured my skin
Now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries
I am a master, I am a master, I am a master hunter1Embed
