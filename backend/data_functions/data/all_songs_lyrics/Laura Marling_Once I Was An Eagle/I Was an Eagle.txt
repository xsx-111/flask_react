I Was an Eagle Lyrics
So your grandmother sounds to me
A woman I would be proud to be
And you say she reminds you of me
Every little boy is so naïve

I will not be a victim of romance
I will not be a victim of circumstance
Chance or circumstance or romance, or
Any man who could get his dirty little hands on me
Oh, oh
No, oh

So your grandfather sounds like me
Head up, shoulders back, and proud to be
Every little girl is so naïve
Falling in love with the first man she sees

I will not be a victim of romance
I will not be a victim of circumstance
Chance or circumstance or romance, or
Any man who could get his dirty little hands on me
Oh, oh
No, oh
When we were in love (if we were)
When we were in love
I was an eagle
And you were a dove

Today I'll feel something other than regret
Pass me a glass and a half-smoked cigarette
I've damn near got no dignity left
I've damn near got no dignity left

I will not be a victim of romance
I will not be a victim of circumstance
Chance or circumstance or romance, or
Any man who could get his dirty little hands on me
Oh, oh
No, oh

When we were in love (if we were)
When we were in love
I was an eagle
And you were a dove
When we were in love (if we were)
When we were in love
You were a dove
And I rose above you and preyed1Embed
