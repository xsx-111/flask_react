Once LyricsIn the land I now know to be mine
There the heart is so dark it's near blind
When I think about the life I've left behind
I still raise no praise to the sky
With my eyes on the prize of your bed
When all that's needed saying has been said
When I think about the life that I have led
I laid down to the sound of the wise
Once, once is enough to break you
Once, once is enough to make you think twice
About laying your love out on the line
With all I now know to be true
And all I've figured out about you
All the crazy things a mind can do
I laid down to the sound of the truth
Once, once is enough to break you
Once, once is enough to make you think twice
About laying your little love out on the line
O, I was a child once
O, I was happy young
When all I didn't know needed doing
Had been doneEmbed
