Little Love Caster LyricsYes I am
Yes I am a master
I have you bad man
Little love
Little love caster
Palm of my hand
I wish that I had
I wish that I had have told you then
Where my kindness ends
I would take you home
I would take you home and then
Our love spell will end
You are new to me
You are new to me
I can't seem to say
"I'd like you to stay"
Yes I am
Yes I am a master
I have you, bad man
Little love
Little love caster
They might know you best
They might know you best
And love you most
I would take you home
I would take you home and then
I would be your ghost
I saw a lady dance yesterday
She was easily swayed
I cannot be tossed
And turned in this way
I'm not your tiny dancer
I can't seem to say
"I'd like you to stay"
I see a lady dance yesterday
She is easily swayed
I cannot be tossed
And turned in this way
I'm not a tiny dancer
I can't seem to say
"I'd like you to stay"
I can't seem to say
"I'd like you to stay"Embed
