Love be Brave LyricsIn a world you can't get lost in
I find my way to him
I am purpose and regret
You're a feeling I'll forget
What will I do then?
How did I sleep at night
With you far from my side?
Hold me down, make no sound
Silence speaks for me

Love be brave
No one will say it but you
And that has not yet been
The easy thing for you to do
How does he make love seem sweet?
Isn't that some heavy feat?
Do the birds suffer so?
Do they sing because they know?
This life don't go slow

Love be brave
No one will save you but me
And that has not yet been
The safest place for you to be
What will I do then?

Here comes a change over me
Something strange takes over me
I am brave and love is sweet
And silence speaks for him and me1Embed
