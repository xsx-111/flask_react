Pray for Me LyricsWhere does my lover lie?
I don't love, I just lie so
Pray, pray for me
And where you run, I run in tow
And where you're from I long to know
How does a child know
Where mother's weakness goes?
And where? And where the trouble goes?
Well you will speak, and it shall be so
And what you say will be all I know
There was a time of weeks
I thought dogs barked at me and
I, I have lost my mind
And the devil had put his mark on me
And calls his branches shake your trees
That's not me for my trying, that's the devil and his lying
Trying to make me lose my mind so
Pray, Pray for me
So you got my letter late
When I permanently etched my name
Right, oh right into your soul
I cannot love I want to be alone
I will not love I want to be alone
That's not me for my trying, that's the devil and his lying
Trying to make me when I'm trying to be good so
Pray, Pray for me
But where he runs, I run in tow
And where you're from I long to know
And you will speak and it shall be so
But I cannot love I want to be alone
Pray, pray for meEmbed
