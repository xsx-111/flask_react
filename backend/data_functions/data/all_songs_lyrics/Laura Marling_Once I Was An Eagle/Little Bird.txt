Little Bird Lyrics
Oh, Rosie, where have you been?
I couldn't save you, but I tried, Rosie
I tried

Why did you run from everyone
Who only tried to love you? Rosie, only tried

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?

Maybe I like pleasure-pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine

So why not run from everyone?
Who only tries to love you? Rosie, only tries
Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?

Maybe I like pleasure-pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you—


—With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?Embed
