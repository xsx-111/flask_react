When Were You Happy? (And How Long Has That Been) LyricsHey there, new friend across the sea
If you figure things out, would you figure in me?
Wouldn't it be a thing
To live somewhere quietly where there's a breeze
And there's a reason for us to be
I look at people here in this city and wonder if they're lonely
Or like me they're not content to live as things are meant to be
When were you happy?
And how long has that been?
Who speaks for them and then again
Who speaks for me?
My vote was never counted
So who upon this earth knows what it is that I believe?
We're all looking for answers where no answers can be found
Or is that a concern of mine
Because I have the time
To question my ground?
Hey there, new friend across the sea
If you figure things out, would you figure in me?
Hey there, new friend across the sea
If you figure things out, would you figure in me?
I find the more I think the harder it is for me to breathe
When were we happy?
And how long has that been?Embed
