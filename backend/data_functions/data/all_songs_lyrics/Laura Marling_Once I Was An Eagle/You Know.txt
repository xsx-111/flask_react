You Know LyricsDamn all those people who don't lose control
Who will never take a foot out of life
You might not think that I care—but you don't know what I know
And damn all those hippies who stomp empty-footed
Upon all what's good, or what's pure in the world
You might not think that I care—but you don't know what I know
And bless all those mothers who do all they can
Just to take their faults out of the line
I might not know what it's like—but I'm glad that you know
Give me a minute there—just a minute now
It'll come back to me
I was so sure, but you, free-wheelin' troubadour
You took my mind off the scene
And you know what I know, and I know that I know that you know
You asked me blind once
If I was a child once
And I said I'm really not sure
How can you know
How can you know
What it is you don't know
We were a pair once of such despair, oh
We were a child then, I'm sure
If we were a child then
We are children no more
Give me a minute there—just a minute now
It'll come back to me
I was so sure, but you, free-wheeling troubadour
You took my mind off the scene
And you know and I know and I know
I know that you know
You know, you know, you know, and I know that you knowEmbed
