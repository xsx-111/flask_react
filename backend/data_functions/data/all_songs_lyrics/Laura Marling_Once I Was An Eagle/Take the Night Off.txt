Take the Night Off Lyrics
You should be gone, beast
Be gone from me
Be gone from my mind, at least
Let a little lady be
I don't want you to want me
Wouldn't want you to know
I don't care where you've gone, beast
I care where you go

Take the night off
And be bad for me
Take it right off
And be bad for me

You're a night bird
Early riser
You have a kind of wing
To take her and surprise her
I didn't understand where you had gone
Didn't know you'd be right back
I didn't hear the night song
Calling for you into the black
Take the night off
And be bad for me
Take it right off
And be bad for me

Didn't ask you to save me
Not when you knew me well
Wouldn't ask you even to behave for me
I know there's no help in hell

Take the night off
And be bad for me
Take it right off
And be bad for me1Embed
