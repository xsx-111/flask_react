Lethargica Lyrics
The void clenches its determined jaws
A lethargic, careless motion to kill
Monstrous, prodigious, indifferent
Slow and deliberate its torturous skills

Its molars grind and shatter
Onerous, leaden bringers of hurt
Unhurried in its deadly intent
The undoer of all, dense and inert

Its design perfected through aeons
Pure, immaculate, clean, omnicidal god/machine

Calm, precise ambition
Untroubled by the roar of unending screams
The droning blare of absolute doom
The downpitched moan of collapsing dreams

Composed, cold, unconditional
Uncompromising 'til all is death
Extinction, ruin, its malicious cause
'Til the last exhalation of human breath1Embed
