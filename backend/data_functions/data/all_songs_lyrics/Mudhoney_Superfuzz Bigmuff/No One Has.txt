No One Has LyricsI've been so close to no way out
I don't lock the door no more
I've been so close to no way out
I don't lock the door no more
No
Lost my mind about a million times
Still ain't sure what I'm looking for
Must've lost my mind at least a million times
Still ain't sure what I'm looking for
No
I ain't looking for the easy way
And I'm not looking to lose my self
I ain't looking for the easy way
And I'm not looking to lose my self
No
I'm looking for something
No one seems to have
I'm looking, looking, yeah
For something no one seems to have
I keep looking everywhere
No one I know has
I keep looking, yeah
No one, no one has
No one, no one has
I keep looking anyway
No one, no one hasEmbed
