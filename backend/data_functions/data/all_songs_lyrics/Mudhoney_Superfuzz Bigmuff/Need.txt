Need LyricsGive me love laced with lies
There ain't much I haven't tried
Give me love laced with lies
There ain't much, baby, I haven't tried
There's so much, so much, so much I need
There's so much, so much, so much that I need
Turn your back, because you've shown your pain
There's nothing you really need to explain
No
There's so much, so much, so much that I need
There's so much, so much, so much I need, need, need
Hit it
Ahh
You're killing me and I'm killing you
You can't keep me from what I got to do
No, no, no
There's so much, so much, so much I need
There's so much, so much, so much that I need
There's so much, so much, so much I need
There's so much, so much, so much that I needEmbed
