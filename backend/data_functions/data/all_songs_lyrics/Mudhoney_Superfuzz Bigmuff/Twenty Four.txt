Twenty Four LyricsHe's been drunk for twenty four years (four years)
If he had a dime for every time (one dime)
Someone tried to change him (change)
He'd get drunk for twenty four more (twenty four more)
Yeah
I got trained to fight for the chain (yeah)
I got a dime and time to kill (time to kill)
I've been drunk for twenty four hours (drunk)
Someone's always trying to change me (stupid heads)
I've been drunk for twenty four hours (really drunk)
I'll stay drunk for twenty four more (yeah)
YeahEmbed
