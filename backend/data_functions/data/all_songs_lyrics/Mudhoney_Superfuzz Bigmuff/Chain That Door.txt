Chain That Door LyricsWhere do you think we've seen that girl?
Chain that door, I'm outta your world
We know
We know
We know what I mean
You made me feel like a big-time loser
Chain that door, it's all over
I said
You made me feel like a big-time loser
Chain that door, girl, it's all over
We know
We know
We know what I mean
See that I'm walking the way I am
Why you always hang around?
We know
We know
We know what I meanEmbed
