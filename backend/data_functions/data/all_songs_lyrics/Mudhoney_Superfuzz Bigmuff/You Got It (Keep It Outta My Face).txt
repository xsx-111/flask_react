You Got It (Keep It Outta My Face) LyricsWoah.. They say you got it
I've seen you got it
You got it.. You got it good
You've got it, You can keep it
That's right.. I don't want it
You give it away like free samples
But I don't want what anyone can have
You've got it.. Damn right you got it
So what?
Keep your mirror.. 'my face
Keep it out of my face
Keep it out of my face
Keep it out of my face
Just cuz you got it, You think everyone wants you
You got it, That's enough
You got it, That's right you got it
Fuck you
Keep it out of my face
Keep it out of my face
Keep it out of my faceEmbed
