Burn It Clean Lyrics
Got it burning so hot it shines
The route I'm on has got no signs
They say I fuse my only light
The fruit I eat is overripe

Burn it clean

Get topped, they lose, so lose your turn
Got it right from the start
Our mission to burn
Lost my turn and gained a sin
Got to see it, got to see it going in
Yeah

Burn it clean


One more tight knot tight under the collar
You would do anything for a dollar
Burn it thick 'til I can't name
Got to see, it got to see it go up in flames
Burn it cleanEmbed
