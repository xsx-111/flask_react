The Rose LyricsSome say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves the soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you its only seed
Its the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
Its the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
Its the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live
A friend, someone who knows
The song of your heart
And sings it to you
When you
Forget
The words
Attack
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been to long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose1Embed
