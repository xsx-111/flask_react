Halloween LyricsThere's something shifting in the distance
Don't know what it is
Day as dead as night
Except for the feeling
That's crawling up inside of me
As you sing your song
As you swing along, and you
It's your, your song
Devil in me who makes me stare at you
As you twist up along, sing your song
And you're slithering up to me
You're so close
I just
Just want to touch and sing your song
And you don't know what's going on
But you want me to come
You want me to come
You want me to come
You want me to come
Along
As you sing your, your song
And you're fucking me
Yeah, you're fucking with me
You're fucking with me
As you slither up, slither up to me
Your lips are slipping, twisting up my insides
Sing along and just a swinging man
Singing your song
Now I don't know what you want
But you're looking at me
And you're falling on the ground
And you're twisting around
Fucking with my, my mind
And I don't know what's going on
Swing your song, twist it along
As you slither up to me, and it's got to be
And I don't know what you want to do
Looking at me with your big dark eyes
And you're rubbing your body
Twist
Twist
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
Halloween
