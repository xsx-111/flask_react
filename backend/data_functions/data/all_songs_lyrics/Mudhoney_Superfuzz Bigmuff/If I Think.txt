If I Think LyricsI forgot how to breathe
I forgot just what I need
Saw the world laid down before me
I saw everything so small
If I think I think of you
If I think I think of you
I open my eyes
Watch the sky turn blue
I felt so good I almost forgot
All about you
I forgot how to cry
I forgot that I could die
And I'm so sick of what I need
I could close my eyes and fall
If I think I think of you
If I think I think of you
I open my eyes
Watch the sky turn blue
I felt so good I almost forgot
All about youEmbed
