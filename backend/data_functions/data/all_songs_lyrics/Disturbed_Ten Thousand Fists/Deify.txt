Deify Lyrics
 That's what I believe got him reelected
Is the people knew that you could believe what he says
 Our country is strong 
Yet, we go forward to defend freedom
And all that is good and just in our world

All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me
You want to know why
I feel so horrified
I've left my innocence die
You want to know why
I can't be pacified
You made me bury something
I won't be sleeping tonight

I only wanted a blessing made
Now I've been labeled a renegade
It seems so clear now what I must do
You're no immortal—I won't let them
Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man

You want to know why
It seems the passion's died
We've all been living this lie
You want to know why
My will's been fortified
You made me hunger again
Good luck sleeping tonight

I only wanted a blessing made
Now, I've been labeled a "renegade”
It seems so clear now what I must do
You're no immortal—I won't let them

Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man
All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me
All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me

Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man

Deify you
(All my devotion betrayed)
They view you as the new messiah
(I am no longer afraid)
Deify you
(I was too blinded to see)
Renew belief in some demented man
(How much you've stolen from me)2Embed
