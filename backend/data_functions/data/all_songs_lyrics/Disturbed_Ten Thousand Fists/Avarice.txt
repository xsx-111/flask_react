Avarice Lyrics
Politics and evil
All one in the same
Satan hides behind a different name

Take these chains away
Free my hands from bondage
Can't explain our way
Avarice will kill you in time

Violent upheaval
Cities drenched in flame
Wickedness we know we can contain

Take these chains away
Free my hands from bondage
Can't explain our way
Avarice will kill you in time

Who will we murder now?
See what we are becoming
An onyx veil that filters out the light
I'll savor this anger
My hate makes me stronger
Free my hands from bondage
Take these chains away
Running from destruction
Avarice will kill you in time
Kill you in timeEmbed
