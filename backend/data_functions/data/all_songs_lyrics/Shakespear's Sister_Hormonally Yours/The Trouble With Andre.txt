The Trouble With Andre Lyrics
Some people say he has a death wish
Trouble is he tends to agree
Let's not ask too many questions
It's nothing to do with you or me
He remembers a time when even going home was sweet
Now he can't feel the ground under his feet

And she said
"The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he hides everything"
But I know
The trouble with Andre
Is he's a liar

Inside the dresser by the table
Something he keeps beside the bed
Living with Andre can't be easy
Some things are better left unsaid
He remembers a time before the waters got so deep
When he found it easier to sleep

And she said
"The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he hides everything"
But I know the trouble with Andre
Is he's a liar
And you know
The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he fools everyone
But I know the trouble with Andre
Is his disguise

And she said
"The trouble with Andreâ€“"
But I know the trouble with Andre
Is he's a liar
And you know
The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he fools everyone
But I know the trouble with Andre
Is his disguise
And I know
The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he hides everything
But I know
The trouble with Andre
Is he's a liar
And you know

The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he fools everyone
But I know
The trouble with Andre
It's in his eyesEmbed
