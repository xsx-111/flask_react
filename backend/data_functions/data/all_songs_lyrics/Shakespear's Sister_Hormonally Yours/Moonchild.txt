Moonchild Lyrics
Birds can fly and fish can swim
But on this planet where do I fit in?
I could be in trouble or just imagining
Sometimes I feel like an alien
I make them laugh I make them stare
But Mr. Jones said "Hey young girl
Don't you feel sorry for yourself
The world's out there"

There's a moonchild (Talk to me baby)
For everyone (Come on, come on yeah)
Oh little moonchild (Oh little baby)
You're not the only one (Ooh)
There's a moonchild (Talk to me baby)
For everyone (Oh come on, come on yeah)
Oh little moonchild (Oh little baby)
You're not the only one (Ooh)

I looked at the world from another star
That's when you discover where you really are
So if you think you'd like the taste
You know there's not much time to waste
So take off into outer space
I'll see you there
There's a moonchild (Talk to me baby)
For everyone (Come on, come on yeah)
Oh little moonchild (Oh little baby)
You're not the only one (Ooh)
There's a moonchild
For everyone
Oh little moonchild
You're not the only one
The only one, no no no


There's a moonchild
For everyone
Oh little moonchild
You're not the only one (Ooh)
There's a moonchild (Talk, talk)
For everyone
Oh little moonchild (Oh)
You're not the only one (Ooh)
There's a moonchild (Oh talk to me)
For everyone (Come on, come on yeah)
Oh little moonchild (Oh little baby)
You're not the only one
The only one, no no noEmbed
