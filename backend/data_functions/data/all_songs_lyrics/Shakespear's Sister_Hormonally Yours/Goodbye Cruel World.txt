Goodbye Cruel World LyricsShe likes to wake up and just fake it
She knows if she touches it she'll break it
She can see all the houselights fading
And the ground beneath her feet is shaking
She's singing bye bye my old friend
You're never going to see my face again
You left me outside in the rain
So bye bye mr. A
 just when you think she's wearing thin
She's walking out with the biggest man that you've ever seen
She's singing bye bye my old friend
You're never going to see my face again
It took some time so here I am
So bye bye mr. A
Well now her grass is looking greener
And you hope that sometimes you might see her
What a diamond, boy, looks like you missed it
It must have left you feeling sick and twisted
Bye bye my old friend
You're never gonna see my face again
You left me outside in the rain
So bye bye I said bye byeEmbed
