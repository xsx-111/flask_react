Let Me Entertain You Lyrics
She's the queen of cliche
Lit from the highest tower
She loves to entertain you
But she charges by the hour

Here among the flowers
Of faith and hope I stand
While you are buried in the mess
Of weeds you sowed by hand

You're looking for a saviour
A queen from TV
But if you want to trust someone
Well how about me?

Let me entertain you
Is your soul for hire?
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time?

In a bar in Oklahoma
She offered you a dream
But it turned into a coma
Well there are no in-betweens
Sleep comes to the navyman
Who has to work the yard
But love's an added extra
You get when you're a star

Let me entertain you
Is your soul for hire?
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time?
Let me entertain you
Is your love for hire?
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time?

Don't you want to put your trust
In someone who's not ordinary?
Don't you want to put your trust
In someone like me?

Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Is your heart for hire?
Let me entertain you
Is your soul for hire?
Let me entertain you
Is your love for hire?
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time?Embed
