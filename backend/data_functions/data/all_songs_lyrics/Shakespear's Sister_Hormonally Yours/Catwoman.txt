Catwoman Lyrics
I was floating around the atmosphere
I liked what i saw so i came down here
I was looking for something
Looking for something
And the sky came up to meet with me
Magnetic forces greeted me
I was looking for something
Looking for something

I'm a superhuman 3D baby
A Hollywood brainchild to drive you crazy
And I'm coming your way real soon
I'm the catwoman from the moon

Now peace and love like a willow tree
Have hung their heads and wept for me
And I'm looking for someone
I'm looking for someone
So earth, don't you betray me
I'm willing to have your baby
Are you looking for someone?
Looking for someone?
I'm a superhuman 3D baby
A Hollywood brainchild to drive you crazy
And I'm coming your way real soon
I'm the catwoman from the moon


I'm a superhuman 3D baby
I'm a Hollywood brainchild to drive you crazy
And I'm coming your way real soon
I'm the catwoman from the moon

From the moon, yeah yeah
From the moon
From the moon, yeah yeah yeah
From the moon child, the moon child
From the moon
From the moon, yeah
From the moon
From the moon
From the moon
From the moon, yeah
From the moon
From the moon
From the moonEmbed
