Are We In Love Yet Lyrics
It's just another day in this crazy place
Well don't you ever feel like you're losing the race?
We're all on the same long road
To get where we want to go

Are we in love yet?
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet?
That's what makes the world go round

Don't need a crystal ball to see what's going on
Well I can see the signs so come on everybody
Let it shine, shine, shine, oh yeah
'Cause love makes you love somebody
Love turns you into somebody

Are we in love yet?
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet?
That's what makes the world go round
Are we in love yet?
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet?
Don't you know that makes the world go
Love's spinning, love's spinning round
Love's spinning, love's spinning round

'Cause love makes you love somebody
Love turns you into somebody, yeah

Are we in love yet?
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet?
That's what makes the world go round
Are we in love yet?
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet?
That's what makes the world go round

Are we in love yet?
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet?
Come on, come on, yeahEmbed
