Hello (Turn Your Radio On) Lyrics
Woke up this morning and the streets were full of cars
All bright and shiny like they'd just arrived from Mars
And as I stumbled through last night's drunken debris
The paperboy screamed out the headlines in the street
Another war and now the pound is looking weak
And tell me have you read about the latest freak?
We're bingo numbers and our names are obsolete
Why do I feel bitter when I should be feeling sweet?

Hello, hello, turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there?
Help me sing my song
La, la, la, life is a strange thing
Just when you think you've learned how to use it
It's gone

Woke up this morning and my head was in a daze
A brave new world had dawned upon the human race
Where words are meaningless and everything's surreal
Gonna have to reach my friends to find out how I feel
And if I taste the honey is it really sweet?
And do I eat it with my hands or with my feet?
Does anybody really listen when I speak?
Or will I have to say it all again next week?
Hello, hello, turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there?
Help me sing my song
Hello, hello, turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there?
Tell me what went wrong (Oh oh, oh oh)
La, la, la, life is a strange thing
Life is a strange thing


Hello, hello, turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there?
Help me sing my song (Oh oh, oh oh)
La, la, la, life is a strange thing
Just when you think you've learned how to use it
It's gone1Embed
