My 16th Apology Lyrics
The things I said about you
Maybe we could work it out someday

Things were going pretty well 'til I died
On that sunny afternoon
When you broke down before my eyes
Well I got a streak of meanness (Oh yeah)
A clumsy way of speaking
And I don't know where I get it from
It must run in my family

Do I have to go down on my knees?
This is my sixteenth apology to you
With friends like me who needs enemies?

I got a river inside the size of my rage
Which is really something else
When you think of my tender age
Well I got a way about me (Oh yeah)
But it's hard for me to see it (Oh yeah)
And I don't know when I'm in the wrong
Why am I so hard to please?
This is my sixteenth apology to you
Do I have to go down on my knees for you? (Yeah)
With friends like me who needs enemies?

The things I said about you
Were all said yesterday
I didn't mean to hurt you
Maybe we could work it out someday

Now I got a streak of meanness (Oh yeah)
A clumsy way of speaking
And I don't know when I'm in the wrong
Why am I so hard to please?

Do I have to go down on my knees?
This is my sixteenth apology to you
With friends like me who needs enemies?

Didn't your mother ever tell you
To err is human, to forgive is divine?
Oh well, I'll see you in the next lifeEmbed
