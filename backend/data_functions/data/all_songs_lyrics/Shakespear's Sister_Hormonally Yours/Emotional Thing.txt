Emotional Thing Lyrics
I've seen the world from a first class seat
I've read The Bitch and Ulysses
I've tried religion and philosophy
And walked upon the sea

Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
It's just a suicidal whim
But I can't resist

An emotional thing
An emotional thing (An emotional thing)
An emotional thing
An emotional thing (An emotional thing)

Now isolation can be sweet
No juvenile delinquent heat
I don't have to tell ya where I'm coming from
If I leave my cat suit on

Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
It's just a suicidal whim
But I can't resist
An emotional thing
An emotional thing (An emotional thing)
An emotional thing
An emotional thing (An emotional thing)

Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
It's just a suicidal whim
But I can't resist

An emotional thing
And the sky sucked me up into its geography
An emotional thing
And it smelled sweet over and over we rolled
An emotional thing
Down the Matterhorn of excess into the daffodils
An emotional thing
By the black swan in that ugly dress!
An emotional thing
I was dreaming of you and you were dreaming of success
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thing
An emotional thingEmbed
