Song to the Siren (Take 7) LyricsLong afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang:
"Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you"
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing:
'Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow
O my heart, o my heart shies from the sorrow'
I am puzzled as the oyster
I am troubled as the tide:
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Should I lie with death my bride?
Hear me sing, 'Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you:
O my heart, o my heart is waiting to hold you'Embed
