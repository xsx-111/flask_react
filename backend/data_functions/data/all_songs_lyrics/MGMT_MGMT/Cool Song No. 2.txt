Cool Song No. 2 Lyrics
Whenever I drift by the unknown
Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine petals open and close offended
Poor explanation and nothing shown

Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we shared a dream for 20 nights in a row
I might feel better knowing that I was alone

Wherever scientists turn lead to birds
Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth
What you find shocking, they find amusing
Something else to soften a sadistic urge

When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core
Oh I'd twist it more

If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up
What if the beast escapes (apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault)
Seeps into the hollow bones
Wouldn't its eyes expand and zero in like a scope
I might feel better knowing I wasn't alone5Embed
