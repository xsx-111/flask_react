A Good Sadness Lyrics
I can still hear the reflections in the air
Feeding time
Either hemisphere, if it's summer there
Seeking you, taking a dive
Streets realigned
Ooh ooh ooh
Stored in my mind

All I could do not to steal
All the fun in the world
From your little heart
And now I owe it back to you
But it's hard to catch it and let it go
Find excuses to burn right through the grief
And to melt, to melt, to melt

Oh my poor memories
Down to a trace
'Til you forget that, I'm alive
And you feel it's all right
Ooh I'm sure you'll be fine
Tune it out
And I'm sure you'll be fine
Doing well
Finding an excuse
Shutting down soon (over my eyes)
Lost the recall

No line
Disprove
Mean time
Desperate
Confide
Inrush
Disprove
Mean time
Inrush
No line
Desperate
Confide
Inrush
Disprove
No line
Inrush
No line
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...3Embed
