I Love You Too, Death Lyrics
Who is much more than a friend
But never by my side?
All beginnings are an end
In the blackness there’s a light
Maybe you will only read
One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets
Every stranger is a ghost

Cashiers won’t deduct the pain
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color’s faded out
Let’s go camping in the cold
Make a fire, buy a tent
Envision leather getting old
Re-send pigeons that were sent

Try to memorize your smell
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guts recast in steel
Birds don’t cry when echoes quit
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks
Knowing winter’s five feet tall
Generations of defeat
All assuming you're the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own
If there’s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine’s a black heart you could flip

I’ve come to terms with what I have
What’s been given, what’s been asked
Turn my back against the sea
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in zee park

I can’t touch you only once
You always leave me wanting more
So keep my feet within the house
And stick my toes just past the door
Let me know when I’m in love
Let me die when I’m in love7Embed
