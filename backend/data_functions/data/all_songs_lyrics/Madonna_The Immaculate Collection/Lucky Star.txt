Lucky Star Lyrics
You must be my Lucky Star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you, and I start to glow
And I need your light and baby, you know

Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, (Starbright)
Make everything all right
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, (Starbright), yeah

You must be my Lucky Star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost, you'll be my guide
I just turn around, and you're by my side

Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, (Starbright)
Make everything all right
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, (Starbright), yeah
C'mon, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right
Mmm, c'mon, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right

You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far
You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far

Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, (Starbright)
Make everything all right
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, (Starbright), yeah

C'mon, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right
Mmm, c'mon, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right

(You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far)
(You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far)
(You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far)
You may be my Lucky Star
What you do to me, baby
(You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far)
You know, I'm the luckiest by far
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, (Starbright)
Make everything all right
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight

Starlight, starbright
You make everything all right
What you do to me, baby
You got to stay by my side tonight
