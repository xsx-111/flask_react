Dying Day LyricsSomebody is whispering
Tongues are a-twisting
My eyes are glistening
Say hello to your debutante
And say bye-bye to true love
I heard your bugle playing
The sweetest music to my ears
I'm not afraid of saying
I'm close to tears
We'll run away
And I'll always believe
Until my dying day
My dying day
I say I'm not sorry
To cast you off, discourteously
When you talk so realistically
The thrill of love
Is gone for me
I heard your bugle playing
The sweetest music to my ears
I'm not afraid of saying
I'm close to tears
We'll run away
And I'll always believe
Until my dying day
My dying dayEmbed
