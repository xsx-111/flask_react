Upwards And Onwards LyricsUpwards and onwards
I'd rather fall to the ground and think again
And I'm hoping and praying
That those we've broken time will mending, amending
The king's new clothes have fallen to the ground
But my ears are deaf to your bright new sound
Upwards and onwards
I can't supress the guilt I feel inside
So I'm hoping that someday
I can return to resting, reposing
Resting, reposing
The king's new clothes have fallen to the ground
But my ears are deaf to your bright new sound
Upwards and onwards
