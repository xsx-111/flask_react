Tender Object LyricsHere I go around and around
Sick inside and eyes to the ground
Looking for a sign to set me free
In my chic cold misery
Step we gaily, on we go
Heel to heel and toe to toe
Lock me away, I need to unwind
Did you ever hear anything so unkind
From your window?
Listen, remembering with deep regret
How we used to dance in a discoteque
Ask me why I say dance to forget
My fall from grace, my losing face
These are the tears, the tears I can't hide
The pride inside, I can't deny
The hurt, the pain, all thrown out
My window
I trusted you
Listen I step
Down to the arcade
And I see my reflection in the window
And I feign affection for that window
I could be kidding you on
I could be kidding you on and on...
I step down to the arcade
And I see my reflection in the window
Come step down to the arcade
And we'll laugh at our reflections in the window-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa1Embed
