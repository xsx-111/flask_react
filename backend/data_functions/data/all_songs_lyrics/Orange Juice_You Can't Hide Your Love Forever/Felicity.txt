Felicity Lyrics
I objected
When they took it away from here
Honesty that could not have been much more than me
One must be strong for without the weather will change
But within remain unchanged the things for which we strive
For happiness, I guess, when you lay it on the ground

Felicity, I guess so
Felicity, I guess so

Now I'm in a stupor
Behind the scenes which say
This was is OK
The clarity of my eyes
Shines both in memories of past victories
Fine scenes shining while, shining white

Felicity, I guess so
Felicity, I guess so
Take me to the bridge now

Happiness
Oh oh happiness
Oh oh happiness
This is the sound of happinessEmbed
