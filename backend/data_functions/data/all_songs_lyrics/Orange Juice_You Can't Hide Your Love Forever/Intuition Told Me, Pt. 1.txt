Intuition Told Me, Pt. 1 LyricsHe took her hand
They took the floor
She was his all time favourite dancer
Smile lopsididly
Decididly
Awkward
He asked her
Take my hand
Take me and
I'll take my cue
Ain't you guessed by now
I'm sold on you
The late bus is leaving
From the lonely station
So grab your silk stockings
And your
Dance invitationEmbed
