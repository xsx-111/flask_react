Three Cheers For Our Side LyricsI'm just like a whisper on the breeze
Praying to the team oh don't say me
I'm just like a whistler on the tree
Praying to the breeze oh don't move me
I've seen that silence can break your heart
It's like a bond of iron we'll rend apart
We sit her in torpor by our old fireside
And just agree to differ --- Three cheers for our side
You can laugh at danger all day long
Still be laughing when the sun has gone
Be wise to history
Open your eyes and declare to me
See them wending, never ending, smiling cheers
You know that very shortly they'll turn to tears
We sit here for ever by our old fireside
And won't sing in spring --- Three cheers for our side
Say not so long
Sift through the sand
Wave of the hand
