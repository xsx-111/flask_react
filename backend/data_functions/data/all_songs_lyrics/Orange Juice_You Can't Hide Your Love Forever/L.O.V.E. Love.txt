L.O.V.E. Love LyricsI started to write this song about you
Then I decided that I would write it all about love
It then occured to me
That you weren't happy
That's for sure, positively
That's what the world is made for
So give me more...
L.O.V.E
Love is a walk down Main street
Love is an apple that's so sweet
Love is something that can't be beat
L.O.V.E
It's strange to me
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens
Can't you see
You can always depend on me
To give you love
Love is a fire within my soul
Love is a story that can't be told
Can't you feel it burning more and more
Stop and look at the big wheel roll
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story
'Bout...
I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story, I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together
And I will be such a happy fella
'Bout...
Love is something that is so divine
Love is a feeling (that)'s a friend of mine
It can't be measured by no time
In your heart or even in your mind
Love is a fire within my soul
Love is a story that can't be told
Can't you feel it burning more and more
Stop and look at the big wheel rollEmbed
