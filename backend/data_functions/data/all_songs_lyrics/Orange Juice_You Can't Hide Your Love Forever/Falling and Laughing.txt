Falling and Laughing Lyrics
You must think me very naive
Taken as true
I only see what I want to see
Avoid eye contact at all costs
What can I do
To see your fine teeth smiling at me

I'm not saying
That we should build a city of tears
All I'm saying
Is I'm alone and consequently
Only my dreams satisfy the real need of my heart
I resist

You say that there's a thousand like you
Well, maybe that's true
I fell for you and nobody else
So I'm standing here so lonesome
What can I do
But learn to laugh at myself

I'm not saying
That we should build a city of tears
All I'm saying
Is I'm alone and consequently
Only my dreams satisfy the real need of my heart
I resist
I'm not saying
That we should build a city of tears
All I'm saying
Is I'm alone
Fall falling, falling again
Cause I want to take the pleasure with the pain
Fall falling, falling and laughing
Cause I want to take
The pleasure with the pain
Fall falling
Falling and laughing
Falling and laughing
Falling and laughing1Embed
