Satellite City LyricsWhisper it all
Cry wolf discreetly
I answered your call
Now I moan dispairingly
Would it hurt you so
If I told you to
Would it hurt you so
If I told you to go?
Your knife edge caress
Cuts me so deeply
There's no bitterness
'Cause you did it all so sweetly
Would it hurt you so
If I told you to
Would it hurt you so
If I told you to go?
I can remember the halcyon days
We leapt on stage
Though we couldn't play
Furthermore we had nothing to say
You smash your heart against the rocks
You smash your heart against the rocksEmbed
