Untitled Melody Lyrics
You're so transparent I can guess without question
You need something or other to cover your expression
I bought you some sunspecs from the local hipsters store
I need you more or less, you need me more and more

I'm so transparent you can guess without question
I need something or other to cover my expression
Buy me some sunspecs like the ones you wore
From the local hipsters store
You need me more or less, I need you more and moreEmbed
