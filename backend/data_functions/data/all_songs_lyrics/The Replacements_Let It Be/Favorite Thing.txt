Favorite Thing LyricsHey!
Yeah, kid, it's a-really hip
With plenty of flash and you know it
Yeah, dad, you're rocking real bad
Don't break your neck when you fall down laughing
Donna, wanna, Donna
Yeah, I know, I look like hell
I smoke and I drink and I'm feeling swell
Yeah, I hear you think it's weird
But I don't give a single shit
Yeah, man, it's a-hip, you know what I'm saying
It's a-hip, you know what I'm saying and I hear it
My heart aches, it's a-looking for a dolly
Looking for a dolly, can't you hear it?
Wanna be something
Wanna be anything
Yeah, I know I feel this way
But I ain't gonna never change
Yeah, I hear, I think, I know
Rock don't give a shit, you know
You're my favorite thing
You're my favorite thing
Bar nothing!
You're my favorite thing
You're my favorite thing
You're my
You're mine
You're mine
You're mine
I think big, I think big
I think big once in a while
I think big, I think big
I think big once in a while
I think, think, think, I think, think, think
I think, think, I think once in a whileEmbed
