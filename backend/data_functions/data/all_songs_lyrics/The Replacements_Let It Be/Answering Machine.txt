Answering Machine Lyrics
Try and breathe some life into a letter
Losing hope, we'll never be together
My courage is at its peak
You know what I mean

How do you say you're okay to an answering machine?
How do you say good night to an answering machine?

Big town's got its losers
Small town's got its vices
A handful of friends:
One needs a match, one needs some ice
Call-waiting phone in another time zone

How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do say good night to an answering machine?

(If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, hang up and then dial the number...)
I get enough of that
Try and free a slave of ignorance
Try and teach a whore about romance

How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do you say good night to an answering machine?
How do you say I'm lonely to an answering machine?

The message is very plain
Oh, I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
(If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...)Embed
