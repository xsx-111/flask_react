Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out Lyrics
Tommy gets his tonsils out
Hi Susie, do you know what?
I've been in the hospital

Now open wide, the doctor's here
Everything is fine, got nothing to fear
Strap 'em down, we're outta gas
Stop your bawling, you little brat

Let's get this over with, I tee off in a hour
Didn't wash up, yesterday I took a shower
Get this over with, I tee off in an hour
My Cadillac's running, let's

Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now

Open wide, you little snot
That's the way we knock 'em out
Got nothing to fear, got nothing to be afraid of
Doctor's here, nothing to be afraid of
Let's get this over with, I tee off in an hour
Did I wash up?
Yesterday, I took myself a shower
My Cadillac's running

Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now

How ya doin'?
How do you feel later, after the operation?
Can I come by?
I'm really feeling terribleEmbed
