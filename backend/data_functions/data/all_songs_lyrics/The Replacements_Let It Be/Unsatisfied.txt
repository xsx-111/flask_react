Unsatisfied Lyrics
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Was you satisfied?
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Hey, are you satisfied?

And it goes so slowly on
Everything I've ever wanted
Tell me what's wrong?

Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfied
Were you satisfied?
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Now, are you satisfied?

Everything goes, well, anything goes
All of the time
Everything you dream of is right in front of you
And everything is a lie

Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfed
Look me in the eye, unsatisfied
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so dissatisfied
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so unsatisfied
Well, uh-- well, I'm-a
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so dissatis-, dissatis-, dissastis...
I'm so...Embed
