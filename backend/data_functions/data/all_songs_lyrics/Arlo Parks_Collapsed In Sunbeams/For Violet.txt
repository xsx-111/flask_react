For Violet Lyrics
Couldn't always come to mine when your dad got angry
So I'd play Nujabes down the phone for you to hear
I could picture terror swirling in your iris
You would say, "I cannot bear this, get me out of here"

Wait, you know when college starts again you'll manage
Wait, you know that I'll be there to kiss the damage
Wait, you know I bought a couple books I think you'd like
Just hold on for tonight

It feels like nothing's changing
And I can't do this, can't do this
It feels like nothing's changing
And I can't do this, can't do this
It feels like nothing's changing
And I can't do this, can't do this
It feels like nothing's changing
It feels like nothing's changing

Oleander bushes flourish in your garden
I come round for pancakes
And we'd stretch under the leaves
He would always act so sarcastically charming
Wonder if he realized how much he hurt his kids
Wait, you know when college starts again you'll manage
Wait, you know that I'll be there to kiss the damage
Wait, you know I bought a couple books I think you'll like
So hold on for tonight

It feels like nothing's changing
And I can't do this, can't do this
It feels like nothing's changing
And I can't do this, can't do this
It feels like nothing's changing
And I can't do this, can't do this
It feels like nothing's changing
It feels like nothing's changing

Can't do this
Can't do thisEmbed
