Portra 400 Lyrics
Making rainbows out of something painful
Getting fried is how I'm dodging gravestones

Spiraling in bathrooms, tiles on cheek
Telling me the drugs will only make me weak
Don't you think I know that
Don't you think I know that
Keeping bits of moonstone next to me
Tried to shave your stubble but you gashed your cheek
Won't you stay away
Won't you stay away from me

With you I'm always making rainbows out of something painful
Getting fried is how I'm dodging gravestones

You look like me when you lie
Boiled blood star shifts in the window of my eye
You put warm salt to the stitch
And I suffer for the sky that you shook nine times
You smell like burnt hibiscus
I still feel blessed even when we're bitching
You stole my spine for a minute
So I cut my hair just to make you smile
Making rainbows out of something painful
Getting fried is how I'm dodging gravestones
Making rainbows out of something painful
Getting fried is how I'm dodging gravestones1Embed
