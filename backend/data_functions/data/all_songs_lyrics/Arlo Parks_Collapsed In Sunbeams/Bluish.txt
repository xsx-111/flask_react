Bluish Lyrics
You held me
You held me so hard I went bluish
I resolve to set boundaries
I went bluish, I went bluish

Smothered me with fake blood and ginger
Around your throat
Always charming and balanced
That's why it hurt the most
I got so claustrophobic
But you were never close enough, hey

It's not easy when you call me in the dead of the night
When I say I need some space I shouldn't have to ask you twice
It's not easy when you call me in the dead of the night
When I say I need some space I shouldn't have to ask you twice

Shouldn't have to
Shouldn't have to ask you twice
Shouldn't have to
Hey
I went bluish, I went bluish
You twist violets in my eyes
Always in my house just smoking
Drinking tea, collecting spines
Never had the chance to miss you
I never had the chance to miss ya

Heart in my mouth
Please let me out
Please let me out of you
Heart in my mouth
Please let me out
Please let me out of you

It's not easy when you call me in the dead of the night
When I say I need some space I shouldn't have to ask you twice
It's not easy when you call me with your voice pink and white
When I say I need some space I shouldn't have to ask you twice

Shouldn't have to
Shouldn't have to ask you twice
I shouldn't have to
Shouldn't have to ask you twice
I shouldn't have to
Shouldn't have to ask you twice
I shouldn't have to
Shouldn't have to ask you twice
I shouldn't have to
Shouldn't have to ask you twice
I shouldn't have toEmbed
