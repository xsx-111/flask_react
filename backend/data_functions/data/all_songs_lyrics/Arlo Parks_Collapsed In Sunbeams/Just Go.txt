Just Go Lyrics
Thought I was hallucinating when you turned up at my house
Hair dyed silver, mumbling apologies
I don't trust your eyes

Told me I should change my mind
Said you're feeling dead inside without me
As I watched you welling up
I knew you hadn't changed that much

Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Oh why don't you just

Can't forget her necklace in the backseat of your car
Can't forget the hickies, you know bitter blossoms fast
Won't deny I miss your choice of words, but I can't go back

Begging me to change my mind
Said you're feeling dead inside without me
As I watched you welling up
I knew you hadn't changed that much
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
(Go, go, go, oh)
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?
Why don't you just go?

(Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da)1Embed
