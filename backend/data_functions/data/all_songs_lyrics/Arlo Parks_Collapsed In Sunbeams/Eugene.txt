Eugene Lyrics
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah
(Yeah)

I had a dream, we kissed
And it was all amethyst
The underpart of your eyes was violet
You hung a cigarette between your purple lips

We've been best buds since thirteen
I hold your head back when you're too lean
I hold the Taco Bell and you cried over Eugene
He was mean
He was mean

Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame
I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame
I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Seein' you with him burns
I feel it deep in my throat
You put your hands in his shirt
You play him records I showed you
Read him Sylvia Plath, I thought that that was our thing
You know I like you like that
I hate that son of a bitch

We've been best buds since thirteen
But that don't change the things I feel
Oh, when I see you smile with your teeth at Eugene
Yeah, I can't deal

Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame
I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame
I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say4Embed
