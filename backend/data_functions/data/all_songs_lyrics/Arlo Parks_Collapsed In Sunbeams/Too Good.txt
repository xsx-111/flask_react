Too Good Lyrics
Why'd we make the simplest things so hard?

I brought you breakfast, then you stared at your rings
The air was fragrant and thick with our silence
I held my breath as something deep inside pinched
I touched the bump on your wrist you were born with

Watching you tryna push away
It hurts when you see it coming
You're too proud to tell me that you care
Watching you tryna push away
It hurts when you see it coming
Never use your words to show you care

I think you know it
Too cool to show it
Babe you're so good, you're too good to be true
I think you know it
Too cool to show it
Babe you're so good, you're too good to be true

Oh-oh-oh
Why'd we make the simplеst things so hard?
I let my pain out through the way that I sit
And start to pick at the rips in my Nikеs
You quote Thom Yorke and lean in for a quick kiss
But still you just won't admit that you like me

Watching you lower both your eyes
It hurts when you know it's over
Still too stubborn to show that you care
Watching you lower both your eyes
It hurts when you know it's over
I feel like you never really cared

I think you know it
Too cool to show it
Babe you're so good, you're too good to be true
I think you know it
Too cool to show it
Babe you're so good, you're too good to be true
I think you know it (Oh)
Too cool to show it
Babe you're so good, you're too good to be true
I think you know it
Too cool to show it
Babe you're so good, you're too good to be true
Oh-oh-oh
Why'd we make the simplest things so hard?
Oh-oh-oh
Why'd we make the simplest things so hard?

Oh-oh-oh
Sunspots in your eyes, dark green
You still mean the world to me
Oh-oh-oh
Why'd we make the simplest things so hard?
Why'd we make the simplest things so hard?Embed
