Caroline Lyrics
I was waiting for the bus one day
Watched a fight between an artsy couple escalate
Strawberry cheeks flushed with defeated rage
Then he spilled his coffee as he frantically explained

Maybe if you took a breath
You would hear me when I talk to you
Threw her necklace in his face
Eyes so bright with disappointment
I saw something inside her break
Everybody knows the feeling
Suddenly he started screaming

"Caroline, I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried
Caroline, I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried, I swear to God I tried"

Ripped the hem of her skirt as she ran
Panicking and weaving through the crowds on Oxford Street
Watched his world dissolve in his hands
Tried to roll a blem then put his head between his knees, ooh
Maybe if she took a breath
She would know I did it all for her
Agony and hints of sage
Her eyes blind with disappointment
I couldnâ€™t recognize her face
Shards of glass live in this feeling
Have to somehow stop her leaving

"Caroline, I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried
Caroline, I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried
Caroline, I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried
Caroline, I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried
I swear to God I tried, I swear to God I tried"2Embed
