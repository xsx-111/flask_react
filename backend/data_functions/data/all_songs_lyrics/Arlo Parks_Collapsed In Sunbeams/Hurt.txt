Hurt Lyrics
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Charlie drank it 'til his eyes burned
Then forgot to eat his lunch
Pain was built into his body
Heart so soft it hurt to beat

Oh, wouldn't it be lovely to feel something for once?
Yeah, wouldn't it be lovely, to feel worth something, huh?

(Mmm, mmm)
I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
Just know it won't hurt so
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much

Charlie melts into his mattress
Watching Twin Peaks on his ones
Then his fingers find the bottle
When he starts to miss his mum
(Mmm, mmm)
Wouldn't it be lovely to feel something for once?
Yeah, wouldn't it be lovely, to feel worth something, huh?

(Mmm, mmm)
I know you can't l–µt go, of anything at the moment
Just know it won't hurt so
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much

Charlie started seeing stars, so stuck on the new Jai Paul
Said "my clothes are sticking to me and I can't quite see my walls"
Started dreaming of a house with red carnations by the windows
Where he didn't feel so small, so overwhelmed by all his flaws

I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
Just know it won't hurt so
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much forever
I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
Just know it won't hurt so
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much
I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
Just know it won't hurt so
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much forever
Won't hurt so much
Won't hurt so much4Embed
