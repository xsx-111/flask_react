Collapsed in Sunbeams LyricsCollapsed in sunbeams, stretched out open to beauty however brief or violent
I see myself ablaze with joy, sleepy eyed, feeding your cat or slicing artichoke hearts,
I see myself sitting beside you, elbows touching, hurt and terribly quiet
The turquoise in my ring matches the deep blue cramp of everything
We're all learning to trust our bodies, making peace with our own distortions
You shouldn't be afraid to cry in front of me. I promise.‎Embed
