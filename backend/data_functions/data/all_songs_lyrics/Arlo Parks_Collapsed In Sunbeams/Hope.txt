Hope Lyrics
Millie tried to talk the pleasure back into being alive
Reminiscing 'bout the apricots and blunts on Peckham Rye
Won't call her friends 'cause she's ashamed of being locked into bed
Can't feel her legs and feeling like a liar at best

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alonе like you think you are
We all havе scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone

You're not alone, you're not alone

Started sweating bullets when her dad asked, "How d'you really feel?"
She said, "I've been feeling like something inside me wants to scream"
Won't call my friends, I'm persuaded that they'll leave in the end
Can't feel my legs, I'm feeling like a liar at best

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone
I've often felt like I was born under a bad sign
Wearing suffering like a silk garment or a spot of blue ink
Looking for light and finding a hole where there shouldn't be one
I cannot communicate the depth of the feeling
Truth is I'm still learning to be open about this
But know that I know and you're not alone
Yeah, know that I know and you're not alone

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not aloneEmbed
