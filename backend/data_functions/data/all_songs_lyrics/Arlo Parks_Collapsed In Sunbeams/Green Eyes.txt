Green Eyes Lyrics
Summer in my eyelids, eatin' rice and beans
Paintin' Kaia's bedroom, think she wanted green
But the weather puts you on my mind
Dragonfruit and peaches in the wine
Kissin' circles underneath your eyes

Of course I know why we lasted two months
Could not hold my hand in public
Felt their eyes judgin' our love and baying' for blood
I could never blame you darlin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Some of these folks wanna make you cry
But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide
And shine, and shi-ine, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish that your parents had been kinder to you
They made you hate what you were out of habit
Remember when they caught us makin' out after school
Your dad said he felt like he'd lost you

So I know why we lasted two months
Could not hold my hand in public
Felt their eyes judgin' our love and baying' for blood
I could never blame you darlin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Some of these folks wanna make you cry (Oh, oh)
But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide
And shine, and shi-ine, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some of these folks wanna make you cry (Oh, oh)
But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide (Oh, oh, oh)
And shine (Oh, oh), and shi-ine (Oh, oh), yeah, yeah, yeah

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo2Embed
