Offspring Are Blank Lyrics

There was a single one
Then there were ten
With time made a hundred and a hundred million
You came and spoke to me
I saw your face
Your words were like raindrops from a storm in a vase
Each generation different

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love them

And in the marriage of eagle and snake
The parents are fertile but the offspring is blank
The fire rages and all through the night
The flame is contagious but the heat feels all right
Can't recognize our poverty
He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love them

There is a darkness I feel comin' down
And shadows that lengthen from the sky to the ground
And a silence that can swallow sound

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love them
He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love both of them1Embed
