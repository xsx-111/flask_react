Dance for You LyricsI ran across cyanide planes
Mind like a prison cell
But feet untethered and sane
I wandered out hopeless and sad
No thought of where I'd go
Or how I'd ever get back
There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing 'till I do (ooh)
I boogied down gargoyle streets
Searching in every face
For something I could believe
I knelt beneath one hundred saints
I wanna feel the breath
Of a force I cannot explain
There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing till I do (ooh)
Dance for you

There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing till I do (ooh)
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you1Embed
