Maybe That Was It LyricsIf you saw the surface rip and bloom with rot
Some part doing what some other part will not
Maybe that was it
If you saw a shadow rise beyond the hiss
Iridescent and pretend anonymous
Maybe that was it
If you saw a weapon that so smooth transfixed
Cylinders of language pounded into bricks
Maybe that was it
If you saw an animal in hard retreat
Hundred parasites all burrowed in so deep
Maybe that was itEmbed
