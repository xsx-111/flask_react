See What She Seeing LyricsMornings I wake up hung over
Lower than mornings before
I don't know, memory's torture
Or maybe what I deserve
Lonely and forgotten in the frozen world
Scorned in my desire
Ignored by all the girls
I need someone to comfort me
Whose hair is whipping (wild and free)
Whose mouth is smiling (wide open)
Whose eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing
Everywhere I go I see her
Everywhere I look she disappears
Every time I think I've found her
Just what I've found is unclear
So onward through the murk and the uncertainty
Sifting through the days, patient and carefully
Always to get to where she is
Her hair is whipping (wild and free)
Her mouth is smiling (wide open)
Her eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
"But you can't see me"
Tell me the way to the orchid
Tell me the way and I'll be there
Give me a day to go forward
Give me your hand and we'll go there
Forward through the clover and the bergamot
Shoreward to the gulls and to the guillemots
Who're rising alone among the winds
Her hair is whipping (wild and free)
Whose mouth is smiling (wide open)
Her eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeingEmbed
