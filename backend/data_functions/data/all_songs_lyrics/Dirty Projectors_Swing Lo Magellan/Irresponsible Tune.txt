Irresponsible Tune LyricsWith our song we are outlaws
With our songs, we're alone
But without songs we're lost
And life is pointless, harsh, and long
In my heart, there is music
In my mind is a song
But in my eyes a world crooked, fucked up, and wrong
Sing all day
Record and play
Drums and bass
And a guitar
Will there be peace in the world?
Or will violence always own the truth?
There's a bird singing at my window
And it's singing an irresponsible tune
An irresponsible tune
An irresponsible tune1Embed
