The Socialites Lyrics
I think she’s the prettiest lady I’ve ever seen
Her hair — it has meaning and volume and such a sheen
Sometimes I think maybe I could go and talk to her
Her eyes — they look lonely, far away and inert

Oh baby, the socialites who act so nice
Won't ever begin to let you in
They’ll act surprised, apologize
Won't ever let on
The face you wear is their own

I’m gonna try combing my hair in a thousand ways
Maybe he will notice and maybe look my way

Oh baby, the other guys who act so nice
Won't ever begin to let you in
Stars in their eyes, they’ll apologize
Won't ever let on
They need someone real

But they don’t know where I’m going
It’s not impossible to show
But to show is to open up
The socialites who act so nice
Won't ever begin to let you in
They’ll act surprised, they'll apologize
Won't ever let on
The face you wear is their own

I'm glad they're the ones on the other side of the glass
Who knows what my spirit is worth in cold, hard cash
Oh baby2Embed
