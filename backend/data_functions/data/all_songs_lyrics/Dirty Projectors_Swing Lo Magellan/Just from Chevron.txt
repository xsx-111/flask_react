Just from Chevron LyricsWhere she collapses into the shore
Pump her like product and, ask her for more
There a man lay dying in ice
Gasket had busted and
Pinned him like a vice
As the sun sank into repose
A friend knelt and
Listened to his dying words as he froze:
"Tell my love don't mourn too intense
I'm going down to her great good expense
Now all the air is quiet and still
Wish I was back home on that knell in the hill
Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Wherever the people will drive
That's where I will survive
All of my friends, my enemies too
Live in the shadows of the dirtiest fuel
Burns the land and its people to ruin
While wind's always whistlin' an infinite tune
Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Wherever the people will drive
I swear I will be live
Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Wherever the people will drive
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live"
"Now so long," he whispered so faint
Closing his eyelids with his face turning grey
When the workers cleaned up the spill
Sent the man home to his knell in the hillEmbed
