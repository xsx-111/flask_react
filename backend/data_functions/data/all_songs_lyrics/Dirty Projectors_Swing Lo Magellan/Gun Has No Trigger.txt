Gun Has No Trigger Lyrics
If you had looked, you might have just seen them
Strut in the background
You'd see the oceans swirl
And the mountains shook
You'd see a million colors
If you really looked

Now, quick the night draws near
Her curtain spreads quicker
The safety's off
But the gun has no trigger

If you had looked, you'd be no one's coward
Distance, justice, power
You'd glimpse the password
You wouldn't need the book
You'd own both slave and master
If you just had looked

But now the banks all closed
And nothing gets bigger
The crowd will yell
But the gun has no trigger
If you had looked, you might reconsider
Or just maybe you already have
They watch you sleeping
You watch their garbage cook
You'd weep a bowl of tears
If you had looked

But now the gate comes down
The pangs are growing dimmer
You hold a gun to your head
But the gun has no trigger3Embed
