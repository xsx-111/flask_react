Unto Caesar LyricsAccident or intention
It's already history
Random or intelligent
The mute march into victory
Innocent or innocent enough to say
"I did what I did, I did what I did only"
Render unto Caesar
Scrawled and all illegible
You kept yourself hidden well
Sprawling and inflexible
The world asked you for nothing else
So and forward, lifelong in the gentle breeze
Moral as a leaf, to fall and to decease, you
Render unto Caesar
("When should we bust into harmony?")
Where the grayscale conjurers (flip it)
Where the lifelike perjurers (write it)
Where the vested spectators (watch it)
Where the weapon chancellor (gun it)
Where the twilight mandolin (play it)
Where the high custodian (mop it)
Where the panic violent (panic)
Where the crabby handmaiden is (scrub it)
Down the line, down the mercenary barbary
Down the line, dead the martyrs' morbid poetry
("What are we singing?")
("Uh, that doesn't make any sense what you just said. Hey, can youâ€”")
Down the rampart, the vandals given to defeat
And down the landscape
The lineman plastered for a, for a, for a week
Render unto Caesar
Render unto CaesarEmbed
