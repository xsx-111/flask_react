Impregnable Question Lyrics
If there is ever the impregnable question
Of why what did or didn't pass
It would help to seek
Comfort in destiny
But I really don't --
We don't see eye to eye
But I need you
And you're always on my mind

Whether there is or isn't any position
You care if I take or I don't
I will always hope
What we shared so long
To be the only love
And though we don't see eye to eye
I need you
And you're always on my mind

Through time and through many a situation
We both look forward side-by-side
We have shared it all
We have both stood tall
What is mine is yours, in happiness and in strife
You're my love
And I want you in my life4Embed
