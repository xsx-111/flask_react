 Lyrics
People standing in line to look at pre-made sandwiches
People standing in line to get high to bad bitches
People standing in line to smoke weed that's green tea
People standing in line for two rails of OxiClean
People standing in line to nuke themselves with ketamine
It's artisan raw and gluten free
Probiotic superfood antioxidant low-MSG
Non-GMO locally sourced quinoa and chia seeds
Jojoba and baobab dog treats
Hand made with wild goji berries
Agave, acai and activated whey protein
People standing in line to buy whatever the McFuck
they might want to shove down their foodpipes tonight
New watch in black gold
New shirt that looks old
Big dick and no soul
New pants with four holes
Old phones in one drawer
Five dry pens, something from a Kinder egg
And everything you didn't know you were looking for
People complaining 'cause their Mum whines
People complaining about losing their minds
People complaining about standing in line
People standing in line and they don't even know why4Embed
