Cane Shuga Lyrics
Baby, don't go
I'll stop breathing coke
No more bloody nose
No more John Does

Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your—

Burn through my love
Just like your drugs
I've had quite enough
Or lack thereof

Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your—
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong—

Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your—9Embed
