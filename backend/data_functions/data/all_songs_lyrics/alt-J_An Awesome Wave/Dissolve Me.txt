Dissolve Me Lyrics
Now dissolve me
Two tabs on your tongue
A herd of shepherds to herd the sheep
Sleep now, my only one
Broken sweethearts, ah
Who sleep apart
Both still pine for the other's side spine
Spoon as sleep starts

And pulse to pulse
Now, shush

She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
To calm me down

I am see-through
Soap sliver, you're so thin
As I begin rubbing lathers out
Your state worsens on my skin
And gold
Fatless finger to lip
One-two, three-four, hush
And pulse to pulse
Now, shush

She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
To calm me down
She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
I'm tired now

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north sea16Embed
