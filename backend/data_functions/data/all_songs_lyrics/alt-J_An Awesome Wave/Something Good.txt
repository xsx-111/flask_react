Something Good Lyrics
Something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now

Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport

But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now

Forty-eight thousand seats
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I'm fully clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view

Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport
Forty-eight thousand seats
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I am clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view

But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now32Embed
