Bloodflood Lyrics
Good morning, flood of blood
Good morning, everyone

C
O-double
M-O-N

A wave, an awesome wave
That rushes skin and widens in flooded veins
Breathe in, exhale
I've poked a nerve; he'll slap me like a whale

Slaps the C
O-double
M-O-N

Tide out, tide in
A flood of blood to the heart and the fear slipstreams
Breathe in, exhale
I've poked a nerve; he'll slap me like a whale
Slaps the C
O-double
M-O-N

(C-O-Double M-O-N)
Flood, flood, flood
Flood of blood, blood, blood
To the heart, heart, heart
To the heart, heart, heart, heart
Flood, flood, flood
Flood of blood, blood, blood
To the heart, heart, heart
To the heart, heart, heart, heart
(C-O-Double M-O-N)
Flood, flood, flood
Flood of blood, blood, blood
To the heart, heart, heart
To the heart, heart, heart, heart
Flood, flood, flood
Flood of blood, blood, blood
To the heart, heart, heart
To the heart, heart, heart, heart28Embed
