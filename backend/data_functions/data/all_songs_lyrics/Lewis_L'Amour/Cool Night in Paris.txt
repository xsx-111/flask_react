Cool Night in Paris LyricsI seen you walking down the Paris street
Look at the ??? cooly sweet
I must've sighed right out loud
You turned around and smiled at me
It is a cool night in Paris
I'm in low tide and moonlight
Follow her til I'm here and dry
I don't know if Mary has a mint
Here alone as you
Only a cool night in Paris
I seen you walking down the Paris street
Look at the ??? cooly sweet
I must've sighed right out loud
You turned around and smiled at me
Only a cool night in ParisEmbed
