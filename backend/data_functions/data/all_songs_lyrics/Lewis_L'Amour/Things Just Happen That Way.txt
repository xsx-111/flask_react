Things Just Happen That Way LyricsMet a lady
In the south of France
Said her name was ???
I took her hand
She took my heart
Things just happen that way
Sat down in Paris
Sat down in Liverpool
Sat down in New York 
I bought her clothes
I bought her a rose
We run naked on the shores
And the plane it flew
After the moon 
And I still wait for you to fly
But boy is it cruel to be me
And girl is it cruel to be a lady, oh yeah
Always a rain in my heart
My heartEmbed
