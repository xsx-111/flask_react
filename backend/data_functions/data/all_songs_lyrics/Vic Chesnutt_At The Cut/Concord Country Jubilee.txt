Concord Country Jubilee LyricsI stumbled so innocently
Over all the obscene boundaries
Still I might've procured the act
Of Concord Country Jubilee
And the perfect order fill in the street
It is there I scraped it clean
I was stumbling in
It was gonna be hard to heal
Crowd browsed in
Callous toward the injury
Still I rode the kidney tray
At the Concord Country Jubilee
And the evidence is aimed on me
I screamed
And the girl, she kissed his tongue
He touched her stuffed meat
Her stuffed meat, her stuffed meatEmbed
