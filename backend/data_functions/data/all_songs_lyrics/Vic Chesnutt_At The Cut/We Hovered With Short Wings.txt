We Hovered With Short Wings LyricsAbout your reef
Over the hillock crest
A breath like aviation
Glowing, showing bones
Glowing, showing bones
With much bellowing and rowing
A cello directioning will let you out
Deaf and loud, let you out
A hungry, hungry awful hunter
A breath, his came asunder
The old dog makes padded cake
As the aged come for me
As the aged come for meEmbed
