When The Bottom Fell Out LyricsWhen the bottom fell out, there wasn't any doubt
I just suddenly found myself free falling
And from such a height, the wind, it had a bite
And it took all my might to fight the fright
But flailing spread-eagled
Must've formed an airfoil or some kind of wing
And I gained some equilibrium
And caught myself gliding
When the bottom fell out, observers heard me shout
So long, it's been good to know you
But when I finally smash into that verdant grass
I will say it's been pretty great goingEmbed
