Granny Lyrics
Granny, oh Granny, what ya doin' by the kitchen sink?
She said, "I'm just makin' up some Pimento cheese"
She said, "I'm just makin' up some Pimento cheese"
She said, "I'm just makin' up some Pimento cheese"
Granny, oh Granny, what ya doin' with your false teeth?
She said, "I'm just pickin' out the blackberry seeds"
She said, "I'm just pickin' out the blackberry seeds"
She said, "I'm just pickin' out the blackberry seeds"
Granny, oh Granny
Where did your husband, my granddaddy go?
Where did your husband, my granddaddy go?
She said, "He went off to heaven just before you were born"
She said, "He went off to heaven just before you were born"
She said, "He went off to heaven just before you were born"
She said
"You are the light of my life and the beat of my heart"
She said
"You are the light of my life and the beat of my heart"
She said
"You are the light of my life and the beat of my heart"
She said
"You are the light of my life and the beat of my heart"Embed
