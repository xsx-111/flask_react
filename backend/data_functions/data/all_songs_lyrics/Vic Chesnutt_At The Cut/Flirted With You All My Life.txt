Flirted With You All My Life LyricsI am a man
I am self-aware
And everywhere I go
You're always right there with me
I flirted with you all my life
Even kissed you once or twice
And to this day I swear it was nice
But, clearly, I was not ready
When you touched a friend of mine
I thought I would lose my mind
But I found out with time
That, really, I was not ready (No, no)
Oh death, oh death
Oh death, really, I'm not ready
Oh death, you hector me
And decimate those dear to me
You tease me with your sweet relief
You are cruel and you are constant
When my mom was cancer sick
She fought but then succumbed to it
But you made her beg for it
"Lord Jesus, please, I'm ready"
Oh death, oh death
Oh death, really, I'm not ready (No, no)
Oh death, oh death
Oh death, clearly, I am not ready (No, no)2Embed
