Chinaberry Tree LyricsMe with a machete
Going at the chinaberry tree
All the key players are watching me
Through their simian groove thing
Sweat slinging
Blood slickening
Life ever-loosening grill
Chinaberry tree
Chinaberry tree
Chinaberry tree
The biggest chinaberry tree
That I've ever seen
Sawdust in the air
And on the ground everywhere
Throwing myself at the cut
With a force heretofore unknown to me
Chinaberry tree
Chinaberry tree
Chinaberry tree
Chinaberry tree
Chinaberry tree
Chinaberry tree
Neatest chinaberry tree
That has ever beenEmbed
