Philip Guston LyricsThe hand, the hand
The hand, the hand
The hand, the hand
Thoughts of another finger
Typing down into a cellar
The line, the line
The line, the line
The line, the line
The line, the line
The line, the line
The line, the line
The line, the line
The line, the line
A fame A fame A fame for nothing
Pile, pile of cherries
And oh, I shouldn't think
Like gravity
Bad habits
Bad habits
Bad habits
Bad habitsEmbed
