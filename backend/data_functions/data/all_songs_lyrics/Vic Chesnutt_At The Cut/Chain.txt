Chain LyricsChain, chain
Every gesture, every frame
Chain, chain
Chain, chain
Empty hours, out of phase
Chain
Anecdotal evidence synergize with common sense
Collective carnal consciousness
Strains the bulging silt fences
Visionary's blind ambition, unintended consequences
Chain, chain
Every shadow, every face
Chain
Chain, chain
Every dollar ain't the sameEmbed
