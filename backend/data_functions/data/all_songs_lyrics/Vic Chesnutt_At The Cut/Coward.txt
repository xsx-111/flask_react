Coward LyricsThe courage of the coward
Is greater than all others
A scaredy-cat'll scratch you
If you back 'im in a corner
But I ,I ,I, I am a coward
I, I, I am a coward
Courage born of despair and impotence
Submissive dogs can
Lash out in fear and be
Very, very dangerous
But I ,I ,I, I am a coward
I, I, I am a cowardEmbed
