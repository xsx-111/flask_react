Tomorrow Lyrics
Oh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow
Holding hands, we both abandon sorrow
Oh, for a chance to get away tomorrow

Hey, baby's got a lazy day on Sunday
Here's a pound, we hang around 'till Monday
Oh, baby don't you let me down on Sunday

Bring a bag of bread and cheese
And find a shady spot beneath the trees
Catch a breath of country air
And run your pretty fingers through my hair
Tomorrow, when we both abandon sorrow

Oh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow
Through the week we beg and steal and borrow
Oh, for a chance to get away tomorrow

Honey, pray for sunny skies so I can speak to rainbows in your eyes
Let's just hope the weather man is feeling fine and doesn't spoil our plan
Tomorrow, when we both abandon sorrow
Oh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow
Holding hands we both abandon sorrow
Oh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow

Oh, for a chance to get away tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Hey, don't let me down
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let, let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrowEmbed
