I Am Your Singer Lyrics
You are my love, you are my song, linger on
You are my song, I am your singer
You are my one, you are my own melody
You are my song, I am your singer

Someday when we're singing
We will fly away, going winging
Sing, singing my love song to you
Someday when we're singing
We will fly away, going winging
Sing, singing my love song to you

My song is sung
When day is done harmonies will linger on
I am your singer
I am your singer
Singing my love song to youEmbed
