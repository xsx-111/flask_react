Wild Life Lyrics
The world "wild" applies to the words "you" and "me"

While taking a walk through an African park one day
I saw a sign say, "The animals have the right of way"

Wild life, whatever happened to
Wild life, the animals in the zoo?

You're breathing so hot
A lot of political nonsense in the air
You're making it hard
For the people who live in there
You're moving so fast
But, baby, you know not where

Wild life (wild life)
What's going to happen to
Wild life (wild life)
The animals in the zoo?

You'd better stop
There's animals everywhere
And man is the top, an animal too
And, man, you just gotta care
Wild life (wild life)
What's going to happen to
Wild life (wild life)
The animals in the zoo?

You're breathing a lot
Of political nonsense in the air
You're making it hard
For the people who live in there

Wild life (wild life)
What's going to happen to (whatever happened to, whatever happened to)
Wild life (wild life)
The animals in the zoo? (Whatever happened to, whatever happened to)
(Wild life
Whatever happened to, whatever happened to
Wild life
Whatever happened to, whatever happened to)
Ah, la-la-ah (wild life)
Whatever happened to (Whatever happened to, whatever happened to)
Ah, ah, ah (wild life)
The animals in the zoo? (Whatever happened to, whatever happened to)
Woo, woo
Wild life (wild life)
Whatever happened to (whatever happened to, whatever happened to)
Wild life (wild life)
Whatever happened to (whatever happened to, whatever happened to)
Woo, woo
(Wild life
Whatever happened to, whatever happened to
Wild life
Whatever happened to, whatever happened to
Wild life
Whatever happened to, whatever happened to
Wild life
Whatever happened to, whatever happened to
Wild life
Whatever happened to, whatever happened to)2Embed
