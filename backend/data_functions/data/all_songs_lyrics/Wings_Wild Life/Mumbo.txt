Mumbo Lyrics
Take it, Tony!

Well, your love in my mind
My woman, I’m breakin’
And, my minds’ gotta take
No wrong doesn’t break ya

Ooh, when I'm feeling alright
Ooh, when I'm feeling alright
Ooh, when I'm feeling alright
Ooh, when I lose it, alright
Well, my mind is in love
My Mumbo will break ya
And our love hasn’t made
The Mumbo will break ya
Ooh, when I'm feeling alright
Ooh, when I'm feeling alright
I don’t see any number
I don’t see an old lady
Ooh, when I'm feeling alright
Ooh, when I'm feeling alright
I am keepin’ a layer
Come, I made it alright. Eheh. Eheh
Ah. Yeah. Yeah
I don’t beat a drumplayer
But I made alright
I am keepin’ a layer
Come, I made it alright. Eheh. Eheh
Eheh. Eheh. Eheh. Eheh
Oooh, come on see, I’m a player. Come on, feel it I play. We’re not feeling a play out. No one think of a way. Ooh
Well! Lady on my mind, I think I should make love. Well, my mind hasn’t made all up, can’t go to maintenance
Ooh, you don’t seem to me, you don’t seem to me, get any maintenance
Well, on my mind, my Mumbo will make you. Well, down in my mind, my Mumbo will break you
Ooh, come on, keep it on playin’. You just keep it on playin’. You just keep it on, playin’. Ooh. You just beat them all. Aaah
