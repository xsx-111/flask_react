Bip Bop Lyrics
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam

Take your bottom dollar, hold it in your hand (and you go)
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Why'd you hide your handbag underneath the stand? (and you go)
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam

Wim wop, wim and wop
Wim wop, wim and wam
Wim wop, wim and wop
Wim wop, wim and wam

Why'd you hide your handbag underneath the stand? (and you go)
Wim wop, wim and wop
Wim wop, wim and wam
Put your hair in curlers, we're going to see a band
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam

Take your bottom dollar, hold it in your hand (and you go)
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Treat me like a good boy, treat me like a man (and you go)
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam

Wim wop, wim and wop
Wim wop, wim and wam
Wim wop, wim and wop
Wim wop, wim and wam

Why'd you hide your handbag underneath the stand?
Wim wop, wim and wop
Wim wop, wim and wam
Put your hair in curlers, we're going to see a band (and you go)
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam

Take your bottom dollar, hold it in your hand (and you go)
Bip bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bam
Take me hair in curlers, but treat me like a man (and you go)
Bip bop, bip bop, bop
Bip bop, bip bop, bamEmbed
