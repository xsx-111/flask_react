Love is Strange Lyrics
Baby, love is strange
Many, many people take it for a game
My sweet baby, love is strange
Yeah, yeah
Many many people, take it for a game
Yeah, yeah

Love is strange
Love is strange
Yeah, yeah
Many many people, take it for a game
Yeah, yeah
Love is strange
Love is strange

Many people, they don't understand
They think that having love is like having money in the hand
My sweet baby, love is strange
Many, many people seem to take it for a game
Now let me hear you sing it!

La, la, la, la, la, la
Love is strange
Yes it is, I don't need you to prove it to me
La, la, la, la, la, la
Love is strange
So many people seem to take it for
La, la, la, la, la, la / A game!
Yeah, love is strange
Said, said it is, show me
La, la, la, la, la, la
Love is strange
Oh baby, baby, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la
Love is strange
Yeah, yeah / Keep singin', keep singin' now
La
