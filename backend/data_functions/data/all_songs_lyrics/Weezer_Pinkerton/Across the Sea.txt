Across the Sea Lyrics
You are eighteen year-old girl who live in small city of Japan
You heard me on the radio about one year ago and you wanted to know
All about me and my hobbies
My favorite food and my birthday

Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter, you've got my song

They don't make stationery like this where I'm from
So fragile, so refined
So I sniff (So I sniff)
And I lick (And I lick)
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time (Your envelope and fall to)
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea

Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter, you've got my song
At ten, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
I thought the older women would like me if I did
You see, ma, I'm a good little boy (Good little boy)
It's all your fault, mama, it's all your fault (It's all your fault)

Goddamn, this business is really lame
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send (So you send)
Me your love (Me your love)
From all around the world (From all around the world)
As if I could live on
Words and dreams and a million screams
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel

Why are you so far away from me?
Why are you so far away from me?
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter, you've got my song
(I've got your letter) I've got your letter, you've got my song10Embed
