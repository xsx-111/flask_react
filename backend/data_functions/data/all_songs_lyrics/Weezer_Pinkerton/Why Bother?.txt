Why Bother? Lyrics
I know I should get next to you
You got a look that made me think you're cool
But it's just sexual attraction
Not somethin' real, so I'd rather keep wackin'

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore

I've known a lot of girls before
What's the harm in knowin' one more?
Maybe we could even get together
Maybe you could break my heart next summer

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore

It's a crying shame I'm all alone
Not with you, nor her, nor anyone
Won't you knock me on my head?
Crack it open, let me outta here
Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore

(Why bother?) Why bother?
(It's gonna hurt me) It's gonna hurt me
(It's gonna kill when) Why bother?
(You desert me) It's gonna hurt me
(Why bother?) Why bother?
(It's gonna hurt me) It's gonna hurt me
Why bother? It's gonna hurt me7Embed
