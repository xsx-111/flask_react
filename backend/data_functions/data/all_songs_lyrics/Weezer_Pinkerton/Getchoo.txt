Getchoo Lyrics
This is beginning to hurt
This is beginning to be serious
It used to be a game, now it's a cryin' shame
'Cause you don't wanna play around no more

Sometimes I push too hard
Sometimes you fall and skin your knee
I never meant to do all that I've done to you
Please, baby, say it's not too late

To getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo
Uh-huh
Oh-ho

You know this is breakin' me up
You think that I'm some kind of freak, uh-huh
But if you'd come back to me then you would surely see
That I'm just foolin' around
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo

I can't believe (I can't believe)
What you've done to me
What I did to them (What I did to them)
You've done to me, oh

Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo
Uh-huh

(This is beginning to hurt) Oh-ho
(This is beginning to hurt) Oh-ho
(This is beginning to hurt) Oh-ho-ho-ho
(This is beginning to hurt) Oh3Embed
