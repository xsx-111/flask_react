Tired of Sex Lyrics
I'm tired, so tired
I'm tired of having sex (So tired)
I'm spread so thin
I don't know who I am (Who I am)
Oh

Monday night, I'm makin' Jen
Tuesday night, I'm makin' Lyn
Wednesday night, I'm makin' Catherine
Oh, why can't I be makin' love come true?

Oh
Oh

I'm beat, beet red
Ashamed of what I said (What I said)
Oh
I'm sorry, here I go
I know I'm a sinner but I can't say no (Say no)
Oh

Thursday night, I'm makin' Denise
Friday night, I'm makin' Sharise
Saturday night, I'm makin' Louise
Oh, why can't I be makin' love come true?
(What's a guy to do?)
Oh, tonight, I'm down on my knees
Tonight, I'm begging you please
Tonight, tonight, please
Oh, why can't I be makin' love come true?10Embed
