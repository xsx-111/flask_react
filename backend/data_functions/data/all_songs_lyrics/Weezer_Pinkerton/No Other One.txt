No Other One Lyrics
My girl's a liar
But I'll stand beside her
She's all I've got
And I don't wanna be alone
My girl don't see me
When she's with my friends
She's all I've got
And I don't wanna be alone

No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I can't have any other one
Though I would, now I never could with one

All of the drugs she does
Scare me real good
She's got a tattoo and two pet snakes
Nobody knows me like her
Nobody knows her like me
We're all we've got
And we don't wanna be alone

No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I can't have any other one
Though I would, now I never could with one
No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I won't have any other one
Though I would, now I never could with one9Embed
