Slave To The Wage Lyrics
Runaway from all your boredom
Runaway from all your whoredom
And wave your worries and cares goodbye

All it takes is one decision
A lot of guts, a little vision
To wave your worries and cares goodbye

It's a maze for rats to try
It's a maze for rats to try
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die

Sick and tired of Maggie's farm
She's a bitch with broken arms
To wave your worries and cares goodbye

It's a maze for rats to try
It's a maze for rats to try
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race, a race for rats
A race for rats to die

Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away3Embed
