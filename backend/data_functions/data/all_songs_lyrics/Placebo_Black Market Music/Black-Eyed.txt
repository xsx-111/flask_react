Black-Eyed LyricsI was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline and schizo
And guaranteed to cause a fuss
I was never loyal
Except to my own pleasure zone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home
I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline bipolar
Forever biting on your nuts
I was never grateful
That's why I spent my days alone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home
Broken home
Black-eyed (X8)
I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline and schizo
And guaranteed to cause a fuss
I was never loyal
Except to my own pleasure zone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home
Broken home
