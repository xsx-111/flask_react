Haemoglobin Lyrics
I was hanging from a tree
Unaccustomed to such violence
Jesus looking down on me
I'm prepared for one big silence

How'd I ever end up here?
Must be through some lack of kindness
And it seemed to dawn on me
Haemoglobin is the key

Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat

At the time they cut me free
I was brimming with defiance
Doctors looking down on me
Breaking every law of science

How'd I ever end up here?
Reaching strain of color blindness
Then it seemed to dawn on me
Haemoglobin is the key
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat

Now my feet don't touch the ground
Now my feet don't touch the ground, go
Now my feet don't touch the ground
Now my feet don't touch the ground

As they drag me to my feet
I was filled with incoherence
Theories of conspiracy
The whole world wants my disappearance

I'll go fighting nail and teeth
You've never seen such perseverance
Gonna make you scared of me
'Cause haemoglobin is the key
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat
Haemoglobin is the key
To a healthy heartbeat

Now my feet don't touch the ground
Now my feet don't touch the ground, go
Now my feet don't touch the ground
Now my feet don't touch the ground, go
Now my feet don't touch the ground
Now my feet don't touch the ground, go
Now my feet don't touch the ground
Now my feet don't touch the groundEmbed
