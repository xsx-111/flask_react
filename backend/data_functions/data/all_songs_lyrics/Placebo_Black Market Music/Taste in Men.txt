Taste in Men LyricsCome back to me a while
Change your style again
Come back to me a while
Change your taste in men
It's been this way since Christmas Day
Dazzled, doused in gin
Change your taste in men
Come back to me a while
Change your style again
Come back to me a while
Change your taste in men
I'm killing time on Valentine's
Waiting for the day to end
Change your taste in men
Come back to me a while
Change your style again
Come back to me a while
Change your taste in men
It's been this way since Christmas Day
Dazzled, doused in gin
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men
Change your taste in men3Embed
