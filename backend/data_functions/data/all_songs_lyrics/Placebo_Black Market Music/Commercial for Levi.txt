Commercial for Levi LyricsYou're the one who's always choking Trojan
You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Sleep may be the enemy
But so's another line
It's a remedy
You should take more time
You're the one who's always choking Trojan
You're the one who showers always golden
Spunk and bestiality well it's an Assisi lie
It's ahead of me
You should close your fly
I understand the fascination
The dream that comes alive at night
But if you don't change your situation
Then you'll die, you'll die, don't die, don't die
Please don't die
You're the one who's always choking Trojan
You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Drunk on immorality
Valium and cherry wine
Coke and ecstasy
You're gonna blow your mind
I understand the fascination
I've even been there once or twice or more
But if you don't change your situation
Then you'll die, you'll die, don't die, don't die
Please don't die2Embed
