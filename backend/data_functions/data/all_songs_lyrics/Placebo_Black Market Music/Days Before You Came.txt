Days Before You Came Lyrics
Days before you came
Freezing cold and empty
Towns that change their name
And a horn of plenty
Days before you came
Counting breaths inside me
Even crack cocaine
Couldn't start to hide me

Won't you join me now
Baby's looking torn and frayed
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade
Won't you join me now
Baby's looking to get laid
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade

Days before you came
It always seemed enticing
To be naked and profane
There is no denying
Days before you came
Thunderbolts and lightning
Each day a brand new vein
Each tourniquet colliding
Didn't want you anyway
Didn't want you anyway
Didn't want you anyway
Didn't want you anyway

Won't you join me now
Baby's looking torn and frayed
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade
Won't you join me now
Baby's looking to get laid
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade

Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you
Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you
Didn't want you anyway
Didn't want you anyway
Didn't want you anyway
Didn't want you anyway2Embed
