Special K Lyrics
Coming up beyond belief
On this coronary thief
More than just the leitmotif
More chaotic, no relief
I'll describe the way I feel
Weeping wounds that never heal
Can the savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around
I'll describe the way I feel
You're my new Achilles' heel
Can the savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
Gravity
Gravity
