Blue American Lyrics
I wrote this novel just for you
It sounds pretentious but it's true
I wrote this novel just for you
That's why it's vulgar
That's why it's blue
And I say, "Thank you"
I say, "Thank you"

I wrote this novel just for mom
For all the mommy things she's done
For all the times she showed me wrong
For all the time she sang God's song
And I say, "Thank you mom"
"Hello mom"
"Thank you mom"
"Hi mom"

I read a book about Uncle Tom
Where a whitey bastard made a bomb
But now Ebonics rule our song
Those motherfuckers got it wrong
And I ask, "Who is Uncle Tom?
Who is Uncle Tom?
Who is Uncle Tom?"
You are
I read a book about the self
Said I should get expensive help
Go fix my head create some wealth
Put my neurosis on the shelf
But I don't care for myself
I don't care for myself
I don't care for myself
I don't care

I wrote this novel just for you
I'm so pretentious, yes it's true
I wrote this novel just for you
Just for you, just for youEmbed
