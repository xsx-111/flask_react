Passive Aggressive LyricsIt's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate
If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That God's in crisis
He's over
It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate
If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That God's in crisis
He's over

Every time I rise I see you
Falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space, find me space
It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate
If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That God's in crisis
He's over
Every time I rise I see you
Falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Every time I rise I see you
Falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
It falls apart
It falls apart
Falls apart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
It falls apart
It falls apart
Falls apart2Embed
