Black Market Blood Lyrics
Wasted face that swallowed time
With Armageddon crawling
She's insane, this friend of mine
And she's always bawling

Hear her calling
Hear her calling you
Hear her calling
Hear her calling you

There's a place within her mind
With rains already falling
She's insane, this friend of mine
And she's always bawling

Hear her calling
Hear her calling you
Hear her calling
Hear her calling you

She's preparing for the flood
The deluge and the sliding mud
She's preparing for the flood
Running on black market blood
Black market blood
Wasted face that swallowed time
With Armageddon crawling
She's insane, this friend of mine
And she's always bawling

Hear her calling
Hear her calling you
Hear her calling
Hear her calling you

She's preparing for the flood
The deluge and the sliding mud
She's preparing for the flood
Running on black market blood
Black market blood
Black market blood
Black market blood
