Peeping Tom Lyrics
I'm careful not to fall have to climb your wall
'Cause you're the one who makes me feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping Tom on my own for far too long
Problems with the booze nothing left to lose

I'm weightless, I'm bare
I'm faithless, I'm scared

The face that fills the hole that stole my broken soul
The one that makes me seem to feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping Tom on my own for far too long
Troubles with the gear nothing left to fear

I'm weightless, I'm bare
I'm faithless, I'm scared
I'm weightless, I'm bare
I'm faithless, I'm scared

With every bet I lost and every trick I tossed
You're still the one who makes me feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping Tom on my own for far too long
Problems with the booze nothing left to lose
I'm weightless, I'm bare
I'm faithless, I'm scared
I'm weightless, I'm bare
I'm faithless, I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared1Embed
