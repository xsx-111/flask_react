Spite & Malice Lyrics
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets

Aces take your time
Queens are left for dead
Jacks can stand in line
And touch themselves instead
Aces take your pity
And keep it warm in bed
Aces take your time

Cut the deck, the queen's left for dead
Soft and wet, scarf tied to the bed
Jack is all tragic when he stands alone
Feeling demonic, harmonic, and in a no-go-zone
You look well suited like you came to win
Lust, spite and malice, your degrees of sin
Cruising for pity and looking pretty as fuck
Ace take your chance, queen wish you luck

Aces take your time
Draw your final breath
Jacks are feeling fine
They've clubbed themselves to death
Aces take your pity
And sleep with it instead
Aces take your time
You can play your card, I'll hold onto mine
Tied up in the reasons, ace take your time
Looks turn to lovers, flames into fires
Jack loves his tragedy, queen her desires
You look well suited like you came to win
Lust, spite and malice, your degrees of sin
Wrap me in your trauma and I may just give you mine
Queen take your chances, ace take your time

Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Everything will blow
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Tonight
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Neither friend nor foe
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Tonight
Take yor time

Cut the deck, the queen's left for dead
Soft and wet, scarf tied to the bed
Jack is all tragic when he stands alone
Feeling demonic, harmonic, and in a no-go-zone
You look well suited like you came to win
Lust, spite and malice your degrees of sin
Cruising for pity and looking pretty as fuck
Ace take your chance, queen wish you luck
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Everything will blow
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Tonight
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Neither friend nor foe
Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets
Tonight

Revolution
Dope, guns, fucking in the streets1Embed
