Narcoleptic Lyrics
Slip and stumble at my first offenses
It's not treason, it's no lie
You talk in paragraphs, I write my sentence
It's not treason, it's no lie

It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream

Crush and crumble under your defenses
It's not treason, it's no lie
You frame the photograph, I sit on fences
Change of season, love can die

It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream

If we tear out the tumor
It's later, never sooner
If we tear out the tumor
It's later, never sooner
It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream

You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream

You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
