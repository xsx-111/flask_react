Deep Sea Diving Suit LyricsYou didn't have to say that I'm no good
Cause I know
There's no point pointing pistols at me now
I'll just go
I never should have asked you to be kind
But I'm slow
And I'm sorry, but how can I get to you
Stuck in my fifty-pound lead boots
Stuck in my deep sea diving suit
I never thought you'd turn on me cause you're
My best friend
You say I never offered you a thing
In the end
And now you wouldn't trust me with a
Grain of sand
And I'm sorry, but how can I get to you
Stuck in my fifty-pound lead boots
Stuck in my deep sea diving suit
And I'm sorry, but how can I get to you
Stuck in my fifty-pound lead boots
Stuck in my deep sea diving suitEmbed
