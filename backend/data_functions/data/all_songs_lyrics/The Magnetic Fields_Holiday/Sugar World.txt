Sugar World Lyrics
Please forgive me
For all the things I've done
Sugar, give me
The love I need to carry on
Living, living
Without you, I'd just die
With you, with you
I can hold my head up high
And tell the crowd that I'm so proud
It makes me want to cry

Sugar World, of you (To me you're champagne or ruhr wine)
Sugar World, what can I do? (Will you make up your mind)
Sugar World, you're so sweet (You're lemon or you're lime)
You're a Sugar World to me (You're pecan or praline)
(You're sky bar or cloud nine)

Sugar save me
Come on, save me from myself
Enslave me
I never wanted anything else
Looking, looking
Into your candy eyes
Talking, talking
About the day when I
Can make a vow, but that's not now
It makes me want to cry
   
Sugar World, of you (To me you're champagne or ruhr wine)
Sugar World, what can I do? (Will you make up your mind)
Sugar World, you're so sweet (You're lemon or you're lime)
You're a Sugar World to me (You're pecan or praline)
(You're sky bar or cloud nine)
Sugar World, of you (To me you're champagne or ruhr wine)
Sugar World, what can I do? (Will you make up your mind)
Sugar World, you're so sweet (You're lemon or you're lime)
You're a Sugar World to me (You're pecan or praline)
(You're sky bar or cloud nine)Embed
