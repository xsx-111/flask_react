High Road Lyrics
You let the wind take us down
You let the storm come and wipe us out
I saw the fog snuff you out
I saw the ocean come take you under

I have my boots stuck in your mouth
I'll have you screaming for your last breath, yeah
I'll shove them both deep inside
Patiently waiting for deep devour
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below
You are the one who nobody likes
You are the plague that was brought here by rats
I'd like to hunt you, that's fact
Watching you fade out and never go back
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below5Embed
