Ember City Lyrics
You walk with boundless grace
Think old thoughts from yesterday
All being lost in the fire
You wandered and lost the way
Someone's always left behind
When the door of life closes

And you were slipping away
What do I say to you
What do I say to you
And if I want you to stay
What do I say to you?
What do I say to you?

This moment I take for you
Think of all we didn't do
All seeking answers from this
Hope to come out alive
Standing still my hands are tied
Our eyes open up to the sky

And you were slipping away
What do I say to you
What do I say to you
And if I want you to stay
What do I say to you?
What do I say to you?

And you were slipping away
What do I say to you
What do I say to you
And if I want you to stay
What do I say to you?
What do I say to you?Embed
