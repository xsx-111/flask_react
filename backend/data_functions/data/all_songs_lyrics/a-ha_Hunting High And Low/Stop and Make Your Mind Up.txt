Stop and Make Your Mind Up Lyrics
We have no help
You know that
All by ourselves
We have come this far

Now stop and make your mind up about me
Stop and make your mind up about me, baby
Stop and make your mind up about me, yeah
Stop and make your mind up

Beer goes to my head
I want you
Come back to bed
We have come this far

Now stop and make your mind up about me
Stop and make your mind up about me, baby
Stop and make your mind up about me, yeah
Stop and make your mind up
Yeah, I want you near me
So stop and make your mind up about me, baby
Stop and make your mind up about me, yeah
Stop and make your mind up about me, baby, oh, baby
Stop and make your mind up about me, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babyEmbed
