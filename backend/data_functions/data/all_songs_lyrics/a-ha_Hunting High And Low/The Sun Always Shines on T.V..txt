The Sun Always Shines on T.V. Lyrics
Touch me, how can it be?
Believe me the sun always shines on TV
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me, to me

I reached inside myself and found
Nothing there to ease the pressure of my ever worrying mind
All my powers waste away
I fear the crazed and lonely looks the mirror's sending me these days

Touch me, how can it be?
Believe me the sun always shines on TV
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me, to me

Please don't ask me to defend
The shameful lowlands of the way I'm drifting gloomily through time
I reached inside myself today
Thinking there's got to be some way to keep my troubles distant

Touch me, how can it be?
Believe me the sun always shines on TV
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me, to me
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me
Your love to me8Embed
