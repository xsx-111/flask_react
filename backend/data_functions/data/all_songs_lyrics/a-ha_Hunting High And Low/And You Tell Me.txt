And You Tell Me Lyrics
Please don't hurt me, I have told you
All my love is all I've got
And tomorrow is the day
When I, for your sake, I'm coming back

And you tell me
That I don't love you

I'm trying hard to make you jealous
Trying harder to make you stay
Days are longer, nights are crazy
It's so strange when you're away

And you tell me
That I don't love you

Because I love you, I will show you
All the faces my love can hide
So, please
Let me come to you and stay this time
And you tell me
That I don't love you

Oh, you know
That it's just not trueEmbed
