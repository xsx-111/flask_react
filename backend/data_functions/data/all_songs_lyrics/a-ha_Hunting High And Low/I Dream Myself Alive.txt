I Dream Myself Alive LyricsDream myself alive
I dream myself alive
But you can't deny
There's something dark against the light
All I can say
It doesn't have to be this way
We'll be chasing our tails madly
See days pass like wildfire
Right from the start
I knew this world would break my heart
I dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
I dream myself alive
Break my heart and
Dream myself alive
What can it mean
I'm drawing pictures of the sea
Right from the start
I knew this girl would break my heart
Dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
I dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
I dream myself alive
Dream myself alive
Dream myself alive1Embed
