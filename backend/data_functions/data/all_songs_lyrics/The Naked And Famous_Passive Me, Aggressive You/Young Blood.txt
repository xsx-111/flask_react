Young Blood Lyrics
We're only young and naive still
We require certain skills
The mood it changes like the wind
Hard to control when it begins

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate
We lie beneath the stars at night
Our hands gripping each other tight
You keep my secrets hope to die
Promises, swear them to the sky

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
As it withers, brittle it shakes
Can you whisper, as it crumbles and breaks?
As you shiver, count up all your mistakes
Pair of forgivers, let go before it's too late
Can you whisper? Can you whisper?
Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Can you whisper?)
The bittersweet between my teeth
(Can you whisper?)
Trying to find the in-betweens
(Can you whisper?)
Fall back in love eventually
(Can you whisper?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah11Embed
