Frayed LyricsAll of my dreams
Tear at the seams
Frayed
All over the place
Thought it was good
Everything where it should be
Around me
All that depends
On where it ends
It ends
Did you pretend?
Or maybe not comprehend?
Procrastination baby
Are you agitated lately?
“Cut it up, it’s fucked” you say, it’s useless
Just a couple figures for the different uses
Here it comes: the sum of all excuses
Easier to stay, the old refuses

Spread it thin
Make it bend
Help me save him, make the ends
I got things to feed, to reimburse
And he’s sick, I’m alone and it’s getting worse
“Today, today” you say, it’s useless
Just a couple figures for the different uses
Here it comes the sum of all excuses
Where did you think I got these bruises?2Embed
