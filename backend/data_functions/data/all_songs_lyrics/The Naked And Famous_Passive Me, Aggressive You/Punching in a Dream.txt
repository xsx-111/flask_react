Punching in a Dream Lyrics
All the lights go down
As I crawl into the spaces
Fight, flight, or the screams
Life tearing at the seams

Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare

If it falls apart
I will surely wake it
Bright lights turn me green
This is worse than it seems

Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
They’ll get through, they’ll get you
In the place that you fear it the most
In the corner, where it’s warmer
In the face that you wish was a ghost

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare
Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare10Embed
