No Way Lyrics
When the daylight comes, do you feel it?
Leave your bag of bones underneath your bed
Everything is as it should be
I'm leaving now as I should be

No way, no way, no we're never going to talk about it
No way, no way, no we're never going to speak again
No way, no way, no we're never going to talk about it
No way, no way

When the night descends, are you sleeping?
All the things you've done come to haunt you
All that we can do is smile
It will be like this for a while

No way, no way, no we're never going to talk about it
No way, no way, no we're never going to speak again
No way, no way, no we're never going to talk about it
No way, no way

I'm not sorry
Hardest thing, losing
Letting go, oh, oh
Won't look back, no, oh
No way, no way, no way2Embed
