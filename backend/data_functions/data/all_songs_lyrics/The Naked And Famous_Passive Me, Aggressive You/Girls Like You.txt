Girls Like You Lyrics
Run, whirlwind run
Further and further away into the sun
In twenty minutes
Everyone will remember you when you're gone
And your heart is a stone
Buried underneath your pretty clothes
Don't you know people write songs
About girls like you?

What will you do when something stops you?
What will you say to the world?
What will you be when it all comes crashing
Down on you little girl?
What would you do if you lost your beauty?
How would you deal with the light?
How would you feel if nobody chased you?
What if it happened tonight?

How would you cope if the world decided to
Make you suffer for all that you're worth?
How could you dance if no-one was watching
And you couldn't even get off the floor?
What would you do if you couldn't even feel
Not even pitiful pain?
How would you deal with the empty decisions
Eating away at your days?

Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?
About girls like you
About girls like you
Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?
About girls like you
About girls like you

Everything you say is fire
All the claims you lay, you liar
Everything you say is fire
See it in the grey, you crier

Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?
About girls like you
Liar
About girls like you
Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?
Everything you say is fire
About girls like you
All the claims you lay you liar
About girls like you
Don't you know people write songs
Everything you say is fire
About girls like you?
See it in the grey you crier
About girls like you2Embed
