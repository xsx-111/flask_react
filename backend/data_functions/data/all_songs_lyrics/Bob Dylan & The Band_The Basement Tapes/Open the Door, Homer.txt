Open the Door, Homer Lyrics
Now, there’s a certain thing
That I learned from Jim
That he’d always make sure I’d understand
And that is that there’s a certain way
We all must swim
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land

Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
But I ain’t gonna hear it said no more

Now, there’s a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
That fella who never blushes
And that is that one must always
Flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes

Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
And I ain’t gonna hear it said no more
“Take care of all of your memories”
Said Nick
“For you cannot relive them
And remember when you’re out there
Trying to heal the sick
That you must always first forgive them”

Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
And I ain’t gonna hear it said no moreEmbed
