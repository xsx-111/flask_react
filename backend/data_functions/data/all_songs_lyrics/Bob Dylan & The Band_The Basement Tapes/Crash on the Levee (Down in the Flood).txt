Crash on the Levee (Down in the Flood) Lyrics
Crash on the levee, mama
Water's going to overflow
Swamp's going to rise
No boat's going to row
Now, you can train on down
To Williams Point
You can bust your feet
You can rock this joint

But oh mama, ain't you going to miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Now, don't you try an' move me
You're just going to lose
There's a crash on the levee
And, mama, you've been refused
Well, it's sugar for sugar
And salt for salt
If you go down in the flood
It's going to be your own fault

Oh mama, ain't you going to miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow
Well, that high tide's rising
Mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase
Mama, don't you make a sound
Now, it's king for king
Queen for queen
It's going to be the meanest flood
That anybody's seen

Oh mama, ain't you going to miss your best friend now?
Yes, you're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehowEmbed
