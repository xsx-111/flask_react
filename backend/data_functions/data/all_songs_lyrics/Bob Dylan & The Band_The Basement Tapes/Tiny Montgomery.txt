Tiny Montgomery Lyrics
Well you can tell ev’rybody down in ol’ Frisco
Tell ’em Tiny Montgomery says hello

Now ev’ry boy and girl’s gonna get their bang
’Cause Tiny Montgomery’s gonna shake that thing
Tell ev’rybody down in ol’ Frisco
That Tiny Montgomery’s comin’ down to say hello
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank
They’re all gonna take on down by the bounty bank
One bird book and a buzzard and a crow
Tell ’em all that Tiny’s gonna say hello

Scratch your dad, do that bird
Suck that pig and bring it on home
Pick that dream and lose that dough
Tell ’em all that Tiny says hello

Now he’s king of the drunks an’ he squeezes, too
Watch out, Lester, take it, Lou
Join the monks, the C.I.O
Tell ’em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello
Now grease that gig and play it blank
Go on out and gas that dog
Trick on in, flower that floor
Take it on down, begin to grow
Now play that low and pick it up
Take it on in in a bald cup
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe
Tell ’em all Montgomery says hello

Well you can tell ev’rybody down in ol’ Frisco
Tell ’em all that Montgomery says helloEmbed
