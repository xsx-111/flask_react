Richard Dick Richards LyricsRichard
Oh Richard Dick Richards
I love the shirts you wear
When you cum in your underwear
Richard
Richard Dick Richards
You've had your share of heartaches
Not with the girls
Oh they've thrown pearls at your feet
But you're better than the pearls
Dressed in leather
Clad in heat
You make all the teats swell
You may as well
Richard
Richard Dick Richards
You make the boys swell as well as the girls
Your fancy curls on your bulge
Uh huh ho
There's no one like you
RichardEmbed
