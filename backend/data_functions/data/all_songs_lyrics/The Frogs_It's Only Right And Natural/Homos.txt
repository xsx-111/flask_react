Homos LyricsOh mom, was always wondering why I was into sports
Oh mom, was always wondering why I was staying after school
I'm into sports mom and also I'm in the locker room with the boys
I'm in the shower and I drop the soap every time
Homos uh huh uh huh uh huh
Homos no one knows a homo like us
We love homos
Lesbians are cool
And straights are fools
Lesbians rule their scene
But the homos are the coolest of the cools
Homos uh huh uh huh uh huh
Homos
They never knock at my front door
They never ring on the phone
They always come through the window
Through the back door
Through the throat
Homos uh huh uh huh uh huh
