(Thank God I Died In) The Car Crash LyricsHello, how are you
I'm fine
I made it home okay
I'm glad you were concerned
My face didn't get too badly burned
In the car crash
But my thighs were lacerated heavily
The doctor took care of that though
Thank god it wasn't a female nurse
Thank god i died in the crash
My ghost came to haunt you in a flash
Oh the ghost of the man
From the candyland car crash
Oh the sash is falling down upon his breast
Oh he did his best to breathe
But he just couldn't
Oh they sucked on his lips
'Til his head turned blue
Then his ears turned purple
And the sun turned green
And the light went out of the moon
Car crash blues
Arriving dead in the morgue in the nude
Cold morning hours
Oh I didn't wear my best clothes to my death
Oh what will they think down at the parlor at best
What will they think
When they found i had 9 pairs of underwear onEmbed
