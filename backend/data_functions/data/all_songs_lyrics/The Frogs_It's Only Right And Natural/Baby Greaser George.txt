Baby Greaser George LyricsI'm grateful that the stroller came my way today
Oh, Mrs. Macrae driving the stroller
And look who's inside oh don't hide
Baby Greaser George
Oh, I got too close to the stroller
And put my thing down his mouth
And he parted his teeth, baby teeth
North and south brilliantly
Like Greaser George
Baby Greaser George
Took off with my left ball
Oh mother took off with the stroller too soon
And he swallowed it whole
Ah, did I ever tell you what Greaser George
Was dressed in that day?
Well Greaser George, he had on a leather outfit
Oh, three months or so
But boy could he ever suck
Greaser George, Greaser George
The three month old baby
Greaser GeorgeEmbed
