Rosy Jack World LyricsOh come on
Oh come on
Rosy Jack's World
You'll find the boys and girls 'round here
Uh huh yeah yeah
Rosy Jack world, everybody's in tears
Don't know why
I gave 'em all the love I got inside
Don't know why
Don't know why
They get all of my love
Rosy Jack World, come along
We're gonna sing such a happy song
Downstairs in the barn
Come on kids, join along
This is our world kids
Have fun while you can
Ah your mother didn't know
Where you were when I found you
Sorry 'bout that
Oh child don't cry again
'Cause Rosy Jack World
This is a place where you belong friend
Oh child, child, child don't cry
Child, child I'll tell you why
Rosy Jack man is down your pants
Rosy jack world
Oh Rosy Jack World
Oh Rosy Jack World
I'm your squirrel man
Don't you know about
Rosy Jack World
Rosy Jack World
He's an evil man
Painted up clown and you're evil as hell
Oh why don't you find yourself
A boy down inside
The wishing well
Wishing well
Oh Rosy Jack World
Rosy Jack World
Oh you like the boys more than the girls
In your Rosy Jack WorldEmbed
