Men (Come on Men) LyricsMy kind of town
My kind of gown to wear to bed
Oh town of gold
Ohhh everyone here is too old for sex
We're listening to our music
On the bed
Ohhh
If you're a man get over here
Women clear out
No fucking doubt about it
Men are right
To love me all night

Once there was a woman
With a man
They held Eden between the fingers of their hands
Fuck that like I told you in the other story
Men
Come on men
Men
Oh come on men
Oh don't be shy men
Oh look me in the eye men
Both of them were menEmbed
