Been a Month Since I Had a Man LyricsBeen a month since I had a man
Been a month since we had that dance
And you waved your flag at me
And I came running huh huh huh
Been a month since I had a man
Been a month since I had the sperm
Taken out of my pants
The laundry worked wonders
The laundry is best for these things
Been a month since I had a man
And somehow I give a damn
When I see you eyein' up other guys
Well I talked to mother about it
I can talk to mother
Well I talked to father about it
He says you're a faggot
Been a month since I had a man
Been a month since we did our dance
In my bedroom
And it's so cool without you
Been a month since I had a man
'Twas the finest romance
With a man
Been a month since I had a man
Been a month since I had a manEmbed
