Wolf Girl (Bonus Track) LyricsI think it's gone away
But I still feel it here
I think it's gonna change
But I still need it here
In the middle of the afternoon
Looking good
Standing in a tall, tall grass
She looks like you
Is she gonna tear
These walls down again?
Is she gonna burn
This house down again?
I'll have another car
Bad luck, spin the wheel
Whatever could it be
Step back, it can't be real
Your street car hunt
Runs up and down the line
If all you want is everything
Come back and find
Standing on the edge
And it's a long, long way down
Just another step
And you're gone from me now
Imagine all the girls and boys looking good
Don't you wanna run and play
I bet you would
Your street car hunt
Your street car hunt
Your street car hunt
Your street car huntEmbed
