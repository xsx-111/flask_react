Mainline Lyrics
Standing on the mainland, the sea's on fire
Hanging on a tightrope, don't shake the wire
Running down the mainline, you're just in time
Never gonna know, but I think you saved my life

Standing on my tiptoes, so I'll be seen
Everybody loves you, it's not just me
Listen to the broadcast, oh can't you see
Everybody's saying that you're way too good for me

And now
Just lie beside me
We can burn and glow
Take down the walls we built

I think I've done my best now, I'll wash my hands
Who is in the bedroom, it's a secret gang
Have another breakdown and make some plans
Think about the money that you spent on making friends last night

Oh tell me truly
Do you sleep alright
You must be kidding me
Standing on the mainland, the sea's on fire
Hanging on a tightrope, don't shake the wire
Running down the mainline, you're just in time
Never gonna know it but I think you saved my lifeEmbed
