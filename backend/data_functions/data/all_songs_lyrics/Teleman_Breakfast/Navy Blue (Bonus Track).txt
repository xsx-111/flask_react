Navy Blue (Bonus Track) LyricsTime stands still when I talk to you
Lights coming on when you walk on through
Feels pretty good when you talk to me
Feel pretty numb when you're lost at sea
Lost in a room with a hundred friends
Lost in a house with a hundred rooms
Floating around with the engine gone
Searching for land but it won't be long
Call it what you want to
Call it black or navy blue
Can't you take it off?
It's not the one for you
Time stands still when I talk to you
Lights coming on when you walk on through
Feels pretty good when you talk to me
Feel pretty numb when you're lost at sea
Never run, wheel of life
Never stay too long
Is it real? Turn it on
Let it burn and glow
Please come around, make a tiny sound
Feels pretty good when the sun goes down
And what do you do if the wheels get stuck
It feels pretty good
We just make it up
Call it what you want to
Call it black or navy blue
Can't you take it off?
It's not the one for youEmbed
