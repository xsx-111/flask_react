Monday Morning Lyrics
I don't care
If it's Saturday night
Or Monday morning
Under the plastic sky
I fell asleep
With the radio on
I started dreaming
You were in every song

And i don't care
If you were yellow or red
Standing very tall
On your feather bed
You're falling apart
With your best clothes on
Listen to the music
You are in every song

Drifting through the night
Whatever you're thinking of me
You're probably right
If you are so small
Surely you can see
Whoever you're waking up with now
You still want me
And are you trying to dance
Underneath the sea
Moving slowly
Coming up to breathe
And what in the world
Could make you really feel
You think it's made of plastic
I think it might be real

Real enough to find
Whatever you're thinking of me
You're probably right
If you are so so small
Surely you can see
Whoever you're waking up with now
Is still not me

And I felt so far
A hundred storeys high
Whatever you're thinking of me
You're probably rightEmbed
