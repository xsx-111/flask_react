Redhead Saturday Lyrics
Saturday, Saturday don't be long
I'm going out of my mind
Keep treading water and dreaming on
God, you are so hard to find

And if all of your houses of cards fall down
You blame the first day of spring
I blame your bad dreams and your cheap white wine
Float to the surface and rise up
Rise up, falling down only love

Oh Mrs Hijin please call me back
I won't sit outside of your door
The girl's made of concrete and wants me dead
She can fuck herself for all I could care
For all I could care, for all I could care
For all I could care, for all I could careEmbed
