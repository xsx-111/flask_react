In Your Fur Lyrics
I am a walking tower of silence
Haven't I got some place to be?
Pushing your friends aside, you just move on
Can't tell if you're dancing just for me

We stop so far from many station
And it's so still and dark outside
Where have you been while I was sleeping
On the strangest ride?

Couldn't you grow a pair of wings now
Pushing yourself above the roof
Couldn't you be my new relation
You in your fur and leather boots

We stop so far from many station
And it's so still and dark outside
Where have you been while I was sleeping
On the strangest ride

I've been trying to lift your heavy feeling
Tick-ticking along like an old machine
Cover the front and ride with the driver
Shoveling coal to make the steam
We stop so far from many station
And it's so still and dark outside
Where have you been while I was sleeping
On the strangest ride
On the strangest ride
On the strangest ride
On the strangest rideEmbed
