Lady Low Lyrics
Driving, lost on the motorway, lady
In the Mercedes is smiling
What can she see through her dirty window?
Low light, spires of the churches enchant me
Girls on the bicycle pass me
Making their way through their lives so quietly
And oh now it's late in the evening, I'm drowning
Visions of you all around me
Probably best if I don't stay home again tonight

Lady, you're trying to get to me slowly
Chipping away like the sculptor
And I am a block of your cold, cold marble
Tell me, when will the spell take effect then?
What can I learn to expect, oh
I'm happy to be in the time so slowly
Lady, look at the way that you left me
Forgetting to kill me completely
Stumbling round with my shoelaces untied


Driving, lost on the motorway, Lady
Sitting beside me, still smiling
Come to the surface and float so quietly
But lady, it's probably best if you leave me
Dragging us both into the deep sea
What would I see through your eyes if I could get inside?Embed
