Cristina LyricsI’m coming back to where I started
I never meant to be the bad kid
The feeling came in uninvited
Where is everybody hiding?
Come back and turn the lights on
Throw everything around your bedroom
Some things just take you right back
You forget you’ve gotta go soon
Cristina’s so good, she makes me go across town
She makes me to lie down
There’s nothing in the way now
I’m coming back to where I started
I never meant to be the bad kid
The feeling came in uninvited
You wanna see if I can fight it
Cristina’s so good, she makes me go across town
She makes me to lie down
There’s nothing in the way now
Lie down and let the music play
Nothing in the way now
Lie down and let the music play
Standing in the sidelines
Conversation in the half-light
You remember you’re downtown
You really should be on your way now
Come back and turn the lights on
Throw everything around your bedroom
Some thing’s just take you right back
You forget you’ve gotta go soon
Cristina’s so good, she makes me go across town
She makes me to lie down
There’s nothing in the way now
Lie down and let the music play
Nothing in the way now
Lie down and let the music play
Nothing in the way now
Lie down and let the music play
Nothing in the way now
Lie down and let the music play
Nothing in the way nowEmbed
