23 Floors Up Lyrics
Another day waking up with your conscience stuck
In your hotel room 23 floors up
Oh love has come to town
Caramel in the mind and I can keep good time
The city below could be anywhere
Oh love is pouring down
Do you remember how we started out
Feeling round in the dark we just didn't know how
Oh leave it all behind
Or carry it on the wood pigeon song
Sits on the wire tells me nothing's wrong
Hey sing to me your song

I'm leaving you behind
I don't need anyone now
I'm leaving you behind
I can't feel anything
Oh let me float up high
I don't need anyone now
I'm leaving you behind

There's nothing like waking up with your conscience stuck
In your hotel room 23 floors up
Oh love has come to town
Combination is fine and I can keep good time
The city below is anywhere you like
Oh love is pouring down

Oh love is pouring down
I don't need anyone now
Oh love is pouring down
I don't need anyone
So slowly spinning round
I can't feel anything now
Oh love is pouring down

Oh oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oh love is pouring down
I don't need anyone now
Oh love is pouring down
I don't need anyone
So slowly spinning round
I can't feel anything now
Oh love is pouring down

Oh oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh-ohEmbed
