Steam Train Girl LyricsOld love is leaving now
Old love is leaving now
Oh another train comes to take you where you've got to be
Sure enough you never felt so free
South of nowhere, you call your friends
Got to turn round 'cause the train track ends
What does it mean to be a rolling heart?
Gathering moss because you're stuck so fast
What can you do to get attention now?
Struggling up to get a good look down
Down down down
That's the wrong way
Come come come
Need to repay
It's not so so complicated now
Isn't it good when you can feel that
Old love is leaving now (my eyes back up)
Old love is leaving now (my steam train girl)
Old love is leaving now (my eyes back up)
Old love is leaving now (my steam train girl)
Another train comes to take you where you've got to be
Sure enough you never felt so free
South of nowhere, you call your friends
You've got to turn round 'cause the train track ends
What does it mean to be a rolling heart?
Gathering moss because you're stuck so fast
What can you do to get attention now?
You're struggling up to come a long way down
Down down down
That's the wrong way
Come come come
Need to repay
It's not so so complicated now
Isn't it good when you can feel that
Old love is leaving now (my eyes back up)
Old love is leaving now (my steam train girl)
Train, train, train...Embed
