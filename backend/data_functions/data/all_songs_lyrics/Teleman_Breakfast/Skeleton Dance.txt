Skeleton Dance Lyrics
Everyone talking, trying to get near you
Hanging around your rumpled eyes
Maybe you think I'm dumb or I'm crazy
Why do you think I'm standing by your side?
Can you carry me back to where I came from?
Carry me back to rolling hills
All along I try to remember
Why I had left, why I'm here still

Skeleton dance with me round the bedroom
Rattling bones and laughing so loud
Happiest dead girl I've ever known
Is leaving me with no doubt

The cupboard is empty, go to your phone book
Back in the car and round to your house
Talk about lost times of your childhood
Telling me things I can do without

I was the one who made you fall over
Tying your laces, pushing you down
But you were the one kept trying to get closer
Carrying on till I was worn out
Skeleton dance with me round the bedroom
Rattling bones and laughing so loud
Happiest dead girl I've ever known
Leaving me with no doubt

And I've come to life, at last
My madness must have left
In the night, oh no
And I'm so glad you've come home

We're sat in the kitchen drawing our faces
Through the window Coco's there
"Can I come in?", she said and her eyes are
Green and then she runs off again

I was the one who made you fall over
Tying your laces, pushing you down
But you were the one kept trying to get closer
Carrying on till I was worn out

My skeleton dance with me round the bedroom
Rattling bones and laughing so loud
Happiest dead girl I've ever known
Is leaving me with no doubt
And I've come to life, at last
My madness must have left
In the night, oh no
And I'm so glad you've come homeEmbed
