Travel Song Lyrics
I want to shake this blue
You know where I'm going
Travel time has come
A vapor trail and I'm gone
Be so kind as to say
You won't just drift away
Write it on your hand
But you can't remember
There's something left behind
A KLM flies in

Contact
It's looking good
What's that?
It's not getting through

Touch down in the dark
And fallen footsteps
Where am I to sleep
It's never a problem yet
All night long, keeps me warm
Electric blanket
Contact
It's looking good
What's that?
It's not getting through

I'm not lost, I'm just turning in endless circles
In my perfect garden far from this world

Thoughts are running round
Stuck in a tape loop
The rusting ferris wheel
Spinning above you
All night long, keeps me warm
Electric blankets are

Contact
It's looking good
What's that?
It's not getting through

I'm not lost, I'm just turning in endless circles
In my perfect garden far from this world
And if you're calling, I can't hear you darling
Lost in my perfect garden far from this world

"Not In Control" hidden track
Every other time when the telephone rings
Put it down, I'm not in control
Don't know what it brings to me
I'm not in control anymore
Close the shutters, make it black
Take me back, I'm not in control anymore
I'm not in control 
I'm not in control anymore

Every other time when the telephone rings
Put it down, I'm not in control
Don't know what it brings to me
I'm not in control anymore
See the ceiling, hit the floor
Lock the doors, I'm not in control anymore
Kerosine, care flock
Caroline, juice bop
Price drop, capital
Come and go, palindrome
Fruit drop, I'm not in control anymore
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control
I'm not in control anymoreEmbed
