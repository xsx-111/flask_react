Counting Lyrics
Thinking now when you don’t mean that
Speak, this is not a time we don’t see
This is not a way for you to be
I don’t wanna be with you all night alone
It’s in my time to break it off
I don’t wanna die and then break it off
I don’t wanna know where we make it out
No, no, no

I’m counting on the idea that you'll stay
I’m counting on the idea that you'll stay alive

Take it down when you don’t mean
Down soft, this is not a world for you to love
And I don’t wanna see that fade our love
This is not the way that you expect to be
Taking off out and making love
Everything you say is breaking off
This is not a time for this to stop
No, no, no

Thinking now when you don’t mean go
Fade, this is not a time where you can raise
This is not a time where you're okay
I don't want the feeling you are not alone
It's in my time to make it out
This is not your time to make it out
This is not your time to make it out
No, no, no
I’m counting on the idea that you'll stay
I’m counting on the idea that you'll stay alive
I’m counting on the idea that you'll stay alive, I need you for a little while
No, no
I’m counting on the idea that you'll stay6Embed
