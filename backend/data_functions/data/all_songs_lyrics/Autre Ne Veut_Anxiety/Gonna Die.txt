Gonna Die Lyrics
Some day I'm gonna die
And I feel it more acutely now
Than I have for a while
Death is staring back through the mirror
The lines on my face say I am
I'm okay for a while
 x3
And oh, I'm gonna die
And I feel it more acutely now
Than I have for awhile
You stare in the bathroom mirror
The lines on my face say I am
I'll be OK for a whileEmbed
