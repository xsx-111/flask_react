Ego Free Sex Free Lyrics
Your sexy body
Tell me what you love and
Going for the places
And an opinion tonight
You hold me back and tell me what you love
Looking for their faces
And then I place it to her

I want to be the knight in armor
When you say this is forever and
I want to be this vine in your side
When you say this is forever and

Love riding your sexy body
Tell me what you love and
Going for the places
And an opinion tonight
You hold me back and tell me what you love I'm
Going for the place that
And it’ll pin you tonight

I want to be your  in armor
When you say this is forever and
I want to feel you heart enlighten
When you say this is forever and
Ego free sex free
I can’t feel my body moving
Ego free sex free
I can’t see your body baby
Ego free sex free
I can’t feel my body moving
Ego free sex free
I can’t see your body baby

Your sexy body
Tell me what you lovin
Holdin for the faces
In your opinion tonight
You hold me back and tell me what you lovin
Follow in those footsteps
I know the place that you want

You want to be my second armor
When you say this is forever and
I want to be your favorite, your side
When you say this is forever and

Ego free sex free
I can’t feel my body moving
Ego free sex free
I can’t see your body baby
Ego free sex free
I can’t feel my body moving
Ego free sex free
I can’t see your body baby
Ego free sex free
I can’t feel my body moving
Ego free sex free
I can’t see your body baby
I can’t feel my body moving
I can’t see your body babyEmbed
