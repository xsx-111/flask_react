Play by Play Lyrics
And I said baby
And I said baby
And I said baby
And I said baby

And I said baby, I'm all alone I need you now
Come stay with me so that we can meet somehow
Said baby, your hold-me-down is my design
Come stay with me so we can be much higher

I don't wanna be there tonight
You make me whole, you make me crawl
And make me harder
And you, wanna be the one that made me up
You made me love
Don't make me help and make me odder
And you don't wanna be like I'm the pain that
You never wanted
Be out, fine, take that

You wait for love, telling me to go, go, go
Don't ever leave me
You're feeling like you don't mind
Thinking that you want to go
Don't ever leave me
You're feeling like you don't mind
Thinking that you want to go
Don't ever leave me alone
And this is how you find
I'll make it and you know, know, know
Don't ever leave me no
Never leave me out
Never leave me
Don't try to make me
I just called you up to get that play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
I just called you up to get that play by play
I just called you up to get that play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
I just called you up to get that play by play
I just called you up to get that play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
I just called you up to get that play by play
I just called you up to get that play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
I just called you up to get that play by play
I just called you up to get that play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
I just called you up to get that play by play
I just called you up to get that play by play
Don't ever leave me alone
I just called you up to get that play by play
Don't ever don't ever don't ever leave me alone
Don't ever leave me don't ever don't ever leave me
Get that play by play play by play
Don't ever leave me alone5Embed
