I Wanna Dance With Somebody Lyrics
Say you want to be all for me
But you can't find your 
I don't want  for me
Every word that you try to say
Just got lost in your speech
And here we are and we’re breaking on
And how 
 x2
Stand up, be mine
You never do it with me
Dance now, making you want
You wanna be there
Stand up, be mine
You never do it with me
Dance now, making you want

Say you be all for me
But you can't find your 
Every word that you try to say
Every way that come right down
And you don’t understand
This is right where you wanna be
Down, and you hate for now
 x2

And you say that you wanna be like 
Baby down and you wanna be there
You don’t wanna let it stay
And the ways that you anticipated me for life
Holding back and you run from me
How and day by day, by day, by day
