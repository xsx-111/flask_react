Promises LyricsIt’s the last heartbreak that’ll ever have to with us
And you know that there were some times
When I could get rough
But you promised me heaven
Oh, didn't you?
(Love me)
It’s the last time
Oh, it’s the last heartbreak that’ll ever have to do with us
And you know that there were some times
When I could get rough
But you promised me heaven
Oh, didn't you?
(Love me)
Now it’s the last heartbreak that’ll ever have to do with us
And you know that there were some times
When I could get rough
But you promised me heaven
Oh, didn't you?
(Love me)Embed
