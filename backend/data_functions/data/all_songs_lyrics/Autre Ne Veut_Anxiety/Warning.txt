Warning Lyrics
What’s this thing that, that I can’t explain?
Just a feeling, more like a warning
And this thing that I’m telling you I can’t explain
Just a feeling, more like a warning
Like a warning

On/off, it goes, never gets better baby
Oh no no no no we
On/off, it goes, never gets better baby
Oh no no no no we

What’s this thing that, that I can’t explain?
Just a feeling, more like a warning
And everything that I’m telling you I can’t explain
Just a feeling, more like a warning
Like a warning, like a warning
Warning, warning, warning…


In a time that you said that your world was on fire
I would never wanna see your face again
In the world that your heart is screaming, find it in Neverland
I was never low, let’s see the face again
And I run and tell you what I know you damage me
I would never wanna see your face again
In all the flames of the world that died
What’s this thing that, that I can’t explain?
Just a feeling, more like a warning1Embed
