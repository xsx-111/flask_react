World War Lyrics
Wanna be the one that you be
Take a timeout and listen
Do everything right
Don’t wanna make a mistake
Oh, you know that you’re in it
And this is goodbye
Don’t wanna think darling, don’t disobey
And you promised you wanted to be

Oh world war
She’s a fire side
Sometimes I see your face
In my mind right now
Rather just stand there
Fighting you
World war

Wanna be the one that you be
Take a timeout and listen to everything right
Don’t wanna be there 
And you know that you’re listening
Girl, this is not right
Go on and do what you can darling
Don’t deserve babe
And you follow you wanted to me

 x18
Not gonna be
No way, no way, no way
You’re gonna be my babyEmbed
