A Lie LyricsNo holding back, you’re wonderful and you fed a lie
I just wanna be the one
Girl wait for me
And this is goodbye
I just wanna be the one
You’re looking for an innocence, a lie
This heavy name
Can’t wait for me and this is goodbye
Hang up, I knew you loved her
Oh, know what moved her
Hang up, making you love her
In the end I accept her
Say what? Don’t make me feel
Carry a lie
Know enough for me to make you sweat
And I feel that I am there
Tell you what
You make me feel you carry a lie
No one to make me feel, you carry a lie
A million secrets yea
No, no baby
You’re wonderful and you fed a lie
I just wanna be the one
Girl wait for me
And this is goodbye
I just wanna be the one
You’re beautiful and this is a lie
Care deep and can’t make it her
And this is goodbye
Hang up, I knew you loved her
Oh, know what moved her
Hang up, making you love her
In the end I accept herEmbed
