Just Friends Lyrics
When will we get the time to be just friends?
It's never safe for us, not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning where your shit works
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
"Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?"

When will we get the time to be just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends?

And, no, I'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Though we need to find the time to just do this shit together
'Fore it gets worse
I wanna touch you, but that just hurts

When will we get the time to be just, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
Just friends?12Embed
