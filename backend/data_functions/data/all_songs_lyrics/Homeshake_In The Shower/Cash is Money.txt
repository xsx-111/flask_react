Cash is Money LyricsOh no, no more, make it stop
One, two dahahahah ahahahah
She's been looking at me sideways
Even me and all my weekday
It's too bad that she'll never know
Cause I can't, can't afford to let it show
She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm
You know cash is where it's at
Sorry girl I'll be right back
She feels every second that it takes
I need every dollar I can make
She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm
She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm1Embed
