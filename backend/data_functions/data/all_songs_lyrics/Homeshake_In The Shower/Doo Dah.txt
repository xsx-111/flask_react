Doo Dah Lyrics
Holy moly, get a load of this cat
Just woke up and pawing for a little scratch
These two, they're a perfect match
I dipped out but only for a minute
Came right back, but she was hurt; couldn't laugh
It's blurry and overcast
(Instrumental Chorus)

She's spaced out, now everything is soaked off
All I hear is crying and it marks her eyes
All over again, goodbye
Alright, my baby is outta sight
(Chorus with dah-dah repeated)

Sally, I’m so sorry
I couldn’t stop
I wasn’t strong enough2Embed
