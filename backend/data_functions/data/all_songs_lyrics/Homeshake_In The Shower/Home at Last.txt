Home at Last Lyrics
Look at this place
It's not how it used to seem
They're all the same
But living in a dream

I'm not running
I've just got to get away
Sure, it's fun and everything
But I won't stay

So home
At last
I'm home
At last

So I forgot
It didn't change a thing
Miss her a lot
She kept us company

I'm not hiding
I'm just trying to get it out
Sure, it's testing
But that's not what it's about
So homeEmbed
