Making a Fool of You Lyrics
Damn, it's been a long time since we spoke
Couldn't hear you over that fan
Thinking between a few jokes
It's getting me through the day

Normally I wouldn't say
Lately how you're feelin that way
Told me tell you what to do
She's making a fool of you
Making a fool of you
She's making a fool of you
Something that you gotta lose

Fuck, usually it rolls right off
Guess it's only my bad luck
Didn't want to be so soft
Doesn't matter anyways

Normally I wouldn't say
Lately how you're feelin' that way
Told me tell you what to do
She's making a fool of you
Making a fool of you
She's making a fool of you
Something that you gotta lose6Embed
