Slow LyricsBaby, I know that you're lonely
Things are moving slowly
Only you and me
Show me something you've been doing
Talk to me so soothing
Like I wasn't here
Please don't let me leave
I want to be at home
All alone
Laying low
Livin' nice and slow
She will change the way I feel
Cook me up a meal
And she cooks it nice
I might act a little uptight
Trying to keep it lit up
Every single night
Please don't let me leave
I want to be at home
All alone
Laying low
Livin' nice and slowEmbed
