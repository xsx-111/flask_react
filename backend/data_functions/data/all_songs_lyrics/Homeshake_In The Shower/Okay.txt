Okay Lyrics
Hey, what's up, my name is Pete
How do you do?
Yeah, it's really nice to meet
And say to you

Oh, just a week
Yeah, it's alright
Just around here
Seems pretty nice
Leave around noon
Back to L.A
Don't really know
Yeah, it's okay

Moon is up, it's getting late
It's time to go
I won't remember
What's your name
Guess I don't know

But now
It's mellow when we're hanging tight
And everybody seems alright
Damn, if she ain't looking fine
So fine
