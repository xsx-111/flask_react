Shoo Be Doo LyricsIt's funny, honey, but you don't care
You never wanna take me anywhere
You ride around in your cadium car (echo)
You keep wishin' upon a star (echo)
Why is it you don't care
Don't ya go, don't ya go, makin' eyes at me
Don't remind me (echo)
Don't you tell me what to do
Shoo be doo (echo)
Shoo be doo
Don't ya tell me what to do
Don't ya tell me what to do
Shoo be doo (echo)
Don't ya tell me what to do
'Cha tell what to do (echo)1Embed
