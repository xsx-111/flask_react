Dangerous Type LyricsCan I touch you
Are you out of touch
I guess I never
Noticed that much
Geranium lover
I'm live on your wire
Oh, come and take me
Whoever you are
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight
Oh, inside angel
Always upset
Keeps on forgetting
That we ever met
Can I bring you
Out in the light
My curiosity's
Got me tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
Oh she's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight
Museum directors
With high shaking heads
They kick white shadows
Until they play dead
They want to crack
Your crossword smile
Oh, can I take you
Out for a while, yeah
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type, alright
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight tonight, tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type, tonight
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on hold me tight tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on hold me tight tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you1Embed
