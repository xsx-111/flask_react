Since I Held You LyricsI really love the way you talk
I don't mind sayin' so
And ooh I love it when you da-ance
So silky slow
Oh baby please don't go
I know you refuse to get involved
You won't help me out none
You run around like a paperdoll
Pretending it's fun
Oh baby please don't run
Somethin' in the night just don't sit right
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night, yeah
It's been such a long time
Since I held you
I said it's been such a long time
Since I held you
Ooh ooh such a long time
Since I held you
I won't forget the way you said
It doesn't bother you much
Tutor impressions in your he-ead
Just before the last touch
That meant so much
Somethin' in the night just don't sit right
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night, yeah
It's been such a long time
Since I held you
I said it's been such a long time
Since I held you
Ooh ooh such a long time
Since I held you
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Such a long time
Well, it's been a long, long time
I said it's been a long, long time
It's been a long time
Since I held you
Ooh ooh such a long time
Since I held you1Embed
