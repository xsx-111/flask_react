Respect Lyrics
For reasons I don't know I treated you so cold
I wish I had those times again
Because something that you said keeps
Ringing in my head
Someday you're going to want to come back
And you're going to want to treat me fine

Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little time
Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little

I watched me push you down in dreams I had of you
And all I remember about those days is
I would run around thinking that you'd be alright
But you lost your light along the way
And oh, you were right about the things I'd say
Because if I had it back again I know I would, you know I'd treat you kind

Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little time
Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little time
Everybody got to have somebody
Everybody got to have someone

And all I ever wanted from this play
Was someone to talk to when I get down
It seems you get the things you give along the way
Now all I need is one more chance to make you feel like hanging round

Everybody needs a little
Everybody needs a little
Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little time
Everybody needs a little respect
Everybody needs a little time, time
Everybody
Everybody got to have someoneEmbed
