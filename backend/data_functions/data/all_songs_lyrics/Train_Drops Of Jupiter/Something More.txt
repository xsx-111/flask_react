Something More Lyrics
I just opened up my eyes
And let the world come climbing in
It's all better now, things are going to work somehow
If I just sleep another hour
Tried to reach you at your mom's
Hey baby why you're trying to keep away for so long
I stopped feeling good, somehow I just knew I would
I guess I'll sleep another hour

Feels like I'm wasting my time
Hanging on this same old line
Got to get you off of my mind
There's nothing left for me to find

And all the more I want, all the more I need
All the while you want something more
All the more I want, all the more I need
All the while you want something more

Thought I've found words to say
Just to get you feeling fine over heals my way
But it don't matter how I lost the word and nerve and now
There's nothing more for me to say
Feels like I'm wasting my time
Hanging on this same old line
Nothing left for me to find

And all the more I want, all the more I need
All the while you want something more
All the more I want, all the more I need
All the while you want something more

There's nothing left for me to say
I'm wanting what I need this way
And when I'm feeling low I know
I need to stop

Someday you'll see
That all the more you want, all the more you'll need me
All the while I'll be on to something more
And all the more you want, all the more you'll need me
All the while I want something more

I want something more
I want something more than thisEmbed
