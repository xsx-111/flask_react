I Wish You Would Lyrics
Sleepless nights and endless days
And all I do is promise to change my ways
Leave the lights on, you know
I'll pretend you're on your way
You used to say that there's a time
We all deserve to lose our minds
So I lost my mind, now I'm ready
To find my way, hey, hey

Back home today to stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear to stay
The way you wished I would

I don't know if I'm gonna have to redesign my mind
But tonight I made a wish and I sure hope that it comes true
Because it's been too long without you it's been too long
Come home today to stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear to stay
The way I wish you would
Even if I left it all behind
There'd be reason to come back
And even though I left you far behind
Always thought that you'd come here
To find me, come, find me
I don't know if I can wait this long
To be what I used to be
I don't think I can wait much longer for the tide
To come back to me, come back to me
Back home today to stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear to stay
The way you wished I would

The way I wish you would
I swear to stay
The way I wish you would
Come home to stay, yeah, yeahEmbed
