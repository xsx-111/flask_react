Hopeless Lyrics
I hopelessly, helplessly, wonder why
Everything has changed 'round me
I'd tell it to your face but you lost your face along the way
And I'd say it on the phone if I thought you were alone
Why do things have to change?

You don't need my pictures on your wall
You say you need no one
And you don't need my secret midnight call
I guess you need no one

Is anybody waiting at home for you?
Because it's time that will tell
If it's Heaven, if it's Hell or if it's
Anybody waiting at home for you
Because it's time that will tell this tale

You're in and out, up and down
Wonder if you're lost or found
But I got my hands on you
Are you strong enough to tow the line?
Are you gonna make me yours or do I make you mine?
I'm in and out, I'm up and down
Wonder if I'm lost or found but I need your hands on me now
You don't need my pictures on your wall
You say you need no one
And you don't need my secret midnight call
I guess you need no one

Is anybody waiting at home for you?
Because it's time that will tell
If it's Heaven, if it's Hell or if it's
Anybody waiting at home for you
Because it's time that will tell this tale

I hopelessly, helplessly, wonder why
Everything got to changeEmbed
