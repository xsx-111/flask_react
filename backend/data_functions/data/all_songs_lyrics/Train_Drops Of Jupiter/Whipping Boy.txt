Whipping Boy Lyrics
Since then I never feel helpless
Recess, this mess if you do
And I find that even time well spent
Gets bent if you need it to, we do
By now I've showed you how much
I believe in the here
And now and I wish that you knew

Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy

You spilled your purse onto my bed
Searching for something for your head
Since then you never come clean
I mean you wish you only could

Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy
I can get up, I can get up, I can get up
I can get up, I can get up, I can get up
I can get up, I can get up, I can get up
I can get up, I can get up, I can get up
I can get up, I can get up, I can get up
I can get up, I can get up, I can get up
And I find that even time well spent
Gets bent if you need it to, we do, we do

Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
Lay all you want on me
I'll be your whipping boy

I'll be your whipping boy
I'll be your whipping boyEmbed
