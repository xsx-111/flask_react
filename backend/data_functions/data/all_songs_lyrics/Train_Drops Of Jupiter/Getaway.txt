Getaway Lyrics
If I could ride this slide into forever
What would I give to getaway
That pain that stayed, seemed like forever
What would you give to getaway

I know this is how I could be over you
You know this is not another waste of time
All this holding on can't be wrong
Just come back to me and I am not alone

You had your man, your fan but not forever
You should have let him, you should have let him getaway
But your pride made you ride on this slide
By his side to his lies, seemed like forever
What would you give to getaway

I know this is how I could be over you
You know this is not another waste of time
All this holding on can't be wrong
Just come back to me so I am not alone

To getaway, to getaway, to getaway, to getaway
I know this is how I could be over you
You know this is not another waste of time
All this holding on can't be wrong
And I know this is how I could be over you
You know that I am not another waste of time
All this holding on can't be wrong
If you come back to me, so I am not alone

To getaway, to getaway, to getaway, to getaway
To getaway, to getaway, to getaway, to getaway
To getaway, to getaway, to getaway, to getawayEmbed
