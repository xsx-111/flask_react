Carry Me Lyrics
I won't change

I'm try'n to keep the options near
I want you home, I want you here
The last you saw across the track
The rest are never coming back

If anybody wants to know
Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road

You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
(I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
(I won't change, you know that)
It's time I let my mind disarm
I never meant to cause you harm
Just try'n to keep the options near
I want you home, I want you here

You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
(I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me
(I won't change, you know that)

If anybody wants to know
Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road
You carry me2Embed
