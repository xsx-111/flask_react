Overdone Lyrics
Here comes the doubt to shut the sunlight out
I feel the brunt
And I keep the world away
To be asleep throughout the day, it's all I want

I sit and pine for wasted time
My feet were strong
My head was numb
I feel it come, I'm overdone

And I keep the world away
To be asleep throughout the day, it's all I need
Tell me, was it enough when we were first in love
To plant the seed and just leave?

I sit and pine for wasted time
My feet were strong
My head was numb
I feel it come, I'm overdone4Embed
