So Long, See You Tomorrow Lyrics
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come

You're packing up, packing up
I won't see you again
But you have made, you have made it up
You're packing up, packing up
I won't see you again
But you have made, you have made it up

When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come

When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round and round and round
(But I love you)
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
And round and round and round and round
But I love you
But I love you2Embed
