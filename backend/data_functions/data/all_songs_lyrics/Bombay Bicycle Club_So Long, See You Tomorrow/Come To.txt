Come To Lyrics
Come to

I'm kneeling down to get closer to the sign
And you're breaking my back every time

It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us

Don't need to tell me
You know this ain't nothing new
Of course I love you
Of course I do
But to outplay is not to love
And yet I keep on coming back to call your bluff

It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us

Come to
(Get me, get me)
Come to
(Get me, get me)
Come to
(Get me, get me)
Come to
(Get me, get me)
Your evening eyes
The rain outside
The way I know
No fear that I'll
Be fading out alone
It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us1Embed
