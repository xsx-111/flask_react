Eyes Off You Lyrics
Your letters wait at home
In their bright red coats
Under a midnight storm
I hear four words you wrote
"I can't be sad"
Sad, sad, sad
I can't make you mine

Now you're on your own
Even they can't stand
But I said before
And you know that

I can't take my eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes off you

And I bathed in the light you gave
But it's dark in another way
Yes, you gave me the light today
But it's dark in another way
And I bathed in the light you gave
But it's dark in another way
Yes, you gave me the light today
But it's dark, it's dark, it's dark
I can't be sad
I can't be sad
I can't be sad
I can't be sad

I can't take my eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes off you3Embed
