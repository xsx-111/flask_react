Home by Now Lyrics
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now

When the whistle blows
And we pull out slow
This is where I build my home
And I wait for you so patiently
Letting you find your own

If you wanna try, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
But anywhere I am, tell me you're waiting for me
I could be home by now

When I am old, let the tension flee
I was born crying out and it's come back to me
When everyone else is setting up to fall
I'll just think back on it all

I'll remember long drives, sitting in the back
Looking out and endless snow, waiting in the silence
If you won't spill your heart, I'll chase you for the words you owe
And you and you know and they're begging "come home"11Embed
