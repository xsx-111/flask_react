All I Want to Know LyricsHere comes heartbeat
Picked up on every street
She knows what it's for
Like she said she knows the score
All I wanna know all I wanna know
Does she suck
See her on your TV screen
Prettiest little thing that you ever seen
Is she good has she got a brain
I can teach her but it's such a pain
She's coming out of school
About to break a rule
Going out getting excited
There'll be no homework done tonightEmbed
