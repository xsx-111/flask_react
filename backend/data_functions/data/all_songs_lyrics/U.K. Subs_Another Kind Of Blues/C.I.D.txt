C.I.D Lyrics
See that man dressed in black?
Pass him by, don't look back
Keep in a line and walk straight ahead
Make one false move, could be dead

'Cause he's an underground undercover agent for the CID
CID, CID
Got a loaded .44
A walking armoury store

Take a tip and hear what I say
Don't take no trip down Soho way
'Cause if you do you better keep in a line
Make one false move, could be doing time

'Cause he's an underground undercover agent for the CID
CID, CID
Got a loaded .44
A walking armoury store

Yeah, watch it, kid, he may come out and grab you
Take a tip and hear what I say
Don't take no trip down Soho way
'Cause if you do you better keep in a line
Make one false move, could be doing time

'Cause he's an underground undercover agent for the CID
CID, CID
Got a loaded .44
A walking armoury storeEmbed
