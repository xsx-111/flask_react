B.I.C. LyricsHere comes the rain another dole queue day
I'm gonna get some money, can I? No way
Down to the social then an interview
Got my qualifications they say we don't need you
Here comes the rain and I'm hanging around
Gonna leave this city the place is getting med own
Don't care about tomorrow one more dole queue day
Got my qualifications they say go away
B.I.C. B.I.C
I don't wanna B.I.C
Here comes the rain it's my big day
I'm going down the social to get my pay
Make sure the next time you're dressed for an interview
Your qualifications won't help youEmbed
