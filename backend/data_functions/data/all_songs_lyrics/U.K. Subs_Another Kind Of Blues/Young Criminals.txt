Young Criminals LyricsPolice harass you everywhere you go
You need a place you can call your own
Down in the city street police take you for a beat
They can't get you bust, they'll have you with SUS
You're a young criminal on the street
Young criminal feel the heat
Say goodbye to the world outside
They don't care if you live or die
You're in a fire and you're about to fry
No one's gonna listen, who's gonna hear you cry?
You're a young criminal on the street
Young criminal feel the heat
Got you where they want you, stuck inside a cage
You're just a victim of the modern age
You fought the system but the system won
And when you come out make sure you have a gun
You're a young criminal on the street
Young criminal feel the heatEmbed
