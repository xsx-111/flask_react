Blues LyricsThe more I try the harder it gets with you
Up day and night and day but I still don't have a clue
I need another blue I need another blue
Toget through to you
If someone told me that you'd be here
I die of fright or freeze in fear
When I come down to your side of town
I always get a buzz just knowing you're aroundEmbed
