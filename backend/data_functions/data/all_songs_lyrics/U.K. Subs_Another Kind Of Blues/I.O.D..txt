I.O.D. LyricsOne for you
Two for me
Three for you
I.O.D
Nurse nurse come and see
What this stuff has done for me
I can't eat, I can’t sleep
It looks like it's the end
It's a job for you but
It’s agony for me
Shoot me up with morphine
Now I get my drugs for free
Nurse nurse come and see
What this junk has done to me
I can't eat, I can't sleep
It looks like it's the end
Lying in my hospital bed
I got electrodes in my head
And it looks like it's the end…
For meEmbed
