Crash Course LyricsMeet Mr. Media man
He's got the money he's got a plan
Come on and get a crash course
We'll tell you everything we know
Come on and get a crash course
Go where you wanna go
Go to Hollywood meet the stars
No gasoline in their cars
Come on and get a crash course
See you picture in a magazine
Come on and get a crash course
See your face on the TV screen
National network World Service
World domination 'cos you deserve it
Come on and get a crash courseEmbed
