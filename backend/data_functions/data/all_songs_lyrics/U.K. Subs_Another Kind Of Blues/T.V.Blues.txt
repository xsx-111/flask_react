T.V.Blues LyricsMy little sisters got the T.V.blues
There's nothing you can do
She sat and cried all Saturday night
And most of Sunday too
T.V. detector van coming down the street
T.V. detector man took away our T.V
My little sisters got the T.V.blues
My little sisters got the T.V.blues
Yeah that's tough on you
We have not paid a license fee
Since 1962
Forty days in Brixton
Puts the shit up the family
You woulnd't credit this
On the loss of a T.V
My little sisters got the T.V.bluesEmbed
