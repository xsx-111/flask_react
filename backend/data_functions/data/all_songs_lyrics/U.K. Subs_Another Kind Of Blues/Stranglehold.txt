Stranglehold LyricsOne two three
Four five six
Gotta do a dance
And it goes like this
Yeah some little girl's gotta hold on me
She's only thirteen but oh so sweet
Got me down on my knees
Got a stranglehold on me
Put's her arms around me like a vice
It's oh so painful but nice
But I can only take it once or twice
Got a stranglehold on me
Got a stranglehold on me
Got a stranglehold on me
Got a stranglehold on me
Stranglehold
Put's her arms around me like a vice
It's oh so painful but nice
But I can only take it once or twice
Got a stranglehold on me
Got a stranglehold on me
Got a stranglehold on me
Got a stranglehold on me
Stranglehold
Stranglehold on me
Stranglehold on me
Got a stranglehold on me
Stranglehold
Five six seven
Eight nine ten
You want more?
We'll do it again
Stranglehold on me
Stranglehold on me
Stranglehold on me
Stranglehold
