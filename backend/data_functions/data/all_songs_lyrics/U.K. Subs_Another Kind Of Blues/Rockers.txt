Rockers LyricsDolly Rockers dressed to kill
Holding onto Rocker Bill
It ain't the 50's any more
Born a Rocker Die A Rocker
See us at the local hall
Think that we got it made
Rebel flags from wall to wall
See them coming down the street
Greasy heads and creeper feet
They don't make no social callsEmbed
