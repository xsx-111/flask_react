I Live in a Car LyricsWell i live in a car
Yeah i live in a car
Well i ain't got no television set or stereo
Cos i live in a car
Don't try to call me up on the telephone
Cos i won't be home
I live in a car
234
Well i live in a car
Yeah i live in a car
Well i ain't got no yard
No i.d.card cos
I live in a car
Cops try to get me
But i don't care
I'm never there
Yeah i live in a car
234
Well I live in a car
Yeah I live in a car
Cops try to get me but I don't care
I'm never there I live in a carEmbed
