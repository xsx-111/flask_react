Lady Esquire LyricsSitting in the back row of a picture show with Lady Esquire
Every time I take a little sniff I get higher and higher
Get off with Zof
Science Fiction freaks
Get of with Zof
It's all I need
Batman and Superman are on the screen
Best Science Fiction I've ever seen
Galaxy of war is blasting me
Looks like Lady Esquire is getting to me
Take off with Zof
Science Fiction freaks
Take off with Zof
Get you to your kneesEmbed
