Killer LyricsGo down Picadilly
To get a pill or two
Next thing is you're running
And the killers after you
He may be watching you
You're out having fun
All he wants to do is
Get a file on everyone
The copper is a killer
They've given him a gun
The copper is a killer
And he's killing everyone
And it don't matter
Whose side you're on
You better get your banner down
The killers never wrong
The copper is a killer
No matter what you say
Put him in a uniform
He'll put you in a graveEmbed
