The Bend Lyrics
Have I not been clear
Or do I sound insincere?
I’m just trying to make some sense of this
Before I lose another year

It’s all that I can do
Because it's so hard to feel
In control here
Like I’m behind the wheel
But it won't steer

Stepping off the stone
Do I want to know, I don’t
It was clear and why
The path I left behind
And now I feel alone

No matter what I do
Because it's so hard to feel
In control here
Like I’m behind the wheel
But it won't steer
Have I not been clear
Or do I sound insincere?
I’m just trying to make some sense of this
Before I lose another year1Embed
