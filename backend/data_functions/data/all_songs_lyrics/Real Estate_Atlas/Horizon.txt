Horizon Lyrics
Just over the horizon
That's where I always think you'll be
It's always so surprising
To find you right there next to me

In this sprawling landscape
How'd you know just where I'd be

Just over the horizon
That's where I always think you'll be
It's always so surprising
To find you right there next to me

In this sprawling landscape
How'd you know just where I'd be
In this sprawling landscape
How'd you know just where I'd be
I find it hard to believe
Just one season is all I'd need
In this sprawling landscape
How'd you know just where I'd be
I find it hard to believe
Just one season is all I'd need2Embed
