Primitive Lyrics
When the night is young in the land I'm from
This season's ghost still lives
The stars at night obscured by light
Can still lead me through this

Don't know where I want to be
But I'm glad that you're with me
And all I know is it'd be easy to leave

And in my mind I can see the street
Where you and I will live
You still can't see the stars at night
But were not primitive

Don't know where I want to be
But I'm glad that you're with me
And all I know is it'd be easy to leaveEmbed
