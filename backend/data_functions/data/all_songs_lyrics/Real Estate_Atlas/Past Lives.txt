Past Lives Lyrics
I cannot come back to this neighborhood
Without feeling my own age
I walk past these houses where we once stood
I see past lives but somehow you're still here

Underneath this canopy
All lit up above us
Oh, but I can see
The sky is not the only thing that changes rapidly

This is not the same place I used to know
But it still has that same old sound
And even the lights on this yellow road
Are the same as when this was our town

Underneath this canopy
All lit up above us
Oh, but I can see
The sky is not the only thing that changes rapidly

And even the lights on this yellow road
Are the same as when this was our town1Embed
