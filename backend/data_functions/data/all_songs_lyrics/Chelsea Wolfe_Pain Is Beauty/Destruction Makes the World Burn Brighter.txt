Destruction Makes the World Burn Brighter Lyrics
I don't know what I ever wanted
You got a front, well you better flaunt it
Ate a piece of the devil's body
Yeah, the face of the devil follows me
Every day, it feels like Iâ€™m running
And I'm headed straight for the blaze
And I can breathe when I'm underwater
And I'm ready with my finger on the trigger

Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?

She's only special in secret
And she's got her own familiar spirits
Something inside of her rises and she knows
Destruction makes the world burn brighter

Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl? (Use that gun)
Who's that girl? (Use that gun)
Who's that girl? (I don't know what I ever wanted)
Who's that girl? (You got a front, well you better flaunt it)
Who's that girl? (Ate a piece of the devil's body)
Who's that girl? (Yeah, the face of the devil follows me)
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?Embed
