Ancestors, the Ancients Lyrics
I feel rapid
I feel rapid

Release your dead
Release your dead
Holy ancestors
Holy ancestors

I saw in you, a pattern
I saw the reason why
They never saw it in you
But I swear, I saw it then

In my head, there's a war
In the end, it's a horror
Can't help the chemical's form
In my head, there's a warrior

I saw in you, a pattern
I saw the reason why
He never saw it in you
But I swear, I saw it then
Release your dead
Release your dead
Holy ancestors
Holy ancestors

In my head, there's a war
In the end, it's a horror
The urge to kill, getting stronger
In my head, there's a warrior

And it's a war to feel whole
And it's a fear to feel at all
And it's the wonder at love
And it's the weight of her

For me, they've bled
Those wild men
To give me dreams
To bring me dreamsEmbed
