We Hit a Wall Lyrics
We hit a wall when we were young
We’d given up, we were never taught
When we were young we did ignore
It was so cold, we were never warned
We never were

How is it the world?
How is it the one?
How is this the world?
How is this the one?

We hit a wall when we were alone
We didn't know how to control
No one ever told
I showed you how to hold my hand
And kiss me slow and unending
I’ll show you how to love
I’ll show you how to love
I’ll show you how to love
I’ll show you how to love
An endless war

How is this the world?
How is this the one?
How is this the world?
How is this the one?Embed
