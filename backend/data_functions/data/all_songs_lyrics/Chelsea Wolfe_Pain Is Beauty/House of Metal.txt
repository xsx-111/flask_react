House of Metal Lyrics
You put the pill inside the petal
You put the petal in your mouth
You put your love inside the metal
You build the metal for your house
And the night runs wild

You put the pill inside the petal (And it runs white)
You put the petal in your mouth
You put your love inside the metal (And it runs white)
You build the metal for your house
You put the pill inside the metal
You put the metal in your mouth
You bleed into your house of nettles
You bleed the night without a sound

There's an ocean inside your chest
We’ve been sleeping inside your head
There's an ocean inside your chest
We’ve been sleeping inside your hand1Embed
