Feral Love Lyrics
Run from the light
Your eyes, black like an animal
Deep in the wander
And care for no one but the offspring of your might
Run from the one who comes to find you
Wait for the night that comes to hide
Your eyes, black like an animal, black like an animal
Crossing the water
Lead them to die

We press for the water
Press for the river, press for the rain
We press for the water
Press for the river, press for the pain
We press for the water
(We press for the water)
Press for the river, press for the rain
(We press for the water)
We press for the water
(We press for the water)
Press for the river, press for the pain
(We press for the water)3Embed
