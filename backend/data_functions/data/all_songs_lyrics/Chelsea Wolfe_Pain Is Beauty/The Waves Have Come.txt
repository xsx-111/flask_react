The Waves Have Come Lyrics
The pain forms a circle
With a light at the center
I can see it from here, the end is coming
And all the wait, it was for nothing
I covered you in royal jelly
I made you queen and you forgave me
We'll be given the world in the right time
But we made our own and left it empty

This will be ours
'Cause we're the concept
And we're the flawed
And we're the answer

You said to me, "It won't be long now
You'll leave the world and you will join me here"
My flesh is afraid but I am not
'Cause love now is only the pain of needing
They took your smell, they took your shadow
And I'm searching through faces for someone familiar
I clawed and I clawed, but I couldn't find you there
You wouldn't wake, I couldn't sleep for years
This will be ours
'Cause we're the concept
And we're the flawed
And we're the answer
And we're the stars
It won't be long, now
It will be ours
It will be ours

'Cause we're the cause
We're the stars
We're the cause
We're the flawed

Creation was the only word
That made you feel you never were
An endless hope is all it was
And holding sacred all they were
And don't forsake the way we were
And don't tell me you never would
And we don't need physical things to make us feel
And make us dream
When earth cracks open and swallows
Then we'll never be tired again
And we'll be given everything
The moment we realize we're not in control
And all you know gets older when
The sun goes down
And everything begins to fade away
The waves have come and taken you to sea
Never to return to me
Never to return to me
Never to return to me5Embed
