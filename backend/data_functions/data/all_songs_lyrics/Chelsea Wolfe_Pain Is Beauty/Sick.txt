Sick Lyrics
This suffering brings me closer to you
And time is broken and moves slow
Your pure heart, your white light
And I should be put to death for ever being cruel to you

You washed me clean like no one ever could
Come closer now and step right into
The wide mouth, the sharp teeth of the one you love
The wide mouth, the sharp teeth of the one you love
The wide mouth, the sharp teeth of the one you love

I'm not the kind of sick that you can fix
Don't you worry about me, baby
I've got no enemies and Iâ€™ve got no time

The song, we carry on
Even though you pushed us down
We carry on

When you try to blind my eyes, I can see tenfold
It's nothing that my heart can't take
'Cause your hate has made me strong
And stronger men than you have tried to break me
Stronger men than you have tried to break me
Leaning toward the golden days
Forget about the older days
And everything we left behind
To stand here, in another life

We carry on
Even though you held us down, we carry on
With the song, we carry on
Even though you pushed us down, we carry on

We carry on
We carry on
We carry on
We carry on
We carry onEmbed
