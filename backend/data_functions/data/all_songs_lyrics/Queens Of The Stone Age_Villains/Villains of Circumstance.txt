Villains of Circumstance Lyrics
I miss you now, what's come over me?
We're hostages of geography
The wait is long and heavy too
Despite what you're accustomed to
I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
Have no intentions of letting go
Only us, no one in the world
Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my might
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done until you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey
I've been so close, I'm so far away
It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
I need you now, nothing is real
Save me from the villains of circumstance
Before I lose my place
Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore13Embed
