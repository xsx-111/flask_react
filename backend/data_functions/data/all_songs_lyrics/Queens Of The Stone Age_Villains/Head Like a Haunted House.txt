Head Like a Haunted House Lyrics
Your head's like a haunted house
A tutti frutti written over a caption
Misdiagnosis with-a the most-est
Cue the evil smile
Desperation can lead to madness
De-de-de-degradation is a must
The A-B-C's of leprosy
Need a hand? Take mine
We're subleem, sublime
Fake apologize
Fucks in short supply

Too late, too slick, too young
Gag the bag reflex, spoken tongues
SÃ©ance? Say what?
Say man, don't even think about it
Push the pesticide
Xanadus and xana-don'ts
Edumacate me, copulate me
A dirty trick and it's making me sick (Urgh!)
(You okay?) I'm fine
"Let's go" is my sign
We're subleem, sublime
G-g-g-goddamn crime
Tonight
I'm gonna put up a fight
I'm gonna get a reaction that I like
Burn the days
I reject your displays
I demand satisfaction or the knife
To trip the light fantastic, one takes wire on the shins
Petty disguises worn like skins, a distinction, nice
Drink the Kool-Aid and swallow the pill
You say that you don't and you won't, but you will
Busted

Your head's like a haunted house
Peepin' at your mumbo jumbo
Outta sight, go bump in the night
Screwacide
With posterior so superior
Ain't in a race for second place
Circumstances in my pantses
Cumming for action
Girl, I'll blow your mind
Then you will blow mine
We're subleem, sublime
Goin' for a ride6Embed
