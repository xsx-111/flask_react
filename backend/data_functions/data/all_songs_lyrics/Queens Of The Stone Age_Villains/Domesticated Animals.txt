Domesticated Animals Lyrics
Today is the day
Bewilderness comes to reclaim everything
Burning bridge lights up the sky
Zip your lip until you've picked a side

You get right up and sit back down
A revolution is one spin round
You get back up and sit right down
A revolution is one spin round

All for one, all for naught
Perish baby, perish the thought
Beat the kids to the punch
You've got heart, I'll have it for lunch

You get right up, sit back down
A revolution is one spin 'round
You get back up, sit right down
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down

Tell me, where's the goddamn gold?
(Gold)
Pretty pets once were wild
Domesticated, love slave, give us a smile
You got a number, is it the same?
Who you belong to?
You feral or tame? (Probably tame)

Tell us where you keep the gold (Or what?)
We wanna help you rule the world (I think not)
We won't tell a single soul (So they all say)
So tell us, where's the goddamn gold?

I'll tell you where the gold is
It's in the ground
You wonder where's the reason?
It's in the lost and found
I'll tell you where the gold is
It's in the ground
You wonder where's the freedom?
In the lost and found
Still not found
I'll tell you where the gold is
It's all mine (mine)
Get right up, kneel and bow
Where's your revolution now?
Get back up, sit right down
Tears of gold, drink them down
Get right up, kneel and bow
Shrunken heads parade through town
Tears of gold, drink then drown
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down13Embed
