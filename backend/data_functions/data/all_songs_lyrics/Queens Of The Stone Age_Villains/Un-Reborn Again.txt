Un-Reborn Again Lyrics
Skinny knows jack
Skinny knows jack
Knowing nothing about nothing
It's a blessing in fact
Acid-faced Jake
Acid-faced Jake
He like them dancing straight boys
It makes his pupils dilate
Juzzy come quick
Juzzy come quick
Tell the doctor to come over
Bring emergency kit
Evil ol' Scratch
Evil ol' Scratch
He drink the water from the gutter
It's a natural fact

Youth
You could be young again
Anew
Be un-reborn again
Askew
Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth you can almost reach
Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth you can almost reach
A fever

Chi Chi gone shake
Chi Chi gone shake
Ti rompo il culo
C'est magnifiqué óde lay
Twizzy gon' twitch
Twizzy gon' twitch
He said no huggy, no kissy
Until I get a wedding ring
K Dubs cuts quick
Taking no shit
Give a metal blow job
The middle finger n' split

Youth
You could be young again
Anew
Be un-reborn again
Right where the map ends, is where its hid
Under the X is where it lives
Askew
Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach
Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach
I had a vision as clear as day (Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally)
Was delusions of grandeur in our DNA (Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach)
Every drop like an ocean, a moment of truth (Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally)
Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth (Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach)
Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh-uhuh-uhai
Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh

There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain
Come drink from the water before it's been drained away
Every drop like an ocean, every moment undone
Implosions of beauty back to where we begun
There's gotta be somewhere to bury the proof
Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth
Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Screaming, mm-hm, mm-hm, hm-hm, hmmm-hmmm-hmmm7Embed
