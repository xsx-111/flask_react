The Way You Used to Do Lyrics
When I first met her she was seventeen
Seventeen
Jump like an arsonist to a perfect match
Burned alive

We run 'til no one could find us
Girl, we outrun everyone

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do
Yeah

Is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?
Fine with either
Gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah
They'll terrorize

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does
But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

Now
The way you used to do

My heart, a ding-a-ling
A puppet on a string
C'est la vie
So lay your hands across my beating heart, love

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do
Used to do
Like the way you used to do
Come and love me now
Like the way you used to do
Like the way you used to do9Embed
