The Evil Has Landed Lyrics
Close
Come close

Going on a living spree
Any wanna come with me
You don't wanna miss your chance
Near life experience
Faces making noise
Say, "be good girls and boys"
It ain't half empty or full
You can break the glass, or drink it all
Dig it?

Close
Come close
Close
Come close

A grand macabaret
The last float on parade
As they sweep right up behind
Every puzzle 
Handshake and facade
Play the fool or playing God
Just for God's sake play along
Or well, you can hum along
Hit it
Du-du-du-du-duah!
Dudududu-duuu-du-du
Du-du-du-du-duah!
Dudududu-duuu-du-du
Du-du-du-du-duuu

Diving, falling, no longer different
I fall beyond definitions now
Unless...


Close
Come close
Close
Come close

Going on a living spree
You really wanna come with me
Ain't gonna miss the chance
Near life experience

We're all a little tangled
Corroded and mangled, yeah
But I'm for letting go
Yeah, I'm for letting go
Yeah, I'm for letting go
Yeah, I'm for letting go
Here.. we..

.. come!
Here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta' the way
Here we come
Get outta' the way
Matters not, what the people say
Matters not, what the people say
'Cause here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta the way
