Fortress Lyrics
Your heart is like a fortress
You keep your feelings locked away
Is it easier?
Does it make you feel safe?
You wander through the darkness
Of wilderness behind your eyes
I know youâ€™re afraid
But you gotta move on

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and come through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe

I believe I know you
Yet, I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone as I have felt
I don't want to fail you so
I tell you the awful truth
Everyone faces darkness on their own
As I have done, so will you

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

The Earth spins 'round the sun
And behold
Everything happens
Every night falls prey to sunrise

If your fortress is under siege
You can always run to me
If your fortress is under siege
You can always run
Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

Come on through
Come on through18Embed
