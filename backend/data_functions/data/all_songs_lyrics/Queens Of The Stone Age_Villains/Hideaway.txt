Hideaway Lyrics
The kid who wants some of the pretties in life
Tried shortcuts those are myths
Despite
The first hands, the backhands, the bruises, the bites
The painful spoonful the hustle invites
Speak my name and I'll appear
Right here

Hideaway
Hideaway

I'm all dressed up, no one left to blow
Addiction to friction leaves you raw
Left with the taste of flesh and bone
It's a beautiful day in the USA
I requires a pupil, and I'm sure it's yours

Hideaway
Hideaway
You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms
You'll feel love
Innocence is what you lose
Like keys and dreams and old tattoos
With one quick twist love turns to scar
Cruising the bruises in my car
Catch the keys, take the wheel and drive, for a while

Hideaway
Hideaway
You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms
You owe me everything
You owe me everything

You'll feel love
You'll feel love
Hold my hand
You'll feel love
You'll feel love
You'll feel love
Who needs love?9Embed
