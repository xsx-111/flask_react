Split Myself in Two Lyrics
The man laid his hat on the table
Hung his coat up on the wall
Sat down to dinner, said, "As soon as I am able
I'll say something nice to you all."
Then he took a deck from his pocket
Spread 'em so I saw 'em all
Then he turned his back to me, shuffled 'em and drew me
The card that said I never would fall

Oh, Mary Lou, won't you tell me what to do?
I got a dollar on the corner and a laser in my shoe
If I don't get an answer, gonna split myself in two

He spun 'til a ton was glistening
He turned to me and gave me a smile
He said, "I'm leaving but I want what you owe me
I'll be back in a little while."
That was the last time I saw him
Hope I never see him again
And I know it sounds funny but I owe him some money
Really don't want him for a friend

Oh, Mary Lou, won't you tell me what to do?
I got a dollar on the corner and a laser in my shoe
If I don't get an answer, gonna split myself in two

The man laid his hat on the table
Hung his coat up on the wall
Sat down to dinner, said, "As soon as I am able
I'll say something nice to you all."
Then he took a deck from his pocket
Spread 'em so I saw 'em all
Then he turned his back to me, shuffled 'em and drew me
The card that said I never would fall

Oh, Mary Lou, won't you tell me what to do?
I got a dollar on the corner and a laser in my shoe
If I don't get an answer, I'll split myself in two1Embed
