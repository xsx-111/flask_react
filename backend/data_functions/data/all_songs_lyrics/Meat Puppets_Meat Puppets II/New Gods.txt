New Gods Lyrics
How much do I owe you?
I'll pay but I don't want you going where I go to
Days of where I came from
In a restaurant in Mexico
They told me not to drink the water
And not to touch the food
"All we got is Pepsi Cola
And we know that that won't hold you
But remember what we told you
No one else knows what's in store
Remember that we told you."
