The Whistling Song Lyrics
It’s the shadow in the dark
The silver in the park
It’s the broken, faded bird
You’ve learned to call your heart
It’s not a border you can see
Plain as you or me
I don't pull the lock back
And I don’t have the key

It hovers in the living room
Just above the door
It whistles while it hangs there
Feathers drip from every pore
It shows a spectacle of falling
And settles to the floor
It shows a spectacle of falling
And settles to the floor
Settles to the floorEmbed
