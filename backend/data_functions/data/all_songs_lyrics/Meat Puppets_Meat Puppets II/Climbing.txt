Climbing Lyrics
Climb, climb, I always climb
Out of bed in the morning on a mountain made of sand
And I know this doesn't rhyme
But the clutter on the table is getting out of hand

I know that you tried to see me through
But honey, I'm still having trouble
Finding out what's you

Time, time, it's so sublime
Well, they say it's non-existent but it's playing with my mind
And phone calls don't cost a dime
In the caverns of your feelings where the sun will never shine

I know that you tried to see me through
But honey, I'm still having trouble
Finding out what's you

Mine, mine, which things are mine?
Well, I thought I saw a few before I found out I was blind
And I think I see a sign
And it's saying where to go and when I get there what I'll find
I know that you tried to see me through
But honey, I'm still having trouble
Finding out what's you
