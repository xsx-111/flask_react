Lost Lyrics
Lost on the freeway again
Looking for means to an end
Nobody knows which way it's gonna bend
Lost on the freeway again

Walking the breezeways again
Thinking of something, my friend
I've grown tired of living Nixon's mess
Walking the breezeways again

I know there'll come a day
When you'll say that you don't know me
And I know there'll come a time
When there's nothing anybody owes me anymore

Locked in the attic again
Out of the shallow and into the deep end
I've got a wound that I know will never end
Locked in the attic again

I know there'll come a day
When you'll say that you don't know me
I know there'll come a time
When there's nothing anybody owes me anymore

Lost on the freeway again
Looking for means to an end
Nobody knows which way it's gonna bend
Lost on the freeway again

I know there'll come a day
When you'll say that you don't know me
And I know there'll come a time
When there's nothing anybody owes me anymore1Embed
