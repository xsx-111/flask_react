What to Do Lyrics
What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know

Later on, when the TV's on
Later on, in the empty lot
Watch the scene just fade away
And you really don't know
You really don't know...

What to do, yeah
No, you really don't know
You really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah
You really don't know
You really don't know

There's a place where you can go
That's what you sneak your money for
You drink 'em down 'til you fall apart
And you really don't know, you really don't know...
What to do, yeah
You know what to do, you know where to go
You're talking to the people that you don't know
There's na-na-nothing that you don't know
There's na-na-nothing, oh no, you really don't know

What to do, yeah
Man, you really don't know
You really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah, you really don't know
You really don't know

Hurry, people, get on your train
Don't be late for the working day
It takes time to unfold your faith
And you really don't know
You really don't know

What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know what to do
What to do, yeah, I really don't know
I really don't know what to doEmbed
