Word Starts Attack LyricsDays of no reason are up on us
Caught the ways to rage on us
All the things that the new are promised
Has made things that are not for us
Make me wonder was it refer
Makes me wonder was it worth it?
The star stays, smash some mirrors
Words strike on fast, words strike on fast
World start as a crack, we’ll start an attack
Communication was on it
I don’t want to get to
All the things that the new are promised
Has made things that are not for us
The star stays, smash some mirrors
And I get out of this, and I get out of this
And I get out of this, and I get out
And I get out of this, and I get out of this
And I get out of this, and I get out of this
And I get out of this, and I get out of this
And I get out of this, and I get out of thisEmbed
