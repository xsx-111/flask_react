The Right Thing Right Lyrics
Love fights love invading my zero gravity
The crowd grows, and grows illusions
Down on quantity street
High speed on miracles
Way too smart but short on innocence
Woo!
Endorphin heaven, I
I believe it all but I don't feel it

My head's in the south, now
Individual citizen
Hear it!
My heart's in the north, now
Individual citizen

Here is the star, just got lit
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing
Hear me, the wonder of it
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing

Every word's hidden meaning
Loses meaning, now it's so loud I can't receive
And what you're asking
Seems to be a voice so now I can't be reached
And we're, and we're
And we're, and we're
Individual citizens

Here is the star, just got lit
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing
Hear me, the wonder of it
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing

Love finds love
It's following
And what we're after
Seems to be a voice so far it can't be reached

And we're, and we're
And we're, and we're
Individual citizens

Here is the star, just got lit
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing
Hear me, the wonder of it
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing
Here is the star, just got lit
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing
Hear me, the wonder of it
On the right thing, right
We got the right thing1Embed
