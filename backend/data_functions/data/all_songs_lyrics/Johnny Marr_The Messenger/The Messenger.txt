The Messenger Lyrics
To see it in something
Life you want it takes long
To see him so happy, you find you talking if you want

Don’t wanna be a messenger

To see it in something
Your eyes are opened and you’re on
I’m here and I’m ready
My time’s for taking if you want

Who wants to be a messenger?

Who wants to be a messenger?
We could get going
Who wants to be a messenger?
Who wants to be the messenger?
We could get going
Who wants to be a messenger?
We could get on1Embed
