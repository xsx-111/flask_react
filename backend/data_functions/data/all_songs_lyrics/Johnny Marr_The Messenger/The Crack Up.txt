The Crack Up Lyrics
Dogs at the footsteps transform the model teen
Glamour auto maker, disguise the money
A live assembly line, your face will never be the same
Who could ask for more? Who would ask for more?
Come and see how it’s done eating every mistake
Your eyes are dynamite, disguise and dominate
The girl couldn't never get lost, how she gonna be found?
She can find herself, she’s gone and jumped out of it
One fall, she’s out of it

Her smiles are miles of metaphor, don’t crack up, it don't add up
No u-turn, you turn a mean catwalk, so take off, tick tock
Who’s gonna fix your walk?
And you walk when you’re broken up
Take her face off, tick tock, full stop

Don’t you wanna get lost, you know it devastates
Glamour auto monkey, disguise and dominate
The girl couldn't never get lost, how she gonna be found?
Couldn't find herself? One fall and she's out of it
