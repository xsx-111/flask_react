Upstarts Lyrics
Oh oh oh
I feel it coming round
I hear it sounds like
The good life I know
Oh oh oh
I see us running down
Defiance comes
Oh oh oh oh oh

The underground is overground
The overground will pull you down
It's how it goes in these times
How we know is in their eyes

Upstarts, now
Are on their way
Upstarts, now
Have to pay

Oh oh oh
I hear us coming round
Denial comes
Oh oh oh oh oh

Upstarts, now
Are on their way
Upstarts, now
Have to pay
And hear her tell it now
It's so fast

Oh oh oh
I hear us coming round
Oh oh oh
I feel it
Upstarts are on their wayEmbed
