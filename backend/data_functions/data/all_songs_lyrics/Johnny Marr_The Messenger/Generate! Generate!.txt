Generate! Generate! LyricsI placed by and I wonder why, calculate, calculate, calculate
I divide and I multiply, calculate, calculate, calculate
Sensations versus thinking, an equation all good for nothing
Same old song, what’s going on? Calculate, calculate, calculate
I come by and all is fly, generate, generate, generate
You got no how, I got to know now, calculate, calculate, calculate
Sensations versus thinking, oh, no, no, no, it’s beginning
Get her CD, haven’t sworn, generate, generate, generate
That’s the way that go, cascade and unknown
Accelerate and I go, that’s the way that I go, too
Sensations judged thinking, equation no good for nothing
Fast crash fear us some theme, fast track feel us some theme
I can’t get behind a war track mind, calculate, calculate, calculate
Rising suns put you on the re-run, generate, generate, generate
Sensations got me thinking, an equation all good for nothing
God keeps an upper thumb, generate, generate, generate
That’s the way that go, cascade and unknown
Accelerate and I go, close it and I go, too
Sensations judge my thinking, oh, no, no, no good for nothing
Fast crash fearless and theme, flashtrack fear us a theme
Cascade and I go, accelerate and I go
Sensations judge my thinking, oh, no, no, no, it’s beginning
Fast crash fearless and fear, flashtrack fear us a themeEmbed
