Sun & Moon LyricsI hear it snap, hurry up, see
Let’s get rich and get the feeling to have it all
A face that fits you, it really fits you
It’s a snip bruised as a hobbit now
A reason to have it all, here it is, the pillow kids have it all
Take in a car on run, I’ve got an ambition
Broke as fits as mine, we got a television
A reason to have it all, here it is, the pillow kids have it all
Take in a car on run, I’ve got an ambition
Broke as fits as mine, we got a televisionEmbed
