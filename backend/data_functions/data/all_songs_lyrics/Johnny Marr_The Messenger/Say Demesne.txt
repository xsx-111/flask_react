Say Demesne LyricsWe were crawling out of step ground till we walked
Secret for a while, the blood’s okay so we fall
Still my car is so on sell cause you can say to me
Let me get you, they get what they want
But you’re in for love, you’re in for love
And you will find love
You’re in for love, you’ll still find love
But you’re in for love and you will find love
You’re forced, drunk and your memory’s stuck
Crashing into to go back home you forgot
Feel no good, they’re not there, lost and you’re lost
Take down into where she opens your heart
But you’re in for love, you’re in for love
And you will find love
You’re in for love, you’ll still find love
But you’re in for love and you will find love
You’re in for love and you will find loveEmbed
