Lockdown LyricsLook out everyone
I've been pushed hard for too long
Take back what they've done
It's a lockdown
Touch out if we want
Home is a city
It's gone and I'm a loser
And they took back what I want
Another lockdown
Freeze out if we want
Love is a city
A war
And I'm a loser
Can I get back what I want?
In a lost town?
I know I was born between the exit streets
And entry's beats and
A salvage situation
Where nobody goes
An education I still don't know
Coastline of neon
Makes me look out to what's gone
Right now there's no better in this town
Ghosts out tonight
Help me break out of life
These times define me in this town
I know I was born between the angel's streets
And entry's beasts
And someone's situation that's nobody's home
An education that I still don't know
Look out everyone
Freezed out
And we was
Give back
Come on
Lockdown
Oh, touch out everyone
Be fast 'cos we're gone
Come back
It's on another lockdown
A lockdown
