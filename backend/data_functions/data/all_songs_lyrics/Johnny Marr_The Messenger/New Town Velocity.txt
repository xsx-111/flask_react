New Town Velocity LyricsLeft home a mystery, leave school for poetry
I say goodbye to them and me, mission velocity
It made me just run faster now, I'm gonna take it off driving round
Make up my mind, leave the windows down
I'm in something alright, I know
I got to live it up, oh-oh, oh
I can't resist, make for zero, oh, no
It turned out like I said it would, can I get the world right here?
Step up to symphonies, they play on for you and me
When we face that July dawn, the uniforms one on one
No run, we chased that summer down
I'm in something alright, I know
I got to live it up, oh-oh, oh
I canâ€™t resist, make for zero, oh, no
It turned out like I said it would, can I get the world right here?
I can't resist, make for zero, oh, no
It turned out like I said it would, can I get the world right here?
Hello, you mystery, mission velocity
Here comes our poetry, new town velocity, new town velocityEmbed
