Place in the World fades away  Lyrics


O Jesu Christ
Thy Cross doth call me
O Jesu Christ
Thy Cross doth call me
For thou did'st give
Thy life for mine
Thou did'st give
Thy life, for mine

O Jesu Christ
Thy Cross doth call me
For Thou did'st give
Thy life for mine
Jesu Christ, Jesu Christ

O Jesu Christ
Thy Cross doth call me
For Thou did'st give thy life for mine
For Thou, did'st give
Thy life, for mine
Thy Sacred Heart
For me is breaking
Thy Sacred Heart
For me is breaking

For Thee my love at last is waking
For Thee, my love is waking
My life for ever more be thine
My life for ever more be thine
