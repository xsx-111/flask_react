Moths LyricsOh the leaded window opened
To move the dancing candle flame
And the first moths of Summer
Suicidal came, oh suicidal came
And the new breeze chattered
In its May-bud tenderness
Sending water-lilies sailing
As she turned to get undressed
And the long night awakened
And we soared on powdered wings
Circling our tomorrows
In the wary month of Spring
Chasing shadows slipping
In the magic lantern slide
Creatures of the candle
On a night-light ride
Dipping and weaving, flutter
Through the golden needle's eye
In our haystack madness
Butterfly-stroking on a Spring-tide high
Life's too long (as the lemming said)
As the candle burned and the moths were wed
And we'll all burn together as the wick grows higher
Before the candle's dead
Oh the leaded window opened
To move the dancing candle flame
And the first moths of Summer
Suicidal came, oh suicidal came
To join in the worship
Of the light that never dies
In the moment's reflection
Of two moths spinning in her eyes1Embed
