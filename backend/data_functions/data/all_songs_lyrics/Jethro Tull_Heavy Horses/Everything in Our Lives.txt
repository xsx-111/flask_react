Everything in Our Lives LyricsThere's a black cloud on the high rise
And a sulphurous haze below
And the seagulls drift darkly
On the seaway where long ships go
But you and I will have everything in our lives
Yes, you and I, we'll have everything in our lives
There's the sweet sound of oil wells drilling
As the new roads come rolling in
To throw up playing card houses
While the fortune wheel's in spin
And you and I will have everything in our lives
Yes, you and I, we'll have everything in our livеs
Got a new car and a loo en suite
And a wagе rise every second week
Propaganda on a balance sheet
That guarantees everything
There's a black cloud on the high rise
And a sulphurous haze below
And the seagulls drift darkly
On the seaway where long ships go
But you and I will have everything in our lives
Yes, you and I, we'll have everything in our lives
Got a new car and a loo en suite
And a wage rise every second week
Propaganda on a balance sheet
That guarantees everythingEmbed
