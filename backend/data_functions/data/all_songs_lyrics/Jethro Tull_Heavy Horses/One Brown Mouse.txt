One Brown Mouse LyricsSmile your little smile --- take some tea with me awhile
Brush away that black cloud from your shoulder
Twitch your whiskers. Feel that you're really real
Another tea-time --- another day older
Puff warm breath on your tiny hands
You wish you were a man who every day can turn another page
Behind your glass you sit and look at my ever-open book ---
One brown mouse sitting in a cage
Do you wonder if I really care for you ---
Am I just the company you keep ---
Which one of us exercises on the old treadmill ---
Who hides his head, pretending to sleep?
Smile your little smile --- take some tea with me awhile
And every day we'll turn another page
Behind our glass we'll sit and look at our ever-open book ---
