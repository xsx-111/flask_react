Rover Lyrics
I chase your every footstep and I follow every whim
When you call the tune I'm ready to strike up the battle hymn
My lady of the meadows
My comber of the beach
You've thrown the stick for your dog's trick but it's floating out of reach

The long road is a rainbow and the pot of gold lies there
So slip the chain and I'm off again
You'll find me everywhere
Cause I'm a Rover

As the robin craves the summer to hide his smock of red
I need the pillow of your hair in which to hide my head
I'm simple in my sadness, resourceful in remorse
Then I'm down straining at the lead
Holding on a windward course

The long road is a rainbow and the pot of gold lies there
So slip the chain and I'm off again
You'll find me everywhere
Cause I'm a Rover

Strip me from the bundle of balloons at every fair:
Colourful and carefree
Designed to make you stare
But I'm lost and I'm losing the thread that holds me down
And I'm up hot and rising in the lights of every town

The long road is a rainbow and the pot of gold lies there
So slip the chain and I'm off again
You'll find me everywhere
Cause I'm a RoverEmbed
