It Shits!!! LyricsTuck the phone in the crack of my sheets 'cause I'm not getting up today
Television down, turn the clock around 'cause you're not getting up today
We're gonna sleep late and get breakfast
We're gonna tell our bosses we're sick
It really shits that I only get to see you for an hour and a half everyday
And it really really shits that that hour and a half isn't really very good anyway
Because I'm burnt, because you're angry
We watch three quarters of a movie
And pass out on opposite halves of a couch, of a couch, of a couch, of a couch, of a couch
Pass out on opposite halves of a really long couch, yeah
Pass out on opposite halves of a couch, of a couch, of a couch, of a couch, of a couch
Pass out on opposite halves of a really long couch
I wanna live on a float in the middle of a swimming pool
I'm sorry, all my friends, I'd trade anything for this
I've always got a good book and it's always the summer
And I'm not hiding in the bathroom just to catch up on sleep like a creep, it shits, okay?
When you wake up at every train stop
And when you sleep through just your train stop
You gotta push yourself so hard that you're gonna burn out
Until you feel so fucking burnt that you just sit around
Evenings, weekends, I just wanna sit here
Please send me more sick days, sick days
I wanna live on a float in the middle of a swimming pool
I'm sorry, all my friends, I'd trade anything for this
Eating fries, drinking beers in the summer, in a swimming pool
I'm sorry, all my friends, I'd trade anything for this
I'm burnt, I'm gone, I don't know what I'm on
It shits, it shits, okay?
I'm burnt, I'm gone, I don't know what I'm on
It shits, it shits, okay?
I'm burnt, I'm gone, I don't know what I'm on
It shits, it shits, okay?
I'm burnt, I'm gone, I don't know what I'm on
It shits, it shits, okay?Embed
