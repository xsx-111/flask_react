Sort of Like Being Pumped LyricsI saw the sunset from the front of the J train tonight
The subway stopped and stammered and I couldn't get my footing right
I tied my scarf for the walk home, the sun went down about 5:45
But I saw the sunset tonight
I saw the sunset from the front of the J train tonight
I saw an Asian boy staring out the window at the light
We didn't see a single sunrise at 6:30 AM, it's been a cloudy week and cold as ice
But I saw, but I saw, but I saw, but I saw, but I saw the sun set over the tracks tonight
I saw the sunset from the front of the J train tonight
I took a couple pictures and the workers thought that I wasn't quite right
I see them every day, we all battle for a seat, it's been a long damn week, we gotta rest our tired feet
But I saw, but I saw, but I saw, but I saw, but I saw the sunset
But I saw, but I saw, but I saw, but I saw, but I saw the sunset
I saw messages that say that life's better than this
I followed it down to the ground and took a seat with the other stiffs
I faced my weekend fright, looked forward to my Friday night
I let me worries burn likes flies inside the fire and the lights
When I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw the sunset
When I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw the sunset
When I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw the sunset
When I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw the sunset
When I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw the sunset
When I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw, when I saw the sunsetEmbed
