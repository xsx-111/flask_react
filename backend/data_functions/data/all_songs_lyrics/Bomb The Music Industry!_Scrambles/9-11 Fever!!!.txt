9/11 Fever!!! LyricsWe can’t forget 3,000 lives
We got the flag to prove it
We got the sticker and the bracelet
We got a list of specials and we set the DVR so we won’t miss it
We waste no time
I got the fever for a feature
A new target for a campaign speech
And a couple cents off at the pump tonight
You want the action hit of the summer
Where Nick Cage really learns something
Or the made-for-TV suspense-thriller
Where the pimp from Taxi Driver is attacking Clinton’s credibility?
Or how about some amateur footage of southern Virginians crying to the camera
And shopping at Rite-Aid, buying flags to translate what they gotta prove on this year’s anniversary
We’re mourning the loss, oh what can you do
But make the evening news logo red white and blue?
I got the fever for a feature
A new target for a campaign speech
And another moot point on the floor tonight
I got the fever for a feature
A holiday for a high school teacher
And a couple cents off at the pump tonightEmbed
