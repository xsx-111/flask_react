25! LyricsI walked two miles in the rain in a suit, my feet torn up by my father's shoes
Receipts and cards tumble out of my pocket to the floor of the station, I still don't have a wallet
Up a flight of stairs to Herald Square, the umbrellas of New York take up too much air
So we just walk real slow at double-arms-length, in unison
My mom dragged me to the doctor today, I've had a cough for a month and it won't go away
I've been sleeping on floors for three hours a day and I've got no insurance so she has to pay
I can't talk to my friends because I'm embarrassed
That I keep sliding back down, I keep getting depressed
We got our ideals but no way to achieve them
We got our degree but got no means to use it
Weâ€™re swimming in debt with no way to surmount it
We got thirty bucks and we spend it on whiskey
We got credit cards, so we got a new TV
We got mobile phones but no minutes, so text me
Get out of my way because I'm 25
And I still act like I'm 10
I'm 25 and I don't learn from my mistakes
So I make them again and again and again and again and again
We swallow our pride over piles of problems
We whine and complain but we don't try to solve them
We're reaching for answers but nobody's got them
Get out of my way because I'm 25
And I still act like I'm 10 goddamn years old
I'm 25
And I still act like I'm 10 goddamn years oldEmbed
