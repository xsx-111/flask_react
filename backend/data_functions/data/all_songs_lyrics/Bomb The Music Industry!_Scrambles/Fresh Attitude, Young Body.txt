Fresh Attitude, Young Body LyricsApartment at dusk, a gray Brooklyn sky
A train that I'm missing
A cheap travel mug that leaks from the side
Damp coat and mittens
If you don't find a steady job now, if you don't find a steady job now, oh no
If you don't find someone to love now, if you don't find someone to love now, oh no
You will die freezing cold and alone
You will die freezing cold and alone
They've got full blown homes, they're married with kids and appliances
I'm doing dishes
Alone in your car, the heat doesn't work
Baby, we're scramblin'
If you don't find a steady job now, if you don't find a steady job now, oh no
If you don't find someone to love now, if you don't find someone to love now, oh no
You're alone and you're wet in a hospital bed
And your family and friends will inherit your debt
As you breathe from machines, yeah, I know it sounds mean
But you're probably gonna die alone
If you don't find a clock to punch now
Or find yourself a steady fuck now
Oh, no
Your family and friends will inherit your debt
And you're probably gonna die alone
Yeah, your family and friends will inherit your debt
And you're probably gonna die aloneEmbed
