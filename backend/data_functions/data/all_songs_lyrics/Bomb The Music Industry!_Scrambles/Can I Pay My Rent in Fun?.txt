Can I Pay My Rent in Fun? LyricsYou took a little every day until I didn't have shit
Two years off and on and not even the chance to quit
Just a letter on the fridge
That I got from human resources
I know that six weeks was kind of a bit much
And that nothing is forever and that nothing should be
Someday it all stops, and I can't sleep now
Because I'm not a real fucking adult
But I guess I'll have my life from 7:00 to 6:45
Marie, Marie, Marie, I'm sorry I've been too busy
For the promise of an unfulfilling life
The risks I took were mine to take
We couldn't communicate in anything but rote responses and shit eating grins
And everything starts dwindling when it's all built on
Power trips and pandering, power trips and pandering
The letter arrived yesterday, I didn't have a drop to drink
I had to play and drive four hours to Brooklyn
To my apartment of dirty shit
And a thousand lonely days ahead
But I guess now I'll have my life
With red and blackout of my eyes
Marie, Marie, Marie I'm really stoked you set me free
From the promise of an unfulfilling life
Where I can pay my bills and pass out at eleven and not
Wake up in the morning and start feeling bad
Worst case of the Mondays that I've ever had
Though I treat every weekday like a Saturday night
Except for drinks I can't afford
A can of Shmidty's, nothing more
I need some more security
Than that provided by choosing between a job you hate
A job you hate and a job that doesn't pay
I got too caught up with me to behave responsibly
Michael, Nathan and Christine, I've got no rent, Marie, Marie!
I was arguing with cops while I had a fake mustache on
Poorly handling emotions while swimming naked in the ocean
Breaking bottles on stranger's floors and leaving without our fucking passports
Drinking gin and Zicam until 2 AM while playing Rock Band
Inviting myself into homes of strangers to drink all alone
Leaving sweat-soaked boxers on a bar 'cause they said "put a t-shirt on"
Acting irresponsibly and trying to make a choice between
A job you hate and a job that doesn't pay1Embed
