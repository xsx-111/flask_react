$2,400,000 LyricsI know what it looks like
The ship's not capsizing
The driver's just drunk
Or asleep at the wheel
The map is illegible, we spilled beers all over it
We're all piss poor heroes, we're aching to drown in a sea of bad metaphors, trite, overused
Well, I'm sorry, I guess talking just gets me confused
Dang, dang
Dang, dang
And as a result
Conversations don't start
They sputter and stammer
They spiral like shit
Trying to go down the drain but keeps spinning 'cause forces
Are making it stay and I don't wanna talk 'cause you don't understand
This wasn't for anyone, I just wanted something that
Wasn't prepackaged and that wasn't pre-planned
And now my only plan that is damn sure to happen
Is slowly decaying on a shelf filled with millionaires
Saving the future in a sweet fucking press release
Gloating on pedestals, you can't make a change
Unless you're there bragging
Unless you're a dick about
Something that's pure to you
Always gets fucked
Hey!
Hey!
"Google my name, 'cause kid, I've got credentials
My pop's a big shit and I can get you free long distance
My co-op is awesome, my fixed gear's ridiculous
Stop smiling and stop frowning, I always thought you'd be different"
And there's been talk of leaving for good, but how, to where?
And what happens when they show up there with friends, show up there with friends?
Can you afford to leave again?
Afford to leave again
And there's been talk of leaving for good, but how, to where?
And what happens when they show up there with friends, show up there with friends?
Can you afford to leave again?
Afford to leave againEmbed
