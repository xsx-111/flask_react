Gang of Four Meets the Stooges (but Boring) LyricsThere's nothing new about the old sound
Regardless of what you say
The world is looking on like
"Really, again? Okay, okay"
We jumped on late, we both live far away
Okay, but it's 700 vs. 2K
And when there's a lot of money, you can split things two ways
When you put us on last and late, assholes, we're getting paid
Paid!
Paid!
Paid
We didn't bring this shitty attitude
But our kids still came
And yo, I heard that friends and bands and human beings
Are supposed to help each other out, okay?
Okay?
Okay?
Okay?
Okay?
Even twenty bucks could have fixed this up
A gesture, something
We'll feel super posi when there's
Sugar in your gas tank
Stink bombs at your CMJ convention
No one bought your record
No one wants to buy pretention
We're eating pizza in New York
We're drinking beers with our best friends
We're not looking over shoulders
Karma is the shitEmbed
