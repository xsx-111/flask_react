(Shut) Up the Punx!!! LyricsI know it’s hypocritical to point fingers at the people who point fingers
But when we all march to the beat of the same different drummer
Yeah, the steps start to come off like clockwork
I guess I’m saying we could stand to be nicer
Because when you’re in a basement talking shit and interspersing it with speaking in name drops and units
I must admit I’m not the best when on the defensive, I’d rather steal your whiskey than your heart in conversation
I’d rather break three strings a song than stick to a routine like I’m ripe for the picking after growing on a tree
And then talk about the industry, cross-market positivity with vinyl nerds and brightly colored, quirky messy record sleeves
I’d rather be vomiting and I despise vomiting
Blugh
But thanks for the beer. I appreciate your time but can we talk about something else?
If you really think that you and I are on the same page, you can go ahead and fuck yourself
Because you’ve got coke and good looks, I’ve got overdue library books
So let’s be friends and change the subject now
‘Cause the last thing I wanna be is another negative asshole
Like God speaks through my acoustic guitar and I’ve got the perfect set of morals
On a dry erase board at the front of the house
Follow these conditions or we'll kick your ass out
Vegans only, no meat allowed
Straight edge only, no drinking allowed
Fixed gears only, no three-speeds allowed
Me, me, me, I'm smart, I'm right, I'm smart!
I think it’s dumb when you take the inherently fun like riding bikes and singing songs and say they’re not for everyone
As if for your whole life you were cool as shit
Punk tourist
‘Cause you still beg for cash cause you spent your parents’ last on a Greyhound to the Fest
And your jacket says Crass but I don’t give an ass, I’m not giving you fifty cents
So that you can buy a forty and destroy a hotel party
And the man who cleans your mess up shrugs and says
This non-conformity looks like conformity
Like boring, nice people pose threats to your authority
This positivity is negativity
And you boys sure left me with a mess to clean
Smile big, hug bigger, talk big, act bigger
Stop judging, do something, shut the fuck up, do something
Instead of sneering at somebody because they're not stealing
Buy a troubled friend a drink at the bar and tip well
Don’t spend your time scoffing when you do that you’re just scoffing
Like the people who scoff at us while defending our community
You’re a teacher, you’re a parent, you’re the head of a dictatorship
When the ground is covered up in rules you’re guaranteed to power trip
This non-conformity looks like conformity
Why should anyone believe in our community?
This organization doesn’t feel like anarchy
‘Cause we’re suiting up to have the same identity
And the boring, nice people say shut up the punx, shut up the punx!
All the people who have barbecues to feed their friends and family
Shut up the punx, shut up the punx!
All the people writing zines with information, not just blaming things
Shut up the punx, shut up the punx!
All the boys and girls are fed up with just saying that we're punk
We say shut up the punx, shut up the punx!Embed
