Shake! Lyrics
Shake!

Hey, hey people what you come here for?
Come on everybody, let's get out on the floor
All the pretty girls shaking what they got
The boys swear to God that they're all too hot

Everybody shake
You got to shake something, my lord
Shake!
You got to shake something

Come on pretty baby now don't be shy
New liberated girl, ask a guy
We can go dancing, baby, every night
(Shake! Shake, shake shake! Shake!)
But you got to shake your body until the early, early light

Everybody shake
(Shake, shake, shake)
You got to shake something, my lord
Shake!
(Shake, shake, shake)
You got to shake something
Sing with me now
Oooh-ooh
Lucy's standing there with the false hair on
Don't shake it to hard or that hair will be gone
Marilyn's so worried about her two left feet
Pretty thing keeps worrying about keeping on the beat

That don't matter y'all, come on
Shake! Oh lord. You got to shake something
Everybody shake
(Shake, shake, shake)
You got to shake something
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shake!
Come on, y'all
You got to shake something
Shake!
(Shake, shake, shake)

Every-everybody
Hey, hey, people what you come here for?
(We want to shake something)
Come on everybody let's get out on the floor
(Got to shake something)
You shake it to the north, you can shake it to the south
(Got to shake something)
(Somebody help me with this)
Shake!
If you come to party now open up your mouth
(You got to shake something)
Come on, oh yeah, yeah
Shake! Shake
(You got to shake something)
Oh don't stop, oh
Shake!
(Shake, shake, shake)
Shake!
(Shake on it... for me)
Shake!
You're hired, ket's go
Shake! Shake!
Got to shake somethingEmbed
