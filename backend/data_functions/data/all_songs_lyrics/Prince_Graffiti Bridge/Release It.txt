Release It Lyrics
Yo Stella, if you think I'm afraid of you
Grace, if you so much as think I can't do the do
Girl, if you dream I came to jerk around
You better wake up and release it
Party people in the crib get hyped
Let's get this party funking right, come on, (Hey), come on
(Release it) Listen to me now, release it (Hey)
Come, come, come on, release it

Who's crib is this? (My crib)
Who's wine you drinking? (Mine)
Who asked your ugly ass what time it was? (Nobody)
Because we doing fine
Take it all off - bass
I need the funk in my face
I can't stand tight asses in my place
Let's get hyped y'all
Release it

(Hey, release it)
(Hey) What time it is? Band
It's time to get sleazy up in here
Mary Sweet Mother Jesus
Talk that talk, Morris
Oh stella, I know you came alone
Because it isn't just any man qualified to take you home
Me? No I'm not a man. Jerome? He's an adventure
Oh! Somebody slap me
I don't know. Party people in the crib get hyped. (Hey)
Party people in the crib get hyped. (Hey)
Release it. Yes
(Hey, release it, hey)
Jerome? (Yo)
When this solo's through, Jerome? (Morris?)
Find me a stella to rap to. (Yes) (Hey, hey)

Who's beat is this? (My beat)
Who's horns are these blowing? (Mine)
Who asked your dumb ass how to catch a groove? (Nobody)
Because we doing the do. Jerome. (Yes?)
Who's Stella is this? (My Stella)
Who's Stella is this? (My Stella)
Then what's she doing over here with me? (Umm)
Then what's she doing over here with me? (Umm)
Who told you that women like men with no money?
Release it, boy
Go on stella, dance
Say man, back up, give me some room
Dance, shake it like a peckerwood
(Release it)
Over and over and over and over and over and over
Your girlfriends told you that I'm the rover
But I'm here to scold ya that if you live alone
Then we can bone (Hey)
Give me a number to phone, you groan
And I am so, if you say no
Instead of crying, I'll keep trying
Until you're dying to have me for your own
So peep stella, peep stella
If you think that I'm afraid of you, (Do it, MD)
If you think that I'm afraid of you, (Rap to her)
If you think that I can't do the do (Yeah, papa)
If you think that I can't do the do (Woo)
If you think I came to jerk around (Don't say it)
You better wake up stella, (Wake up) this is my town

(Release it)
Man, let them drums kick
Let's get the hell out of here
Let's do it
(Release it, hey)
Motherfucker, get your ass out of my way
(Hey, hey, release it)
(Hey, hey, release it)
(Hey, hey, release it)Embed
