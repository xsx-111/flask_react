Graffiti Bridge Lyrics
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Something to believe in, a reason to believe that there's a heaven above
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love

Everybody wants to find the perfect one
Someone that makes you happy, someone that makes you laugh when you want to cry
Everybody wants to find the perfect one
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love

The love of a boy, the love of a girl
The love that comes from a warm heart in a cold cold world
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Something to believe in, a reason to believe that there's a heaven above
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
(people throw away your arms of fire)
A bridge of many colors
A bridge that leads them to a love they know is real
(let democracy take you higher)
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Everybody's looking for (if you believe)
Everybody's looking for (wave your hands)
Everybody's looking for love (on the power of love)
(Love is shining)
(everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge)
There's a future (sure, you're right) a future worth fighting for
I'm a living witness
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Ooo, everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love

There is a future (a future worth fighting for)
Worth fighting for
Yes it is, I know it is
Everything will be alright
Everybody wants to find Graffiti BridgeEmbed
