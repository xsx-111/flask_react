We Can Funk Lyrics
Jump them and funk them
Pump them and funk them
We can funk

I'm testing positive for the funk
I'll gladly pee in anybody's cup
And may your cup overflow
I'm testing positive and I'll pee some more

I could tell you stories until you get tired
I could play with your mind
But you'd probably say that I was a liar
So I won't waste your time
I'm scared because though we just met there's this energy between us
Let's just go somewhere, we can funk

I'm testing positive for the funk
I'll gladly pee in anybody's cup
And may your cup overflow
I'm testing positive and I'll pee some more

Pump them and funk them
Pump them and funk them
Jump them and funk them
Pump them and funk them
Pump them and funk them
Every time I could, I would compliment you on the things
The things that you be, honey doll, we should make the real noise, just you and me
I could tell you things to get you excited, things you never heard
You know the Kama Sutra?
I could re-write it with half as many words
But I'm scared, because if I don't kiss you, I'm going to go mad baby
Take off my clothes
We can funk

I'm testing positive for the funk
I'll gladly pee in anybody's cup
And may your cup overflow

Wait a minute. Let me turn on some lights. We can funk
Yeah, come here
You can blow the candle off baby
You can turn the candle on
Which ever one you choose is alright
Because we're going to do it all night long
(sex) sex between two people is alright
If all the love in the world is what they got
As long as they're not trying to hurt nobody
Just as long as it's hot
Good lord, baby, I want to make love to you two times maybe three
Yeah, if you want to go four or 5, baby that's alright with me
Listen, I said I will be your little baby
Yeah, I can be your big strong man
I can be your girl or boy, I can be your toy
Alright, let's dance
It's up to you can funk me baby. I'll funk you. We can funk one another
Whatever you want to do
You got electric ass baby
You got electric thighs baby
I can't wait no longer child
It's getting stronger, baby
Open up your eyes

See this gold chain around my waist
I want to give it to you
Yeah, people tell me I got no taste
Then blow the candle out, let's see if it's true

We be funking over here, and over there ain't shit
We be funking over here, and over there ain't shitEmbed
