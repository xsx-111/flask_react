New Power Generation (Pt. II) Lyrics
Don't pick my apples, don't pick my peaches
(we are the new power generation)
Leave my tree alone...leave it alone...leave it alone
(we are the new power generation)
Don't you look at me
(we are the new power generation)
If you're sad and you know it and you think you want to blow it
Let your feelings out, love is there

Just go!
Kid! Yo Kid!
I got to do this, I got the noise, I got to do this
So pump the big noise, come on in the house

This here rap's about the true confession
If you listen close you about to learn a lesson
You must know failure before success
Now this is the failure I must confess (well)
I was hanging onto life trying deal with this
Playing the games, almost got dismissed
Cocaine was the thing that I took on
And nowhere was the place that I was going (preacher, cmon on)
I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed for the kill, steal, destroy, and die
Top to the bottom to bottom to top
Success is where I'm headed there is no doubt
Success is something that we all want
But the truth is what we need to reach our point
I had to give this message the so-called truth
I hope it's something in it that's there for you
(Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight 
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight )

Like I told ya before, I'm a tell you again
Success is something that's deep within
So remember the truth you can't go wrong
The flesh is weak and the spirit is strong
I know it to do this rap, and I know its right
Because I did it in the name of Jesus Christ
(come on somebody lets party tonight)
Party tonight! (oh yeah!)

You want me to what?? (shake!)
What? (shake! shake!)
Awww, right
The New Power Generation has just taken controlEmbed
