Elephants & Flowers Lyrics
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night
He's looking for some action, he's looking for a fight
He's looking for a saviour in a city full of fools
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking to
Can we talk baby?

Strip down, strip down
I think I'm going to fall in love tonight
Elephants and flowers

Hot sweaty light paints a picture red and gold
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls
How can he find a shy angel in a city so bold (so bold)
He can't even find a place for dance, this is rock and roll

Strip down, strip down
Elephants and flowers
Is everybody ready? Here we go

Love the one who is love, (love)
The one who gives us the power, (power)
The one who made everything, (what?)
Elephants and flowers (what will he do?)
The one who will listen when all others will not
There will be peace for those who love god a lot
Elephants and flowers
Strip down
Think I'm going to fall in love tonight

When I do, there won't be no more (confusion)
There won't be no more (no tears)
There won't be no more enemies, so that eliminates all the fear
And there won't be no sorrow, (sorrow)
There won't be no pain, (no pain)
There won't be no ball and no chain

Strip down, strip down
Elephants and flowers

Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night
He's looking for an angel to hold him until the morning light
Here we go

Love the one who is love (love)
The one who gives us the power, (power)
The one who made everything (what?)
Elephants and flowers (what will he do?)
The one who will listen when all others will not
There will be peace for those who love god a lot
Here we go
Love the one who is love (love)
The one who gives us the power, (power)
The one who made everything (what?)
Elephants and flowers (what will he do?)
The one who will listen when all others will not
There will be peace for those who love god a lot2Embed
