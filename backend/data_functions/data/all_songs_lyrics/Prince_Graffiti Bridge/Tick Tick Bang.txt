Tick Tick Bang Lyrics
Ooh, I can't hold it
Ow! Bang, b-b-bang, bang
Bang

You, yeah
You're such a big tease, you get me all excited
All excited then you go home
You're like ice cream
Knew I got to get you, got to get you, before you're all gone

You're such a bombshell
And if I ever get you, ever get you, ever get you
There's no telling how long I'd last
Before I tick, tick bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bang

You are no cheap thrill
Every time you tick I'd rather you bang
But you leave me in a fire sweat (leave me in a fire sweat)
You're like a good pill
All I need is to, and I'm so into you, you're the best stuff that I could get
You're such a bombshell
And if I ever get you, ever get you, ever get you
There's no telling how long I'd last
Before I tick, tick bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bang

Ooh, I can't hold it
Ooh, it's getting all over me
Ooh, I can't hold it
Ooh, it's getting all over me

You're such a queen bee
Let me taste your honey, taste your honey, taste your honey, for it go bad
You're so slippery
Like this chain around my hip, I want a 24k relationship
So baby don't spit me out, tick, tick, bang, all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang
Ooh, I can't hold it. Ooh, it's getting all over me

You're such a bombshell
And if I ever get you, ever get you, ever get you
There's no telling how long I'd last
Before I tick, tick bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bangEmbed
