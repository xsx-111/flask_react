Return of the Phantom Stranger LyricsShape shifting high
And a haunted eye
Falling plastic and paper demons!
No trace of time
I'm branded sly
I am your ghostmaster baby free me
All you know
Is alone
You see a
Phantom Stranger!
Down you go
All alone
You love my
Phantom Stranger!
My sinister sounds
Sweep the grounds
Still-born I lie beneath it
I throw it away
The freaks all stay
Deformed and laughing screaming!
All you know
Is alone
You see a
Phantom Stranger!
Down you go
All alone
You love my
Phantom Stranger!
She lies there, waiting for the sacrifice
A wretched heart
In the dark decay
Dominate forever...
Destroy the things you love
And see if I remember
All you know
Is alone
You see a
Phantom Stranger!
Down you go
All alone
You love my
Phantom Stranger!Embed
