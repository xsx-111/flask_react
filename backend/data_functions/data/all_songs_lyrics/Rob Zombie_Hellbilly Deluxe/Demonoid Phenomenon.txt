Demonoid Phenomenon Lyrics
Donâ€™t lie to yourself. It gave you pleasure!
Hold the door, woman!

Hell on earth
For what it's worth
Dead on dreaming
You started screaming
The wizard of how
The king of now
Cry like a banshee
And die like you want me

Violator (hey!)
Desecrator (hey!)
Turn around and meet the hater
Violator (hey!)
Desecrater (hey!)
Turn around and...

Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on
Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on
The conquering worm
The slithering germ
Lost in the black sleep
I see how the gods weep
The horror of madness
The terminal sadness
The cool air of mourning
Gave me that warning

Violator (hey!)
Desecrator (hey!)
Turn around and meet the hater
Violator (hey!)
Desecrator (hey!)
Turn around and...
You enjoyed that dead girl's body!

Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on
Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on

Violator (hey!)
Desecrator (hey!)
Turn around and meet the hater
Violator (hey!)
Desecrater (hey!)
Turn around and...
(Hey! Hey!)

Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on
Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!Embed
