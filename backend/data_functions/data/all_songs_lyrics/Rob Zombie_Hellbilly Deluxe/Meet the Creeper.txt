Meet the Creeper Lyrics(Intro)
"The devil is in all of you!"
(Verse 1)
Creature core you can't ignore
Got a 5000 fingers of dead, yeah
Rats are we, you can't break free
When they're livin' on your breath, yeah
(Chorus 1)
Meet the Creeper
Dig in deeper
Meet the Creeper
Yeah, yeah!
(Chorus 2)
I see the dead in your eyes!
I transform in the skies!
(Verse 2)
Rabid eye, the cities cry
Like a dagger fallin' on your baby
Thrill the kill, I know you will
Feed the monster and the lady
(Chorus 1)
Meet the Creeper
Dig in deeper
Meet the Creeper
Yeah, yeah!
(Chorus 2)
I see the dead in your eyes!
I transform in the skies!
(Verse 1)
Creature core you can't ignore
Got a 5000 fingers of dead, yeah
Rats are we, you can't break free
When they're livin' on your breath, yeah
(Chorus 1)
Meet the Creeper
Dig in deeper
Meet the Creeper
Yeah, yeah!
(Chorus 2)
I see the dead in your eyes!
I transform in the skies!
(Outro)
Meet the Creeper (ahhhh)
Meet the Creeper (ahhhh)
Meet the Creeper (ahhhh)
