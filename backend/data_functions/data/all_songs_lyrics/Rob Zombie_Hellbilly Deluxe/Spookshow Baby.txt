Spookshow Baby Lyrics(Verse 1)
High noon, dead moon
Hangin' all over you, yeah
Devil man, yes I can
Cut a little piece of you, yeah
(Bridge)
Hunger! (Inside you)
Hunger!
Hunger! (Destroy you)
Hunger!
(Verse 2)
Swift might, dead night
That's all right for you, yeah
Voodoo man, yes I can
Tear it all down for you, yeah
(Chorus)
She's a killer!
She's a thriller!
Spookshow baby
She's a killer!
She's a thriller!
Spookshow baby
(Verse 3)
Red rain, no pain
Fallin' down over you, yeah
Wicked man, yes I can
Walkin' all over you, yeah
(Bridge)
Hunger! (Inside you)
Hunger!
Hunger! (Destroy you)
Hunger!
(Chorus)
She's a killer!
She's a thriller!
Spookshow baby
She's a killer!
She's a thriller!
Spookshow baby
(Verse 4)
Bright glove, mad love
Movin' all over you, yeah
Psycho man, yes I can
Do it all over for you, yeah
(Chorus)
She's a killer!
She's a thriller!
Spookshow baby
She's a killer!
She's a thriller!
Spookshow babyEmbed
