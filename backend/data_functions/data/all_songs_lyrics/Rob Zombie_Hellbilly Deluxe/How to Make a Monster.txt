How to Make a Monster LyricsShe freak out at a damaged life like a jailbait in the park
A teenage wolf with a bloody knife goin' down in the dark
How to make a monster baby, how to get it on
How to make a monster baby, how to get it on
Go go zombie, go go yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah
Go go zombie, go go yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Roots in hell and only time will tell if your baby is insane
A child bride with bloody eyes got Satan on the brain
How to make a monster baby, how to get it on
How to make a monster baby, how to get it on
Go go zombie, go go yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Go go zombie, go go yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
