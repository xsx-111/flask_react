Skin & Bones LyricsYou know, and I've been wondering
You know, all the way home
Whether the world will see
I'm a better man than others by far
And you know, I've had it so good
Yeah but how loathsome
It's not quite my style
Work and vanity
Wasted my time inside
Oh, you see me in a cardigan
In a dress, dress, dress that I've been sick on
Oh, how are you?
Can't say I really care at the end of it all
Actually, oh, well there's something I've found
It's that we're just flesh and blood
Well, now, just one thing I've found
It's that we're just flesh and blood
And you know, and I've been wondering
You know, all the way home
Whether the world will see
I'm a better man than others by far
Ooh, how are you?
I shan't say I really care at the end of it all
Actually, oh, there is something I've found
It's that we're just flesh and blood
Well, now, there's one thing I've found
It's that we're just skin and bones
Actually, oh, there's something I've found
It's that we're just flesh and blood
And we're nothing much more
There's something, just something I've found
It's that we're just flesh and blood
And we're nothing much more
Oh no, what did I do wrong?
Oh no, what did I do wrong?
Individual doubts
Just one thing I've found
We are just flesh and blood
Nothing much more
Something, just something I've found
That we're skin and bones
Yeah...Embed
