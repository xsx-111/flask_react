A Certain Someone LyricsLive your life, have your say
Read your stars, day by day
If I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me
Oh, live your life, go your way
And I said, "Oh no"
Live your life, stake your claim
Wash your clothes, change your name
Ooh, and I said, "Oh, no, no"
If I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me
You're too twisted by half
But that's far enough
So live your life, build a home
And fill it full of flowers and a bottle of old cologne
Yeah, if I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me
Except perhaps a certain someone (x5)
Just to be shown another way out
You're too twisted by half
But that's far enough
I would be careful living in a block of flats
And I'd never take the lift to the top
No, I'd never take the lift to the top
You're too twisted by half
But that's far enough
Take a swim 'round, take a look down
I'll never believe what we've found
We figured it out, we figured it out
We lived in a house, in a cold roomEmbed
