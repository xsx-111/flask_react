I Kicked A Boy Lyrics
When the weather's fine, when it's sunny outside
Think about the time I kicked a boy 'til he cried
Oh, I could've been wrong, but I don't think I was
He's such a child
When I am alone, I remember so well
How merrily I tripped a boy so he fell
Oh I could've been wrong, but I don't think I was
He's totally wild

And I've been wondering lately just who's gonna save me

Now I have a cold, and no story to tell
I'd marry you but I'm so unwell
And I could've been wrong
Well I don't think I was
He's totally wild

And I've been wondering lately
Just who's gonna save me
Yes, you should've been wise
Oh, hysterical child
Where'd you learn to do thatEmbed
