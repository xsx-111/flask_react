Bad Kingdom Lyrics
Here it ends
No one’s gonna shed a tear
No need to shout
Just to stand the silence

(A) well spent time
In the early morning’s haze
You sit and wait
Watching full glasses through blank eyes

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind
This is not
What you wanted, oh
Not
What you had in mind

Vacuous winter stare
Worn out version of yourself
Too tough to fall
But not strong enough to turn
But not strong enough to turn
But not strong enough to turn
This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind
This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind
This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind
(Ahh ahh ahh ahh)
Ooh ooh ahh ooh ooh10Embed
