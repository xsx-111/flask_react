Last Time LyricsWhen I was dead asleep
Behind towering walls
They built a world outside
And I missed the wake-up call
My stony breath crawled
To glory heavens be
There was a sea of sound
But it was silence
That stole my sleep
When I was dead asleep
Behind towering walls
They built a world outside
And I missed the wake-up call
When I break cripple legs
Through long winding streets
Fill me with suffering
And the people
Would see right through meEmbed
