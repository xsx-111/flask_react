Damage Done Lyrics
Scratch the words with false inspiration
A thorn buried deep in my side
Split lips cracked and parted
Pearly teeth cleft in half

I see the damage I’ve done
Rip the tongue from my hide
I see the damage I've done
Rip the tongue from my hide

I go out and stare at the sunlight
Until the tears stain my eyes
Find answers of questions unwanted
Scars decay from my mind

Now I see the damage I’ve done
Rip the tongue from my hide
Now I see the damage I’ve done
Rip the tongue from my hide

Oh I see the damage I’ve done
Rip the tongue from my hide
No I see the damage I’ve done
Rip the tongue from my hideEmbed
