The Oath LyricsBy the symbol of the creator, I swear henceforth to be
A faithful servant of his most puissant arch-angel
The prince Lucifer, whom the creator designated as his regent
And Lord of this world, Amen
I deny Jesus Christ, the deceiver
And I abjure the Christian faith
Holding in contempt all of it's works
As a being now possessed of a human body
In this world I swear to give my full allegiance
To it's lawful master to worship him
Our Lord oh, Satan and no other
In the name of Satan, the ruler of earth
Open wide the gates of hell and come forth from the abyss
By these names, oh, Satan, Leviathan
Belial, Lucifer, I will kiss the goat
I swear to, to give my mind
My body and soul unreservedly
To the furtherance of our Lord
Our Lord Satan, where Satan's designs
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be
A world without end, AmenEmbed
