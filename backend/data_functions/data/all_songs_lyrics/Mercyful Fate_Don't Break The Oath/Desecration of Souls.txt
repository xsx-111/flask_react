Desecration of Souls Lyrics
Stay away white magician, young lovers
And mourning wife
You're not welcome on our land
So I speak for the dead

Magic circles drawn after midnight
Around graves to be opened
He'll use the wand to raise a body
He'll ask the questions and he'll burn the remains

It's desecration of souls in their holy lair

Copulation in the night
Two shadows upon a grave
Screams of pleasure and screams of pain
Young lovers, you must be insane

It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
So I say again: stay away, it's desecration of souls

Dyin' flowers upon the grave
Of a husband who's lost his maid
She's there on duty, and the tears she cries
They don't belong where the flowers lie
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
So I say again: stay away, it's desecration of soulsEmbed
