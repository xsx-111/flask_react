Welcome Princess of Hell LyricsI turn off the lights, we like darkness
Now you call my name, you finally came
Even in the night I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
Now I see you clear, we raise our glasses
Welcome to my house, princes of Hell
Even in the night I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
I will bring in here my crystal ball
I will gaze, you will know what is to come
I'm amazed of what I've seen tonight
I won't tell a living soul, they would not believe
Welcome princess of Hell
Never will I break the oath I gave
I hail you again in Satan's Name, princes of Hell
Even in the night I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
We will be back, we will be backEmbed
