Gypsy LyricsAhhh...
This magic winter night I see a light
Again I hear that tune, some sort of croon
Oh no, no, no! Oh, my brain
Oh whoa, oh
Ahhh...
I see them gypsy wagons left in the snow
Oh I must see that lady, I have to know
Gypsy woman, let me inside
Ahhh...
They say you know the secret, secret of time
So gaze into your crystal and tell me all you see
Gypsy woman, let me know
"Oh, my son, you were never gone
You are the Devil's child and so am I"
Gypsy now I know you're not my mother
You're a part of my soul
It's clear for all to see
Oh no, no, no, I am you
Gypsy you're inside of meEmbed
