Nightmare LyricsAm I awake or is this just a dream?
I had a nightmare, some sort of vision
I was stuck in an empty room
When the black book appeared
The lights were dim, but the face in the
Book was in daylight
Eyes of fire staring at me
It's the eyes of a woman
And I see, on her spirit
Steppin' out of the Book
I hear her callin' for her coven to come
There's a light in the doorway
Entering shadows whose number is 13
They do the sign of the Devil's seed
I'm in the middle of a magic ring
Somebody tell me, what's goin' on
"Only we know the secret of the curse
That you bear"
Listen, they sing, the coven sings
Night after night I hear them sing
No, they're still here, I can hear them
Again
Night after Night I have this dream
(You are insane!)
"You're only living on borrowed time from your fate"Embed
