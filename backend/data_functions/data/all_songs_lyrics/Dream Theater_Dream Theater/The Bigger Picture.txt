The Bigger Picture Lyrics
Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see the painting come alive
Clever like an angel in disguise
Moving in and out of reach
If the candle lights this crooked path
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze
I will find the river through the rain
And I’ll reach the water’s edge

Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my eyes when I can’t see
Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my guide so I can see
The bigger picture

Like a moth burned by the fire
And driven to the flame
(Prophecies’ a blessing and a curse)
I must bare this cross alone
There’s no one else to blame
With each treasure found
Another shipwreck’s washed ashore
I am carried by the current
On a slow and steady course
Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my eyes when I can’t see
Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my guide so I can see
The bigger picture

What if caught in a moment
I get lost and can't find my way?
What if all along I was wrong
In every turn, in every way?
Would you talk me off the ledge
Or let me take the fall?
Better to try and fail
Than to never try at all!

You look but cannot see
Talk but never speak
You live but cannot breathe
See but don’t believe
Wounds that never heal
A heart that cannot feel
A dream that’s all too real
A stare as cold as steel
I’ve listened to the stories of resentment and disdain
I’ve looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame
I’ve taken blood from every stone
And traveled every road!

When I see the distant lights illuminate the night
Then I will know I am home1Embed
