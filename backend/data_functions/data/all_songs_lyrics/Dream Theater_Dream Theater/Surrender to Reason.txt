Surrender to Reason Lyrics
In moments of pain
Where heart and mind collide
Self reflection helps me decide
I believe the sacrifices in life
Give more than they take

Visions flowing slowly shedding light
Memories swimming in the sea of time
Pieces to the puzzle falling into place
That with which we struggle through we’ve learned to embrace

Love, show the way, alter my state of mind
Wash away the sorrow
Grace, lead the way
When boundaries are found
Surrender to reason

Life gives you brighter days
Through sacrifices made
My spirit travels like the wind and waves
My heart and mind unite
Mistakes resolved give sight
The river’s currents slowly turns the stone
Love, show the way, alter my state of mind
Wash away the sorrow
Grace, lead the way
When boundaries are found
Surrender to reason

Restless angels
Help me find my way
Restless angels
Help me find my strength
Restless angels
Help me find my way
Restless angels
Let love show the way
Let grace be the way
Surrender to reasonEmbed
