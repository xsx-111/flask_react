Illumination Theory Lyrics

Consider this question
Look deep inside
Deliver a true confession
What are you willing to live for?
Consider this question
Open your eyes
Examine your own reflection
What are you willing to die for?
When your backs' against the wall
And the times uncertain!
Consider this question
No standing by
When flesh and blood are threatened
What are you willing to kill for?
We seek to understand
We cry with head in hand
The bridges we build to connect
The distance that makes us forget
Hate dividing us, love reminding us
Of our shared humanity
Hope can be a shadow fleeting
I would rather die believing
Capture it all in a final act of faith!
We seek to understand
We cry with head in hand
A story that needs to be told
An answer that begs to found
The beauty we wish to behold
Is never too far away


Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life
A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their students
Vengeance for a crime
Rebels for their freedom
A tyrant for the praise
Cowards for salvation
Money, love, and fame
Noble and brave
Lay down our lives for the cause
Death over shame
Grace before glory

To really feel the joy in life
You must suffer through the pain
When you surrender to the light
You can face the darkest days
If you open up your eyes
And you put your trust in love
On those cold and endless nights
You will never be alone
Passion glows within your heart
Like a furnace burning bright
Until you struggle through the dark
You'll never know that you're alive
Never know
Never know
You'll never know
Never know
Never know
