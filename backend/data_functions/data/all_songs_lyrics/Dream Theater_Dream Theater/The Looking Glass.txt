The Looking Glass Lyrics
I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds
Than be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn’t matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are not content with being nameless and unknown
Trying to rise above the fray
Eager to give it all away
Some will not admit that fifteen minutes have expired
Too much attention much too soon
Don’t see you walking on the moon
You are caught up in your gravity
Bathing in the spotlight
Imitating fame

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass


You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying madness
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass
You live without shame
You’re digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass2Embed
