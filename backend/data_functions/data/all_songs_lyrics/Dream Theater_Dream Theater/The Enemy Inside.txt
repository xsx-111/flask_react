The Enemy Inside Lyrics
Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin
Pain as real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Is staring at me crying

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
And shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
Overcome with irrational fear
Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying!
I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a burden, I'm a travesty
I'm a prisoner of regret
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
I am hanging on the edge
Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise came to an end
And no magic pill
Can bring it back again

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy insideEmbed
