Dive LyricsTell her something
Tell her nothing
Tell her that you’re
Waiting
And I know you like it
So you try to hide it
I was looking
Out the window
All the people
Waiting
Tell her something
Tell her nothing
Tell her that you’re
Fading
And I know you like it
So you try to hide it
And you know I like it
So I dive to find it
In eyes, lost in confusion
Golden hearts, left all illusion
Is it my imagination?
Shadow, flicker creation
In, high over the ocean
Waves crash mechanical motion
Left all illusion
Left all illusion11Embed
