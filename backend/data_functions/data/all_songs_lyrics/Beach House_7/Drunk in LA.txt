Drunk in LA Lyrics
Can't help seeking corners
Of dark and dead-end rooms
Where the drinks keep pouring down
And the candles keep me warm
Isolation tenders
Something fragile coming soon
Skinny angels making eyes at cameras
Perched in every room

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
Memory's a sacred meat
That's drying all the time
On a hillside, I remember
I am loving losing life

Strawberries in springtime
Pretty happy accidents
My awareness that I'm lucky
Rolling clouds over cement
Maybe there's a screenplay
Or a bathroom I can hide
Down the hallways of a high school
And the dances left behind
I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
I would climb the Eiffel Tower
Write letters on the sky
How many turns it took to reach you

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
On a hillside, I remember
I am loving losing life6Embed
