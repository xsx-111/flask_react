Last Ride LyricsThere she goes
Under the sun
Some question there
Roll her eyes
Blonde, your hair
Fake eyelashes
Sun came up
Baby went black
And she rolled over
There she goes
Around the bend
The sun is slow
Unknown friend
There she goes
The sun went bad
The cycle ends
Who takes your name back
When he said he's four streets from your bed
And I'm loving and sick
There she goes
On her bike
Earth to the side
When you're loving most at night
And I love you back
When the sun rises, I--
Who will call you back?
It's a whisper
It's just a whisper
It's just a whisper7Embed
