Pay No Mind LyricsPay no mind
It takes time
What's that you say
Down the hall
I heard a song
Who knows
Drifting away
Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes
All of me
Is to tow the waste
What's that you say
It's going away
It's painful but
You do what you must
Takes time to know
Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes
Who knows if there're roses in heaven
Let go of that empty feeling
Not dumber just a little bit older
Kiss of love couldn't be much colder5Embed
