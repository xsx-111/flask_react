Black Car LyricsWe want to go inside the cold
It's like a tomb, but it's something to hold
And in the time before it ends
When the stillness bends
We want to go inside the cold
It's like a tomb, but it's something to hold
And in the time before it ends
When the stillness bends
I skipped a rock and it fell to the bottom
I skipped a rock
Each time I'm walking at night
And I can't close my eyes
And I can't close my eyes
Each time
We want to go inside the cold
At night
It's like a tomb, but it's something to hold
Eyes
And in the time before it ends
Close my eyes
When the stillness bends
I skipped a rock and it fell to the bottom
I skipped a rock9Embed
