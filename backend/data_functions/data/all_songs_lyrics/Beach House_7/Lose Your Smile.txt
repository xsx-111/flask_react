Lose Your Smile LyricsOutside looking in
Mirrors once again
Nothing left to say
Tomorrow's gone today
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
Sweet lies on your face
Tears are out of place
Sunshine in the rain
Comes in rainbows and leaves again
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
When all the while, child
It's your own self giving in
Who's to blame this time?
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true6Embed
