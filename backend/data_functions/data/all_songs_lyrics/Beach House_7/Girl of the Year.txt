Girl of the Year LyricsYou slide out on sunset
Head west on bedrest
On your own
On your own
Get dressed to undress
Depressed to impress
All night long
All night long
Turn on the TV
They all wanna see me
Come undone
Come undone
Pick all the petals
Off all the daisies
One by one
The feeling's here
The pattern caught in a falling tear
And in the waves
One goes and the other one knows
One high
The feeling's here
She rolls
The pattern caught in a falling tear
Too soon
And in the waves
She goes
One goes and the other one knows
Baby's gone
All night long
Baby's gone
All night long5Embed
