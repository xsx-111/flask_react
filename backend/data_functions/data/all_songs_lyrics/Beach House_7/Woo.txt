Woo LyricsI want it all
But I can't have it
Images fly by
I cannot say much
But I want it all
And I want it all
I want it all
But I can't have it
Images fly by
I cannot say much
But I want it all
And I want it all
When she closes her eyes
Looks inside
Never knowing
Shooting for the stars
It's gone too far
And you know it
I can't keep you there
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
You're everywhere
You don't give a fuck
Swimming pools
Forever glowing
You break all the rules
It's a trick of the eye
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
It passes me by
In a swimming pool
You break all the rules
Keeps on going
Backseat, give a fuck
I want it all
But I can't have it
Images fly by
I cannot say much
But I want it all
And I want it all
You're my trick of the eye
I want it all
That passes me by
But I can't have it
Keeps on going
I can't keep you there
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
Images fly by
Or everywhere
You don't give a fuck
Swimming pools
I cannot say much
Forever glowing
You break all the rules
You're my trick of the eye
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
But I want it all
That passes me by
In a swimming pool
You break all the rules
And I want it all
Keeps on going
Backseat, give a fuck2Embed
