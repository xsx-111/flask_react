Dark Spring LyricsDark red light-years
Brought near
Cold gone glowing
Night sing
Star death ringing
Brought fear
I want to lie in
They call Orion
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring
Cold red light-years
Brought near
Dark gone glowing
Night sing
The worlds colliding
Unreal dividing
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring6Embed
