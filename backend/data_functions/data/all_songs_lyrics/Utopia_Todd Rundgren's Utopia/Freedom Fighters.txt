Freedom Fighters Lyrics

Tucked away in the darkest cupboard of your heart
There's a feeling you can't let out
In a way you are just a soldier of the mind
You are marching, what are you marching about?

On your mark, now get set
Get back on your feet
We ain't down yet
You know we will get it
But don't you forget

That the world rolls on
Your reward will come
It's just a question of how and when
How

Look around, everyone is wondering where it's at
Do you wonder, or do you know?

Clap your hands! Raise your voice
Some people will hide
They can't stand the noise
But we're freedom fighters
And we've got no choice
That the world rolls on
And the truth will come
(I can't believe my eyes)
And a change will come
It's just a question of how and when
How


In a way you are just a soldier of the mind
In a way you are just a soldier of the mind


On your mark, now get set
Get back on your feet
We ain't down yet
We're all freedom fighters
And don't you forget

That the world rolls on
(I can't believe my eyes)
Your reward will come
(It's just a question of how and when)
And the truth will come
(Just a question of how and when)
And the change will come
(It's just a question of how and when)
HowEmbed
