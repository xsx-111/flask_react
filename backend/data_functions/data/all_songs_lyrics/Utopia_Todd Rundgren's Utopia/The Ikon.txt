The Ikon Lyrics

On a day like no other
In a time unique, in a place divine
Keep your eye on the Ikon
Shining in the light of eternal mind
I went to sleep a blind man
But when I awoke I saw
The legions of the lonely
See their faces, hear them call

See how they hang on
Each one in a world of his own design
Listen to the Ikon
Ringing in the sound of eternal mind
And the music plays forever
And it captures every ear
And the sound of barriers crashing down
Is the sweet harmony you hear

Still, be still
To strong, so be still
Much too long, come down
Be still, look around
Listen here, be still
Hear the sound, be still
Still, be still
Still, be still
Still we are here, we are still
Will we sing sweet, sing we will
Still we are here, we are still
Nil is all fear, all is nil
Still we are here, we are still
Spill it let go, let it spill
Still we are here, we are still
Will we sing sweet, sing we will
(Still) Still we are here, we are still
(Be still) Spill it let go, let it spill
(Still) Still we are here, we are still
(Be still) Nil is all fear, all is nil
(Still) Still we are here, we are still
(Be still) Will we sing sweet, sing we will


The question comes to mind
About what should be done
And how much of the old will die
That the new may be begun

(But you don't have to be afraid)
Of being alone with nowhere to run
(But you don't have to be afraid)
To look yourself in the eye
You don't have to be afraid not to lie

Someone knows who you are
Someone watches over you
Someone knows how you feel
And someone feels the same
So you never have to be afraid
(Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind)
So you never have to be
For those who still recoil
For those who fear the pain
Of peering o'er the edge of
A new and different plane

(You don't have to be afraid)
Whenever you go you come back again
(You don't have to be afraid)
We live and we die
You don't have to be afraid to know why

Someone knows who you are
Someone watches over you
Someone knows how you feel
And someone feels the same
So you never have to be afraid
(Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind)
So you never have to be


So you never have to be afraid
(Never fear for you are living in eternal mind)
So you never have to be afraid
(Never fear for you are living in eternal mind)
So you never have to be afraid
(Never fear for you are living in eternal mind)
So you never have to be afraid
(Never fear for you are living in eternal mind)
