Zion Wolf Theme (Unfinished) Lyrics
In the company of wolves
Will I make it through the night?
If I stay with you, I might
When I'm out there on my own, I don't know

In the company of fools
Can I win or only lose?
'Cause where the land becomes the sea
That's where I'll be

Can I make you fall in love with me?
Can I make you fall in love with me?
We'll see

In the company of thieves
Will I stay or will I leave?
Will they steal away my life?
Will I go down without my fight?
I might

In the company of kings
I learn the wisdom of all things
And then I'll come for you, I will
Yeah, yeah
Can I make you fall in love with me?
Can I make you fall in love with me?
We'll see3Embed
