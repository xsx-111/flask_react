Desert River (Unfinished) Lyrics
I am the eagle of things to come
I am the heart of the burning sun
I am the face of the earth itself
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie
I am the eagle of things to come
I am the heart of the burning sun
I am the face of the earth itself
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie
I am the eagle of things to come
I am the heart of the burning sun
I am the face of the earth itself
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie

They don't fear them; that, I know
They feel the shiver, they are all cold
They not goin' to the river, it is a lie
I'm going in, yeah

Trials and avenger's feign
There will be journeys of endless pain
And I will live by the river 'til I die
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie
They will be talking and talking it loud
You won't be (Shh) when I'm bleeding out
You won't cool me down off by the river tonight
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie
They don't fear them; that, I know, yeah
They feel the shiver, they are all cold
They not goin' to the river, it is a lie
I'm going in, yeah2Embed
