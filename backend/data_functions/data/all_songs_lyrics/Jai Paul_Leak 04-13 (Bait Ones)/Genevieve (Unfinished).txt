Genevieve (Unfinished) Lyrics
That fucking number cruncher
Stole my thunder again
They say I ain't half the man
I act like I am, but they're wrong
You can see a crook in my smile
You know it's worthwhile, yeah, you do
Now I like the way you walk in them shoes
They don't make 'em like you anymore

That's why I'm begging you, Genevieve
Why don't you come back to me?
Why don't you even chat to me?
Let's go back to how we used to be, yeah (Woo)

It's like the more I try
The more you just lie, and that's a trait
Remember how we—
I know you felt that too, yeah, I do
That's why you keep me hanging around
You love to know that I'm bound to you—
Haha

That's why I'm begging you, Genevieve
Why don't you come back to me?
Why don't you even chat to me?
Let's go back to how we used to be, yeah
That's why I'm— you, Genevieve
Why don't you come back to me?
Why don't you even chat to me?
Let's go back to how we used to be, yeah
Why don't you give me a chance?
You never know, it might last if you do
You can't just play on my mind
For all of this time, that ain't right
You can see the guilt in my smile
You know I'm worthwhile, yeah, you do
Now I like—
They don't make 'em like you anymore, nah
That's why I'm telling you

Genevieve
Genevieve
Genevieve (What's that, baby, now?)
Genevieve (We can work it out)

Genevieve
I know you still love me
And it won't be easy
Don't mean it ain't meant to be, whoa
Genevieve
I know you still love me (We can work it out)
It won't be easy
Don't mean it ain't meant to be, whoa (What's that, baby, now?)
(We can work it out)
Genevieve (What's that, baby, now?)
Genevieve (We can work it out)Embed
