BTSTU (Demo) Lyrics
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Since you shipped my ass out to sea
I never knew where I was goin'
I went where the water was flowin'

I know I've been gone a long time, but
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time, but
I'm back and I want what is mine

The ship was the love of my life
We went down together that night
I surfaced in every shadow
For years I just kotched on the down low

I know I've been gone a long time, but
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time, but
I'm back and I want what is mine
So don't try and fuck me about
You're wasted but on your way out, boss
I'm startin' to clock how you roll
I'm tired and about to get cold
I know I've been gone a long time, but
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time, but
I'm back and I want what is mine (Oi)
I know I've been gone a long time, yeah, yeah
I'm back and I want what is mine, yeah
I know I've been gone a long time, yeah, yeah
I'm back and I want what is mine, yeah
I know I've been gone a long time, yeah, yeah
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time, yeah, yeah
I'm back and I want what is mine37Embed
