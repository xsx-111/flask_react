Crush (Unfinished) Lyrics
Real hits only

I see ya blowin' me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on, baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not overanalyze
Don't go too deep with it, baby

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play loose
And run like we have a date with destiny, yeah

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
And it's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you

Raising my adrenaline
Banging on a heart of tin
Don't make too much of it, baby, yeah
You say the word "forevermore"
That's not what I'm looking for
All I'll commit to is "maybe"
So let it be what it'll be
Don't fuss and get crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play loose
And run like we have a date with destiny, yeah

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
And it's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
And it's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
It'sâ€”
