All Night (Unfinished) Lyrics
If it's got to be one night
Then, girl, it's got to be all night
Let's meet up in the moonlight
'Cause, girl, it's got to be all night

All night, baby, yeah
All night and day
All night
All night and day

If it's got to be one night
Then, girl, it's got to be all night
Let's meet up in the moonlight
'Cause, girl, it's got to be all night

All night, baby, yeah
All night and day
All night
All night and day

If it's got to be one night
Then, girl, it's got to be all night
Let's meet up in the moonlight
'Cause, girl, it's got to be all night
I've been searching for a lover
Who will last me through the summer nights
Will you be mine?
All night

(I've been searching for a love like this) All night and day
All night (For the rest of time)
All night and
Always (Always, I'll remember this)
All night, and day
All night (For the rest of time)
All night, yeah, yeah

Always, I'll remember this
For the rest of time
Yeah, yeah
I've been searching for a love like this
For the rest of time
Always, I'll remember this
For the rest of time8Embed
