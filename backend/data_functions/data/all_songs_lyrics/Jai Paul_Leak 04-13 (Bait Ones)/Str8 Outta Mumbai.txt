Str8 Outta Mumbai Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh (Very), ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh– (Special) ooh, ooh-ooh

There's something to the way I'll say it
So let me try it now
I wanna help you, I know I can
What you worried about?

Want to talk to you but you don't know what to say
And you don’t know what to do
And she wants to talk to you but you don't know what to say
And you don’t know what to do
And she

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Grinding, this ain't no quick ting, I wanna last
It’s gonna take time
I wanna help you, I know I can
I wanna make you mine
Want to talk to you but you don't know what to say
And you don’t know what to do
And she wants to talk to you but you don't know what to say
And you don’t know what to do
And she wants to talk to you but you don't know what to say
And you don’t know what to do
And she wants to talk to you but you don't know what to say
And you don’t know what to do
And

But you never let me do anything for you
I’ll make anything, do anything for you
But there's so much that is happening
But you know I'll do anything for you

Kaho to kusumal sadi rangawa
Kaho to bhagwa bhesh
Pran hamara waha basat hai
Yaha to khali bhash

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh7Embed
