Baby Boomer LyricsWe gotta stand a little closer
To what it is we're leanin' on
Who was it that first said it?
Could it be he could be wrong
About the pilgrims and the natives
Having dinner on the lawn?
I think if I was ever king
I would buy a censorship
Where the only books upon the shelves
Were the ones that I had written
Oh, and put them up in borders, set my photo down the spine
To tell the story of the livin' without forgettin' those who'd died
And I would die a happy man
Cause I did the best that I could do
To find a better way of living
Should we leave that up to you?
Who was it that first said it, the one who said it best?
You got to L-O-V-E your neighbors, at least the ones who are still left
And we gotta stand a little closer
To the lessons that we've learned
Is it just a premonition?
Could we really get ourselves both burned?
I've been sent here on a mission to find what we agree upon
We don't agree about September
Could we agree on Vietnam?
I think if I was ever publisher I'd buy a pirate ship
Where the mission at each position is to shoot and to click
Clean the photos up a little, censor the ship out of it
So I could put it up in borders, turn a profit on the trip
Charge the public for the overhead of 1492
And if they need a better reason tell them we got livin' proof
And I would die a happy man
Cause I did the best that I could do
To find a better way of leaving
Should we leave that up to you
Who was it that first said it?
Yeah that's what I'm trying to say
You got to L-O-V-E your neighbors, at least the ones that live today1Embed
