Man Named Truth LyricsDon’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
I’ll tell you right now that it ain’t no use
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Pain was hunting me down but I gave him the slip
I left the city through a tunnel and I headed for the styx
With oregeno oil in the morphine drip
Pain was a-hunting me down but I gave him the slip
And I fell in love with identical twins
They lived thirty-four summers between the two of them
I gave one my ego, I gave one my id
Yeah, I got to get back to my pretty little twins
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
I’ll tell you right now that it ain’t no use
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
I was lost for a year in those almond trees
The sun was rising in the south and setting in the east
I was a half awake, I was half asleep
I thought I’d never get out of those almond trees
And don’t think too slow in syruppy the sun
You’ll get buried alive when the caterpillar comes
Tapping your time on congo drums
Just don’t think too slow in the circling sun
I met a black-skinned man with an ice cream grin
And a blonde afghan with some heroin
And we moved to the mountains where the highway ends
And I got myself that ice cream grin
So don’t search too long for that Aztec gold
Well, like old Cortez, you’ll lose your soul
Turn an honest man into Diablo
Yeah, don’t trade your soul for no Aztec gold
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
You look in my eyes, you can (and you’ll) see the proof
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth
Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth2Embed
