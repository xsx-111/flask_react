Losin Yo Head Lyrics
Coming home alone at night, I'm so scared
Turn on all the lights, check underneath the stairs
Open all the closets, make sure they're no monsters in there
Living in a small house, it's fairly easy to check
If I were living in a mansion, I'd probably just sleep out on the deck
Heaving on the boulder, just trying to move it an inch
I think I'm getting closer, I think I'm getting bolder, but then it all starts to slip
And I keep making the same old faces again

Partying with strangers or sticking with close friends instead
It don't matter what you're doing, as long as you're losing your head
Out riding the range, or laying with you here in bed
It don't matter what I'm doing, as long as I'm losing my head

Way back when the smallest trip was the greatest quest
Now sometimes I get bored, even though I know I'm blessed
Coming and going like we do it's hard to keep friends I know firsthand
I'm tired of doing nothing, feel like we should be making plans
We need a little thrill, I can see it in our faces, yeah, turn off the tv set
The feeling of adventure, I think we all remember it
Partying with strangers or sticking with close friends instead
It don't matter what I'm doing, as long as you I'm losing my head
Out riding the range, or laying with you here in bed
It don't matter what I'm doing, as long as I'm losing my head2Embed
