Say Please Lyrics
Everyone grows old on the gold coast
It takes a lot of hope to grieve
Everyone gets dark and the worst part
Is the way those thoughts can please you

Personality like a split screen
See yourself down your knees

Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand, darling
Hold out your hand
Say please

Everyone gives up down on hard luck
On hope ain't enough it seems
Everyone gets lost in their own fog
Have to wonder on with lantern dreams

Say please, please
Just say something
Speak up, please
If it's what you're looking for
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand, darling
Hold out your hand
Say pleaseEmbed
