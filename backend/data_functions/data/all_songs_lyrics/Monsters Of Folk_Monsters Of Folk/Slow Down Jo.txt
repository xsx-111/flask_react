Slow Down Jo Lyrics
Slow down Jo
Anybody ever tell you that you move too fast
Anybody ever tell you how to make a good thing last
'Cause it ain't like that

First you gotta slow down Jo
Last night I was talking to some friends of mine
A.J.'s afraid you're gonna kill your time
Or lose your mind

If you don't slow down Jo
Anybody ever tell you if you lose the knack
Anybody ever tell you that it's true
You can get it back
Oh, but not like that

It ain't by kicking down the walls
Pissing off your friends
Every time the cards don't fall your way
It ain't by poking out your eyes
When you see something you don't like
Even your mama said she don't want to see you spent at 25
Slow down JoEmbed
