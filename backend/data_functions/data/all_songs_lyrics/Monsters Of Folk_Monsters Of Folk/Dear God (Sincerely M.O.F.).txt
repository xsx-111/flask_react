Dear God (Sincerely M.O.F.) Lyrics
Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe in
Good God, I know you have your reasons

Dear God, I see you move the mountains
Dear God, I see you moving trees
Sometimes it's nothing to believe in
Sometimes it's everything I see

Well I've been thinking about
And I've been breaking it down without an answer
I know I'm thinking aloud but if your loves
Still around why do we suffer?
Why do we suffer?

Dear God, I wish that I could touch you
How strange sometimes I feel I almost do
And then I'm back behind the glass again
Oh God, what keeps you out it keeps me in

Well I've been thinking about
And I've been breaking down without an answer
I know I'm thinking aloud but if your loves
Still around why do we suffer?
Why do we suffer?Embed
