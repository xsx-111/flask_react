Goodway Lyrics
I learned a good way, good way
I learned a good way, good way
I learned a good way of saying goodbye
I learned a good way, good way
I learned a good way, good way
You taught me everything I know about
Taking other people for a ride
And I just wanted to take the time
To thank you for that gift tonight

I learned a good way, good way
I learned a good way, good way
I learned a good way of saying goodbye
I learned a good way, good way
I learned a good way, good way
You taught me everything I know about
Taking other people for a ride
And I just wanted to take the time
To thank you for that gift tonight

Yes, we'll drive out to the forest
And wait 'til the moon is up above
We'll smear mud and pomegranate seeds on our faces
Build a giant fire and wait for the sun to put it out
We'll be fed and nourished back to health by our surrogate animal parents
You'll eat berries from the bushes
I'll learn to fly and you'll learn to fish
And I'll fly down to the river to join you
And when we're strong and healthy and ready
We'll return to the human world with new skills and a new perspective
We'll be free
Yours, always
(Good way)Embed
