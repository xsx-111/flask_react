Temazcal Lyrics
Putting on my power, righteous as a rose
Dynamite the mountain, now I'm walking up the road, ah
The love we made at gunpoint wasn't love at all (love at all)
The dancing in the valley, the moon's the mirror ball

Blew open my mind, now it's an empty room
Swinging in the hammock, dogs are walking across the roof, ah
I watch you braid your hair, you're from another time ('nother time)
When the earth wasn't so angry, and God was on our side

Searching west and east
And all points in between
Underneath the lines of thought
You're there and then you're not

The mayans stole tomorrow, hid it underground
We come with heavy magnets but it still hasn't been found, ah
I'm sweating out my secrets in the temazcal
They're screaming in the calle that there are stars about to fall

Looking through the trees
Cities and the seas
Things we've seen, OVNIDS on the lawn
They're there and then they're gone
There and then they're goneEmbed
