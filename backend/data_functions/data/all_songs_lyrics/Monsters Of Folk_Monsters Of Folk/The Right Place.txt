The Right Place Lyrics
Do you like where you're living? Do you like what you do?
Do you like what you're seeing when you're lookin' at you?
Do you like what you're saying when you open your face?
Do you got the right feeling? Are you in the right place?

Stealin' a tusk from an elephant
Must make one feel creepy inside
And although you'll boast around the fire at night
That ghost will kick up a fight
"Be gone? Be gone?", you scream
You're just some elephant dream
I needed you like you needed me
People, they need piano keys

If you like where you're living, if you like what you do
If you like what you're seeing, when you're lookin' at you
If you like what you're saying, when you open your face
Then you got the right feeling, you're in the right place

"Is this right? Is this right?"
Come on God answer tonight
Is there some fee that you'll charge me
For doin' what you thought I might?
Once you've thought long and hard about it
Tell me if heads will roll
Once you've thought long and hard about it
Tell me 'cause I need to know

'Cause I like where I'm livin', and I like what I do
And I like what I'm seein', when I'm lookin' at you
I still like what I'm saying, when I open my face
I think I got the right feeling, I think I'm in the right place
I think I got the right feeling, I think I'm in the right placeEmbed
