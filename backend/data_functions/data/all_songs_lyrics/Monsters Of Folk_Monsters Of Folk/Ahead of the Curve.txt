Ahead of the Curve Lyrics'Nother perfect day
They keep piling up
I got happiness
That I can maintain some beginner's luck
I had shoes to fill
Walking barefoot now
Can't tell north from south
But no split hair's gonna get me down
I'm staying 'bove the flat line
I'm ahead of the curve
Take a piece of the sunshine with me
On a red eye flight to another world
It isn't any trouble
If you wanna come with me
I know it's out of the question, honey
But I sure could use the company
And a place to be
Now the sky is pink
Rooftop swimmin' pool
I'm not carefree, no
I'm free to care, I just never do
All the bags are checked
And the reasons why
Yesterday lingers on
That's the piece you keep when you say goodbye
You can get what you want now
Knock it out of the park
Bury it by the river, easy
There's a search party but it's gettin' dark
I won't hold you to nothin'
I wanna make that plane
Probably end up a stranger and crazy
But I'm still hoping there's another way
And a place to stay
What a scene that's got you sentimental
When the night comes, when the knot comes loose
All the things you've put up on your mantle
What a shame, what a shame it's old news
I'm staying 'bove the flat line
I'm ahead of the curve
Take a piece of the sunshine with me
On an all night drive to another world
You can get what you want now
Knock it out of the park
Probably end up a drifter and lonely
But I'm still hoping for a change of heart
And a place, a place, a place to start1Embed
