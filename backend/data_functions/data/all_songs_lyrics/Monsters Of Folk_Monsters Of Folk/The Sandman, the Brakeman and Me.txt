The Sandman, the Brakeman and Me Lyrics
The Brakeman is letting off some steam
This has to be the slowest train that I have ever seen
And the Sandman's waiting to deliver me my dream
Guess I'll lay my head against my elbow and the window

Watch the wheels go, watch the wheels go

Roll on, roll on, oh little train
Brakeman blow your whistle, throw your weight upon the chain
Make way, for whatever will be, will be
Between the Sandman, the Brakeman, and me

And the Sandman's waiting to deliver me my dream
Deliver me my dream, deliver me my dream, today
Guess I'll lay my head against my elbow and the window

Let my wheels go, let my wheels go

Roll on, roll on, oh little train
Brakeman blow your whistle, throw your weight upon the chain
Make way, whatever will be, will be
For the Sandman, the Brakeman, and meEmbed
