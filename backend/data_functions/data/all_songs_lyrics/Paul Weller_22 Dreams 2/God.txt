God LyricsAnd I looked up, and I spoke to God;
And God said:
"Look at YOU, don't look at me
You only call on me when you need me
And when you don't; you hardly think of me at all
I don't enter your head for weeks at a time
And at the times I do, they're in your despair;
That you created and not I
And still, you look up at me in such pleading terms
That's how I can not deny you
Don't look at me; look at you
DON'T look at me; look at you."
And every night I pray to God
"Please save the lives of those I love
And take me instead, if you really need someone
To keep you company... On a golden chair, in the glare
Bring your guns to the table, and recite your prayer
Loose all your hatred, if you are to pray in there
The temple you're seeking, is in front of your nose
Because the message you're giving, is doing nothing for those"
Seek, and you shall find
Seek, and you shall find
The oldest is the young
The young is the oldest
The oldest is the young
The young is the oldestEmbed
