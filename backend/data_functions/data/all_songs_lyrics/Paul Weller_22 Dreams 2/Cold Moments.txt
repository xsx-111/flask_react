Cold Moments LyricsIn those cold, cold moments
Waiting for that girl to come
She's the one
Got my hands deep in my pockets
Trying to keep out of the rain
She cause me such pain
But she's got me so
Lord, that girl drives me insane
In that far off distance
I can see the lights of town
Sure bring me down
And though I'll miss it so
Lord, I can't stay here no more
Waiting for the dice to roll
Where I'm headed, I don't know
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
I just hate to move on
From these cold, cold moments
Getting time to get on board
Greenline coach take me somewhere warm
Don't look like she's gonna show
Where I'm heading, I don't know
I don't know
Sha la la la, la la la
Sha la la la, la la la
In those cold, cold moments
Waiting for that girl to call
She's the one
Got my hands deep in my pockets
Trying to keep out of the rain
She cause me such pain
Yes she's got me so
Lord, that girl drive me insane
Yes, that's got me so
I just got to let her go
From these cold, cold momentsEmbed
