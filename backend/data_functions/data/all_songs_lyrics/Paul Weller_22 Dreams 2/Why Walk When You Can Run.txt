Why Walk When You Can Run LyricsMy Son rose to the shore
To the world that lies before
He can't hear my sound
He's much too in tune with the ground
He sees only the tide, and the surf and the sea
He's oblivious to me calling
In years to come
I will still call him Son
But he'll have no time to wait
We must see beyond his fate
He said "only the Sun and the Wind may get free"(?)
His only defence will always be...
Why walk, when you can run?
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind my Son
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind my Son
Through sheets of time
On the wings of a bird
He'll come to the edge
To look life in the eyes
He'll see only the keys
To the world and his dreams
His strongest defence will always be...
Why walk, when you can run?
Why walk, when you can run?
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind my Son
Run like the wind, run like the wind
No turning back, no giving in
Run like the wind, run like the wind
Run like the wind my SonEmbed
