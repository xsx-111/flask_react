Jade Lyrics
She runs through the Valley of Death and of Sleeping
She laughs as she dances, her feet wake the flowers
She comes now running through our gloomy town
Yes, Jade is the Girl of the Hour
We can't help but follow, she’s Buddha- just watch her
She moves like an old gypsy woman but swears she’s a girl
And all that she asks, we’ll allow her
For Jade is the Girl of the Hour

It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers
Yes, Jade is the Girl of the Hour

The people in town now just wake up to see her, for
When she smiles they all feel the power
The strong men, the children and even the cowards
Know Jade is the Girl of the Hour

It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour and always it's hers
Yes, Jade is the Girl of the Hour
You won't soon forget the name

Softly now join her, she’s blessed for construction
She sings and sounds off the hammer of god
Man I swear, she’s come here to fill us with power
It’s Jade, the Girl of the hour!

It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour and always it's hers
Yes, Jade is the Girl of the Hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers it's hers
Yes, Jade is the Girl of the Hour
And you won't soon forget the nameEmbed
