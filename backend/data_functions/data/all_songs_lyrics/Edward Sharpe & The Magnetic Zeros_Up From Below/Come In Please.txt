Come In Please LyricsOnce upon a time I was the hurricane boy
There was no eye in me for you to hide
Head low don't show oceans in my eyes
As the waves clap goodbye to sorrow
Daddy's on the mountain yellin' at the bloody sky
Mama's in the mirror actin' out another life
Children in the schoolyard singin' 'everybody dies'
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies
Hopped up on a gypsy train with tracks that you can hide
That way no storm could follow our tomorrows
But shackled to a suitcase full of automatic thunder
CLAP!
All hail to death's boy-wonder
JJ's in the kitchen talking bout the end of times
Mo's thowin' Kerouac to Catcher In the Rye
Tempermental yogis bakin' merryweather pie
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies
Sometimes said it's suntime
Let it sunshine on my mind
All the same its conscience waiting
Cross the line
Last night I dreamed myself upon a golden glade
The clouds passed in and out of my reflection
And everyone I've known held my hands till they were clay
And the storm finally bled from my complexion
Now Jadey's on the mountain singing 'We will never die'
The band is in the rainbow playin' love for you and I
Heath is riding shotgun aimin' at the paper sky
And I am only 'I am' now I've opened up my eye
I am only 'I am' that I've opened up my eye
Sometimes said its suntime
Let it sunshine on my mind
Healing I need healing
A good feeling I can Shine
Feel it like you can see it
Like you can dream it in your mind
Sunny Hallelujah comin' to ya
Rain or shine
All the same its Conscience waiting
Cross the line1Embed
