Carries On LyricsOne love
One love
Carries on
One touch
One touch
Carries on
Ohhh, eeeee
One look
One look
Carries on
Ohhh, eeeee
One smile
One (when?) can you give me
One (when?) can you give me
Touch
? come and give me
Hope can you give me
Love
? can you give me
Hope can you give me some
Of the gift that carries on
One word
One word
Carries on
One smile
One smile
Carries on
Ohhh, eeeee
One love
One love
Carries on
Ohhh, eeeee
One smile
One (when?) can you give me
One (when?) can you give me
Touch
? come and give me
Hope can you give me
Love
? can you give me
Hope can you give me some
Of the gift that carries on
And on and on
One smile
One (when?) can you give me
One (when?) can you give me
Touch
? come and give me
Hope can you give me
Love
? can you give me
Hope can you give me some
Of the gift that carries onEmbed
