Black Water LyricsBlack water
Drippin down your face
Mountains in reconstitutions embrace

Guns and steel
And the Germs of Love
Toe to toe
In the world of Mud
Guns and Steel
And the Germs of Love
Blow For Blow
For my aching heart
Black water, ohhh
Spread your words on me
Waste me with a BANG
You know, for posterity

Guns and steel
And the Germs of Love
Toe to toe
In the world of Mud
Guns and Steel
And the Germs of Love
Blow For Blow
For my aching heartEmbed
