40 Day Dream LyricsI been sleepin' for 40 days and
I know I'm sleeping 'cause this dream’s too amazin'
She got gold doorknobs where her eyes used to be
One turn and I learned what it really means to see
Ah, it’s the magical mystery kind
Ah, must be a lie
Bye-bye to the too good to be true kind of love
Oh, I could die
Oh, now I can die
I've been sleepin' for 60 days and
Nobody better pinch me
Bitch, I swear I’ll go crazy
She got jumper cable lips
She got sunset on her breath now
I inhaled just a little bit
Now I got no fear of death now
Ah, it’s the magical mystery kind
Ah, must be a lie
Bye-bye to the too good to be true kind of love
Oh, I could die
Oh, now I can die
Ohh Ahh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ah, it’s the magical mystery kind
Ah, must be a lie
Bye-bye to the too good to be true kind of love
Oh, I could die
Oh, now I can die13Embed
