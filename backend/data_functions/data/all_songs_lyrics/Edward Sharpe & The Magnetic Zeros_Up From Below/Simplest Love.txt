Simplest Love Lyrics
This is a song for my simplest love
A simple song for a simplest love
Her eyes are green, her hair is brown
This is a song for my simplest love
A constant song for a constant love
No difficult chords, easy to play
A simple song for a simplest love
Her eyes are green, her hair is brownEmbed
