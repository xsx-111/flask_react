Brother LyricsSomewhere over the Earth
A song, a song
Somewhere I have heard
My brother is gone
Away, under the Moon
Brother, brother
Away, gone so soon
Please singin' his tune
Still singin' his tune
And away he gone day
And away he gone night
And away he gone dark
And away he gone light
Up and away he gone away
But in a way he gonna stay
Oh brother of mine
We'll be singin' some day
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Undead audio, yes we'll be singin' someday
Some say I am to blame
Brother, brother
Some days I feel the same
I'm feelin' that shame
Away under the moon
Brother, brother
Away, gone so soon
Please singin' this tune
Still singin' his tune
And away he gone dark
And away he gone light
And away he gone day
And away he gone night
Up and away he gone away
But in a way he gonna stay
Oh brother of mine
We'll be singin' some day
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Eh, yeah we'll sing it someday
Brother of mine, we'll be sing it someday
Undead audio, yes we'll sing it todayEmbed
