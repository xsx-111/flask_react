Desert Song LyricsI was born the devil’s son
Yes my dad, he gave my name
Now my mama keeps saying
:
Run to the desert
You will see all that you need to see
Run to the desert
You will be all that you need to be
I woke up to the shadow of a man standing over me
Here in the land of frozen hands
I came out here to kill you father like a Sergio Leone picture
Gee I hope you understand
And as the red soaked the sand – shhh
