Mary LyricsThat a creature could be so lonely
It became my deepest wish
To give her my love
To embrace her forever
And to have her find some peace
She who was so lonely
Came with volumes of feeling I have never known
Except perhaps for Mary
And she was always my sister
And she was always my sister
That a creature could be so lonely
It became my deepest wish
To give her my love
To embrace her forever
And to have her find some peace
She who was so lonely
Came with volumes
Volumes of feeling
I have never known
Except perhaps for Mary
And she was always my sisterEmbed
