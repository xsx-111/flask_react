Ceiling Gazing LyricsLayin' in my bed ceiling gazing
Wide awake with jet lag from Australia
Got a stack of mail and a wedding invitation
From a new young relative I never even knew of
Got me thinkin' 'bout my Grandpa for some reason
Met him half a dozen times in a nursing home
The last time I saw him, he was in a box
And they were lowering him into the ground
St. Mary's Church stood so high
It was the first and the last time I saw my Dad cry
The ground had a thin coat of snow
And we wandered off in the cold
It's 3:47 am, June 13th
It's my sister's birthday today, I think
Gonna give her a call, see how she's doin'
She had a rough divorce, I hope she's improvin'
I want to reach out and give her my love
Put a smile on her face like when we were young
Listenin' to records from the library
Hermit of Mink Hollow and Dreamboat Annie
She lives with her daughters all alone
Across the street from a cornfield in Ohio
One's four, one's seven, and I love them so
So I wanna live a long time and see them grow
Outside my window tonight
Sausalito's twinklin' lights
My love's beside me. deep asleep
Her dog is layin' between my feet
Outside my window tonight
The cargo ships are cruising by
And I'm so happy to be alive
To have these people in my life
Layin' in my bed ceiling gazing
Can't make my mind stop from racing
It's not good or bad, it's just how God made me
To lay awake at night ceiling gazingEmbed
