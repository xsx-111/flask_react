You Missed My Heart LyricsBroke into her house, saw her sittin' there
Drinkin' Coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen hangin' up the phone
I asked him nicely please to pack his things and go
He gave her a reassuring look and said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him once again, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me, and said
"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good, I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
Were his last words before he died
Lookin' out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost control
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering, I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of everything I missed
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
Driving into Wheeling and showin' her off at
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I loved her skin when she started laughing
And while I clenched down on her wrist, she said
"That's quite a list, but there's one thing you missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed"
Runnin' through the parking lots, runnin' through the fields
Policemen on my back, somethin' hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke loose
Went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
Who got me in the shins and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
And the priest read my last rites
And just before everything went dark, I said
"He missed my heart, he missed my heart"
Just before my world went dark, said
"He missed my heart, he missed my heart"
Just before everything went dark
The most poetic dream came flowin' like the sea
Layin' there, my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene: night sky, moon beams
Fishing with my friends, sittin' in the wild weeds
Watchin' the Ohio River flow at night
Waitin' for the bullhead catfishes to bite
