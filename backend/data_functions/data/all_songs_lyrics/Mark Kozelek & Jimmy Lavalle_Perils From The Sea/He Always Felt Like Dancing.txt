He Always Felt Like Dancing LyricsThere's the neighbor with the doggy
Why she looks so lost and lonely
Walking down the Filbert Steps
Past the tables at Trieste
Like she swallowed a sleeping pill
On her way down Telegraph Hill
There's the woman who wore the smile
Who had the poise and the graceful style
Now she seems to walk in circles
Like a lazy backyard turtle
Her eyes are sadder than a fawn
Than an empty koi fish pond
When she used to walk in her door
He would rise up from the floor
And when their eyes met
He always felt
He always felt like dancing
And he always wanted to bring love
And he always filled the room with spirit
The miles they traveled were long and heavy
They lived in Paris when she was twenty
And then they moved to San Francisco
Went back and forth to Orange County
The miles they traveled were long and far
And there in the passenger seat of her car
He took his last breath
And she kissed him and she wept
And she wept
In the driver's seat
There in the summer heat
He always wanted to go to the ocean
And he always kept her in constant motion
And he filled her heart with happiness
At the end of her walk
She still hears his call
From her bay window
On Broadway
Some nights she thinks
She still hears his feet squeak
On her apartment floor
On Broadway
There's the woman with the neighbors
Who used to kindly stop and greet her
Until they sensed her emptiness
And now they stop her less and less
Now she walks beside a shadow
Like she's led off to the gallows
For he's the loveliest thing she's ever known
But in time her dampened flame will grow
And in time with his passing she'll make peace
And in time the ocean she will reach
And in time she'll fall into a trance
And in her dreams again they will dance
And one morning she'll wake up with a smile that beams
And she'll honor him but learn to love other things
And they'll always slow dance in her dreams
And they'll always slow dance in her dreams
And they'll always slow dance in her dreams
And they'll always slow dance in her dreams
And they'll always slow dance in her dreams
And they'll always slow dance in her dreams
And they'll always slow dance in her dreamsEmbed
