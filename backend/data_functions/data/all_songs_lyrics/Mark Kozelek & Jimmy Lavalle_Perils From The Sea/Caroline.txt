Caroline LyricsWalkin' down Broadway, pacin' the streets of Chinatown
Walked them so much, be walkin' 'em when
I'm old and hunched over, maybe with a friend
Maybe with my love, or maybe alone
Circlin' the globe, I ache with midnight loneliness
My heart turns black, the demons nest inside my soul
When each night comes and I close the door
I feel the cold, I see the digital clocks
I face the ceiling layin' on my back
Got no willpower, honestly
And crave your touch to comfort me
Caroline
You're always in my heart and in my mind
Caroline
Though I've lied before and I don't deserve your love
Caroline
I don't deserve your kindness or your time
Caroline
The Holiday Inn, the Hilton Hotel
The Intercontinental, the Admiral Fell
Embassy Suites, Islington, Jury's Inn
Doubletree's got a nice pool where I swim
Scandic Stockholm's got a nice gym
And baths and saunas to soak in my sins
Marriot Courtyard, Radisson Blu
Wherever I am, I try to reach you
'Cause nothing's better than any given day
Layin' in bed with you, lookin' out at the bay
Watchin' a movie or watchin' a fight
Like when Manny Pacquiao had an easy night
Of Ricky Hatton, and I rolled over
And kissed your neck, and I smelled your skin
And I still fall in love with you every time
That I hold you close and I look in your eyes
Caroline
You always seem to find me when I'm losin' my grip
Caroline
When I'm lost at sea like an old ghost ship
Caroline
When I'm hiding behind walls and I've stopped seein' my friends
Caroline
When I don't feel like talkin'
When I'm icy as Nordic Decembers
Disconnected and cannot remember
If last Christmas we had spent together
If I'm alive or I'm a soft grey cloud
Sleepwalkin' through traffic lights downtown
When I can't discern, cannot decipher
Pages fallin' from this old typewriter
Caroline
Are we running out of time? Well, I hope we're not
Caroline
'Cause there's no one I could find who could hold up to you
Caroline
Without you, I'm no one; deaf, blind and mute
Caroline
This mornin' I woke up next to my love and her rat terrier pup
She went off, worked her day long
And I stayed home and I wrote songs
Took my break down the block and drank iced tea at the coffee shop
My agent called, said "I got somethin' for ya
In Halifax, Nova Scotia, Winnipeg, Manitoba
Netherlands, London, U.K
Then come back home, Seattle, Portland, L.A."
Walkin' down Broadway, through the streets of Chinatown
I scratch my head and I look down
I'll still be walkin' 'em when I'm old, maybe with a friend
Maybe with my love, maybe aloneEmbed
