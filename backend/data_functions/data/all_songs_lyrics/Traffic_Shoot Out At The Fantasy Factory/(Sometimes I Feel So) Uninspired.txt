(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired LyricsSometimes I feel so uninspired
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel so very tired
Sometimes I feel like I've had enough
Sometimes you feel like you've been hired
Sometimes you feel like you've been bought
Sometimes you feel like your room's been wired
Sometimes you feel like you've been caught
But don't let it get you down, no, no
There is no reason for not failing
You've got to smile and turn the other cheek
So today you might beat up
But by tomorrow you'll be sailing
And you won't even hear these words I speak
Some people want to be so desired
Some people can't stand the light of day
Somebody's laughing while someone is crying
Oh, for to want in the close of the day
But sometimes I feel like my head is spinning
I'm gonna cave with all I see, yeah
I don't know who's losing
And I don't care who's winning
Hardships and trouble are following me
But don't let it get you down, no, no
There is no reason for not failing
You've got to smile and turn the other cheek
So today you might beat up
But by tomorrow you'll be sailing
And you won't even hear these words I speak
Some people want to be so desired
Some people can't stand the light of day
Somebody's laughing while someone is crying
Oh, for to want in the close of the day
Sometimes I feel like my head is spinning
I'm gonna cave with all I see, yeah
I don't know who's losing
And I don't care who's winning
Hardships and trouble are following me, yeah, yeahEmbed
