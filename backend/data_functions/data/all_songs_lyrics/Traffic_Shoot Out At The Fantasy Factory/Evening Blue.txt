Evening Blue Lyrics(Winwood/Capaldi)
Sitting all alone by the fireside
Listen to the wind in the chimney top
Haven't slept for days, and I'm still wide eyed
Try not to think, but my mind won't stop
Evening shadows making my heart sing out
With the setting sun, turning leaves to brown
If I had a lover, who's heart was true
I wouldn't be alone in this evening blue
Everybody's looking for something in life
Not everyone's finds what they're looking for
Everybody wants a little happiness in life
But everyone can open the door
Morning wakens, making my heart sing out
Now that summer's here, changing fears and doubts
