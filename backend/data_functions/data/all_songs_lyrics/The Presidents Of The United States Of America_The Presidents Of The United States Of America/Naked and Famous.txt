Naked and Famous LyricsI can't explain glacial motion
Or why Los Angeles don't drop into the ocean
I can't unfold the layers of mystery
Or piece together the tragedy of history, â€˜cause
Those lucky suckers
They don't have to work
Make 3D billboards and big
30-foot smurfs.
Everybody wants to be naked and famous
Everybody wants to be just like me
I'm naked
And famous
I met a poet, said she didn't like the smell of it
Then took her clothes off in a restaurant for the hell of it
I met a DJ who lived in seclusion
Reality and sobriety were her only delusions, and
Those lucky bastards
They didn't have to work
Make 3D billboards and big
30-foot smurfs
Don't get a nosebleed
Don't get upset
We can't be naked and famous
Just yet
There's a big old dollar sign
On the sunset strip
You can send your friend a postcard
It ain't worth the trip
Everybody wants to be naked and famous
Everybody wants to be just like me
I'm naked
Everybody wants to be naked and famous
Everybody wants to be just like me
I'm naked
Everybody wants to be naked and famous
Everybody wants to be just like me
I'm naked

And famousEmbed
