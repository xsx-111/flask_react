Kick Out the Jams LyricsWell, I've been elected to rock your asses 'til midnight
Well, this is my term and I've shaved off my perm but it's alright
I solemnly swear to uphold the Constitution
Got a rock 'n' roll problem, well, we got the solution
Just let me be who I am - and let me kick out the jams, yeah
Let me kick out the jams; I done kicked 'em out
Well, I've been selected to orbit the planet in a rocket (In a rocket)
I'm goin' to Mars; I got a message for the poodle in your pocket (In your pocket)
Well, mission control callin' supernova
The hotline's rockin'; you can come on over
And let us be who we am - and let us kick out the jams, yeah
Kick out the jams; we done kicked 'em out1Embed
