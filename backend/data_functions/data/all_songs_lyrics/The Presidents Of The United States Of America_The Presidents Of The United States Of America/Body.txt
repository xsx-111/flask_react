Body LyricsLittle salamander where did you go?
Edge of the yard
I found you you know
All brown and hard
I can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
I can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
She goes smooth through my body, yeah
Through my body she goes smooth
She goes smooth through my body, yeah
Through my body she goes smooth
Little killer froggy where did you hop?
Under the entertainment center
Realized you just couldn't stop
The worms found a hole in your booty they could enter
And I can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
I can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
You go smooth through my body, yeah
Through my body you go smooth
You go smooth through my body, yeah
Through my body you go smooth
Hey, little lizard where did you slink?
Left your cage door open
Under the basement sink
The drippin' water made your moldy body eyes open
And I can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
I can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
Can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
Can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
Can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body
Can't get your body out of my mind
I can't get your body1Embed
