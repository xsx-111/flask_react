Stranger LyricsYou - Lynyrd Skynyrd hat
And me - little kitty
Sat across with a velvet jacket
Wild orange hair and dark dark eyes
I gawked - like a 12-year-old, smitten
Carla the stripper - straight from L.A
You seem cool for a naked chick in a booth
Let's be pals someday
In other words: put some clothes on and call me
I saw you - it was incredible
Slim, relaxed buyin' wine at the QFC
On a snowy Saturday night
Black pearls and I swear you were drinking beer
You were the redhead behind the counter there
I'm the one who fell out of his chair there
You had your dry cleaning and I think you're dreamy
I saw you - it was incredible
Mumbled these words at you - unintelligible
Ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma-ma-ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma-ma-ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma-ma-ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma-ma-ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma...
Hey, you there, what time is it?
Yeah
I saw you - it was incredibleEmbed
