We Are Not Going to Make It LyricsWe're not gonna make it
No, no, we're not gonna to make it
'Cause there's a million better bands
With a million better songs
Drummers who can drum
And singers who can sing
Deep in my heart
I do believe
We're not gonna make it
No, no, we're not gonna to make it
'Cause we don't have the talent
And we don't have the time
And we don't have the patience
And we don't know how to rhyme
Deep in my heart
I do believe
We're not gonna make it
No, no, we're not gonna to make it
Said no, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no-no, n-no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no-no, n-no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no-no, n-no, no
We're not gonna make it
Yeah
We're not gonnaEmbed
