Candy LyricsSugar's only sweetness
Salt is ocean tears
And you were my only weakness
For years and years and years
You little yellow sweetie
You were hiding in a jar
Now my mind is gone completely
Take off the lid and there you are
You're my candy
Candy
Well, the devil she made sweet candy
Took six days and nights to dream
On the seventh day she rested
Woke up early and made ice cream
Now, the devil she must be a dentist
With deep jawbreaker eyes
Red rope hair, gum drop lips
Cotton candy thighs
You're my candy
Candy
Chocolate lava stole my body
And aftertaste stole my mind
Left me danglin' down defenseless
And then sweet candy she said goodbye
Now my teeth are worn and useless
My eyes too sunk to see
My tongue swole up to twice its size
And all I wanna do is eat
Candy
My candy
My candy
My candy
Suckin' on my candyEmbed
