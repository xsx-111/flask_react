Feather Pluckn Lyrics
(But that's totally)
(But that's totally)

A-billions of birdies squawkin' out loud
Talkin' in code to clams in the clouds
They send a secret message, they send it by worm
So vibratin' spiders will receive the word

But that's totally feather pluckn' insane

Ten million monkeys all pick up guitars
But nobody taught them how
Five thousand fishies rockin' really, really, really hard
Nobody taught them how
Check out chickie drivin' piggy's little blue car
Nobody taught him how
Mmm, yeah
Yeah
Peace, brother

Well, flies like to fly 'cuz they don't like to stay
They're buzzin' in the ears of the chicken all day
Chicken understand and he peck out the code
Send a subsonic signal through the snot in the middle of an elephant's long wet cold grey nose
But that's totally - feather pluckn' insane

Ten million monkeys all pick up guitars
Nobody taught them how
Five thousand froggies rockin' really, really, really hard
Nobody taught them how
Check out chickie drivin' piggy's little blue car
Nobody taught him how

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, said oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Said oh yeah
Everybody supernova
Everybody supernova
Everybody supernova
Everybody supernova
Oh yeahEmbed
