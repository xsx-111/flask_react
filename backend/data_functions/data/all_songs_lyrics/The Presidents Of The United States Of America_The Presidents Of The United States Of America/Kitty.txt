Kitty LyricsMeow, meow, meow-meow, meow-meow
Meow, meow
Meow, meow
Little bag of bones been out all night
Little bag of bones been out all night
Can you hear him scratchin' at the screen door?
Can you hear him scratchin' at the screen door?
Little bag of bones been out all night
He needs some pettin' and lovin' on his head
He needs some pettin' and lovin' on his rain-soaked hide
He's circlin' around my ankle
He's circlin' around my ankle
He needs some pettin' and lovin' on his hide
Kitty, won't you come inside?
Kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
Kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I want to touch it
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow-meow
Meow, meow
Meow, meow
A pussy purrin' and lookin' so satisfied
A pussy purrin' and lookin' so satisfied
I'm lost in his little yellow round eye
Lost in his little yellow round eye
Pussy purrin' and lookin' so satisfied
Kitty rear up and scratch me through my jeans
Kitty rear up and scratch me through my jeans
Fuck you kitty; you're gonna to spend the night (Meow?)
Fuck you kitty; you're gonna to spend the night (Meow!)
Fuck you kitty; you're gonna to spend the night OUTSIDE
Kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
Kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I want to touch it
Touch it
I wanna touch it
I wanna touch it
I wanna touch it
Wanna touch it
Wanna touch it
I wanna touch it
...Touch it
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, touch it
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, touch it
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, touch it
Kitty at my foot and I want to touch it2Embed
