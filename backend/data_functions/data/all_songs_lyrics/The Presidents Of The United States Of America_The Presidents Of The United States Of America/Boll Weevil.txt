Boll Weevil LyricsGet down
Let me tell you about a friend of mine
His name's Boll Weevil, check him out
Spends all day - on his big butt
And he don't ever, ever get outside
I come to visit, I bring some sunshine
And I just spread it all over the fire
He's stuck on his big couch, stuck in his big shell
He looks at the TV and he's all right
I come from the Drug-Mo, the local drug store
Bug is a fly, baby, he's never uptight
And I wonder: Boll Weevil why don't you get out of your home?
He said "I'm comfortable here; I don't wanna move, I don't wanna leave"
I said "Boll Weevil get right out of your home"
Good bye, I gotta stay, I'll move some other day, bye bye, gotta go to sleep
And let the tube shine, let the tube shine
Let the tube shine, let the tube shine
Now I would tell you about Boll Weevil but that bug is just too scary
He's sittin' there all alone, but I try to coax him out with chocolate pies
But he would not move a muscle and I tried
To make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Break it down
Check it out
Boll Weevil get right out of your home
Boll Weevil get right out of your home
Boll Weevil get right out of your home
Boll Weevil get right out of your home
Now I would tell you about Boll Weevil but that bug is just too scary
He's sittin' there all alone, but I try to coax him out with chocolate pies
But he would not move a muscle and I tried
To make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' out
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see that the sun is shinin' outside
Make him see the sun, make him see the sun
Make him see the god-damn sun
C'mon little buggy, he's a little bugEmbed
