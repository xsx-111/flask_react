Peaches Lyrics
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat me a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches

Peaches come from a can
They were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
If I had my little way
I'd eat peaches every day
Sun-soakin' bulges in the shade

Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat me a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
I took a little nap where the roots all twist
Squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature's candy in my hand or can or a pie

Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free (Look out!)
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free (Look out!)4Embed
