To Whom It May Concern Lyrics
Don't sit and wait, don't sit and dream
Put on a smile, go find a scene
I'm sure you'd meet
Someone who would really love you

Don't sit and hope, don't sit and pine
If you've been hurt, make up your mind
I'm sure you'd find
Someone who would really love you

I don't know why you sit around
I only know if love is gone
Don't sit alone
With your pride

To whom this may concern to say
Don't wait for love to come your way
Don't waste your time, make up your mind
And make it happen

I don't know why you sit around
(Do-do-do-down) I only know if love is gone
Don't sit alone
With your pride
Listen to me and you would see
Just how fine your romance could be


I don't know why you sit around
I only know if love is gone
Don't sit alone
With your pride

Listen to me and you would see
Just how fine your romance could be
