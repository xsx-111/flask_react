Drawing Pins Lyrics
Every light is blinding
Every minute lasts all day
Every thought is fighting
They're not falling into place

I'm held down by drawing pins
They pierce the skin
Lights are on but no one's in
When you talk
I don't feel like I belong
Here at all

Tell me what you did it
What you did it
What you did it for
'Cause I, I, I can't figure it out
What you did it
What you did it
What you did it for
'Cause I, I, I can't figure it out

I could use some Magick
C'mon Crowley, let me in
I'm held down by drawing pins
They pierce the skin
I try not to fall asleep
When you talk
I don't think that I belong
Here at all

Tell me what you did it
What you did it
What you did it for
'Cause I, I, I can't figure it out
What you did it
What you did it
What you did it for
'Cause I, I, I can't figure it out


What do I have to do
To be loved, loved by you?
What do I have to do
To be loved, loved by you?
What do I have to do
To be loved, loved by you?
What do I have to do
To be loved, loved by you?
Tell me what you did it
What you did it
What you did it for
'Cause I, I, I can't figure it out
What you did it
What you did it
What you did it for
'Cause I, I, I can't figure it out
What do I have to do
To be loved, loved by you2Embed
