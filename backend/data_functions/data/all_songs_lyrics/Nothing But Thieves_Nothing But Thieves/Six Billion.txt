Six Billion Lyrics
Sometimes the cord likes to break
Sometimes the light tries to bend away
Sometimes you're thrust against the wall
Sometimes the world wants to see you crawl

And you can't decide if it's enough
You can't decide if it's enough
Six billion lives looking for love
You can't decide if it's enough

The end is the same for everyone
Should be enough for us to be as one
Watch me fall apart over you
Watch me fall apart
Tryna please you

And you can't decide if it's enough
You can't decide if it's enough
Six billion lives looking for love
And you can't decide if it's enough

And you can't decide if it's enough
You can't decide if it's enough
Six billion lives looking for love
You can't decide if it's enough

Watch me fall apart
Tryna please you
It's all I want to do
Watch me fall apart
Tryna please you
It's all I want to do2Embed
