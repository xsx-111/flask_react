Ban All the Music Lyrics
Cut me off from the rest of the world
It's my addiction, it turns me on
It's oh so quiet at my end of the world
Ban all the music, it's all gone wrong

This is, this is it
They're tryna take it from me
Got this, this is it
Won't let them take it from me
Play an illegal song and turn it up louder
Play an illegal song and turn it up louder

There's a buzz in the air, I've been told
It's my affliction, been sick so long
Switching off all the noise I've been sold
Ban all the music, it's all gone wrong

This is, this is it
They're tryna take it from me
Got this, this is it
Won't let them take it from me
Play an illegal song and turn it up louder
Play an illegal song and turn it up louder
This is, this is it
They're tryna take it from me
Got this, this is it
Won't let them take it from me
Play an illegal song and turn it up louder
Play an illegal song and turn it up louder6Embed
