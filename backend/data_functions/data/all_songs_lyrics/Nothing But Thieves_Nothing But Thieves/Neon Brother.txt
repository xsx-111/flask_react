Neon Brother Lyrics
If you open my chest, see that two hearts are beating
Falling out of sync
There's the one I accept and the one I believe in
Which one drew you in?

In the night, in the night, this is how it goes
We are all or nothing
It's alright, It's alright, listen to your bones
Can you hear it coming?

Do you see something real or just some kind of mirror
Staring back at you
It's a punch and a kiss and I'm trying to remember
Which one is the truth

In the night, in the night, where we feel at home
With the wires humming
In the night, in the night, we are not alone
Can you hear it coming?

I heard my brother crying out
I heard my brother crying out
From the beginning, we were in rhythm
I heard my brother, crying out
Yeah we'll build something new and we'll do it together
Wake up from our sleep
It'll kick like a mule and it won't live forever
That's alright with me

In the night, in the night, where we feel at home
With the wires humming
It's alright, it's alright, we are not alone
Can you hear it coming?

I heard my brother crying out
I heard my brother crying out
From the beginning, we were in rhythm
I heard my brother, crying out
From the beginning, we were in rhythm
I heard my brother crying out

If you open my chest, see that two hearts are beating
They both beat so slow

I heard my brother crying out
I heard my brother crying out
I heard my brother crying out
I heard my brother crying out10Embed
