Graveyard Whistling Lyrics
All that afterlife
I don't hold with it
All your gods are false
Just get used to it
Let's go out tonight
Kill some stubborn myths
Set those ghosts alight
Get into it

No one's getting younger
Would you like a souvenir?
Let it take you under
Feel your worries disappear

'Cause if you don't believe
It can't hurt you
And when you let it leave
It can't hurt you
'Cause if you don't believe
Then you know and you know it can never do you harm
If you don't believe
It can't hurt you
Okay, I'll admit
I'm not innocent
I did everything
And I would again
I'm not listening
I've heard everything
Graveyard whistling
I'm into it

No one's getting younger
Would you like a souvenir?
Let it take you under
Feel your worries disappear

'Cause if you don't believe
It can't hurt you
And when you let it leave
It can't hurt you
'Cause if you don't believe
Then you know, then you know, it can never do you harm
If you don't believe
It can't hurt you
I get a picture and a password and a number
Give me access to the cloud I'm living under
When I go there will I find a sense of wonder?
Open up the gates

'Cause if you don't believe
It can't hurt you
And when you let it leave
It can't hurt you
'Cause if you don't believe
Then you know, then you know, it can never do you harm
If you don't believe
It can't hurt you7Embed
