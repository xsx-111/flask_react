Itch Lyrics
There's a rumblin' in my head
It's gettin' louder and louder
There's a shakin' in my bones
It's gettin' stronger and stronger
There's a hunger in my heart
It's full of promise, promise
There's an itch under my skin
It's under my skin, under my skin, yeah

'Cause, ooh, I
I just wanna feel something real
'Cause, ooh, I
I just wanna feel something

On the pavement I am looking
For a lover, a lover
And my eyes are rolling
She noticed, she noticed
There's a blood red on my shirt
And it's shining, it's shining
There's a sharp pain from my face
I kinda like it, I like it
'Cause, ooh, I
I just wanna feel something real
'Cause, ooh, I
I just wanna feel something real
I wanna feel something

(Something, something)
(Something, something)
(Something, something, something)
(Something, something, something)
I just wanna love
I just wanna touch
I just wanna see, something, yeah
I just wanna love
I just wanna touch
I just wanna see

'Cause, ooh, I
I just wanna feel something real
'Cause, ooh, I
I just wanna feel something real
I wanna feel something12Embed
