Hostage Lyrics
When I'm in the dark
Sometimes I feel like a hostage
Keep me in the dark
I want to feel like a hostage

The night and the dark appreciate
The light and the heat we generate
My heart and my soul cooperate
I want you to be happy
I just want to give myself to it
I'll come when you call me a little bitch
It gets me when you whisper it
I want you to be happy

Sometimes I feel like a hostage
When I'm in the dark
Sometimes I feel like a hostage
Point it at my heart

I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy
I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy
The day and the night don't separate
This ache for you starts to dominate
I'm finding it hard to concentrate
I want you to be happy
I wait for you like a prisoner
Whatever it is that moves in us
It's starting to feel a lot like love
I want you to be happy

Sometimes I feel like a hostage
When I'm in the dark
Sometimes I feel like a hostage
Point it at my heart

I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy
I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy

Sometimes I feel like a hostage
Sometimes I feel like a hostage
Sometimes I feel like a hostage
I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy
I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy
I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy
I want you, I want you
I want you to be happy3Embed
