Tempt You (Evocatio) Lyrics
Darling, I'm gonna build you something
Sweetie, you need something better
Let me build you something better
Heaven, it's lonely in your heaven
Darling we should get together
I could worship you forever

How do I tempt you
Out of the city
Out of the city
Out of the city tonight?
How do I tempt you
Out of the city
Out of the city
Out of the city tonight?

Honey, just let me spend my money
Goddess, we could make it simple
Wanna build a brand new temple
Heaven, there's room for us in heaven
We could stay this way forever
While your people pray together
How do I tempt you
Out of the city
Out of the city
Out of the city tonight?
How do I tempt you
Out of the city
Out of the city
Out of the city tonight?6Embed
