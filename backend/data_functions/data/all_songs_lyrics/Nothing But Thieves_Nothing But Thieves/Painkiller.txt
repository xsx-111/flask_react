Painkiller Lyrics
I'll light two cigarettes
Then I'll give you one
Oh, that never gets old
No, that never gets old

You send me your regrets
Look what you've done
Now you'll never grow old
No, you'll never grow old

These messages won't compute
Those images don't come through
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
Those images don't come through
These messages won't compute

Your love
Your love
Score love as a painkiller
Your love
More love
Pure love as a painkiller
Your love
Is just
Your love is a painkiller
Your love is a painkiller
Sweet tasting overdose
Oxytocin
Oh, I'll never be told
No, I'll never be told

These messages won't compute
Those images don't come through
No matter what they say
No matter what they do
These messages won't compute

Your love
Your love
Score love as a painkiller
Your love
More love
Pure love as a painkiller
Your love
Your love
Score love as a painkiller
Your love
More love
Pure love as a painkiller
