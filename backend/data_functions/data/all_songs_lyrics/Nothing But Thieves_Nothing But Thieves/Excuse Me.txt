Excuse Me Lyrics
His space crowds out your space
Your space
Your space crowds out hers
Coffee breath and headphone hiss
But no one says a word

Eyes upon the paper headline
Refuge in your phone
Bumping shoulders, cough and sniff
But no-one says hello

Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Excuse me while I run
I really got to get out of here

My heart beats like yours does
Hers does
My heart keeps good time
And everyday I mind the gap between you and me
Here comes someone else to share the air we breathe
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Reach out for anyone
And they will tell you get out of here
I'm asking everyone
You gotta help me get outta here
Excuse me while I run
I really got to get out of here

Meanwhile under the gun
Hey everyone, our work here is done
A way out, you gonna come?
Hey everyone, our work here is done

Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Reach out for anyone
And they will tell you get out of here
I'm asking everyone
You gotta help me get outta here
Excuse me while run
I really got to get out of here10Embed
