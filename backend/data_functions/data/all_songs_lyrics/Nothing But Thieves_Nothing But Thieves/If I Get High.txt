If I Get High Lyrics
I'll meet you at the divide
To break the spell
A point where two worlds collide
Yeah, we'll rebel

And we run, and we run, and we run, and we run
And we run, and we run, and we run
Until we break through

If I get high enough
If I get high enough, will I see you again?

I fill my lungs every night
Not long to wait
And if I do this thing right
I dream of our escape

Oh, and we run, and we run, and we run, and we run
And we run, and we run, and we run
Until we break through
If I get high enough
If I get high enough, will I see you again?

Will I see you again?
If I get high, if I get high
If I get high

And we run, and we run, and we run, and we run
And we run, and we run, and we run
Until we break through
Oh, and we run, and we run, and we run, and we run
And we run, and we run, and we run22Embed
