Honey Whiskey Lyrics
This party's pretty boring
I don't think it's for me
Lucy's already crashed out
She's on the spare settee

This air is getting so thin
Go down, go down, go down
The honey whiskey's kickin'
Go down, go down, go down

I think I better go, before I try something
I might regret, I might regret
I think I better go, before I try something
I might regret, I might regret

Black-hearted angels sunk me
With kisses on my mouth
There's poison in this water
The words are falling out

This air is getting so thin
Go down, go down, go down
The honey whiskey's kickin'
Go down, go down
I think I better go, before I try something
I might regret, I might regret
I think I better go, before I try something
I might regret, I might regret

I think I better go, before I try something
I might regret, I might regret
I think I better go, before I try something
I might regret, I might regret

But if you wanna free your body tonight
It's our secret, it's our secret
I think I better go, before I try something
I might regret, I might regret7Embed
