Hanging Lyrics
The blue one is a little chiller
Use it to take the edge off a touch
Pink one is a buzzkiller
But she stops me from feeling too much
This place stays the same
What we gonna do in the pouring rain?
Yoo hoo, Mary Jane
Are you gonna come for a dance today?

Hanging by a thread
She said
"Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?"
Some days never end
That depends
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?

It's true it can't get us down forever
You say
"But, hell, I swear I don't know"
I threw my keys into the river
'Cause I didn't wanna go home
Goodbye, don't explain
I don't wanna know why anyway, yeah
Yoo hoo, Mary Jane
Are you comin' 'round for a dance today?
Hanging by a thread
She said
"Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?"
Some days never end
That depends
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?

Let's dive into this hole together, like this
And hope we never come out

Hanging by a thread
She said
"Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?"
Some days never end
That depends
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?
Where do you wanna go?3Embed
