Trip Switch Lyrics
Sharing secrets with another world
Rubbing shoulders with some unknown lovers
Making waves through the universe
Starting wars with anonymous brothers
Trip switch
Trip switch

Make a wish and I'll count to three
Press the button and we'll both be happy
Sending signals is a dirty trick
I get my love in a digital package
Trip switch
Trip switch

What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
Down, down, down, down, down, down
When the lights go down, down, down, down, down, down
When the lights go
Give me data 'cause I need a hit
How I love stratospheric numbers
Information, I've been craving it
Give me yours, then give me all the others

What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
Down, down, down, down, down, down
When the lights go down, down, down, down, down, down
When the lights go

They put out the lights
They put out the lights
They put out the lights

What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
What we do when the power's out
What do we do when the lights go down?
Down, down, down, down, down, down
When the lights go down, down, down, down, down, down
When the lights go14Embed
