Wake Up Call Lyrics
We met when we were young
I told you where to go
You had those creepers on
You showed me how to roll
Step out, this town
Has nothing that I wanna know
These thoughts are wireless
This ain't no crowd control
These hearts are violent
They murder rock and roll
Slow down fade out
That's not how I wanna go

Sometimes we never get started
No one will give you a wake up call
Sometimes the hours are wasted
No one will give you a wake up call

We need another rush
Something to fill our days
It lies in wait for us
It lives on empty space
Slow down, fade out
That's not how I wanna go
Sometimes you never get started
No one will give you a wake up call
Sometimes the hours are wasted
No one will give you a wake up call
Sometimes you never get started
No one will give you a wake up call
Sometimes the hours are wasted
No one will give you a wake up call8Embed
