Genius of Love - Live Lyrics
I'm just a murder weapon! Comin' at you right now, ladies and gentlemen, the Tom Tom Club, so check it out!
Ha!
Shock!
Shock!
Shock!
Shock!
HOOOOOO!
Uh-Huh!
Check it out!

(Whatcha gonna do when you get out of jail?)
I'm gonna have some fun!
(What do you consider fun?)
Fun, nasty fun!

The girls can do it too, y'all!

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning, and there is no end
Time isn't present in that dimension (Sure ain't!)
He'll take my arm
When we're walking, rolling and rocking
It's one time I'm glad I'm not a man
Feels like I'm dreaming when I'm not sleeping
Hahahaha!
Oo-Ha!
Shock!
Huagh!
Shock!
Huagh!
Shock!
Check it out!

All the weekend
Boyfriend was missing
I surely miss him
The way he'd hold me in his warm arms
We went insane when we took cocaine

Psychedelic and Funkadelic!
Uh-huh!
And everything is just jumping outta sight!
All night!
Check it out!

Stepping in-a rhythm to-a Kurtis Blow
Who needs to think when your feet just go?
With a hippity-hop, with a hippity-ho

Who needs to think when your feet just go?
(Bohannon!) Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon
Who needs to think when your feet just go?
(Bohannon!) Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon

Ha!
James Brown, James Brown! Yeow!
James Brown, James Brown! Yoooo!
He still is the Godfather of Soul, y'all, so check it out!
Hah!
Feels good to me!

If you see him
Please remind him, unhappy boyfriend
Well, he's the genius of love
He's got a greater depth of feeling
Well, he's the genius of love
He's so deep

Freeze!
Looks frozen to me!
Who dat?
Who dat?
Now who dat tryin' to be bad?
You mother!
Who dat?
Who dat?
Now who dat tryin' to be bad?
You mother!
Who dat?
Who dat?
Now who dat tryin' to be bad?
You mother!
Who dat?
Who dat?
Everybody! Rock the house!
Yeah!
Uh-huh!
Oo-ha!
Okay that's it for the Tom Tom Club, nice to be here!
We gotta change back into the Talking Heads!
So when I say "bye," we gotta go!
Okay!
Okay bye!
(Thank you, good to be here!)Embed
