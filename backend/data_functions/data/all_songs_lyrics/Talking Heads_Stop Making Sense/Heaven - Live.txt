Heaven - Live Lyrics
Everyone is trying
To get into the bar
The name of the bar
The bar is called heaven
The band in heaven
They play my favorite song
Play it one more time
Play it all night long

Heaven, heaven is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens
Heaven, heaven is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens

There is a party
Everyone is there
Everyone will leave
At exactly the same time
When this party's over
It will start again
It will not be any different
It will be exactly the same
Heaven, heaven is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens
Heaven, heaven is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens

When this kiss is over
It will start again
It will not be any different
It will be exactly the same
It's hard to imagine
That nothing at all
Could be so exciting
Could be this much fun

Oh, heaven, heaven is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens
Heaven, heaven is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happensEmbed
