Young Lyrics
We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain
I see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can make
I see the life, I see the sky, I'd give it all to see you fly
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it
I watch the beauty of all our lives, passing right before my eyes
I hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurt
We get so sick, we're so sick, we never wanted all this
Medication for the kids with no reason to live

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart
As we walk among these shadows in these streets, these fields of battle
Take it up, we wear the mantle, raise your hands with burning candles
Hear us whisper in the dark; in the rain, you see the spark
Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home
But you take all we are, the innocence of our hearts
Made to kneel before the altar as you tear us apart

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (we will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (we will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (We will fall)
Till the angels save us all
We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart21Embed
