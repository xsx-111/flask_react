Voice of Treason LyricsThe mist is sleeping on the water
And winter is hiding in my heart
Thorns in my eyes are slowing me down
I can't pass through to the other side
She knows I'm the one who sought her
But when we fall, we'll fall so hard
She holds a secret and won't show me how
How to break the riddle in her eyes
This is treason of the mind and soul
There's no reason why you'd go
Inside the ghost of love is laughing
It mocks the footsteps where I go
It tells me nothing has been lost
It whispers: "you've seen darkness before"
In time the hurting will subside
And longing is overthrown
What's left is a void that grows inside
And the echo of a failure
This is treason of the mind and soul
There's no reason why you'd go
Have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside?
Have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides?
Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up?
Have we given up?
Is it over?
Have you given up?
Is winter hiding in your heart?Embed
