Solitude LyricsMy name, it means nothing
My fortune means less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is faraway, clouds linger on
Everything I possess now they are gone
They are gone… they are gone
Now where can I go to
And what can I do
Nothing completes me and my thought are on you
You just left when I begged you to stay
I’ve not stopped crying since you went away
You went away… you went away
The world is a lonely place
You’re on your own
Guess I will go home and sit down and moan
Crying and thinking is all that I do
Memories I have remind me of you
Of you…of youEmbed
