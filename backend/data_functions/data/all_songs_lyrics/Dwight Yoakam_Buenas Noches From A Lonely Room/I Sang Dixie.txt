I Sang Dixie Lyrics
I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died

He said, "Way down yonder in the land of cotton
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street"
Then he drew a dying breath
And laid his head against my chest
Please, Lord, take his soul back home to Dixie

And I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died


He said, "Listen to me, son, while you still can
Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see, what life here has done to me"
Then he closed those old blue eyes
And fell limp, against my side
No more pain, and now he's safe back home in Dixie
And I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died

I sang Dixie, as he diedEmbed
