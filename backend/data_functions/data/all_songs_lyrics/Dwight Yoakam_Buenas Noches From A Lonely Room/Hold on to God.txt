Hold on to God LyricsChorus:
Hold on, hold on, hold on to God
And not the ways of the world
Hold on, hold on and put your trust
In His ever lasting Word
Hold on, hold on, hold on to God
In this life's storm-tossed sea
Cling to Jesus, His lifeline
It will salvation bring
Satan shall lead down a pathway of sin
Away from your heavenly home
With many great wonders, many great signs
Deceiving all but the strong
Chorus:
Hold on, hold on, hold on to God
And not the ways of the world
Hold on, hold on and put your trust
In His ever lasting Word
Hold on, hold on, hold on to God
In this life's storm-tossed sea
Cling to Jesus, His lifeline
It will salvation bring
Instrumental
Be not misled by miraculous deeds
Performed in the name of the Lamb
For He shall return as a thief in the night
To claim his own once again
Chorus:
Hold on, hold on, hold on to God
And not the ways of the world
Hold on, hold on and put your trust
In His ever lasting Word
Hold on, hold on, hold on to God
In this life's storm-tossed sea
Cling to Jesus, His lifeline
It will salvation bring
Cling to Jesus, His lifeline
It will salvation bring...Embed
