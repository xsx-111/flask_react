One More Name LyricsMy friends tried to tell me
You were steppin' around
But I wouldn't hear it, no I
I shut them all down
But now I'm a thinkin'
You've made a fool out of me
'Cause the words that are slippin'
Spell grief and misery
Chorus:
One more name, one more name
You call out in your sleep
One more name and I'll
Know it's not a lie
One more name, one more name
That from your lips does creep
One more name and our
Love will surely die
--- Instrumental ---
Haunted and tortured by
The rumours about you
Listening in silence
To whispers of truth
Deceived by the soft kiss
You forge every day
While each night those same lips
Give your secret away
Chorus:
One more name, one more name
You call out in your sleep
One more name and I'll
Know it's not a lie
One more name, one more name
That from your lips does creep
One more name and our
Love will surely die
Chorus:
One more name, one more name
You call out in your sleep
One more name and I'll
Know it's not a lie
One more name, one more name
That from your lips does creep
One more name and our
Love will surely die
One more name and our
Love will surely die...Embed
