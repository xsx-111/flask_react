Send Me the Pillow LyricsChorus:
Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So, darlin', I can dream on it, too
Each night while I'm sleeping, oh so lonely
I'll share your love and dreams that once were true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So, darlin', I can dream on it, too
--- Instrumental ---
Send me the pillow that you dream on
Maybe time will let our dreams come true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So, darlin', I can dream on it, too
I've waited so long for you to write me
But just a memory is all that is left of you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So, darlin', I can dream on it too
So, darlin', I can dream on it too...Embed
