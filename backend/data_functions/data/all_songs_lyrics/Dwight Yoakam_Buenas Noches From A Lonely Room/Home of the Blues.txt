Home of the Blues LyricsIt's Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the road all losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops of my friend
I'll meet you at the home of the Blues
I walk and I cry as my heartbeat
Keeps in time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of my mine
It's dark here at the home of the Blues
But this place is filled with sweetest memories
The Memories so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
That I just want to lay right down and die
So if you just lost your sweetheart
And you ain't got no good way to choose
Then Come follow me, misery loves company
I'll meet you at the home of the Blues
Instrumental
But this place is filled with sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
With Dreams that I had left me feeling oh so bad
That I just want to lay right down and die
So if you just lost your sweetheart
And you ain't got no good way to choose
Then Come follow me, misery loves company
I'll meet you at the home of the Blues
Yeah I'll see you at the home of the Blues
Oh, Your welcome at the home of the Blues...Embed
