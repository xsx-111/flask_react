Time to Get Out LyricsFind me ninety miles from Cuba
In a land that has no borders
If the bomb can do it for you
We refuse to take your orders
We remember what you taught us
Time to get out while you can
Twenty-three and one half billion
Joints were smoked by lunchtime Thursday
On the Steppes its not so easy
Vodka helps them sing much stronger
Place your bets which side lives longer
Time to get out while you canEmbed
