Funny Feeling LyricsHey it's no surprise that you're going tonight
Well alright, had a funny feeling
I don't want to go on wasting your time
Well alright, had a funny feeling
That came the whole morning through
It's not hard to do
I'm just not getting through
Don't live a lie
I'd rather say goodbye
Please don't explain
No use pretending it's the same
You don't have to tell me I've known it all day
Well alright, had a funny feeling
I don't see a happy ending coming our way
Well alright, had a funny feeling
That came the whole morning through
It's not hard to do
I'm just not getting through
Don't live a lie
I'd rather say goodbye
Please don't explain
No use pretending it's the same
Hey it's no surprise that you're going tonight
Well alright, had a funny feeling
I don't want to go on wasting your time
Well alright, had a funny feeling
Don't live a lie
I'd rather say goodbye
Please don't explain
No use pretending it's the sameEmbed
