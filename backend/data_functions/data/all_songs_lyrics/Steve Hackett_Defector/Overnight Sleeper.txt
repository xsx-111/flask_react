Overnight Sleeper LyricsBeneath the scattered light
Across bare hills of night
I dreamt a train just missed me
Another came in sight
I ran across the track
Then had to turn right back
A new one came straight at me
The next behind my back
Nowhere else to turn to
There are walls on either side
Why must the embankment be so high
Beside myself with weakness
And faint from running wild
I could hear the sound of burning coal
They never seem to stop
But always get to smoke
Right out between two tunnels
I ran until I wokeEmbed
