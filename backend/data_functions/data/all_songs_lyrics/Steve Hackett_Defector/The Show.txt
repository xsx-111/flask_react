The Show LyricsYes, I'm such a simple man
Just book me on the flight
Every day's another place
Playing into the night
And you can't unwind
You're wrecked before the show
Everything's fine when you feel that
'Johnny go go go' - go go
Will you play tonight for me?
Promise I'll do my best
Yes, rock music should be free
Money's worth less and less
And the walls should be cracked
Four red faces make a noise
All dressed in black
I can't tell if they are girls or boys, or boys
Will you play tonight for me?
Promise I'll do my best
Yes, rock music should be free
Money's worth less and less
And the walls should be cracked
Four red faces make a noise
All dressed in black
I can't tell if they are girls or boys, or boys, or boysEmbed
