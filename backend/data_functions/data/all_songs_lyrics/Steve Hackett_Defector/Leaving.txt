Leaving LyricsEndless fog and rain
Grounded 'plane
There an unshaved man
Was exchanged
Wonder if, a cold grey sky
They led me here to die
You can telephone from here
When you wish
Time to run away from here
Won't be missed at all
Turn the snow to red
Someone fled
Tell the viewers
Were you starved or fed?
Running wild, a hunted deer
Her eyes were filled with fear
People dream in colour here
So they said
Shine your shoes from ear to ear
Right or left the westEmbed
