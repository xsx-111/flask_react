Hercules Unchained LyricsWhen you move up close to me and run your fingers through my hair
I feel like when you're positive, I'm more like Hercules unchained
Don't ever try to sleep with me, I might get very nasty
As for beating people up for me, for someone's liable to get paid
Hunt's in the night, for that you got a love allergy
Hercules unchained
So you wear a part of me, I feel as though you might be watching
Every psycho fool I'm not sure, ooh you're driving me insane
Your eyes are black, your hair is smooth, but I can't care enough for you
Your love is like a sewer main, I wonder if you'll die and we'll get framed
Now easy go, cos that you got a love allergy
Hercules unchained
Well you tell me that you love me then you kiss me and you hug me
Then you kick me where it hurts, you know I think this situation's strained
You tell me I'm your Romeo, you're power-plus and man-of-moment
Guess we'd better move the scene to Superman and Lois Lane
I'm easy go, cos that you got a love allergy
