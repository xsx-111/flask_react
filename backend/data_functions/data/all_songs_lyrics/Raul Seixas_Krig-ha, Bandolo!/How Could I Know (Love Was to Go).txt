How Could I Know (Love Was to Go) Lyrics
Reformulation, rearrange the game you're in
Let us start from the begin
With confidence, you'll win
That's the reason you were born
'Cause Jesus Christ, man
Won't be coming back no more
He set up his proper laws
And you know well that he did
Just what he should have done
As I was growing
And my hair was getting longer
I was feeling so much stronger
I could carry my guitar
And I knew that I could sing

But hey, how could I know
The wind would blow with the rain?
Hey, how could I see
What would they make out of me?

When I was little
Used to dream I was a king
Now, they taught me how to sing
Think I've got most everything
I could ever ask for
You've got your pencil
Your guitar, your amplifier
Searching for the lousy liars
You will set this world on fire
Like Nero did to Rome, yeah
But hey, how could I know
My eyes could see in the dark?
Hey, don't press on me
I'm not to blame can't you see?

It's been so long now
Since the latest "reb" has gone
Who knows you'll be the next
To go down the history1Embed
