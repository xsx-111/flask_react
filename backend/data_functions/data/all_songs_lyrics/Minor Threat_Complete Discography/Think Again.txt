Think Again Lyrics
Everybody's right
Everything I've done is wrong, all wrong
You know I tried, I tried to keep it short
I know it took too fucking long
Too much has been said
You think it fucked my head?

Think Again
Think Again
Think Again
Again Again Again Again Again

Ignorance, it set your standards
Intelligence, that don't work in your brain
You're an adult, so you act like a child
Don't even try to explain
This stupid shit, it's been done
You think you're the only one?

Think Again
Think Again
Think Again
Again Again Again Again Again
A hand to your mouth
A performing yawn
You guess you know
What the fuck is going on
You're on top, you're on the ball
You think you've seen it all?

Think Again
Think Again
Think Again
Again Again Again Again Again

Before you take another crack
And slap yourself on the back
Before you tell me what you heard
Sum it up with one word
Before you start talking shit
Before you throw another fit

Think Again
Think Again
Think Again
Again Again Again Again
If you can...1Embed
