Stand Up LyricsSomething's fucked up
Something's not right
I came to have a good time
You came to fight
But if I do fight
Nothing to fear
'Cause I know
My friends are here
I don't like to fight
I don't like getting hurt
Got my guard up
State of Alert!
I don't look for trouble
Trouble finds me
Need my friends
In an emergency
Don't go out alone
Go with a friend
You might need him
In the end
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
And be counted!Embed
