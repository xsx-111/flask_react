Sob Story Lyrics
Life's not been good for you
It's just not fair
You did nothing to deserve it
You did nothing at all
Sit back and watch
It turns from bad to worse
No matter how loud you cry
It always hurts

Boy I'm glad I'm not in your shoes
How could things get any worse for you?
You're so fucking alone
How could things get any worse for you?
I don't blame you when you piss and moan

Everybody gets what you should've got
Everybody takes your opportunities
Everybody gets the breaks that belonged to you
Everybody takes your just deserts

Boy I'm glad I'm not in your shoes
How could things get any worse for you?
You're so fucking alone
How could things get any worse for you?
I don't blame you when you piss and moan
Life's not been good for you
It's just not fair
I've got some news for you
Nothing is fair
I wish there was a way
To make it all better
I pray for a way
To make you happy
Cause I'm sick
And I'm tired
Of your whining, complaining
And Bitching and moaning
Boo fucking hoo2Embed
