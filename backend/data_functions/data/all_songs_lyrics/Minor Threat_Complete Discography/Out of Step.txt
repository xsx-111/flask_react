Out of Step Lyrics
I don't smoke
I don't drink
I don't fuck
At least I can fucking think

I can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Out of step, with the world!
I can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Out of step, with the world!

I don't smoke
I don't drink
I don't fuck
At least I can fucking think

I can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Out of step, with the world!
I can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Out of step, with the world!
Listen
This is no set of rules
I'm not telling you what to do
All I'm saying, is I'm bringing up three things
That are like so important to the whole world
That I don't have to find much importance in
Because of these things, whether they're, whether they're fucking or whether it's playing golf
Because of that
I feel that...

I can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Out of step, with the world!
I can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Can't keep up!
Out of step, with the world!1Embed
