Go with the Flow Lyrics
She said, "I'll throw myself away
They're just photos after all"
I can't make you hang around
I can't wash you off my skin
Outside the frame is what we're leaving out
You won't remember anyway

I can go with the flow
Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go with the flow (I can go)
Do you believe it in your head?

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake
Lose is more than hesitate
Do you believe it in your head?
I can go with the flow
Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go with the flow (I can go)
Do you believe it in your head?

Do you believe it in your head?
Do you believe it in your head?15Embed
