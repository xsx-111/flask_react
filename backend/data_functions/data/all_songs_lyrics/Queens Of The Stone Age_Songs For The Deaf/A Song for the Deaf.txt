A Song for the Deaf Lyrics
A song for the deaf, that is, for you

Nobody’s coming down the hall
Nobody echoes in my head
Broken reflection, outta luck
Nobody ever needed it

I got what was
I want to take what’s left
(Ready now)

Beautiful senses are gone
Canary in a gilded cage
Singin'
Sweet, soft and low
I will poison you all
Come closer, racin' to your tongue

I got what was
Want to take what’s left
No talk will cure
What’s lost, or save what’s left
(For the deaf)
The blind can go get fucked
Lie beside the ditch
This halo 'round my neck
Has torn out every stitch


Who are you hiding? Is it safe for the deaf?
Beautiful cancer, infiltrate then forget
Yeah, I saw you coming and I heard not a thing
A mistake not to listen
When I knew where you’d been

And I got what was
I want to take what’s left
No talk will cure
What’s lost, or save what’s left
(For the deaf)
