A Song for the Dead Lyrics
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

It's late enough to go driving
And see what's mine
Life's the study of dying
How to do it right
You're a holy roller
If you bettin' to lose
If you're hanging around
I'm holding the noose

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Come a little bit closer
And get untied
In a hearse rolling over
Just a track in the line
Fuck it
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Come on, let's go driving
Come on, let's take a little ride
That's the study of dying
How to do it right

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
