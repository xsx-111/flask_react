First It Giveth Lyrics
I'm in you, now you're in me
I can't tell
You're so cruel, more than me
It is true (That's right)
Loyal to only you, up your sleeve
I want some (Come on, take it)
Of all of you (It's yours)
Trickin' me

First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away

I would beg and I would plead
I would shake

On a hook, dangling, wide awake
I'm so young
And beautiful (That's right, I'm slick)
I'm no fool
Time goes by, tables turn
All I know
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away

First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
Away, away4Embed
