Six Shooter Lyrics
Two glass eyes
I'll fucking tell you lies
I'm on the side of the road
You're gonna fucking die

Yeah, yeah
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow, pow, pow, oh!

Fuck this road
Yeah, fuck you too
I'll fucking kill your best friend
What you fucking gonna do? Here I come

Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow! Ah, pow! Woo, pow! Ah, pow!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow!1Embed
