Gonna Leave You Lyrics
Wait by the phone
Late all alone
He can't help you
But I know I could

Three years too long
You know this is wrong
Everything scars the skin
Push it in, break it off

I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)

I gave it starts
I stomped on your hearts
This is the end
No more pictures, we ain't friends
It's raining in my room
There's blood in my spoon
You're outta my highchair
I'm outta your womb
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)


Three years too long
You know this is wrong
Everything scars the skin
Push it in, push it in, break it off

I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave, I don't need you (Oh)Embed
