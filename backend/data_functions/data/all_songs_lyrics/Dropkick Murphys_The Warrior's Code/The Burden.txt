The Burden LyricsHe came from nothing he tried them all
You gotta live low before you see them fall
Always a loser he lost his shine
They had no idea what kept the beast alive
But Franky's gonna be alright
Yeah Franky's gonna be alright
They said he was broken never coming back
But Franky's gonna be alright
He swore to show them outlast them all
And someday they would see him standing tall
He'd never give in, no not back down
I hope they never give up on his sound
'Cause Franky's gonna be alright
Yeah Franky's gonna be alright
They said he was old and he couldn't hold a tune
But I think he's gonna be alright
'Cause Franky's gonna be alright
Yeah Franky's gonna be alright
They said they'd be placing roses on his grave
But I think he's gonna be alright
Franky don't give up on yourself you heard the voice inside
(Yeah, don't give up on yourself)
Franky don't give up on yourself only you can save your life
(Yeah, don't give up on yourself)
Franky don't give up on yourself you heard the voice inside
(Yeah, don't give up on yourself)
Franky don't give up on yourself only you can save your life
(Yeah, don't give up on yourself)
He came from nothing, he tried them all
You gotta live low before you see them fall
Always a loser he lost his shine
You had no idea what kept the beast alive
But Franky's gonna be alright
Yeah Franky's gonna be alright
They said they'd be placing roses on his grave
But I think he's gonna be alright
They said they'd be placing roses on his grave
But Franky's gonna be alrightEmbed
