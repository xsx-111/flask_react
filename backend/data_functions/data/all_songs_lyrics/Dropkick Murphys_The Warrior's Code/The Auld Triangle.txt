The Auld Triangle LyricsA hungry feeling, came o'er me stealing
And the mice were squealing in my prison cell
To begin the morning, the water boiling
Get up out of bed boy, and clean up your cell
And the auld triangle, went jingle jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
On a fine spring evening, the lag lay dreaming
And the seagulls were squealing high above the wall
Oh the day was dying and the wind was sighing
As I lay there crying in my prison cell
And the auld triangle, went jingle jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
Oh the screw was peeping and the lag was sleeping
As he lay there weeping for his poor gal
And the auld triangle, went jingle jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
In the female prison there are seventy women
And I wish to God it was with them that I did dwell
And the auld triangle, went jingle jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
And the auld triangle, went jingle jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal2Embed
