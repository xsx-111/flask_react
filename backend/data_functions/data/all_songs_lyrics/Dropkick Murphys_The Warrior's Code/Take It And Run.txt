Take It And Run LyricsMaureen's out on the street again
Didn't get the job 'cause she missed her appointment
She don't know if the kids are fed
They've got holes in their shoes and the cold's coming quick now
The power's off the bill's ain't paid
Gotta jump the box for the neighbor's apartment
Space heaters and welfare checks are as good as it gets
In this land of hard lessons
Don't talk to me if you ain't got the answers that I need
Yeah I've got problems, can't you see I'm trying to solve them?
Broke it off with the man in her life
Finally got the courage to pack up and leave now
She keeps saying she'll be all right
But in her mind does she really believe it?
Long lines on Piedmont Street
But if you hang around you might get a bed there
Turn around and don't look back
You've got a piece of your life, so take it and run now
Don't talk to me if you ain't got the answers that I need
Yeah I've got problems, can't you see I'm trying to solve them?
The sun is shining on you
Maureen may all your dreams come true
Broke it off with the man in her life
You know she ain't got nothing better
Yeah you know she don't but she keeps on believing
The sun is shining on you
Maureen may all your dreams come trueEmbed
