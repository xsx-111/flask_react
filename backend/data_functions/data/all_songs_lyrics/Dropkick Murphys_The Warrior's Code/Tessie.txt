Tessie Lyrics
Tessie is the Royal Rooters rally cry
Tessie is the tune they always sung
Tessie echoed April through October nights
After serenading Stahl, Dinneen and Young
Tessie is a maiden with a sparkling eye
Tessie is a maiden with a love
She doesn’t know the meaning of her sight
She’s got a comment full of love
And sometimes when the game is on the line
Tessie always carried them away
Up the road from third base to Huntington
The boys would always sing and sway

Two! Three! Four!
Tessie, Nuf Ced McGreevey shouted
We’re not here to mess around
Boston you know we love you madly
Hear the crowd roar to your sound
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Tessie, you are the only only only
The Rooters showed up at the grounds one day
They found their seats had all been sold
McGreevey led the charge into the park
Stormed the gates and put the game on hold
The Rooters gave the other team a dreadful fright
Boston’s tenth man could not be wrong
Up from third base to Huntington
They’d sing another victory song
Two! Three! Four!
Tessie, Nuff Ced McGreevy shouted
We’re not here to mess around
Boston, you know we love you madly
Hear the crowd roar to your sound
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Tessie, you are the only, only, only
The Rooters gave the other team a dreadful fright
Boston’s tenth man could not be wrong
Up from third base to Huntington
They’d sing another victory song

Two! Three! Four!
Tessie, Nuff Ced McGreevy shouted
We’re not here to mess around
Boston, you know we love you madly
Hear the crowd roar to your sound
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Tessie, you are the only, only, only
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Boston you are the only only only
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Red Sox you are the only only only3Embed
