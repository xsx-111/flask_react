Sunshine Highway LyricsYeah, me and my girl we're acting up again all right
She ain't much of a looker, she can handle her Paraldehyde
You were up all night at the Captain's Table
Drinking Tango and gin by the old piano
Playing cards and smoking cigars 'til the sun came up
Or was it going down for the night?
Take another ride on the sunshine highway
Take another ride try to turn it around
Take another ride down the sunshine highway
Take another ride try to turn it around tonight
Drop me off, sign me in, clean me up and let me out
Man that nurse is a bitch, this sucks, she says my jug ain't allowed
I've had my share of Mt. Pleasant messiahs
Wearing slippers and robes, trying to bum my smokes
I'm gonna Thorazine shuffle straight out that door
Head to the farm and find me a cure
Take another ride on the sunshine highway
Take another ride try to turn it around
Take another ride down the sunshine highway
Take another ride try to turn it around tonight
Tonight, yeah yeah yeah
I’m gonna make it right
Take another ride on the sunshine highway
Take another ride try to turn it around
Take another ride down the sunshine highway
Take another ride try to turn it around tonight
Cause I’m gonna be the one
To take another ride, take another rideEmbed
