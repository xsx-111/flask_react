Last Letter Home LyricsHello there my dearest love
Today I write to you about our sons
The boys start school today
They're the spitting image of you in every way
Hey son it's Dad
I hope this letter finds you well out of harm's way
We saw the news today it frightened your Mom
Now all she does is pray
If I lead will you follow?
Will you follow if I lead?
Hey Melissa it's me, don't be afraid
I'm in good hands, I'm gonna be home soon
It's time to watch the children grow up
I wanna be more than a voice on the phone
Thanks Ma, I got your package today
I love "The Fields Of Athenry"
I swear I want 'em to play that song on the pipes
At my funeral when I die
If I lead will you follow?
Will you follow if I lead?
I stand alone in the distance
And the foreground slowly moves
If I lead will you follow?
Will you follow if I lead?
"We regret to inform you that on January 28th
Sgt. Andrew Farrar died while serving his country
In the Al-Anbar province of Iraq
Words cannot convey our sorrow"
If I lead will you follow?
Will you follow if I lead?
When there's nothing on the horizon
You've got nothing left to prove
If I lead will you follow?Embed
