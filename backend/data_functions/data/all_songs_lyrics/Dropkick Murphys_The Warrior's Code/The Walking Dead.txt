The Walking Dead LyricsThe greats come alive, the water's on fire
Have I been to this place before?
Yeah we danced through the night as the flames burned bright
And the patrons passed out on the floor
What's so new about what you're saying?
It's a new generation with the same sad song
What's so new about what you're saying?
Just another generation with the same sad song
The walking dead couldn't tell us any better
It's a tale you gotta live to know
Yeah the story you're telling is from the book I wrote
I've forgotten more then you'll ever know!
'Cause at the end of the day when the hope fades away
It was an outlook you could never afford
You're on one last stand, with the boys and the band
Before the demon strikes the final chord
What's so new about what you're saying?
It's a new generation with the same sad song
What's so new about what you're saying?
Just another generation with the same sad song
You've got tons of fans in hell boy that much I know
Tune me up and turn me on before I go!
Just another sad song!
What's so new about what you're saying?
It's a new generation with the same sad song
What's so new about what you're saying?
Just another generation with the same sad songEmbed
