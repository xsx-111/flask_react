Wicked Sensitive Crew LyricsWell it's all gone to hell now, the wimps have gangs
Pop punk tough guys with neck tattoos?
Well if you guys are hard then I'd rather be soft
Man I gotta find me some seriously sensitive dudes
Hey! Ho! Hey!
You gotta shake hands with your feelings
In the Wicked Sensitive Crew
In Pittsburgh they called us closed minded
But we know that's simply not true
Yeah we're touchy, feely, sensitive guys
I ain't ashamed I cried when Mickey died in Rocky II
In Sydney they misunderstood us
They called us thugs and mean-spirited types
Yeah we might not be Swedish, and we sure ain't vegan
But do thugs have posters on their bedroom wall
Of the dude from the Darkness in a creepy meat suit
Zippered so low you can practically...
("God that's gross!" "What? It's cool")
Hey! Ho! Hey!
You gotta shake hands with your feelings
In the Wicked Sensitive Crew
I don't know nothing about no meat suit
But I'll tell you there's one town that's ahead of the times
Man, they know what's up for sure
You see it's home to the godfather of love
The bald little man who started it all
One Teddy "Huggybear" Etoll
Hey! Ho! Hey!
You gotta shake hands with your feelings
We've got a big hug waiting for you
Hey! Ho! Hey!
You gotta shake hands with your feelings
