Threnody LyricsGather 'round, you wounded people
Shadows fall upon the steeple
Soon shall come the closing of
The closing of the gates
For there is word of plague among us
Curse the one whose poison stung us
All along the alleyways
The satyrs wait their fate
But who's to blame when all are guilty
Morals stained and conscience filthy
Abreast your idol replicas
Your replicas of lust
In the sky I hear the threshing
Dare to watch your lord undressing
While you beg forgiveness
You feed on his disgust
But if perhaps the salt might stain your skin
And if perhaps the smoke might weep your eyes
Listen while the threnodies begin
Know no one in here gets out alive
But let your frailty not deceive you
A little pinprick, rest relieves you
And dream of all the days that are
The years that are to come
For you will dance and you'll be nimble
Pirouettes upon a thimble
And I will be beside you
Lest I lose you once again
But if perhaps my sorrows all are show
And I should find a crack among the gates
Guilt shall follow me where'er I go
Though I try I know I can't escape
And when you're gone the earth will crumble
I will try but I will stumble
And all through these city streets
My robes shall drag the ground
Hear the children swing with sorrow
Yesterday was once tomorrow
No more I'll be troubled by the troubles of this world
But if I lose my step along the way
And if the speech of victim fills my throat
Out beyond the cliffs that shape the day
It's there I'll wander, there I'll stray
It's there I'll look for you when all my trials are done
I feign sleep to save my breath
This love is loss, this life is theft
And all that's left is some vain need to carry on
And though I fear the tightening of the skies
Against the dawn I'll watch you rise
Oh Lord, the company I keep within my head
The scent of flesh might tease the nose
It claims the calm, it clings the clothes
Could that be you, my love?
Your dust upon the wind?1Embed
