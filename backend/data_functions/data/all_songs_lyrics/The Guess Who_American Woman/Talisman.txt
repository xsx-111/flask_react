Talisman Lyrics
Trinket worn with colors matching saddened eyes
Has lost its magic touch
People from a distant hill
Have crossed an ever-stretching sea of sand
Artificial flowers cannot die
For life within them is illusion

Talisman, talisman grace my hand
Talisman grace my hand

Figures made of pedigrees
Control the non-existent soul of John Smith
Walk the creature let it run
But slacken not the rope to which its bound
Ships in bottles cannot sail
And neither can a tombstone kill a feather

Talisman, talisman grace my hand
Talisman grace my hand

Kings are nothing more without the glory
And the wealth behind their thinking
Let me feel the choice of seeing
Dawn or setting sun before I die
Myriads of painted faces
Rush behind the eye of the uncertain
Talisman, talisman grace my hand
Talisman grace my hand

Let me live only to do
And let me do only to live
My steel image comes with the sun
And that's where it slumbers now

Talisman, talisman grace my hand
Talisman grace my handEmbed
