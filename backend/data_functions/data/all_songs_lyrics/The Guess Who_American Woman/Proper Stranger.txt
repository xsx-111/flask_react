Proper Stranger Lyrics
Dark day, windy city
Raincoat on my shoulder
So take my hand and show me where to go
Because don't you know I'm the proper stranger
Traffic lights, dusty sidewalks
Freeway people on the move
So take my hand and show me where to go
Because don't you know I'm the proper stranger
I'm the proper stranger
Nobody knows my face or
Knows my name
Nobody knows where I'm going or
How I came
Lost and found, no one claimed me
All alone with a million others
So take my hand and show me where to go
Because don't you know I'm the proper stranger
Broke my mind, had no spare
Nothing left and no tomorrow
So take my hand and show me where to go
Because don't you know I'm the proper strangerEmbed
