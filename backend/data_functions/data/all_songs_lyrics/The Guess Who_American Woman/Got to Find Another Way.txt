Got to Find Another Way LyricsLost in the memories that time cannot erase
Here I can linger for a while in the trace
Of the things not too old that since have gotten cold
And the thoughts from before that told me so much more
And I've got to find another way, I've got to find another way
I've got to find another way and get along without her
Oh, I've got to find another way, got to find me another way
Got to find another way and get along without her
Friends now wouldn't mean so much me, not alone
Time to return to friendly ways and be sure
Of the things not too old that since have gotten cold
And the thoughts from before that told me so much more
And I've got to find another way, I've got to find another way
I've got to find another way and get along without her
Oh, oh, I've got to find another way, got to find me another way
Got to find another way and get along without her
And I've got to find another way, got to find me another way
Got to find another way and get along without her
Oh, oh, I've got to find another way, got to find another way
Got to find another way and get along without her
Oh, oh, I've got to find another way, got to find another way
Change everything I'm thinking, change everything I'm doing
Got to go back, go back when, find out what was wrong
And come back then change everything I'm thinking about her
Forget everything I said about her, got to find another way
Change maybe then, maybe todayEmbed
