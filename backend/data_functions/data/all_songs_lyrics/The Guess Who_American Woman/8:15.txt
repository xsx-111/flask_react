8:15 Lyrics
Vision of mine, can you see it? (I can see)
I know a sound, can you hear? (I can hear)
I've got a place, have you been there? (Yes, I've been)
What time of day can you meet me?

At 8:15
8:15
8:15
8:15

I know a song, can you sing it? (I can sing)
I've gotten lost, can you find me? (I can find)
I know a game, can you play it? (I can play)
What time of night can you meet me?

At 8:15
8:15
8:15
8:15

You have changed my style
Knowing all the while
I would thank you for it someday
Lookin' all around but I can't find you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Lookin' high and low in front of me, in back of me
Don't look like you're comin' through
I'm gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find you
Gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find you
Gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find you
Gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find you
Gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find you
Gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find you
Gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find you
Gonna keep on lookin' 'til I find

Vision of mine, can you see it? (I can see)
I know a sound, can you hear? (I can hear)
I've got a place, have you been there? (Yes, I've been)
What time of day can you meet me now?

At 8:15
8:15
8:15
8:15
You have changed my style
Knowing all the while
I would thank you for it somedayEmbed
