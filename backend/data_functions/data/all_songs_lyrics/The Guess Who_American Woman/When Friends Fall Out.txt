When Friends Fall Out Lyrics
The lone wolves howl
On Moonlight Bay
Dark moon is out
When friends fall out
When friends fall out
Birds aren't alone
You've past all doubts
Their world has grown
When friends fall out
When friends fall out
A journey is plastic for
Someone who's walking on air
He falls through elastic and
There is no net waiting there
And it's so nice to be home again
So nice to be home again
Where I belong
No night, no day
No in, no out
No work, no play
When friends fall out
When friends fall out (listen to me talking)
When friends fall out (Baby, you got nothing)
When friends fall out
And it's so nice to be home again
So nice to be home again
Where I belongEmbed
