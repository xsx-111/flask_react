Eyepennies Lyrics
I will return here one day
And dig up my bones from the clay
I buried nails and strings and hair
And that old tooth I believe was a bear's

I held my hand in the fire
It burned me down to the wires

Blood suckers hide beneath my bed
And black fumes of skin so gently bled
I slept with a cat on my breast
Slowing my heart, stealing my breath

At sunrise the monkeys will fly
And leave me with pennies in my eyes

I will return here one day
And dig up my bones from the clay
I buried nails and string and hair
And that old tooth I believe was a bear's
At sunrise the monkeys will fly
And leave me with pennies in my eyes1Embed
