King of Nails Lyrics
The toothless kiss of skeletons
And summer hail
I'm the king of nails
I drink my liquor from the palm
Of a child who spoke in tongues
And smelled like sun

Keep all your leaves
And go sing the peace
To sink or to shine
The nails are all mine

And blood was rushing up the stairs
I shut my eyes and killed the cock
When the sun came knocking
Oh, to taste the salty oil
Of your chest and on your eyes
When the sting is on the rise

Sleep in the fire
With snakes I have sired
To sink or to shine
The nails are all mine
I drink my liquor from the palm
Of a child who smelled like sun
And spoke in tongues
The toothless kiss of skeletons
And summer hail
I'm the king of nails

Keep all your leaves
And go sing the peace
To sink or to shine
The nails are all mine
Sleep in the fire
With snakes I have sired
To sink or to shine
The nails are all mineEmbed
