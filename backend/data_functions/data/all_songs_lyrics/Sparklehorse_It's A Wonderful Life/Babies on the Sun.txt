Babies on the Sun LyricsThe sound of your voice
Rose graves of cats
The pounding of your steps
Woke caves of bats
(La La La)
Babies on the sun
Babies on the sun
Your first burning breath
Was a symphony
(La La La)
And a ship full of horses
Was going down at sea
(La La La)
Babies on the sun
Babies on the sun
(unintelligible...I want- I want a dog...uninteligible)
Babies on the sun
Babies on the sun
On the sun, on the sun
On the sun, on the sun
On the sunEmbed
