Little Fat Baby LyricsDid you save your wisdom teeth?
Did you burn your Christmas tree?
But he got dragged by a donkey
Through the dirt and the myrtle
But he was once a little fat baby
Did you lose your fatty in the bath?
Did you make the city slickers laugh?
He got dragged by a donkey
Through the glass and the myrtle
But he was once a little fat baby
Did you burn your wisdom teeth?
Did you save your Christmas tree?
He got dragged by a donkey
Through the switches and the myrtle
But he was once a little fat babyEmbed
