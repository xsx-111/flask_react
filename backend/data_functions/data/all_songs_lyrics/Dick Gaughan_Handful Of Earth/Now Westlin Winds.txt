Now Westlin Winds LyricsNow westlin winds and slaught'ring guns
Bring Autumn's pleasant weather;
The moorcock springs on whirring wings
Amang the blooming heather:
Now waving grain, wide o'er the plain
Delights the weary farmer;
And the moon shines bright, when I rove at night
To muse upon my charmer
The partridge loves the fruitful fells
The plover loves the mountains;
The woodcock haunts the lonely dells
The soaring hern the fountains:
Thro' lofty groves the cushat roves
The path of man to shun it;
The haz–µl bush o'erhangs the thrush
The spreading thorn the linnet
Thus ev'ry kind their pleasure find
The savage and the tender;
Some social join, and leagues combine
Some solitary wander:
Avaunt, away! the cruel sway
Tyrannic man's dominion;
The sportsman's joy, the murd'ring cry
The flutt'ring, gory pinion!
But, Peggy dear, the ev'ning's clear
Thick flies the skimming swallow
The sky is blue, the fields in view
All fading-green and yellow:
Come let us stray our gladsome way
And view the charms of Nature;
The rustling corn, the fruited thorn
And ev'ry happy creature
We'll gently walk, and sweetly talk
Till the silent moon shine clearly;
I'll grasp thy waist, and, fondly prest
Swear how I love thee dearly:
Not vernal show'rs to budding flow'rs
Not Autumn to the farmer
So dear can be as thou to me
My fair, my lovely charmer!Embed
