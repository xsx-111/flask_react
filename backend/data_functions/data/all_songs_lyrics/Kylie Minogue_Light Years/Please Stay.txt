Please Stay Lyrics
I fell in love with you the moment that we met
Until the end of time, I never will forget
I lose it every time I'm close to you (Ah)
Under your spell, you know there's nothing I can do

Please stay, my babe
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to know regret
I'll do all that I can just to get you to stay, my babe
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to say goodbye
But who knows where we'll be after tonight?

There's nothing stopping us, you don't have to go
The night is young for us, there's more we need to know
I lose it every time I'm close to you (Ah)
Under your spell, you know there's nothing I can do

Please stay (Stay), my babe (My babe)
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to know regret
I'll do all that I can just to get you to
Stay (Stay), my babe (My babe)
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to say goodbye
But who knows where we'll be after tonight?
I lose it every time I'm close to you (Ah)
Under your spell, you know there's nothing I can do

Please stay (Stay), my babe (My babe)
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to know regret
I'll do all that I can just to get you to
Stay (Stay), my babe (My babe)
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to say goodbye
But who knows where we'll be after tonight?
Please stay (Stay), my babe (My babe)
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to know regret
I'll do all that I can just to get you to
Stay (Stay), my babe (My babe)
Who knows when we'll dance again?
And I don't want to say goodbye (Ooh)
But who knows where we'll be after tonight? (Ah)1Embed
