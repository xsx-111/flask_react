Loveboat Lyrics
Come join the loveboat
We're anchored offshore
Martinis and bikinis
Oh, l'amour
Loved up in lame
Qu'est ce qu'on va faire?
Live your love like Heaven
Sur la mer

We'll just float cause the beach is boring
Our loveboat is more alluring
We'll sail on with savoir faire
Sur la mer

Have an havanna
Pass me a peach
Rub on some lotion
The places l can't reach
Cool down with cocktails
Lose all your cares
007 Heaven
Sur la mer
We'll just float cause the beach is boring
Our loveboat is more alluring
We'll sail on with savoir faire
Sur la mer
We're in a place where Heaven breathes
Making some love and shooting the breeze
Living out the memories we'll share
Sur la mer

WaItz in the wake, of the shore
I will be there
Marine sunset dream, I'm your cure
I will be there

We'll just float cause the beach is boring
Our loveboat is more alluring
We'll sail on with savoir faire
Sur la mer
We're in a place where Heaven breathes
Making some love and shooting the breeze
Living out the memories we'll share
Sur la merEmbed
