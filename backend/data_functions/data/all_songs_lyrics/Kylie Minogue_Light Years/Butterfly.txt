Butterfly Lyrics
In the morning, I'll wake up with you
There's not anything I would rather do

You are more than you'll ever know
And your love teaches me to grow
You are more than my everything
And your love gives me wings

Like a butterfly
Like a butterfly

Your touch is the one thing I know is true
My mind is completely devoted to you

You are more than you'll ever know
And your love teaches me to grow (It's growing)
You are more than my everything
And your love gives me wings

Like a butterfly (And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly (From the day into the night)
Like a butterfly (When I'm in your arms)
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly (I am safe from harm)
And it mightn't last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel
Like a butterfly

Like a butterfly (When I'm in your arms)
Like a butterfly (I am safe from harm)

And it mightn't last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel this way
And it mightn't last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel this way

Like a butterfly (And it mightn't last more than a day)
(But I'll take my chances anyway)
Like a butterfly ('Cause my heart is saying it's for real)
(No one else has made me feel this way)
Like a butterfly (And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly (From the day into the night)
Like a butterfly (When I'm in your arms)
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly (I am safe from harm)
(From the day into the night)
Like a butterfly (When I'm in your arms)
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)3Embed
