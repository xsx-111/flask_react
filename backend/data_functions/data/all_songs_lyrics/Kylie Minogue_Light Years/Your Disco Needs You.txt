Your Disco Needs You Lyrics
Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you

Desperately seeking someone willing to travel
You're lost in conversation and useless at Scrabble
Happiness will never last
Darkness comes to kick your ass (Ass)

So let's dance through all our fears
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving to your heart
Your lonely heart

Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you

We're sold on vanity, but that's so see through (See through)
Take your body to the floor, your disco needs you
From Soho to Singapore
From the mainland to the shore
So let's dance through all our fears
War is over for a bit
You're a slave to the rhythm to your heart
You're a lonely heart

Vous Ãªtes jamais seuls
Vous savez ce qu'il faut faire
Ne laissez pas tomber votre nation
La disco a besoin de vous

So let's dance through all our fears
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving to your heart
Your lonely hearts

Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco
Your disco needs you5Embed
