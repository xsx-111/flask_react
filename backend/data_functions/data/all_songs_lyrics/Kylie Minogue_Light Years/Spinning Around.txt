Spinning Around Lyrics
Spinning around, spinning around
Oh

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
The mistakes that I've made have given me the strength
To really believe
And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cause it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cause the truth's given me
A new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this (Ooh)

Baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down (I'm not the same)
I'm not the same (I know you feel me)
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
Feel me 'cause you like it like this, oh
I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh
Ooh yeah, like it like this, like it like this
I'm not the same, like it like this
I'm not the same, I'm not the same, oh7Embed
