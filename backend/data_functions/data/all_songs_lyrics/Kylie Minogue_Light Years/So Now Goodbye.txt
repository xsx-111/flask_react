So Now Goodbye Lyrics
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Remember when I saw you for the first time
I never thought you'd be mine
Then we went ahead and fell in love
Heaven was our common ground
We were never coming down
The two of us we had more than enough

But you and I are not the same
To you love is just a game
Things'll never be the same again

So now goodbye
This time I will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way too long
Started out with trust
But it isn't just about the good times, baby

Remember all the promises we swore to
Can't say I didn't warn you
How I did adore you way back then
(I did adore you, adore you)
But you broke a solemn vow
Ha! You're paying for it now
Wouldn't you expect more from a friend
But you and I are not the same
To you love is just a game
Things will never be the same again

So now goodbye
This time I will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way too long
Started out with trust
But it isn't just about the good times, baby
So now goodbye
This time I will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way too long
I don't need you now
And I am, oh, so tired of excuses, baby

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

This time will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way to long this time
It all started out with trust
But it isn't about the good times, baby
So now goodbye
This time I will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way too long (stayed for way too long)
I don't need you now
And I am, oh, so tired of excuses, baby (tired of excuses)
This time will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way to long this time
It all started out with trust
But it isn't about the good times, baby
So now goodbye
This time I will be gone, goodbye
I stayed for way too long
I don't need you now
And I am, oh, so tired of excuses, baby1Embed
