Disco Down Lyrics
(Burn this disco)
(Burn this disco, burn this disco)
Mmm
(Burn this disco)
Oooh-yeahhh
Ahhh
(Burn this disco, burn it)

I've been thinking' reminiscing
'Bout the days when we were wishing'
We could fly, touch the sky
Laughing meeting under cover
Running hiding from your mother
If we tried we could do anything

And when the DJ came to town
People came from miles around
Baby l still recall those things
(Ooh)
And ooh, I'm missing you now
I'm missing you now

And you turned my world around
When you burned this disco down
Why'd you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
Still there's memories of this town
(Ooh, ooh)
When you burned this disco down
(Disco Down)
(Even after all this time)
Ahhh
(Disco Down)
(I will always wonder where you are)
Disco Down
(Burn this disco, burn this disco)
(Burn this disco)

It's been ten years now this Sunday
Since you left or was it Monday
Time can fly when you're still in love

And now l boogie in my dreams
To "Le Freak" or "Dancing Queen"
Baby l still recall those things
(Ooh)
And ooh, I'm missing you now
I'm missing you now

And you turned my world around
When you burned this disco down
Why'd you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
Still there's memories of this town
(Ooh, ooh)
When you burned this disco down
(Disco down)
Down
(Disco down)
Ooh

And oh, now the dance has died for sure
Since your love ain't here no more
(Ooh)
Still l wonder where you are
(I will always wonder where you are)

And you turned my world around
(Burn this disco)
When you burned this disco down
(Ooh, baby)
Why'd you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
And still there's memories of this town
(Ooh, ooh)
When you burned this disco down

(Disco down)
(Disco down)
(Disco down)
(Ooh)1Embed
