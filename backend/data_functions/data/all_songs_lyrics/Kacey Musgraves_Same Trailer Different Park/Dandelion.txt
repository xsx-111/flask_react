Dandelion Lyrics
Picked you out and picked you up
Hoping that my luck would change
I let the summer fill my lungs
And superstition fill my brain

Dandelion
A million little wishes
Blow across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

Sent you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinkin' it could change my world

Dandelion
A million little wishes
Blow across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion
Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more
Oh, dandelion

(Oh) Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowing kisses
Out across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion
