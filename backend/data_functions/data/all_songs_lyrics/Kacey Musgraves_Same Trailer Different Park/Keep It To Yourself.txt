Keep It To Yourself Lyrics
You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
â€™Cause sleeping alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping
You heard from your friends that I'm doing okay
And you're thinking that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss
So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

Yeah, when you're drunk, and it's late
And you're sad, and you hate going home alone
'Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

Hmm
Yeah, keep it to yourself
