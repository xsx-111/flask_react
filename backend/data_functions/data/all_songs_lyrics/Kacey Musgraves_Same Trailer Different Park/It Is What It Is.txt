It Is What It Is Lyrics
I think we're thinking too hard
So put on your shoes and get in your car
Put it in drive and point it this way
We don't have to talk, you don't have to stay

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

We've tried being apart
But the truth is we are who we are
We're so much alike, it ain't a good thing
Too dumb to give up, too stubborn to change

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

'Til something better comes along
'Til whatever we have is gone
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore
Yeah, it is what it is 'til it ain't anymore2Embed
