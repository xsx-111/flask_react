Not Dark Yet Lyrics
Shadows are falling
And I’ve been here all day
It’s too hot to sleep
And time is running away
Feel like my soul has
Turned into steel
I’ve still got the scars
That the sun didn’t heal
There’s not even room enough
To be anywhere

It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

Well, my sense of humanity
Has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing
There’s been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter
And she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing
What was in her mind
I just don’t see why I should even care
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

Well, I’ve been to London
And I’ve been to gay Paris
I’ve followed the river
And I got to the sea
I’ve been down on the bottom
Of a world full of lies
I ain’t looking for nothing
In anyone’s eyes
Sometimes my burden
Is more than I can bear

It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there


I was born here, and I’ll die here
Against my will
I know it looks like I’m moving
But I’m standing still
Every nerve in my body
Is so vacant and numb
I can’t even remember what it was
I came here to get away from
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there11Embed
