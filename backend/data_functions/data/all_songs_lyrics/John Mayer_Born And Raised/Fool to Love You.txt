Fool to Love You Lyrics
Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

I really did it to myself I guess
I saw you standing in that cocktail dress
Oh, call the press and say my life is a mess
Because I must confess to you

Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

Fool me once and it's shame on you
Twice it's shame on me
But fool me baby for the rest of my life
And I'll be happy, happy as a broken man can be

Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you1Embed
