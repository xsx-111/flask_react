A Face To Call Home Lyrics
I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been
You know my paper heart
The one I filled with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home

So glad you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small
And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home, a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home

Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home
Home home
Home home
Home home
