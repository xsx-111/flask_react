Born and Raised (Reprise) Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three

Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, "Now I'm born and raised"

Born and raised
In half the time I'll be twice my age
Better learn how to turn the page
Because time is strange when you're born and raised

Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, "Now I'm born and raised"Embed
