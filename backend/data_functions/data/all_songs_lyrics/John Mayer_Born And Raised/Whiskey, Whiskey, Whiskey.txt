Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey Lyrics
We pick up in New York City
I'm tryna find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed
The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place
Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
"Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet"
Great, now it's raining
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street1Embed
