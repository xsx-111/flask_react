Speak for Me Lyrics
Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Isn't supposed to make me feel alone

What a drag to know
I have to learn to let it go

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

Well they’re celebrating broken things
I don’t want a world of broken things
You can tell something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white

What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me

I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone1Embed
