Something Like Olivia Lyrics
Well, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time

I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find

There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side

I'm thinking something like Olivia
Could keep me through the night

Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say, I'd let her in

Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

I keep thinking something like Olivia
Is what I need to find

Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
I keep thinking something like Olivia6Embed
