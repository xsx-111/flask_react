The Age of Worry Lyrics
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh

Close your eyes and clone yourself
Build your heart an army
To defend your innocence
While doing everything wrong
Don't be scared to walk alone
Don't be scared to like it
There's no time that you must be home
So sleep where darkness falls

Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"
Ooh! Ooh!

No, your fight is not with them
Yours is with your time here
Dream your dreams, but don't pretend
Make friends with what you are
Give your heart and change your mind
You're allowed to do it
Because God knows it's been done to you and
Somehow you got through it
Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"

Rage in the age of worry
Act your age in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, get out of here"4Embed
