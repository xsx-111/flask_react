Queen of California Lyrics
Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame
I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote "Blue" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down
