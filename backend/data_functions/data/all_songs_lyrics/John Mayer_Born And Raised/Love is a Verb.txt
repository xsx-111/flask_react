Love is a Verb Lyrics
Love is a Verb
It ain't a thing

It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words

Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

Love ain't a crutch
It's not an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOU's
Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard

Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb

Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb6Embed
