If I Ever Get Around To Living Lyrics
If I ever get around to living
I'm going to put my things away
In the drawers and in the closets
And there I'll stay
Stay
If I ever get around to living
It's going to be just like I dreamed
I'm going to take the love I'm given
And set it free
Free

If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away
Free
Free

Maybe it's all a dream I'm having at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying, "Come upstairs, you've got some work to do"
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?

You are hiding in your mind
Working all the time
Trying to make it better than you got it
And you been spending all your time
Searching for a sign
That's never going to look the way you want it

I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy2Embed
