Upon This Tidal Wave of Young Blood LyricsNow that everybody's here
Could we please have your attention?
There is nothing left to fear
No now that bigfoot is captured
But are the children really right
Alright alright
There is danger in the night
There are things we can't control but
Will we give ourselves a fright
When we become less than human?
There are people who say why oh why oh why?
Now there are other ways to die
Oh why oh why?
But upon this tidal wave
Oh god oh god
But upon this tidal wave
Oh god oh god
Young Blood (x8)
We are men who stay alive
Who send your children away now
We are calling from a tower
Expressing what must be
Everyone's opinion
"They are going out to bars
And they are getting into cars
I have seen them with my own eyes."
"AMERICA PLEASE HELP THEM!"
They are child stars...
With their sex, and their drugs, and their rock, and rock, and rock and rock and roll, hey!Embed
