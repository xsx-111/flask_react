Let the Cool Goddess Rust Away LyricsI found a new face
A mirror image staring back at me
Let the cool Goddess rust away
Let the cool Goddess rust away
You so different, in a different way
But what goes up has so far down to fall
So go salvage some of that human dignity
It'll be a long hard roadEmbed
