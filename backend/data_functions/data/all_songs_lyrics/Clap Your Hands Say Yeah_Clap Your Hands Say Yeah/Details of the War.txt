Details of the War LyricsBloody sheets
Tenderly she moves me
An opera star
Dying hard for love
You say I'm hurt, I will take your word
Leather pants
Happiness
A hundred dollars
Buy success
Hanging with your fashionable whores
And I'm a wounded bird
I will take your word
You and Tom
To the prom
Camel dick
Crucifix
Everyone's the same and on and on
Emerging from the football stands
Clinging to his broken hand
It's over I have seen it all before
Nakedness
A flying lesson
Tattered dress
Sunburned chest
You will pay for your excessive charm
With a boy who knows less than he thinks
Drinks up his expensive drinks
Be careful with the details of the warEmbed
