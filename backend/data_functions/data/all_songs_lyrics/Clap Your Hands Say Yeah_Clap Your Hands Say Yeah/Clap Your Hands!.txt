Clap Your Hands! LyricsRun the lip off sunshine shore
Betray white water, delay dark forms
Slap young waves on wooden bones
Don't touch the laughter and away we go
Away we go
Clap your hands! (But I feel so lonely)
Clap your hands! (But it won't do nothing)
Clap your hands! (But I have no money)
Clap your hands! (But it don't seem likely)
Clap your hands! (Are you up to something?)
Clap your hands! (Where's my milk and honey?)
Clap your hands! (But I just look funny)
Clap your hands! (I'll just wait a while)
As time alone stands still for some
Stuffed sailor up with eyeball sun
And if by castle, ship should stray
It has, like you, no chosen fate
For it's tongue-tied caboose that leads this ragged lad
This finger-flipping mom and dad
For what is worth some aimless steer
And should mouth confuse my foggy mirror
And reveal what is not there
I shall take this unbound train and go awayEmbed
