Over and Over Again (Lost and Found) LyricsI heard it from a friend
The Revolution never happened
Sigh
A little die
No more a child
Goodbye
Now where's the woolen sweater
You mentioned in the letter?
Imply
The other guy
And scandalize the lion
A clean shave in the morning
And a full beard with no warning
Time has gotten by on alibis and wine
Success is so forbidding
But it makes me think I'm winning
Quiet
Dim the lights
Adopt another lifestyle
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come
Over and over again
You look like David Bowie
But you've nothing new to show me
Start another fire
And watch it slowly dieEmbed
