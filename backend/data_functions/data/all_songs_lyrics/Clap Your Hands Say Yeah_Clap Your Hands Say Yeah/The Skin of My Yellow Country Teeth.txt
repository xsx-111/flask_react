The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth LyricsOnce the dogs had quit their barking
Son, my neighbor said to me
Know the emptiness of talking blue
The same old sheep
Run, I'll do no more this walking
Haunted by a past I just can't see anymore, anymore
Well, let me tell you
I never meant to let go of the hand
That's been clinging by its thick country skin
To my yellow country teeth
To my yellow country teeth
Far, far away from West Virginia
I'll, I'll try New York City
Explaining that the sky holds the wind, the sun rushes in
A child with a shotgun can shoot down honeybees that sting
Oh, this boy could use a little sting!
Alright
Who will get me to a party?
Who do I have yet to meet?
You, you look a bit like coffee and you taste a little of me
How can I keep me from moving?
Now I need a change of scenery
Just listen to me
I won't pretend to understand
The movement of the wind or the waves in the ocean
Or like the hours, I change softly
Slowly, plainly, blindly, oh me
Oh my2Embed
