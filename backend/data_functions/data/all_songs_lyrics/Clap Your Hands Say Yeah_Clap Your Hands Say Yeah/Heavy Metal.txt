Heavy Metal Lyrics
Now all the secrets of old age
They tell us we should really stop
Now they implore us, oh
They should adore us, oh
It's been a year and now we find
We're lost behind enemy lines
They're gunning for us, oh
They never even met us, oh

Now what happened to our heavy metal?
(One to two and love, baby, love me
Two to three, now hold me hold me)
Now what happened to our coat of arms?
(Three to four, now really, really need me
Four to five, now are we still alive, now)
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
(Five to six, we're forgetting six
Six to seven, I'll need you in heaven)
Picking up the pieces of our hearts
(Seven to eight, we're staying up too late
Eight to nine, we're having such a good time)
And there will be no comfort
For all that we have lost
The actors seemed so happy
But somehow ended all washed up
