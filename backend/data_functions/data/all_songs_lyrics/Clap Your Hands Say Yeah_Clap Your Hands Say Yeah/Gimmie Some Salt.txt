Gimmie Some Salt LyricsSally hit the pavement
Wineglass in her hand
Sally's rearrangement
I'll never understand
But little did I wonder
(little did I try)
Her little bit of thunder
Her little bit of lightning
(lightning)
Sucka sucka MC
Sing my favorite song
Sing it for the dancing
Sing it for somber one
Curious velocity
Brought me to a halt
Flatten me my baby
Gimmie some salt
She was always asking
Where's the nearest bar?
Pedal on the gas kid
Getting playing hard hard
I was in the kitchen
Cooking up a shark
Sally's out preparing
