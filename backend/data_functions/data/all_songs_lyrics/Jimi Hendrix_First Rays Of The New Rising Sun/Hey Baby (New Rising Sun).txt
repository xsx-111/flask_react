Hey Baby (New Rising Sun) Lyrics
(Is the microphone on?)

Hey baby where are you coming from?

Well she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun"
Then I said, "Hey baby, where are you trying to go to?"
Then she said "I'm going to
Spin and spread around peace of mind and a whole lot of love to you and yours"

Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

"Would you like to come along?" She asked me
"Yes, take me along right now"
Hey baby, can I step into your world for a while?
"Yes you can," she said
Come on back with me for a while
We're going to go across the Jupiter sand and see all you people one by one
We got to help you people out right now
That's why I'm doing it all about
Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come alongEmbed
