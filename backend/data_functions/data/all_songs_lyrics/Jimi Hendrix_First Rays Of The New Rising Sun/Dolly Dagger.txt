Dolly Dagger LyricsHere comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge
(Drink up, baby)
Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen
Blow out all the other witches on the scene
She got a bull whip, just as long as your life
Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife
Well, I seen her in action at the players' choice
Turning all the love men into donut boys
Hey red hot momma, you'd better step aside
This chick's gonna turn you to a block of ice
Look out
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so strong gonna make you stagger, baby
Dolly Dagger
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge
Right on
Drink up baby
Hey!

Yeah, look at old burnt out Superman
Tryin' to shoot his dust on the sun
Captain Comic is the man on the run
On the words of love
Do they ever touch Dolly Brown
Better get in some highway and clear outta town
Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger
Dolly Dagger
She ain't satisfied 'til she gets what she's after
She drinks the blood from the jagged edge
Better watch out, baby, here comes your master
Alright
Watch out there, baby
Gonna give a little bit of that
(Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly, heavy mama
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
