Ezy Ryder Lyrics
There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Riding down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Trying to find his heaven above
But he is dying to be loved
He's telling me living
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He's talking bout lying
It is so tragic, baby
But don't you worry about today
We got freedom coming our way
How long
Do you think
He's going to last
Carrying out on a gas 
See all the others say
Do what you please
Got to get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
You going to marry me? haha
I will be stone crazy
Love coming in at you
Stone crazy babyEmbed
