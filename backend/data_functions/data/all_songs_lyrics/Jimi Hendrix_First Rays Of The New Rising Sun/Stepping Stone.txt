Stepping Stone Lyrics
I sure got the blues this morning, baby
Yeah, and I'm here to tell you about it
So you might as well pick up on it
I'm a man
At least I'm trying to be
I have lived before
The other half of me
I have lived before
That you don't want me
But in this search
For nothing desperately
Oh, I'm trying trying
Not to be a fool
I'm trying trying
Lord to keep my cool, baby trying so hard to keep it together
After I find, baby
That true love of mine
I am just Rolling screaming
Crying flying
Can't be trusted, got busted
Rolling stone
You are a woman
At least you say you are
You are a woman
At least you look like you are
You are a woman
At least you taste like you are
But you can take it off
In bed with my guitar
And then you leave them
Throw me outside
To cry, cry
To the moon and the nighttime
Save my soul
You cannot find
All you want is a ticket to ride
After you show me everything
It did prove otherwise
You just rolling, screaming, crying good love is sometime
But cannot be trusted
Stepping stone
