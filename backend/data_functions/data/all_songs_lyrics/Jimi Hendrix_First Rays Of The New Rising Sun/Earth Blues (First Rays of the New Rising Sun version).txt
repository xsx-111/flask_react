Earth Blues (First Rays of the New Rising Sun version) LyricsWell, I see hands and tear-stained faces
Reachin' up but not quite touchin' the Promised Land
Well, I taste tears and a whole lotta precious years wasted
Sayin', Lord, please give us a helpin' hand
(Love love love) Oh, there's got to be some changes
(Love love love) Gonna be a whole lotta rearranges
(Love love love) You better hope love is the answеr
(Love love love) Yеah, it better come before the summer
Well uh, how anybody can hear the sound of freedom's beatin' heart
Sirens flashin' with earth and rock and stone and
You better love me like it's gonna be the last time
And tell the child to bury daddy's old clothes
(Love love love) Yeah, they're talkin' about gettin' together, yeah
(Love love love) Together for love love love
(Love love love) You better hope love is the answer, baby
(Love love love) I think you better hope it comes before the summer
(Everybody) Everybody
(Everybody) Every sister
(Everybody) Every mother
(Everybody) To feel the light
(Everybody) And it's shinin' bright, baby
(Everybody) Everybody
(Everybody) We got to live together
(Everybody) Ooh
Right on, baby
Feel those Earth blues comin' at you, baby
Ooh-hoo
Don't let your imagination take you by surprise (Oooh)
Equitably, I, one day, visualise
My head in the cloud, my feet on the pavement (Whoo)
Don't get too stoned, please remember, you're a man
(Love love love) Lord, there's got to be some changes
(Love love love) Livin' together's gonna be a lot of rearranges, baby
(Love love love) You better be ready, Lord, my Lord
(Love love love) Just hope love comes before the summer
(Everybody) Everybody
(Everybody) Gotta feel the light
(Everybody) You gotta feel the light, baby
(Everybody) Everybody
(Everybody) We gotta live together
(Everybody) Keep it together
(Everybody) Right on together
(Everybody) Whoo, yeah
All standin' together for the Earth blues comin' at ya, baby
(Love love love) Ooh, love love love love
(Love love love) Right on, child
(Love love love) Right on, right on
Feel those Earth blues comin' at ya
Gotta be a Lord all together
