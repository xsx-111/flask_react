Bottle Rocket Lyrics
And it's Us Girls running down a funky rhyme
And this is how we introduce them one at a time

Here's a New York City Breaker with moves to shock
And extra in the air, they call him Flip Rock
Like an acrobat from outer space
With fresh air moves all in your face

Any move or twist that you insist
Is only done by the one at the top of the list
To get the best satisfaction of the main attraction
Is to know the fresh impulse of the man called Action

Now you know their names and the moves they made
And if you challenge the crew, your reputation's sustained
'Cause in a breakdance battle, they never flake
So c'mon everybody, let's rock this break
Hold up fly girls, put it all on ice
'Cause here's the New York City Breaker they call Kid Nice
With knee-neck moves and head glides twice
So c'mon everybody, let's rock this break
Well, spinning on his fist, going faster and faster
That's why I call him the man Glide Master
With his body in the air, fist full of board
Make the crowd roar, guarantee applaud

A New York City Breaker with pep in his step
Keeps time with the beat as he gets set
He'll spin on the floor, and I will bet
He'll be known on the throne as the one Li'l Lep

Now you know their names and the moves they made
And if you challenge the crew, your reputation's sustained
'Cause in a breakdance battle, they never flake
So c'mon everybody, let's rock this break
Hold up fly girls, put it all on ice
'Cause here's the New York City Breaker they call Kid Nice
With knee-neck moves and head glides twice
So c'mon everybody, let's rock this break
Hit it!
