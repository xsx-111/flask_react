Huddle Formation Lyrics
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8

All these beats
Workin' up the streets
Jumping, jacking
Funk to the back
We always stick around it's a-ok
And if we punk around
We're here to stay

Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing

We got the power
Back here
Where it is
We got the power
Back here
It's a 
I got it here, where?
I got it there, where?
I got it
You got it
We got it everywhere

Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Revolution has come
Okay!
Time to pick up a gun
Okay!
Revolution has come
Okay!
Time to pick up a gun
Okay!

Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing

Revolution has come
Okay!
Time to pick up a gun
Okay!
Revolution has come
Okay!
Time to pick up a gun
Okay!
Revolution has come
Okay!
Time to pick up a gun
Okay!
Revolution has come
Okay!
Time to pick up a gun
Okay!1Embed
