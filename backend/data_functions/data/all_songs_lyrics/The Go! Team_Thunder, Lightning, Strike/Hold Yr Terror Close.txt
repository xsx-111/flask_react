Hold Yr Terror Close Lyrics
Here the future is only so near
Why should we all be alone
Every night on the way home
This time we should be starting again
Get up I'm counting to 10
Seeing you comb on your hair
Pretending that no one is there
You know it can be better than that

But wait until tomorrow morning
Learning to be you is what hurts most
Close your eyes and hold your terror close

Out here I hear you come in loud and clear
I carried you 'til it got dark
And then walked you home through the park
You're right, strangers are easy to like
Thunder and lightning will strike
Make the move you'll get the knack
Echoes that don't answer back
Just please give me a chance to say no

But wait until tomorrow morning
Learning to be you is what hurts most
Close your eyes and hold your terror closeEmbed
