Ladyflash Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We started out best friends
Said that you're the kind of man takes every girl for a fool
When the boys go swish, they always score
But can they do it with a cold crack, at they door

Well, you, you, you
Are fantastic and so romantic (say what?)
Romantic and so fantastic
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

We came here to rock the microphone
We came here to rock the microphone
While Dave cuts the record down to the bone
While Dave cuts the record down to the bone

What's gonna rock
What's gonna rock
What's gonna rock
What's gonna rock
We started out best friends
Say you're the kind of man takes every girl for a fool
Jack my boy whatcha gonna do
Let's shoot the shot and do the do

We came here to rock the microphone
We came here to rock the microphone
While Dave cuts the record down to the bone
While Dave cuts the record down to the bone
We came here to rock the microphone
We came here to rock the microphone
While Dave cuts the record down to the bone
While Dave cuts the record down to the bone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
