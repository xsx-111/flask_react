The Power Is On LyricsWatch who's comin' at you
Why? Who's got the power?
Watch who's comin' at you
If you might allow her
Watch who's comin' at you
Why? Who's comin' through?
One, a bit right then we got two
Watch who's comin' at you
But don't fuss
Watch who's gonna get you back on the bus
Watch you change your light bulb
Then you take a shower
Watch who's comin' at you
Why? Who's got the power?
Watch who's comin' at you
Why? Who's comin' through?
One, a bit right then we got two
Watch who's comin' at you
But don't fuss
Watch who's gonna get you back on the bus
Watch who's comin' at you
Then you take a shower
Watch who's comin' at you
If you won't allow it
Watch who's comin' at you
Why? Who's got the power?
Watch it, get up, go!
If you hear us say "come USA"
There ain't no way the gangstas say
Why hello, hello, H-E-L-L-O
Well I need you I want you to know its A-OK
Falcons, falcons, falcons, falcons
Blood stripe falcons
"I woke up this morning out the door
I told the guy who's at the door
I took the morning to read the paper
See if the news was all okay"
Watch who's comin' at you
Why? Who's comin' through?
Wanderin' in the daylight
Then we got the two
Watch who's comin' at you
But don't fuss
Watch who's gonna get you back on the bus
Watch you change your light bulb
Then you take a shower
Watch who's comin' at you
If you might allow her
Watch who's comin' at you
Why? Who's got the power?
Lets go
Lets go
Lets go
Lets go
Watch who's
Got the
Power
Lets go
Lets go
Lets go
Watch who's
Got the
Power
Lets go
Falcons, falcons, falcons, falcons
Blood stripe falconsEmbed
