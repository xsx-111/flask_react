Antenna Lyrics
My darling cruises the streets for pleasure
Skyscrapers in the dead love dawn
Throbbing blood mind selfless creature
Forever yours and then she's gone

Radios play nothing when she's far away
TV antenna nothing gone to waste
Radio transmitting nowhere it falls away
She's far away

Every corner creeping panic
Freak lighting in her abstract mind
Rubber stamps and dreams of cash flow
Wild blood ecstatic crime

Radios play nothing when she's far away
TV antenna rust and gone to waste
Radio transmitting nowhere it falls away
She's far away

Every day I feel more like her
Street magic in the burning dawn
Out for blood my selfless lover
Forever yours and then she's gone
Radios play nothing when she's far away
TV antenna nothing gone to waste
Radio transmitting nowhere it falls away
She's far away
It falls away
She's far awayEmbed
