Leaky Lifeboat  (For Gregory Corso) Lyrics
Leaky lifeboat
Sleeps off shore
Now we're sailing backwards
To the freaky north

My brother the wind
He's got to know
We've got to get it together
And blow
Slipping sideways
Get it straight
The siren sonars
Are tempting fate
Fates in a pleasant mood today
I don't get around much, but hey
I got to say
The sun's got to play

La, la, la, la, la, la

Leaky lifeboat
Called to shore
You got another
Chance to score
My brother the wind
He's got to know
We've got to get it together
And blow
Before the sun gets cold
Cold to gold

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, laEmbed
