Poison Arrow Lyrics
Paintings they fall off the walls
When you come traipsing in with your horse
Your six string guitar is a mess
Silver bullets hanging off your dress
Now I remember what I meant to be
To replace your history
Who let that girl into this room
So innocent yet doomed

Who shot the poison arrow
Who shot the poison arrow
Who shot the poison arrow
Who shot the poison arrow
Ah, ah, here she comes
Yeah, she's playing hard to get
Ah, ah, there she goes
A promise you can never forget

Mirrors, they black out and freeze
When you pull me in too too deep
Every time I, I handcuff you
I know I come closer to the truth
Now I remember what I meant to say
To count all my blessings today
Who let that girl into this room
So innocent yet doomed
Who shot the poison arrow
Who shot the poison arrow
Who shot the poison arrow
Who shot the poison arrow
Ah, ah, here she comes
Yeah, she's playing hard to get
Ah, there she goes
A promise you can never forgetEmbed
