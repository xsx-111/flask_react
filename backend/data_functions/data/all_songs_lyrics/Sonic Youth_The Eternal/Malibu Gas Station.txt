Malibu Gas Station Lyrics
Malibu gas station
Pumps up the nation
A tough cross to bear
Oops no underwear

Come on do it
You gotta use it
That a girl, don't you blow it
Come on move me
Turn me on now
It will make make you feel so good, yeah

I took the stage to show you
So long ago now
My mind is hazy
Just a little crazy

Come on do it
You gotta use it
That a girl, don't you blow it
Come on move me
Turn me on now
Roll me over, it will make you--
Everybody down
Everybody dark
Crawling on the ground

I can't move faster
My face is plaster
The breasts are banging
Abdominal master

Come on do it
You gotta use it
That a girl, don't you blow it
Come on move me
Turn me on now
It will make you feel so good, yeah

Everybody down
Everybody dark
Crawling on the ground
Moving in the waves
Moving in the sand
Bumping on the ground
Grinding in the water
Grinding in the water
Feel the undertow
Feel the undertow
What's yours is mine
What's yours is mine
Feel the undertow, oh
Yeah pulling down
Pull me down
In the undertow
French kiss
French kiss now
Malibu gas station
On face the nation
California magic
A tan so tragicEmbed
