No Way Lyrics
Sweet temptation came today
Time for angels to kneel and pray
I saw you hanging with the devil
Evil nature frozen grave

Renounce your lies sweet succubi, oh no
I don't care I don't wanna hear it
Cause I'm not talking to you no more
And I'm never gonna shadow your door, no way
Hey, hey
There's just no way
Hey, hey
No way

You know you hurt me once
And you know you'll never hurt me again
Cause I'm sick of all yr games
You can't trick my love with sin

Sinners lie I will never die, I said no
I don't care I don't wanna hear it
Cause I'm not talking to you no more
And I'm never gonna shadow your door, no way
Hey, hey
There's just no way
Hey, hey
No way

Sweet temptation came today
Time for angels to kneel and pray
Your black wings are bound in chains
As I swoop into your grave

Werewolf commandos poison tongue, I said no
I don't care I don't wanna hear it
Cause I'm not talking to you no more
And I'm never ever gonna shadow your door, no way
Hey, hey
There's just no way
Hey, hey
No wayEmbed
