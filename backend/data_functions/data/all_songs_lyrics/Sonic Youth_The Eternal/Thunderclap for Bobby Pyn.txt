Thunderclap for Bobby Pyn Lyrics
We did not fade from the noise meditation
We stopped abruptly while spinning down
This is not to depict hesitation
A silent gesture for princess's pleasure

Oh see what heaven sent, whoa
Oh straight from heavens gate, yeah
Oh see what heaven meant, yeah
When it embraces hate, yeah

Elastic dreams of vicious actions
Plastic stomachs wrapped in steel
Hair falls in a dead breeze curtain
Trash can canterbury-hollywood boulevard

Oh you can count on it, yeah
Richard hell tacked to the wall, whoa
Remember the plunger pit, yeah
In love with nothing at all, whoa

Our beards are circuits to amplifier
All our bells have an elite ring
Rapacious gardens of female distinction
Can you smell trouble, libraries of rubble
I don't wanna know, whoa
Who gets the highest score, no
Thatâ€™s when my poodle pukes, yeah
On the gallery floor, whoa

We did not fade from the noise meditation
We stopped abruptly while spinning down
Hair falls in a debris curtain
A silent gesture for princess's pleasure

Here comes Mary rat, whoa
Trudi tacked to the wall, whoa
Take me back to disgrace land, yeah
In love with nothing at all, yeah
