Calming the Snake Lyrics
Come on down
Down to the river
Come on down
I want to feel you shiver
Dark on the edges
Golden on top
Floating down the river
You're so hot

Oh oh oh oh ooh
Oh oh oh oh ooh

Come on down
Down to the river
Come on down
I want to feel you shiver
The sight of death
Is sure to deliver
Come on down
I want to hear you quiver

Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
Corpses' drapery
Rusting, sliding, sliding, sliding
EndlessEmbed
