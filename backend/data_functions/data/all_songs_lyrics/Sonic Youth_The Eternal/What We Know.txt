What We Know Lyrics
I'm in a state of shock
I'm creeping up and down your block
I'm looking into you
I'm trying to catch your view
It's not a quiet meditation

Oh, that you know
Darkness makes the night more cold
That's what we know about me

Satisfied wise child
Creeping heart and frozen perfection
You can touch my hand
I drink a case of you
Heaven's not about your reputation

Yeah, that I know
Forever means the night turns gold
That's what we know about you

It's been quite a ride
With you my sweet, here by my side
Funny how the mountains slide
We're stepping across the great divide
Our bodies vibrate slowly
Yeah, that we know
Bound to give it heart and soul
That's what we know about usEmbed
