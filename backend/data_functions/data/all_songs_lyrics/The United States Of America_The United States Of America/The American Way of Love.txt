The American Way of Love LyricsPart I: Metaphor for an Older Man

Cripple Sam and Joo McGoo
Will join you at the subway
Take a trip downtown
To the 42nd Street Ballet
At the sidewalk supermart
The customers assemble
Look around and see what
The meat department has today

And watch the queens do their thing
Hum-boy, listen to the rhythm
Yes, they do know how to sing
And you can take one home for money
Who will not think you are funny
When you explain the delicate attentions you require

And a dollar ninety-five
Takes you to the movies
With the secret sins
Of nymphomaniacs unveiled
Later on an indiscreet
Encounter in the men's room
And you tell yourself
That a natural urge prevailed
And every night you will find
Sittin' and sippin' on a Burgie
Men who've found piece of mind
For a minimum of payment
There is topless entertainment
That men above the age
Of thirty-five can understand
Part II: California Good-Time Music

Hmm-hmm, we can make California good-time music
In the back seat of my car
Hmm-hmm, later I will tell you
What it's like to be a star

Now you know I'm not the first one (California good-time music)
And I cannot be the last (Califonia good-time, yeah)
To kiss your apple cheeks (California good-time music)
And run away into your past, but (Califonia good-time, yeah)

We'll have good-time music (Good-time music)
Electric good-time music (Good-time music)
California good-time music (California good-time music)
Hmm-hmm, yeah
Part III: Love Is All
Love? Love? Love? Love?
Love? Love? Love? Love?
Love? Love? Love? Love?
Love? Love? Love? Love?

If I should meet you on the streets someday (streets someday)
The price is right
How sweet to be a cloud
Taste of you sweet in my mouth
Love? Love? Love? Love?
Love? Love? Love? Love?
You will find them in her eyes
In her eyes, in her eyes
Good-time music
Good-time music
California music
Love? Love? Love? Love?
Love? Love? Love? Love?
Love? Love? Love? Love?
Love? Love? Love? Love?
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
How much fun it's been
Joo McGoo (love)
Waiting for an answer (love)
Sweet in my mouth (love, love)
In time (love)
So if you want -- the looking glass
When it is (love, love)
California (love, love, love, love)
In her eyes, in her eyes, in her eyesEmbed
