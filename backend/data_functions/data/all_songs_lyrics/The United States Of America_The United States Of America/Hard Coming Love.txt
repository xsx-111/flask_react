Hard Coming Love Lyrics
I don't love easy, babe
Got to be slow
Simple to talk about love
But I want to know
All the things you're thinking
When the colored lights are blinking
And your head starts slowly sinking down

Cause it's hard coming, love
Hard coming, love
Coming love

Something about you, babe
Turning me round
So if you want me, babe
You can't put me down
When you say you need me
And no other one can please me
There's that whole thing coming on where you belong

Oh it's hard coming, love
Hard coming, love
Coming love
If you're uncertain, babe
Don't turn it aside
Save it for this time, now
You can't run and hide
Tell me all the ones you're riding
Round with all the time you're hiding
Down beneath the cover of your blind

Cause it's hard coming love
Hard coming love
Coming love

Love don't come easy, babe
Got to be slow
Simple to talk about love
But I want to know
All the things you're thinking
When the lights are blinking down

It's hard coming love
Hard coming love
Coming loveEmbed
