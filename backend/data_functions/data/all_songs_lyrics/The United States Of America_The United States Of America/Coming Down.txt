Coming Down Lyrics
I think it's over now, I think it's ending
I think it's over now, I think it's ending

There is sometimes a later secondary phase
It's not unusual for it to last for days
And everything is magnified when it is gone

Reality is only temporary
Reality is only temporary

A process imitating things that went before
Without a satisfying answer anymore
The present just repeats the future and the past

I think it's over now, I think it's ending
I think it's over now, I think it's ending

There is no time for second answers to the past
If yesterday is gone don't try to make it last
And summer winds have come and gone without a flood
I think it's over now, I think it's ending
I think it's over now, I think it's ending

A thought of coloured clouds all high above my head
A trip that doesn't need a ticket or a bed
And everything is smelling sweeter than a roseEmbed
