Where Is Yesterday Lyrics
(Agnus dei
Qui tollis peccata mundi
Miserere eis
Agnus dei
Qui tollis peccata mundi
Donna eis requiem.)

Do you remember what you said
And did a thousand years ago?
Where is yesterday?
Do you remember what you said
And did a thousand weeks ago?
Where is yesterday?

Yesterday in crannies or in nooks you will not find;
Yesterday in chronicles or books you will not find;
All you see of yesterday is shadows in your mind;
Shadows on the pavement but no bodies do you find

Do you believe that snows of winters
Long ago return again?
Where is yesterday?
A voice you knew a thousand years ago
You can't remember when?
Where is yesterday?
Here is only waiting for a day that went before
Here is only waiting for an answer at the door;
Here is only living without knowing why for sure
Here is something gone you cannot find it anymoreEmbed
