Stranded in Time Lyrics
Early in the morning
When the sun is still asleep
Father drinks his cup of coffee
Kisses mother on the cheek
Off to work he goes
What he does? Nobody knows
But he's sure to bring home money
Every week

Time when he and mother were young
Now those days are departed
Now he's left broken-hearted
Stranded in time

They dote upon the children
Like some characters in plays
As if nearness to their youngers
Would recall their golden days
And father sold the looking glass
That once stood in the hall
And now mother tends to
Tell the time by pictures on the wall
Times when she would laugh in his arms
Now are vanished forever
Now they stand close together
Stranded in timeEmbed
