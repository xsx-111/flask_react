Pipes of Peace Lyrics
I light a candle to our love
In love our problems disappear
But all in all, we'll soon discover
That one and one is all we long to hear

All around the world
Little children being born to the world
Got to give them all we can 'til the war is won
Then will the work be done?

Help them to learn (Help them to learn)
Songs of joy instead of "burn, baby, burn" (Burn, baby, burn)
Let us show them how to play the pipes of peace
Play the pipes of peace

Help me to learn
Songs of joy instead of "burn, baby, burn"
Won't you show me how to play (How to play)
The pipes of peace? (Pipes of peace)
Play the pipes of peace
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What do you say? (Do you say)
Will the human race be run in a day? (In a day)
Or will someone save this planet we're playing on?
Is it the only one?
What are we going to do?

Help them to see (Help them to see)
That the people here are like you and me (Like you and me)
Let us show them how to play (How to play)
The pipes of peace (Pipes of peace)
Play the pipes of peace
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I light a candle to our love
In love our problems disappear
But all in all, we soon discover
That one and one is all we long to hearEmbed
