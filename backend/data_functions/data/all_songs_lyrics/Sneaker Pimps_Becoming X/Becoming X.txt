Becoming X Lyrics
You can keep breathing
I only fall when you are near me
Incomplete
I only talk when you can hear me
Keep dreaming
Can't wake up until I'm sleeping
Lost on me
Close to something I'll never be

(Very nearly something to me)
(Very nearly something to me)

If I just stay here
Close my eyes can you still see me
Obsolete
Very nearly something to see
See me
I can't wake up for sleeping
Incomplete
Very nearly something to me
Still see me
There's a punishment needed
Obsolete
Very nearly something to be
Very nearly something to be

You can keep trying
Drown in sleep to be flying
See for miles
Something that I wanted to be
I can't wake this dream
Prototype ends up has been
Incomplete
The consequence of something to beEmbed
