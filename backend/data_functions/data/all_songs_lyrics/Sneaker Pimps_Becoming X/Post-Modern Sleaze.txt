Post-Modern Sleaze Lyrics
She looks ahead
She paints her toe nails red
She's wet and wild
A typical 90's child

She makes every move they make
She takes everything they take
She must be a Thelma or Louise
She must be a post-modern sleaze

Unscrew the wine
She'll throw a party line
Stories extreme
She's such a drama queen
Cries through the night
She choked on Marlboro lites
Pure charm and grace
She hates her pretty face

She makes every move they make
She takes everything they take
She must be a Thelma or Louise
She must be a post-modern sleaze
Straw spun from gold
She craves a tortured soul
All doom and gloom
She plays an open wound

She takes every scene they steal
She fakes every pain they feel
She must be a Thelma or Louise
She must be a post-modernâ€”teaseEmbed
