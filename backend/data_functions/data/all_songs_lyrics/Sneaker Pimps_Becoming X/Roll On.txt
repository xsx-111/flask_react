Roll On Lyrics
Roll on, these doors are open
Roll off, you can come next time
I'm in love with your confusion, on your knees
When you're breathing through your elbows
Down on me, down on me

Roll on roll off
Roll on roll off
Don't take that wrong
Don't take that wrong

Roll up, these doors are open
Load up, come next time
Don't try to hurry me along
Just walk ahead a little gone
A little gone (gone)

Roll on roll off
Roll on roll off
Don't take that wrong

Roll on, going down on me
Roll off, make it easy on me
You can't think you're someone special
On your knees
We're throwing punches underwater
Sink with me, sink with me (sink)
Roll on, roll off
Roll on, roll off

Something is sinking
Something is sinking
Something is sinking
Something is sinking
Something is sinkingEmbed
