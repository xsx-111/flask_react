Waterbaby LyricsYour heart is served cold
Your sights are set in perfect stone
And when you go you go alone
And when you stand you're on your own
I wash the streets from your skin when you come home
I wash the streets from your skin when you come home
We're nothing like friends
You have no time to lend
And if you're guilt then I'm the shame
And if I'm hurt then you're the blame
You wash my trace from your skin and you leave again
You wash my trace from your skin and you leave again
(The love is gourds
Life left with anons)
Random laid plans
40 days of one night stands
And when you go you go alone
You walk the cross you made your own
I wash the streets from your skin when you come home
I wash the streets from your skin when you come home
(I wash the streets from your skin)Embed
