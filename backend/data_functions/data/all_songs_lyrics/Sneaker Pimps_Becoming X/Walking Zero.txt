Walking Zero Lyrics
Sacrifice my vanity, kick off my heels
A careless weight on your hatred
Understand, it's so simple, a simple please
To keep the faithful on a wounded knee

To the madness, I do confess
I never see myself as blessed
(Confused, unaddressed)
Like a saviour, I do caress
The truth is boredom, more or less
(Unused, obsessed)
My time is only given up to you
Too much to choose
It's not mine to contemplate if I can lose
With this blood on my shoes

Compromise in full extreme, cut off my heels
Name a price on what's sacred
Guaranteed I've got something, a royal disease
Take a flood to clean these streets

To the madness, I do confess
Forever see myself as blessed
(Immune, obsessed)
Like a saviour, I do caress
The truth is boredom, it's excess
(Take more, give less)
My time is only given up to you
Too much to choose
It's not mine to contemplate if I can lose
With this blood on my shoes1Embed
