Wasted Early Sunday Morning LyricsYou're not the sun
It's just a light
Waking on a sunday morning
You're not the church
It's just the bells
Ringing sweetly through the house
And if this sense of mind
You got an answer
And I am not this rare
You're still in reach
I please myself
Wasting early sunday morning
You're not my lead
You're just my help
Tuck me in just denied
And in this state of mind
You want a want
Nothing close to what I need
I breathe you in
I breathe you in
I breathe you in
I breathe you in
I breathe you in
Suit yourself
Lose myself
Breaking early sunday morning
You're not the sun
You're not my church
I still hold some self control
But in this sense of mind
I'm still too high
Look no hands
I breathe you in
Breathe you in
Breathe you in
Breathe you in
Breathe you in
(i breathe you
I breathe you
I breathe you
I breathe you
I breathe you)Embed
