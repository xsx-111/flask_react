Tesko Suicide Lyrics
Phone me and I'll hang up
Sick and tired of being bubble gum chewed up
Dark lane, bleak house shrinking rose
You're over and out

Tying cherry bootstrings
Put your candy teeth in
Giving out the sweetheart
Hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls, solo
Go on girls, take a chance
Go on girls, trust it
Go on girls, the truth is

Cut your hair, wear a chip on your shoulder
Get ahead, get laid, get it over
Cheap show, back seat martyr's pose
You're over and out

I'm checking out of my senses
Buying best defences
Putting on the trousers
Hang up, hang up, hang up
Go on girls, solo
Go on girls, take a chance
Go on girls, trust it
Go on girls, the truth is
So, so single
So low, the truth is

You want the day to fit to a soundtrack
Get a story, get a life, and get back
You've got nothing to shout about
You're over and out

I'm checking out of my senses
Buying best defences
Fired up on free-will
Hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls, solo
Go on girls, take a chance
Go on girls, trust it
Go on girls, the truth is
So, so single
So low, the truth is
So, so single
So low, the truth is2Embed
