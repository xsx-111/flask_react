Spin Spin Sugar Lyrics
I'm everyone
I feel used
I'm everyone
I need you
I'm everyone
Hang your label on me
I'm everyone
Paint it black and white and easy
I want perfection
I'm real need
I've seen attention
See through me
I'm everyone
Sticks in me
I'm everyone
Sticks with me

Call on me
Spin spin sugar
Crawl on me
Spin spin sugar
Stinks on me
Spin spin sugar
Twists for me
Spin spin sugar
I've seen attention
See through me
I want perfection
I'm real need
I'm everyone
Sticks in me
I'm everyone
Sticks with me

Call on me
Spin spin sugar
Crawl on me
Spin spin sugar
Stinks on me
Spin spin sugar
Twists for me
Spin spin sugarEmbed
