How Do Lyrics

Hey ho—who is this?
No one but me, my dear
Please, come, say, "How do."
The things I'll give to you
A stroke as gentle as a feather
Hey ho—I am here
Am I not young and fair?
Please, come, say, "How do."
The things I'll show to you
Would you have a wond'rous sight
Oooh, oooh, ooh, the midday sun
At midnight
Fair maid, white and red
Comb you smooth and stroke your head
