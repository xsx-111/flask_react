6 Underground Lyrics
Take me down six underground
The ground beneath your feet
Laid out low, nothing to go
Nowhere a way to meet

I've got a head full of drought down here
So far off losing out round here
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace

Calm me down, bring it 'round
Too way high off your street
I can see like nothing else
In me you're better than I wanna be

Don't think 'cause I understand I care
Don't think 'cause I'm talking we're friends
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace

Talk me down, safe and sound
Too strung up to sleep
Wear me out, scream and shout
Swear my time's never cheap
I fake my life like I've lived too much
I take whatever you're given, not enough
Overground, watch this space
I'm open
I fake my life like I've lived too much
I take whatever you're given, not enough
Overground, watch this space
I'm open to falling from grace7Embed
