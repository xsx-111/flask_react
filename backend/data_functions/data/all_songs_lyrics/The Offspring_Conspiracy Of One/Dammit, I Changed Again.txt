Dammit, I Changed Again Lyrics
Hey, come inside
While I stand here acting bold
(Can't stand to feel this way)
Clear out the cobwebs in my soul
(Oooooo ooo)
This time I...

... turn around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again

Now I don't see
Things the way I did before
(Can't stand to feel this way)
Things I feel yesterday
Don't matter anymore
(Oooooo ooo)
It doesn't make any sense
To feel so different day to day
(Can't stand to feel this way)
When nothing's changed except for...
(Oooooo ooo)
Next time I...
...turn around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again
Turn around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again...


Turn around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Start a fight
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again
Turn around
And things have changed
Now I don't feel the same, yeah
Turn around
I can't defend
One more time
Dammit, I changed again
(Oooooo ooo)
I see ya...1Embed
