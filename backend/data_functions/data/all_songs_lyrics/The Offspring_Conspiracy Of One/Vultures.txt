Vultures Lyrics
Now I could lie by your side
All serrated for you
Down below, cancer grows
Weeping waits inside you, too
Now all our rage begs a stage
It's a waste of time, though
And your style seems worthwhile
But this lonely road has turned

And you faded there
They pretend to care
Vultures waiting
If you don't like me
Certify me

Yeah‚ I don't know, yeah
Yeah‚ I won't go, yeah
Yeah‚ save it, I'm okay
Okay

And in the sun, a loaded gun
Makes for conversation
All the while in denial
It's too late for me to change
And you were unchained
Nothing more had changed
I could fake it
If you still hate me
Confiscate me

Yeah‚ I don't know, yeah
Yeah‚ I won't go, yeah
Yeah‚ save it, I'm okay
Okay
Yeah‚ I won't play, yeah
Yeah‚ go away, yeah
Yeah‚ save it, I'm okay
Okay

And you were unchained
Nothing more had changed
I could fake it
If you still hate me
Confiscate me

Yeah‚ I don't know, yeah
Yeah‚ I won't go, yeah
Yeah‚ save it, I'm okay
Okay
Yeah‚ I won't play, yeah
Yeah‚ go away, yeah
Yeah‚ save it, I'm okay
