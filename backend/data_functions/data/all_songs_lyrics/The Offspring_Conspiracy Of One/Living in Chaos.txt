Living in Chaos Lyrics
Got a song, song, man
It goes like this

Somewhere the time was right
Could have been gone in ten
This world is hard to fight
Hitting you once, hit it again
To know the way it feels
Everyone gets knocked down
When you get up it's real
By taking it back, turn it around

Get on it, up on it
Get on it—wouldn't wanna be you
Get on it, up on it
Get on it—no one's gonna free you
You know, when you're keeping it slow
No matter where you wanna go—wouldn't wanna be you
Get on it, up on it
It's on—we're living in chaos

Somewhere along the line
Things get chipped away
This place keeps going down
Gets a little worse every day
I see hate and greed
This world's a messed up town
Embrace the pain and see
By taking it back, you turn it around
Get on it, up on it
Get on it—wouldn't wanna be you
Get on it, up on it
Get on it—no one's gonna free you
You know, when you're keeping it slow
No matter where you wanna go—wouldn't wanna be you
Get on it, up on it
It's on

Falling, falling
Falling, falling
Ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya
Got a song, song, man
It goes like this

Somewhere the time was right
Could have been gone in ten
This world is hard to fight
Hitting you once, hit it again
To know the way it feels
Everyone gets knocked down
When you get up it's real
Falling, falling
Falling, falling
Ya, ya, ya
Get on it, up on it, get on it
Ya, ya, ya
Get on it, up on it, get on it
(No one's gonna free you)
Get on it, up on it, get on it
Ya, ya, ya1Embed
