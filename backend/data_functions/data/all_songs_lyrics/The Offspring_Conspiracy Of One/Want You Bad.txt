Want You Bad Lyrics
If you could only read my mind
You would know that things between us ain't right
I know your arms are open wide
But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie

Your one vice
Is you're too nice
Come around now, can't you see?

I want you, all tattooed
I want you bad
Complete me, mistreat me
I want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

If you could only read my mind
You would know that I've been waiting so long
For someone almost just like you
But with attitude, I'm waiting, so come on

Get out of clothes time
Grow out those highlights
Come around now, can't you see?
I want you, in a vinyl suit
I want you bad
Complicated, x-rated
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad

Don't get me wrong
I know you're only being good
But that's what's wrong
I guess I just misunderstood

I want you, all tattooed
I want you bad
Complicated, x-rated
I want you bad

I mean it, I need it
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, really, really bad4Embed
