One Fine Day Lyrics
If I had a perfect day
I would have it start this way
Open up the fridge and have a tall boy, yeah
Then I'd meet up with my friends
Head out to the game again
We don't even really care who wins, wins, 1, 2, 3

Now excitement seems to grow
When we're hanging with the bro's
When we're chilling and we pound a case of Stroh's
Now the game is cool to see
You can "High 5" on TV
Count the riot on the one, two, three
Operation is in sight
And the field is open wide
When you break it, then you know you're still alive
If the cops don't make you pay
And you make your getaway
Then you know that it's one fine day

On that day before we're through
We could torch a car or two
Then have ourselves another tall boy, yeah
Water hoses and batons
That's the real game that's on
I don't really give a shit who wins, wins, 1, 2, 3
Now excitement seems to grow
When we're hanging with the bro's
When we're chilling and we pound a case of Stroh's
Now the game is cool to see
You can "High 5" on TV
Count the riot on the one, two, three
Operation is in sight
And the field is open wide
When you break it, then you know you're still alive
If the cops don't make you pay
And you make your getaway
Then you know that it's one fine day

I believe it's my God-given right
To destroy everything in my sight
â€™Cause it never gets dull, it never gets old
The only thing it gets is more bold
Drinkin', fightin', going to the game
In our world it's a way to stay sane
If you're asking me to have it my way
I'd say that's one fine day

Now excitement seems to grow
When we're hanging with the bro's
When we're chilling and we pound a case of Stroh's
Now the game is cool to see
You can "High 5" on TV
Count the riot on the one, two, three
Operation is in sight
And the field is open wide
When you break it, then you know you're still alive
If the cops don't make you pay
And you make your getaway
Then you know that it's one fine day
Then you know that it's one fine day, now
Hey, hey, hey hey3Embed
