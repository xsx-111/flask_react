Million Miles Away Lyrics
There was a time, looking through myself
Wanting to pretend
If I escaped, I could fill myself
I don't think you can
Been far and wide
But that hole inside
Never really leaves
When I went away, what I really left
Left behind was me

It's telling me
To be on my way
Home

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Million miles away
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Million miles away
I can't stay, I can't stay
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
A million miles away

Each passing day, every passing face
Seems like such a blur
I long to be home, silently
Lying next to her
Just to get back, by her side is all
All I need to be
I went away, but what I really left
Left behind was me
I need to be
Getting on my way
Home

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Million miles away
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
A million miles away

It's telling me
To be on my way
Home

I can't take, I can't take
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Million miles away
I can't take, I can't take (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
