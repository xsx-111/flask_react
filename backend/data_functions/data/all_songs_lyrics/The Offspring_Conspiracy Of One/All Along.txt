All Along Lyrics
Deep inside secret's burning
Should have known all the while what's true
I went along, to fool myself
Can't go on, I can't escape it

All along
I think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along
Still believed in you
Now I'm leaving here betrayed and broken

Close my eyes from the burning
All along, all the while it's true
Take it on, or turn your back
Either way, you can't escape it

All along
I think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along
Still believed in you
Now I'm leaving here betrayed and broken
Ooooh
Ooooh

All along
I think I really knew
It was there in the words unspoken
All along
Still believed in you
Now I'm leaving here betrayed and broken

All along
I still believe in you1Embed
