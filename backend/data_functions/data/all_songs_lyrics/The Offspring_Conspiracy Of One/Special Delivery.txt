Special Delivery Lyrics

Hey now, do you see me down the way?
Been watching you every day
In my car on your street is where I stay
I know you better that way
One day, I'll be meeting you for real
You'll feel bad like I feel

It'll blow you away
You're going to fall for me
You're going to fall for me
And the voices told me to blow you away
You're going to fall for me
You're going to fall for me


Hey now, well, I'm knocking on your door
This special delivery is yours
My infatuation, it's true
Hello, got something for you
It'll blow you away
You're going to fall for me
You're going to fall for me
And the voices told me to blow you away
You're going to fall for me
You're going to fall for me
If you hadn't sold me, I'd still be away
You're right in front of me
You're right in front of me
Then, I'll be on my way
Breathing you okay

(Ugachaka, ugachaka, uga, uga)
Can't break from my sins
Cannot pray
Can't break from my sins
Cannot pray
But you can't kill a man when he's got no hope
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope
You can't kill a man when he's...
God help me!

It'll blow you away
You're going to fall for me
You're going to fall for me
And the voices told me to blow you away
You're going to fall for me
You're going to fall for me
If you hadn't sold me, I'd still be away
You're right in front of me
You're right in front of me
Then, I'll be on my way
When you breathe onto me1Embed
