Denial, Revisited Lyrics
So here we go
Having the same old fight again
Though there she goes
Same old game that never ends
If I could say all the right words
I know I could make you stay
If I could say all the right words
Things would work out all right

And if you go
I won't believe
That it's forever
And you can go
But I'll never leave
â€™Cause it's not over

Replay last night
Talking it out don't make it right
I know she's tried, but my whole world
Is her and all we've got now

And if you go
I won't believe
That it's forever
I won't let go
Even if she
Says that it's over
I know it'll be
Different this time
If you'd just stay
And when we wrote this story how did it end?
It was you and me for all our lives
Come on, don't say it, we'll try again
And if I'd just hold you we could last
But she stands softly, tears down her face
Hitting me, oh God, this is the end
I'd wait for you but there's nothing more now I can do

How did you know?
How did you know?
How did you know?
