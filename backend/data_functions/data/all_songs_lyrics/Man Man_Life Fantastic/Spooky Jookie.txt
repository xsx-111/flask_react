Spooky Jookie LyricsShe don't dream the way she used to dream
Before her body condemned itself to feel like an empty building
One day she'll discover that the habits that she covet
Only smother the hopes that her heart will change
She broke her teeth on an unsheathed piece of hard tasty candy
She closes her eyes at night
She can hear the calvary go by
She can taste his tongue on her mouth
And his tears sting like disease
She don't ever see what should be seen
'Till the thing that should be seen is out sight
She don't ever see what should be seen
'Till the thing that should be seen is out sight
She don't ever see what should be seen
'Till the thing that should be seen is out sight
She don't ever see what should be seen
'Till the thing that should be seen is gone
Her fingers burn when she folds them to pray
That hunt for love ain't cold like the holes in her duvet
She ain't too certain that her psyche can take
Another season of hunters pretending to spare their prey
And her brains froze black
And her eyes rolled back
And her steps shellacked
She don't know what she's becoming
And her brains froze black
And her tongue rolled back
And her heart shellacked
She don't know what she's becoming
She don't know what she's becoming
She don't dream the way she used to dream
Before her body condemned itself to feel like an empty building
One day she'll discover that the habits that she covered
Only smother the hopes that her heart will change
She broke her teeth on an unsheathed piece of hard tasty candy
She closes her eyes at night
She can hear the years she lost go by
She can taste his tongue in her mouth
And his tears sting like deceit
And her brains froze black
And her eyes rolled back
And her sense shellacked
She don't know what she's becoming
And her brains froze black
And her tongue's rolled back
And her heart shellacked
She don't know what she's becoming
She don't know what she's becoming
She don't know what she's becomingEmbed
