Life Fantastic LyricsAnd I'll trip a light fandango
My legs are sheer elastic
It's how you envelope me
I'm like a corpse in plastic
You find while at a picnic
When you're just there to kick it
Now you have to call the police
And report somethin' wicked
And the scene, it turns so grisly
And the children, they are crying
You hand them black umbrellas
Tell 'em that the world is dying
It's how you hide your cards
It's how you dress your scars
And let them breathe free
Life
Fantastic...
Life
So tragic...
Life
Fantastic...
And I'll trip a light fandango
I'll dangle from your elbow
It's how you envelope me
Between chaos and beauty
It's like you're at a picnic
And the wind, it turns so wicked
But you cannot call the police
And report what is happening
And the scene, it turns so gnarly
And your mother, she is crying
You take her in your arms
Tell her that the world is dying
Ooh...
Life
Fantastic...
Life
So tragic...
Life
FantasticEmbed
