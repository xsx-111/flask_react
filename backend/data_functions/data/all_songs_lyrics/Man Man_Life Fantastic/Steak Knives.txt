Steak Knives LyricsAre you my pet
Or did I have to work so hard for nothing
I've been here before
I'll be here again
My blood runs quick like ink from a squid
And are you my pet
Or did I have to work so hard for nothing
I know you've met the mess you'll marry
He'll keep you fed
But can he carry the weight of your heart?
And everybody says that I'm a fool
For you
And I want some cake and you want the high
We both want a piece of what will quicken the rot
We gotta wait for the day the dead will rise
Wait for the day the dust settles in our
Step step, step your heart up
Step step, stitch the holes up
(x4)
And are you my pet
Or did I have to work so hard for nothing
And everybody says that I'm a fool
For wanting you
And everybody says that I'm a fool
For loving you
And everybody says that I'm a fool
For youEmbed
