Piranhas Club LyricsThrow me to piranhas, if you won't be with me
Feed me to koalas, if you won't be with me
I'm not a barracuda, even though I flash the teeth
Throw me to piranhas, if you won't be with me
Is it all about the ebb and the flow
Of losing your mind sometimes and letting go
You feel like you can't breathe
You're outta control
The world is a shit show
You barely can handle
And if you gotta smash some plates to relax
I say do it d-d-d-d-d-do it
And if you gotta crash your car in a lake to feel sane
I say do it, just do it
And if you gotta scream until your voice breaks
I say do it d-d-d-d-d-do it
And if you gotta punch your dad in the face
I say think about it. Do it
Throw me to piranhas, if you won't be with me
Feed me to koalas, if you won't be with me
I'm not a barracuda, even though I flash the teeth
Throw me to piranhas, if you won't be with me
Is it all about the highs and the lows
Of losing all you love sometimes and letting go
You feel like you can't deal
Your heart's doing cartwheels
The world is a shit show, as bad as the sequel
And if you gotta smash some plates to relax
I say do it d-d-d-d-d-do it
And if you gotta crash your car in a lake to feel sane
I say do it, just do it
And if you gotta dance until the earth quakes
And her boyfriend's a dick and you gotta regulate
I say think about it he might destroy you
Think about it he might destroy you
Think about it he might destroy you
Tear his limbs off
And I don't wanna be the stranger in your rear-view mirror
I just wanna be the man you bring home for dinner
I don't wanna be the stranger in your rear-view mirror
I just wanna be the man you bring home for dinner
I don't wanna be the stranger in your rear-view mirror
I just wanna be the man you bring home for dinner
I don't wanna be the stranger in your rear-view mirror
I just wanna be the man you bring home for dinnerEmbed
