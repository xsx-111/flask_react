Dark Arts LyricsBored to life you shower with a knife
You mix Ambien and motorbikes
She heaves a sigh in the middle of the night
That says come inside her and it kills the vibe
Bored to life you huff glue and wine
You paint portraits of pretty babies
Crying out a short bus eyes for you
(wa wa wa wa)
You gravitate towards lovers named
After days you were weak and hurricanes
And hope that they hold you like an avalanche
And I hit my head and I had a vision quest
I rode on the wings of a giant talking bat
Said to trust my sonar
'cause happiness don't ever last
And I can feel it
Can you feel it?
It's like a warm
Atomic cloud that's raining down, washing over us
I can feel it, can you feel it?
It's like a warm
It's like a swarm
Atomic cloud that's raining down, washing over us
There must be something in the air
That's making us all go crazy here
Our friends are either breeding, dying
Or losing all their marbles trying
Told me that you turn to pygmies
And the dark arts to ease your suffering
It's why you're running through the bush with a taser and a tan
Don't blame me for your bouts of sadness
Blame the magic that makes the mattress
Melt so wonderfully with another's body in the dark
And I hate my head
So I bury it in the sand
If I razor cut some bangs
Will I forget who I am?
Staring at the man who's in the mirror
And how the fuck did I live this long this way?
(Hello
Nice to meet you
Certainly
Charmed
Thank you)
Mister dagger, meet mister back, inseparable, together at last
These days I feel like a pariah
An albatross with my feathers on fire
Stop and drop and roll the flames
But they don't slow, they just grow brighter
And will you help me search party for my hidden Indians?
The parts of me that I scalped to be
A well-adjusted man
And home surgery all the fondest memories
That keep me bound like blackened ice
To motorcycle crash
And I pour myself a cup of mummy brown
And I'll carve a coffin out of tramp art that I've found
Cut me down if you love me and let me sway if you don't
Stare at the man who's in the mirror
And how the fuck did I live this long?
And I can feel it!
Can you feel it?
I can feel it!
Can you feel it?
I can feel it!
Can you feel it?
I can feel it!
Can you feel it?
I can feel it!
Can you feel it?
I can feel it!
Ahhh!Embed
