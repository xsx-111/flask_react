Hourglass LyricsTurn the hourglass around
Turn your head inside out (X2)
Turn the hourglass
Turn the hourglass around
Turn your head inside out (X2)
Turn the hourglass
Are you a snake(?)
Are you a fake
(undecipherable)
A decision, indecision 'cision?
She said she saw a white buffalo
Changing clothes
In a basement window
I don't believe her
Turn the hourglass around
Turn your head inside out (X2)
Turn the hourglassEmbed
