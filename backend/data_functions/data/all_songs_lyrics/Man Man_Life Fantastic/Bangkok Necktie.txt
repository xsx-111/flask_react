Bangkok Necktie LyricsWorld, I wanna know
If you are my lover or you're working with the wolves
World, I wanna know
If you are my lover or you're working with the wolves
World, I wanna know
If you are my lover or you're working with the wolves
World, I wanna know
If you are my lover or you're working with the wolves
World, I wanna know
If you are my lover or you're working with the wolves
Laid my brains out on the table do you want me now?
Before my body catches up and kicks me til I'm down
I laid my body on the table do you want me now?
Before my demons come along and pull me underground
I laid my demons in your navel do you want me now?
Beat your ear into my chest and hear the hollow sound
I left my heart out on the table do you want it now?
Well there it goes right out the door to terrorize the town
Get a rope
Get a rope
Get a rope
Get a room
(x8)
Get a rope in case you fall
Into a hole that people call love
You won't 'cause you can tell
They never been in love before
Pull yourself up
Hey, I wanna know
If you are my lover or you're just another wolf
Hey, I wanna know
If you are my lover or I'm just another wolfEmbed
