Shameless LyricsShameless
Oh my, oh no
How can I be so shameless?
And let myself fall so
Impossibly for you
You wish to demystify
Our electricity
And claim the charge between our hearts
Is just illusionary
Oh my, oh no
How can I be so shameless?
And let myself fall so
Impossibly again
And I spent too many years
Searching for somebody
To be my wrecking ball
And rebuild all that's broken
And I spent too many nights
Without ever thinking
Maybe I'm a wrecking ball
And I'm breaking all that I'm touching
And I spent too many days
Drowning in the shallows
From the mess of the man that I've made
And the nest of mistakes that I have to lay
Doctor I'm telling you
To cut me open please
Doctor I'm begging you
To bring me to my knees
Tear out all my flesh
And all my bones
Make me your cold machine
So I can walk alone
Hey, Hoo
Who do you call
When you try to chase the bad mood off
Hey, Now
What do you do
When you can't shake the baddie in you
Hey, Hoo
Who do you call
When you try to chase the bad mood off
Hey, Now
What do you do
When you can't shake the baddie in you
Hey, Hoo (x6)
Hey...
Doctor I'm telling you
To cut me open please
Doctor I'm begging you
To bring me to my knees
Tear out all my flesh
And all my bones
Make me your cold machine
So I can walk alone
(4x)
I want you so bad
I can't stand
The man that I am
Got this riddle figured (Do you?)
Someone must have sent you to
Orchestrate a shell game
Against the callouses of our hearts
I hate your subtle beauty (Do you?)
The way your doe eyes slow dance me
And beat like a million humming birds
When I draw closer
And the slope of your nose I detest
It's the kind that drove pharaohs crazy
Touch me I'm a hornet's nest
Sinking in Egyptian levies
Most of all I hate the way that I miss your sight
More than a blind man would miss his own eyes
Miss his own eyes
Miss his own eyes
Oh my, oh no
How can I be so shameless?
And let myself fall so
Impossibly for you
Oh my, oh no
How can I be so shameless?
It's 'cause I've learned that need deceives
And you are what I wantEmbed
