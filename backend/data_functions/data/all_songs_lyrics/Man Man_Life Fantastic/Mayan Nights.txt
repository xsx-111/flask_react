Mayan Nights LyricsAnd every night he needs to party
Like it's the end of times
Gilded Mayans descend from heaven
Desires in their eye
They raze the landscape, I'll raise a toast
While wasted in strange arms(?)
No back-alley lobotomy
Could tear me away from you
Oh I can feel it from my head to my toes
The man I was, you once loved, is almost a ghost
I feel it, from my bones to my marrow
The man I was, you once loved, is almost a shadow
(quiet!)
We used to drink to make trouble and fun
But now we drink to forget we are drunks
And everybody needs somebody
To shovel their hurt on
Logistics say you burn all your bridges
The savages stop attacking your village
What's the point, what's the purpose
When you're left with a life that's pillaged
And I, I can feel it
The man I was, you once loved, is almost gone
And I, I can't deal with it
The man I was was weak, but now I'm strong
And I, I can't live through this
The man i was was lost, but now I'm...
...doomed!Embed
