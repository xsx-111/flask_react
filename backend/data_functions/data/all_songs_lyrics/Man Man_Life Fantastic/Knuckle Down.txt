Knuckle Down Lyrics
All my branches break
When you go and tell me
Your body can't take
The nights of being lonely

I'm racing through the dark
A headless Saint Bernard
To cauterize the scars
That line your dirty heart

What the hell can I do
When you whisper "punish me"?
Snap me like a tiger trap
I lost all my honey

I'm bracing for the shiver
String me in your quiver
Aim me for the skyline
But shoot me in the river

And terror quits me
When you palpitate
Confess directly
Sadness spreads your legs
I contemplate the toll
Turning diamonds into coal
Traveling down this hole
Throwing conscience to the wind

That spins, it's not a path that
I ever thought I would traffic to get you back
Our panic will burst like birds full of aspirin
We're not to blame
It's the same as it was never before, so

I'm not a scoundrel
It's just the suit that fits me
Cut tight and breathes nice
Maintains insanity
Never thought I'd be like a hunger with no appetite
A hunter with no urge for thrills
The type of man I despise

So I ask the devil
How to learn to handle
Woman with a shovel
Digging downward spirals
He tells me what to do
And how to strut my cool
And polish up my boots
With all your lovers blood
It's just it's not a road that I ever thought
I would traffic to get you back
Our panic will burst like birds full of aspirin
We're not to blame
It's the same as it was never before, so

And I roam the trenches
Bayonet's just what I need
Hate you more than anything 'cause
You're everything to me, so
You met your match, don't even know it yet
Challenge? This ain't challenge
When evil's got your edge

This time, it's not a road that I ever thought
I would traffic to get you back
Our panic will burst like birds full of aspirin
We are to blame
It's the same is it was never before, so -Embed
