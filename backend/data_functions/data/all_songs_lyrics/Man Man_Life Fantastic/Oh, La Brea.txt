Oh, La Brea LyricsLa Brea, why you gotta be so god damn scary?
Is it 'cause there's little creatures' bones buried in your home?
La Brea, why you gotta be so god damn worried?
Is it 'cause there's little future hope going up your nose?

Sepulveda and Pico, what the hell do they know about me?
Los Feliz and Sunset, Hillhurst, Occidental, and Beverly
La Brea, I love you
TAR PITS!

La Brea, I am you
TAR PITS!
It seems that the scenery's about settling
On a piece of ballast called "a wedding"
The stars that once guided us are fading
The patterns of what we want seem alien
So I learn to drift
And I learn to drift
And I learn to drift awake, away
Awake, away
Awake, awayEmbed
