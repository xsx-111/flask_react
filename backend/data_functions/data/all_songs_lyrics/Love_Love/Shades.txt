Shades Lyrics
Uhh, before you get here, put your panties in your pocketbook
That’s what I told her over the Motorola, Hennessy and Cola
I hold her at attention with my manners
And even though I don’t roll a camera
She still performs like the superstar she truly are
So, also, I think I love her already
Damn, I think I, already, haha
She must be the one
I look in her eyes and see the sun even on rainy days
Ain't it crazy mane? Yeah, that’s what I said
She do doughnuts in my head, over and over and over
'Til the cops pull her over
And then she say some real slick shit like
"I’m on my way by Weezy Baby"
Heh, and of course they let her go
Let me take off my shades

I know I got a lot of baggage
It's full of ladies and Mercedes, you say, "I know that it's heavy
But I'll pay someone to grab it, for me, yeah"
I know I got a lot of baggage
Full of Chanel's and Tiffany's and broken hearts girl
You need me baby, it's hard to break a habit, for me, yeah
And girl if you want (What do you want me to do?)
I'll pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart just to light your cigarette
And girl if you want (I'll do anything for you)
I’ll do anything for you (I'll even take off my shades)
I’ll even take off my shades
And stare right at the sun from the stage
(I’ll even try different things) I'll even try different things
I’ll make love to you on marmalade
Never made love on marmalade
I’ll even change my name, name, to what you say
(I'll be whatever you say) I'll be whatever you say
I'll even take off my shades
I'll make love to you on marmalade
Are you sure that's what you wanna do?
If that's what you wanna do
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
When I’m perfect for you, girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
And love's gon' turn you out baby
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Whoa! What you gonna do
When I’m perfect for you? Girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Yeah, and love’s gon' turn you out baby
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Yeah, girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy

Got a lot of baggage
It's full of shades, different shades and I’m sharp as a razor
That's why I had to brand it, you talkin' 'bout me?
You talkin' 'bout me? Listen to me
I know I got a lot of baggage
It's full of promises, that why I keep a lock on it
I promise girl I'm tryna make it happen, for me, and you babe
Now girl if you wanna pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart
Then I'll light it if you get lonely
If you call me, girl if you want me
I’m ready when you are, just tell me you want me
What you want babe?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
When I’m perfect for you, girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
And love's gon' turn you out baby
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Whoa! What you gonna do
When I’m perfect for you? Girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Yeah, and love’s gon' turn you out baby
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Yeah, girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy

Black, gray, white
If I pull down these shades, would I sound too bright?
Get it? Sound too right, maybe I’m just feeling myself cause
Flashing lights come from everywhere
And you can feel that something's blowing in the air tonight
Now if you need that fire, I'll be that propane
If you need it wet, I can make you pour rain 'til you say, "Stop"
But maybe I won't, heh, maybe you just have to take it
Go ahead, pretend I’m a drug, now let me see you shake it
I can read your mind, read your mind, Professor X
We can press rewind, press rewind, VHS
Speaking of the past, it's so futuristic behind ya
Let me fill up that plate and dish it out, dish it out, China
I'ma bend your body, bend your body, Magneto
Let me have my way, I'ma have my way, Carlito
Now we can put in work, let me get my busy on for you
You ain't never heard me talk like this, just got my Drizzy on for you
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
When I’m perfect for you, girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
And love's gon' turn you out baby
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Whoa! What you gonna do
When I’m perfect for you? Girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Yeah, and love’s gon' turn you out baby
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Yeah, girl watch out, it's gon' drive you crazy4Embed
