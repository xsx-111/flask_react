Private Entertainer Lyrics
My passion for money and women
Is everlastin ain't no limit to how much we spendin
Ain't it fantastic but my champion so high in the club (you see her)
I pay with plastic you not just a stripper my love
You my actress see the fire in your eyes
Mouth to mouth before I let this desire die
Bag of money just to relocate it to the sky
Like a condominium for c-notes to reside I think I'm feelin high

Oooh oh I'm looking for some private entertainment
And you look like an entertainer
Will you be my private entertainer

I'll touch you right
And let you read my body like you do
Do it just like that
Boy you get the party poppin know just how to get me loose

Stop, stop
Baby can I watch, watch
Wanna see ya drop, drop
Girl I gotta thang for ya
And I love your show, show
You just let me know, know
That you was a pro, pro
I can't let you go oh oh
I'm looking for some private entertainment
And you look like an entertainer
I'm looking for some, looking for some private entertainment
And you look like an entertainer
Will you be my private entertainer
And you look like an entertainer
So I guess what I'm sayin
Will you be my private entertainer

I see your hands
Every bit of my attention is on you
And you sexy thing
Let me know that all night long you feel me too

Stop, stop
Baby can I watch, watch
Wanna see ya drop, drop

You wish that I could do it till you tell me to stay stay
But the way that I'm movin you gon wish that I keep goin goin goin
