Yesterday Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus, shouldn't have been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust
Gave everything, you think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different, make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here tryna keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone, I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head, vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

Uh, give my all, you take it from me (From me, girl)
And don't even replace it for me (No)
I wish you'd just fake it for me (Fake it)
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I fucks with you, I needed you
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you
I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know you're missin' somethin', I wish I was what completed you
(Damn, da-da-damn, damn) Damn
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus, shouldn't have been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust
Gave everything, you think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different, make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here tryna keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone, I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head, vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

Uh, I feel like a killer hit me (Hit me)
The weapon was concealed initially (Oh, oh)
But I felt so much pain from it (Pain)
You deserved to feel it with me more
I feel like I beg with you, I plead with you
I don't comprehend how you can't love when it's so easy to
I thought you could do it, I believed in the naive in you (Oh, oh)
I just need to breathe, baby (Oh, no) now I got the freedom to
She's like a drug, yeah
And I don't think I can get rid of her (I can't get rid of her)
'Cause she got me in this curse (Yeah)
And then it dawned on me
I can't do nothing with her (Yeah, yeah)
This woman's worth (No, oh)
I can't find my way out and it hurts (Yeah)
I tried but she won't let me go (she won't let me go)
She wonâ€™t let me go (she won't let me go, oh)
She won't let me go
She won't let me go
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Woah, oh, yeah, yeah1Embed
