Yeah Yeah You Would LyricsLadies and gentlemen, yeah, I'm here to tell you that this is a brand new sound
This, this will change your lives
All you gotta do is turn your shit up, turn your shit up
(All you gotta do is turn your shit up, turn your shit up)
This what you want....
Is what you need, is what you need
Is what you get, is what you get
Is what you like, what you like
Could of been your everything, could of been your shooting star
Could of been you back bone... but now I'm too far away
You won't be there alone, my love wouldn't be over
We wouldn't be staring out the window, guessing which way the wind blows
You would be loving me, holding me, treating me better than before, yeah, yeah, yeah you would
You're just so damn selfish, jealous, you would be loving me, yeah you would, yeah, yeah, yeah you would
Yeah, come on, oh
Who was your number one?
Who had niggas at the altars wearing future gators and cummerbunds
Got my hand on my gun, as I'm sitting drinking and thinking I love you wish you'd of had my son
Got me losing my mind, all alone in my room, staring at your picture like I'm doing time
I know loving is hard, loving is hard, but the further you are away got me closer to God
Sex little bit later
If I was the only one, would I be your mistress?
But now I'm too far to play, too far play
Now you take the blame along, love won't be free to roam
We would be prisoners of the sheets
You would be loving me, holding me, treating me better, yeah, yeah, yeah you would
You're just so damn selfish, jealous, you would be loving me, yeah you would, yeah, yeah, yeah you would
Did you want it, would you love it, you can tell me you wouldn't be happy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah you would)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you wouldEmbed
