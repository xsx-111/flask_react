Ass on the Floor Lyrics
Right
Y'all already know what this is, man (Woo!)
Whoa!
It's that Dirty Money
It's that Dirty Money
OH!

When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (Oh!)
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When-When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
It's that Dirty Money
Them haters can’t tell you nothing
Them haters can’t tell me nothing
Them haters can’t tell you nothing
Oh!
It's that Dirty Money (Let's rock)
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
You know who it is
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (Oh yeah)
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (Yeah)
It's that Dirty Money, yeah
When-When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
Them haters can’t tell you nothing (Yeah)
Them haters can’t tell me nothing (Woo!)
Them haters can’t tell you nothing (Yeah)
No, no
You’re the love of my life
But you hurt my heart twice
Now I’m drunker than a motherfucker
Trying to find my way back to your heart, you motherfucker
So I know there’s a price
When you're running on ice
And you're drunker than a motherfucker
Trying to find your way back to the love, you motherfucker

Baby, you know
Babe, you know just what to do
You know, just what to do
I know you know the truth
I know you know the truth
And we will never lose
And we will never lose
There's no me if there's no you
There's no me without no you
I gave my soul to you

When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (In love)
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (Love me)
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (So high)
When-When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (So free)
I gave my soul to you
Them haters can’t tell you nothing (In love)
Them haters can’t tell me nothing (Love me)
Them haters can’t tell you nothing (So high)
No, no (So free)
And babe, you made me cry (Let's rock)
Don’t you hurt (C'mon)
Hurt my pride (Don't stop)
Got me madder than a motherfucker
Trying to fight my way back to your heart, you motherfucker
C'mon! Talk to 'em
See, you're aching my brain (Don't stop)
In your arms (Let's rock), I feel safe
Shit you know deep down, I'll always love ya
Trying to find your way back to my heart, you motherfucker

Baby you know
Babe you know just what to do
You know, just what to do
I know you know the truth
I know you know the truth
And we will never lose
And we will never lose
There's no me if there's no you
There's no me without no you
I gave my soul to you

When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (In love)
I gave my soul to you, baby
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (Love me)
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (So high)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When-When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor (So free)
Them haters can’t tell you nothing (In love)
(I gave you everything)
Them haters can’t tell me nothing (Love me)
Them haters can’t tell you nothing (So high)
No, no! (So free)
Yo, turn me up
I’ma make sure she can hear me

Yo, that love's gon' get ya, motherfucker
Smoke weed, listening to Sade
I left my pain in Paris
Why can’t you see shit my way?
You on that lonely highway
My car still on that driveway
Feels like I’m dying slowly
Feels like, "What more can I say?"
I made you face your fears
I think we could have made it
Thought I told you I love you
Maybe we should have waited
How could you ever doubt me?
When I stood by you proudly?
I would've gave my last breath
Now, you can’t breathe without me

Oh when you're in the club yeah (Don't save me)
All you think about is your baby (Don't save me)
Oh when you're in the club yeah (Don't save me)
All you think about is your baby (Don't save me)
Baby, I want you to need me
I need you to want me, I want you to love me forever
Baby, I want you, I need you to love me
I love you to need me and want me forever

When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
When-When you’re in the club, get your ass on the floor
Them haters can’t tell you nothing
Them haters can’t tell me nothing
Them haters can’t tell you nothing
No, no1Embed
