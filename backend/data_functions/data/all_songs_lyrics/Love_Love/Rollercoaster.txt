Rollercoaster LyricsYou know right about now, if you would .. someone special
Or you actually .. fucked up along, I want you to turn your lights off
Turn your shit up, can you feel me?
You see, I've had my heart broken a bunch of times
I've been on this rollercoaster, ride of love
And I ain't got no plans to get off
My stomach drops, you know that feeling that you get upon the ferris wheel
Or riding down the hill, or chasing dollar bills
You couldn't quit it or forget it will break your will
And if the earth stood still, that couldn't stop you from spinning around
The sky is moving but your body is pinned to the ground
She's like a rollercoaster, my heart just stopped you know the feeling that you get upon the telephone
When there's nobody home, you feel so all alone
You can admit it, but you didn't waited all night long
And if you sing a song it couldn't stop you from spinning around
The sky is moving but your body is pinned to the ground
It's like a rollercoaster
I toss and turn through out the night and through the day I couldn't shake it off
How could she break it off, I feel so weak and lost
I'm on my feet, I'm on my knees I'm going back and forth
I take it to the Lord, that couldn't stop me from spinning around
My heart was burning and my body is pinned to the ground
I can't believe it's over
I cried and cried all night but couldn't lift myself off above the bathroom door
How did i get this low? The pain is physical
My lungs collapse I couldn't breathe I couldn't let it go
The lump inside my throat, that couldn't stop me from screaming aloud
My head was spinning and my body was pinned to the ground
I can't believe it's over
I feel so, I feel so
And there's times when, the way she makes me feel something I never felt before
She makes me feel like I'm just ill
I feel so empty I'm so scared I need her back I want the world to know
I couldn't let her go, so I, I held a cab I took a plane, I hopped a train
I had to let her know, it's been so difficult
Now that I found her I'm spinning around
The sky is moving but my body is pinned to the ground, back on that rollercoasterEmbed
