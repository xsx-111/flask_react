Outbreak of Love LyricsThe world is crashing down on me tonight
The world is crashing down on me tonight
The walls are closing in on me tonight
The walls are closing in on me tonight
Cos I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak of love
Cos I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak of love
Yes I know
The sky comes falling down on me tonight
The sky comes falling down on me tonight
Cos I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak of love
Cos I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak of love
Yes I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak
Outbreak of love
Outbreak of love
Sharks are coming up to feed
I believe it's time to move
Diver's coming up to breathe
But I'm not in the mood
I'm not in the mood
Cos I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak of love
Cos I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak of love
Yes I know this is the end of the beginning of the outbreak
Outbreak of love
Outbreak of love
Outbreak of loveEmbed
