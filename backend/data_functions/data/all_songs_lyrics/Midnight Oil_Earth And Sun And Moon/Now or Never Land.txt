Now or Never Land LyricsI grew tall in this lucky land
And I thank God for that, but there's needles in the sand
Ozone in the eucalypt and on the Steppes tonight
There's pushing and a shoving on the throne tonight
It's a rhythm of the sea
Lost islands of hope
It's a rhythm of the sea
Who will discover you
But I won't be down at heel cos my senses lead me here
Dream a South-Pacific dream of now or never land
It's now or never land
Rises in rivers in power of the sun
Rises in sea level, look out Mammon's bastard son
Infidels are praying at the stock exchange
Chrome camels are crashing on the smooth terrain
It's the rhythm of the sea
Lost islands of hope
It's the rhythm of the sea
Someone to carry you
But I won't be down at heel cos my senses lead me here
Dream a South-Pacific dream of now or never land
Suitcase full of good ideas, history that's filled with tears
Kill nostalgia, xenophobic fears
It's now or never land
Chant to end
