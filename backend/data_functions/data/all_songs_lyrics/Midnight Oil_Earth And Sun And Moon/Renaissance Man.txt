Renaissance Man LyricsWell I told you about the forest and trees and the chlorophyll green
Yes I told you the birds will endure flutter wings dance on leaves
Hold onto dreams, hold onto dreams tonight
Well I told you about the high pressure cell coming down on the breeze
And I know that the things you can't see they are hard to believe
Hold onto dreams, hold onto dreams tonight
A new world order has been formed
Between the cheque book and the dawn
A new renaissance man is born
Renaissance man are you ready
Renaissance man
Renaissance man are you ready
See what a world that you can make
Well I heard about the spirit of life is it flickering still
Yes I heard that the dark bellied angel's come running up the hill
Hold onto dreams, hold onto dreams tonight
Smash and grab the women and child
All the souls are growing wild
Stripped so bare well the universe stares
It's so close to home that we got to share with you
So many genuine things surround you
Wild weather man well it still confounds you
Cast away the greed and death machine and bytes
And abacus and lights and hold onto your dreams tonight
So you found a hard won friend
To hold your hand and hold your head
A new renaissance to defend
Hold onto dreams, hold onto dreams tonight
Where are we going to be, in 3033
What's spinning round your brain
Are you a renaissance man or are you a renaissance woman
If you jump out an angel will give you wings
