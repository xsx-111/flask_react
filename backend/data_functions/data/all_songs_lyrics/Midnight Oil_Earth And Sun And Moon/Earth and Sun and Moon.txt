Earth and Sun and Moon LyricsIn the morning we will wake up and take to the air
Look back at the planet - I'm glued to my chair
Southern half is burning as we climb through the sky
Sea birds softly falling, smoke way up high
There's the contours of the mountains, the deserts and plains
And a hurricane is blowing, and it turns once again
Now there's oil spills in the water where Columbus once sailed
And there's history and mystery and it's rolling away
I wish you could see this great mystery
Earth and sun and moon, human tribe, thin blue line
Earth and sun and moon will survive
Sediment is flowing from river to sea
Now where are the mighty nations, no lines to be seen
An axe upon the broken ground the sigh of the trees
And it's floating in the ether, it brings me to my knees
Too messed up to care
Anyone got a wing and a prayer
In the blink of an eye
Thank you and goodnight
Earth and sun and moon, human tribe, one thin blue line
Earth and sun and moon will survive, will survive, we will survive
