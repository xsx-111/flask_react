Feeding Frenzy LyricsWell I'm as old as the hills
And young as the day
Nobody sees things, in quite the same way
Computers and shovels, churches and brothels
Mannequins and skeletons, cities and dustbowls
Here we go here we go again
Hear the clamour of the feeding pen
New day new way all my friends can say
Cyclone fences in the cybernetic orchard
Miracle drugs, discount bulk purchase
Sacred in the forest, fast food in the kiosk
Cardboard dinners and the saints and the sinners
I don't want to run and hide
I've seen it all from either side
Truth and fiction must collide someday
God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun
Ah, sweet sensation, the oldest temptation
Now throughout the ages, we've been a' turning all those pages
Now each generation you've got to choose a new location
Got to reach out, got to sync up, build up, get up, to a stronger foundation
God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun
