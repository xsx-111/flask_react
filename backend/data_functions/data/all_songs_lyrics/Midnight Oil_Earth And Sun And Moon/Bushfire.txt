Bushfire LyricsIn my shoes, in my shoes
There is so much to remind me
As the stars come out above me, home
Cool wind, clear my head
Bright sun grow my food
Strong rain clear my heart
Fill my land
It's a new day
I don't know why it is sold
Don't know why it's so cold
In this life that we live
New day, new day, new day
In my shoes, in my shoes
There is so much to astound me
As the whirlpool spins around me, home
Bushfire, burn and grow
Sunset watch and rest low
Long night holding child close, feed my dream
It's a new day
I don't know why it is sold
Don't know why it's so cold
In this life that we live
New day new day new day
It's larger than life, it's darker than death
We're gonna move those mountains aside
Here come the messages
