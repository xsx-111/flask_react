One Foot In The Grave Lyrics
There's s dead hobo on the patio
And an old barbed wire on the funeral fire
Well, you roll out the carpet and it better be red
And it better be long cos the troubles in my head
Gonna be living one foot in the grave
Well, i was sitting at home cooking up a steak
Satan came down dressed like a snake
Well, he called my name as i turned up the flames
And then i realized i was out of mayonnaise
Well, you been living one foot in the grave
Yeah, don't go throwing no coupons on my grave
Don't go carving no happy face on my tombstone2Embed
