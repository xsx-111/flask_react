Mattress LyricsPut those sunglasses on your hips
Mayonaisse on your lips
Pass me a bag of potato chips
When I wanna put my money on a monkey
Give it to me, don't give it to me
Give it to me, don't give it to me
Your idea, maybe I'll see ya
Maybe I will, maybe I won't
Give me a cold sore when you're young
Get old fast when you sag in the sun
Put a coffin lid on everyone
So you can be depressed
Give it to me, don't give it to me
Give it to me, don't give it to me
Your idea, maybe I'll see ya
Maybe I will, maybe I won't
Your love
Your kindness
Your body on the mattress
She's got braids and broken arms
Top Ramen cooking in the burning barns
Talking at me like car alarms
When all the cars got stolen
Give it to me, don't give it to me
Give it to me, don't give it to me
Your idea, maybe I'll see ya
Maybe I will, maybe I won't
Take me out to dinner
I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm a sucker, I'm a sinner
Won't you take me out to dinner?
Take me out to dinner
I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm a sucker, I'm a sinner
Won't you take me out to dinner?
Your love
Your kindness
Your body on the mattressEmbed
