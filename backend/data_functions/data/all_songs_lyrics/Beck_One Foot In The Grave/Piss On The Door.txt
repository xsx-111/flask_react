Piss On The Door LyricsEverything's ugly, kissing my honey
Pickles and pie, can't wait to die
Reach up around, sick as a town
Donuts and tea, don't talk to me
Self-right chicken, Mojo Nixon
Thick as a stick and burning crap
Running all down in the burning crap
You said it before, you kids are so poor
Grow up frozen and piss on the door
Grow up frozen and piss on the door
Out on the highway, I'm doing it my way
Who wants to show, everybody says Go
Rockin' the lands, recyclin' cans
We get the head, choking on lead
Brothers and sisters, bloodthirsty blisters
Skeleton pride, she cooks my mind
Skeleton baby, she pokes my hide
Sexy death soda, wait till your older
Can't get enough of tomorrow today
Can't get enough of tomorrow today
Woo Hoo
Robot chicken, Mojo Nixon
Can't get your stick in the burning crap
Said it before, the kids are so poor
Grow up frozen and piss on the door
Grow up frozen and piss on the doorEmbed
