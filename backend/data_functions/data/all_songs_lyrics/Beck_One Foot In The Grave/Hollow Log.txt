Hollow Log Lyrics
Go where you want to
Do the things you feel
Walk around with a broken leg
And a hundred-dollar bill
Get yourself a pistol
Get yourself a dog
Stay up all night getting drunk
Sleeping on a hollow log
Walk until you're restless
Sleep until you're tired
Wake up without thinking
You're the one that I desired1Embed
