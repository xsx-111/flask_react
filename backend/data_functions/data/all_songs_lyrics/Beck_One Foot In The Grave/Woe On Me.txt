Woe On Me LyricsOn the old forgotten crossways where the fourteen rivers did meet
The bones of our elders were lying in the street
On the dark and dusty deserts, like a ghost, I've flown
I barely cried, wherever I'd ride I'd never find a home
Woe on me
Somehow I will feel more free
To wallow in the empty-headed peace
Where the plain-hearted sorrows never cease
Well I am just a ramshackle, I go from town to town
When there is no shelter, I lay down on the ground
I killed for no reason, I pissed upon the vine
Cussed and moaned and burned the bone when I had the time
Woe on me
Somehow I will feel more free
To wallow in the empty-headed peace
Where the plain-hearted sorrows never cease
There's saints and there is animals, they've taken what they could
And it's written in the pages to do just what they should
They stood the test and burned the rest and tore them limb from limb
Like the fashion with no passion, they opened up their skin
Woe on me
Somehow I will feel more free
To wallow in the empty-headed peace
Where the plain-hearted sorrows never ceaseEmbed
