Outcome Lyrics
Seventeen years in the city
Static clinging to the ceiling

Never did I think it would come to this
(Outcome is different than I expected)
Never did I think it would come to this
(Outcome is different than I expected)

Bright cops and cheerleaders
Eyebrows painted on their heads
A mouthful of rotting cavities
Drinking Coca-Cola in the street

Never did I think it would come to this
(Outcome is different than I expected)
Never did I think it would come to this
(Outcome is different than I expected)

Shot in the leg 
My leg is a bone
Nobody home
My hand is a wire
The skies are fire
The drums are beating
Pistols and jeans
Left for dead 
Dead as a flyEmbed
