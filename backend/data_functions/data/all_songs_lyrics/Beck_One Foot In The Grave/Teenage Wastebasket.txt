Teenage Wastebasket LyricsShe is a teenage wastebasket
Paddling up the river in a casket
Trying to experience everything at least once
Life is a commercial for being fucked up
I know she's not saying much
She's walking backwards and into the dust
Socks don't matter, teeth are turning green
Opinions are forming
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Her mother is proud to be dead
Her dad is breakdancing underneath the bed
She's got lipstick scrawled across her forehead
Saying "Please Destroy Me"
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
She found the thrill on top of the hill
Now she's choking on the punk rock pill
'Cause it all boils down
To a casually pathetic future
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah ooh wa ooh, ah ooh wa ooh
Ah oohEmbed
