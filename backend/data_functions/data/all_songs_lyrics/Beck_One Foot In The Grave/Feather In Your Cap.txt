Feather In Your Cap Lyrics
Make a move with what you can
Dead waters rise higher than your mind
Disappointment is a feather in your cap
You want the truth so you can crush it in your hand

There's no map
That could tell you where you are
You're in between things that only go halfway
Your tangled brain
Your tired old refrain
You'll be singing it in your tired old  asylum


You want the best
You want contests
My eyes are filled with prizes you've been showing
Disappointment is the card up your sleeve
Place your bets at the door before you leave
