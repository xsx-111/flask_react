Your Love Is Weird LyricsThe sun is down when I'm around
In this town, I wear the frown
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird
I feel the strain, I use a cane
To walk the lane of wonderful pain
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird
I live in fear, I have no beer
I live in jails and everything fails
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird
I have no cash, I have no stash
I keep the trash and clean it for you
'Cause your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weird
Your love is weird, your love is weirdEmbed
