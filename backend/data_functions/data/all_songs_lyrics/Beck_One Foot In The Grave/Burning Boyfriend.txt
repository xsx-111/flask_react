Burning Boyfriend LyricsHe's your slime and he's out to break me
I can feel him in the distance
I have grown to see that you are better than yourself
You're more real than you pretend to be
He is guilty, he will pay
He will burn in every way
He will taste the hell I bring
He will change his mind about youEmbed
