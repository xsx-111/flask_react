Atmospheric Conditions Lyrics 
There's no body
There's no mountain
There's no tunnel
You can't get from there to here
You can't get from here to there

There hasn't been a change in the atmosphere
There hasn't been a change for over a year
There hasn't been a change in the atmosphere
Pull the tap
Just a tad
(Gypsy haircut)
There's no atmosphere
(A bear skin rug, the tambourines)
Dig a tunnel through the mountain
(Black piano on the mountain)
How many Atmospheres are out there?
(There's a broken bottle...in the tunnel)
There's a tunnel from here to there
Cut your hand on the Atmosphere
Split in two
Band-aids on your hand
Split the atmosphere
Split in two
Staring at youEmbed
