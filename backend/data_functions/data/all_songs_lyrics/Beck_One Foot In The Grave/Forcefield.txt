Forcefield Lyrics
Forcefield
There's a force field
(Stand outside with the suitcase)
Around my neck
And it stands just where I've sat
(Walk around all the while)
And the stance I took on that
(Look at the people driving that backwards)
Leaves that forcefield
(with no particular style)
Around My neck

Don't let it get near you
Don't let it get too close
(And the stance I took on that)
Don't let it turn you into
(Leaves a forcefield around my neck)
The things you hate the most

Roll out your silver dollar coffins
Roll out your buckskin gloves
Tell them anything they want to
And sound comes from above
 
Don't let it get near you
Don't let it get too close
(And the stance I took on that)
Don't let it turn you into
(Leaves a forcefield around my neck)
The things you hate the most
 
There's a forcefield around my neck
And it stands just where I've sat
And the stance I took on that
Leaves a forcefield around my neckEmbed
