Asshole Lyrics
Your brains went black
When she took back her love
And put it out into the sun
The birds did fly
When the heavens all went dry
And the cigarettes were smoking by themselves

She'll do anything
She'll do anything
She'll do anything
To make you feel like an asshole

Call her name, she looks the same as you
Question marks stretched across her skin
She dangles carrots
Makes you feel embarrassed
To be the fool you know you are

She'll do anything
She'll do anything
She'll do anything
To make you feel like an asshole1Embed
