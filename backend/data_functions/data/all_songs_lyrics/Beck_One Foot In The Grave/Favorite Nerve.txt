Favorite Nerve LyricsPull the car over
Throw out your clothes
The smell is disgusting
Where does it go?
Tear down the houses
The ones that aren't there
Tear down the houses
Pull the car over
(Rise you up) Tell me your story
(Make it all up) I'll be the judge
(Rise you up) Tell me your story
(Make it all up) I'll be the judge
Come for a visit
Come for a stay
I won't annoy you
I won't complain
You can be crazy
Tear up all my things
Cut up the kitchens
Wear all my rings
Tell me your story (make it all up)
I'll be the judgeEmbed
