Burnt Orange Peel Lyrics
I'm on the run with things to be
I've got a garden hose and a color TV
I've got time on my hands 
Nobody cares what I do
I'm on the run with things to do
I've got a burnt orange peel
And a potato stew
I've got work to get done 
Nobody knows where to run
I've got a quart of milk
And some sound advice
I've got trees that are fake
But they smell so nice
Don't give me the flu
Nobody knows I'm with you
Back and forth I dodge a fly
Like a feather in the sky
Write me out a check
Give me all your cash
Nobody knows so let's just go homeEmbed
