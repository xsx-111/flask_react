See Water Lyrics
Close your eyes and see water
Sliding up the back of your head
Folding into your clothing
Covering everything you said

Climb up into
No one's going to miss you

Dry up on the shoreline
Drinking everything you said
Offering food to the ladies
Bowing down in the mossened trees

Climb up into
No one's going to miss youEmbed
