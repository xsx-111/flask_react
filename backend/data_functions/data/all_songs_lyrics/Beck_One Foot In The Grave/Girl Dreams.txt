Girl Dreams Lyrics 
You're just the girl of my dreams
But it seems my dreams never come true

I first met you down on lover's lane
The birds were insane
Flapping all about
Softly you would sing
Swinging in your swing
It wasn't night, it wasn't day
 
You're just the girl of my dreams
But it seems my dreams never come trueEmbed
