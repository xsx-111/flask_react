Unguarded Minute LyricsMaybe I speak too soon
Maybe I play too hard
And I listen to major worries
In a minor way
You sent your message to me
You made a move that I'd understand
When you moved from a ticket in line
To a room in L.A
There was a time split second
I could have said please
Fool around and my guard was down
By a few degrees
An unguarded minute (Watch out)
Has an accident in it (Oh)
An unguarded minute (Watch out)
Has an accident in it (Oh)
I guess I should have tried a little bit
Yeah, I could have changed
I could be anything that you want
But it wouldn't be me
Do anything that you say
Use any thought to armor the way
So do you love the man that I am
Or what you want me to be?
I wanna hold you now
But I can let you go
So anytime you can do better
Just let me know
An unguarded minute (Watch out)
Has an accident in it (Oh)
An unguarded minute (Watch out)
Has an accident in it (Oh)
(Unguarded minute)
I wanna hold you tight
(Accident in it)
Oh
(Unguarded minute)
I wanna hold you tight
(Accident in it)
Has an accident in it
I wanna hold you now
But I can't let you go
So anytime that you can do better
Just let me know
An unguarded minute (Watch out)
Has an accident in it (Oh)
An unguarded minute (Watch out)
Has an accident in it (Oh)
I wanna hold you tight (Watch out)
Please let me hold you tight (Oh)
I wanna hold you tight (Watch out)
Please let me hold you tight
You can do better than me (Watch out)
Why don't you try it? (Unguarded minute)
You can do better than me (Unguarded minute)
You better buy it (Unguarded minute)
Oh, an unguarded minute
Has an accident in it (Oh)Embed
