Looking For A Good Sign LyricsFor days & days go up & go down
Looking for a sign from you
What you want where you goin
What you thinking about
A lot of good it will do
Why are you fighting me
Why are you teasing me
Why are you wearing me
If youre not at ease with me
Im lookin for a good sign
I know that it might be a waste of my time
Im always lookin for a good sign
Ive gotta keep on tryin
Beware of the curves, always signal your turns
Soft shoulders slow you down, you know
There are signs to explain all conditions on the way
Theres where to stop & which way to go
Why are you fighting me
Why are you teasing me
Why are you wearing me
If youre not at ease with me
Im lookin for a good sign
I know that it might be a waste of my time
Im always lookin for a good sign
Ive gotta keep on tryin
Well its so hard to say if theres a better way
Should we have signed off before
Ive got a lot in my heart
Theres a light in your eyes
Dont you think that there could be some moreEmbed
