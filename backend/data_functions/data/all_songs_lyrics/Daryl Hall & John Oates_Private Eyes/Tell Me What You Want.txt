Tell Me What You Want Lyrics
When I look in your eyes
I can see there's more than passion there
Something ugly and lovely
Is tuning in just behind your stare
Yeah, I've seen it before
And I think that I'd know it anywhere

So tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
So tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
You gotta tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

Grin and bare it
No no, I like what you're wearing
You gotta leave it on all night
As above so below so they say
So can we do the Magick  right
Kiss and tell, when I know you so well
There's no need to be polite
That's right
Tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
You gotta tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
Oh, tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

Take a position 'cause you know
I'm gonna listen to you
Tell me
Ain't no conditions
No there isn't, baby
You don't have to sell me
'Cause I love you, love you, love you, love you
And I want you tonight, that's right

Tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
You gotta tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
Please, tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
So tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
You gotta tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
Oh, tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
So tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
You gotta tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
Oh, tell me girl what you want
I know, you know
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What you wantEmbed
