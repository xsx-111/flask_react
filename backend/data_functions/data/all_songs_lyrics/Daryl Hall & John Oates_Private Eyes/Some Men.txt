Some Men LyricsSome men call half way around the world
If they've got a phone game to play
Then again some men (Some men)
Call their mom every day
Old boys drink bad beer
And throw the cans out in the street
Playboys sit and sip red wine
Some drink malt whiskey neat
So if you can (If you can, if you can)
You talk about some men (Some men)
Baby, if you can (If you can, if you can)
You can talk about some men (Some men)
Honey, if you can (If you can, if you can)
You can talk about some men (Some men)
Baby, if you can (If you can, if you can)
You can talk about some men (Some men)
Colonels collect animal heads
And hang their guns up on the wall (on the wall)
Corn balls watch television
Then pull a gun out in the hall
Crew-cut rainbows hang on streets
Hoping they'll find a friend
Odd balls running fast enough
They hope that they won't find their end
So if you can (If you can, if you can)
You talk about some men (Some men)
Honey, if you can (If you can, if you can)
You can talk about some men (Some men)
Baby, if you can (If you can, if you can)
You can talk about some men (Some men)
If you can (If you can, if you can)
You can talk about some men (Some men)
Oh yeah
Sleep all night, work all day
Work all night, sleep all day (all day or all night)
Drink all night, sick all day
Sick all night, drink all day (all day or all night)
Some men, if you can
We ain't soldiers (If you can, if you can)
So don't you generalize (Some men)
No categories (If you can, if you can)
Because it takes all kinds (Some men)
You can sleep all night (If you can, if you can)
You can work all day (Some men)
You can trip all night (If you can, if you can)
Trip all day (Some men)
If you can (If you can, if you can)
You can talk about some men (Some men)Embed
