Head Above Water Lyrics
Oceans emotions yeah we all feel the same
Afraid of undertow and great tidal wave
I may go under many hundreds of times
I keep on kickin', baby throw me a line

C.C. Sick, the Mal de Mer
Try, try, try, I'm holding on, holding my

Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water

No never envy the big fish in the pond
It's deep and dark when all the surface is gone
My kinda humor kinda keeping me dry
On the horizon, water touches the sky

C.C. Sick, the Mal de Mer
Try, try, try, try, try, I'm holding my
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Oh yeah


I better keep my

Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
It's so hard to keep my head above water
Head Above Water
I can't keep my, I can't keep my
Head Above Water
Head Above Water
It's so hard, it's so hard, it's so hard, it's so hard, it's so hard (Head Above Water)
Yeah
Head Above Water
Try, try, try, try, try to keep my, keep my, keep my, keep my (Head Above Water)
Ohh, it's so hard, it's so hard, it's so hard (Head Above Water)
Head Above Water (Ahh)
I can't keep my, keep, keep my Head above
Head Above Water
It's so hard, it's so hard, it's so hard (Head Above Water)
Head Above Water
Head above water, it's so hard
To keep my, keep my
Head Above WaterEmbed
