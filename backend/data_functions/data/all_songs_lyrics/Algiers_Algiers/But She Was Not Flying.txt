But She Was Not Flying Lyrics
(I'm going home to see the king)
(He's gonna take my pain away)
(I'm gonna see my friends again)
(If only I can make it in)

But there's a lizard with a human face
He says he's standing for democracy
And every wealthy man has earned his place
As did the undeserving in their poverty
He told my brother that he wasn't a man
He broke my sister down again and again
His fathers stole and wrote the laws of the land
And now he flips the coin of power with all of his friends
Deciding who is fit to go out and die
And who is black enough to be left behind
And who will model their exceptional lie
And just how many they can murder at the borderline

I knew a woman with a scale in her hand
They bound and gagged her with the lies of the land
She couldn't tell what she was measuring
So they tilt the scale to meet their own personal ends
Saying, "I'll shoot your son if he's out of line"
"I'll rape your daughters underground where I hide"
"And I can murder anytime that I like
Cause I'm protected at my left and my right"
"I got a side that says I'm only a man
Another side that puts the gun in my hand"
"I'll trade your product of environment
For any alibi for consequence"
