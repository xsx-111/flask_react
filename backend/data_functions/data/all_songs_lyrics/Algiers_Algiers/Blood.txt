Blood Lyrics
For all your love of soma
All my blood's in vain
You say your history's over
All of my blood's in vain
Your television coma
All my blood's in vain
It's gone too far to change
All of my blood's in vain

Flash across your screen
They got you in their hand
Fifteen minutes of freedom
Still 3/5 a man
Sterilize your conscience and
Disgrace your name
A healthy simulation
All my blood's in vain

For all your love of soma
All my blood's in vain
You say your history's over
All my blood's in vain
Your television coma
All my blood's in vain
It's gone too far to change
All of my blood's in vain
Liquor stains your table
Women change your bed
You rise on Sunday morning
Just like the living dead
Your Hell is fornication
Your Heaven is the same
But master is complacent
So all my blood's in vain

For all your love of soma
All my blood's in vain
You say your history's over
All my blood's in vain
Your television coma
All my blood's in vain
It's gone too far to change
All of my blood's in vain

Four hundred years of torture
Four hundred years a slave
Dead just to watch you squander
Just what we tried to save
Now death is at your doorstep
And you're still playing games
So drown in entertainment
Cause all our blood is in vain2Embed
