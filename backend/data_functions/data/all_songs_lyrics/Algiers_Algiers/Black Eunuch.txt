Black Eunuch Lyrics
We are all walking in the dark
With the scissors in our hand
We are there when you fall apart
When there's no one in your bed
We are all walking in the dark
With the scissors in our hand
We are there when you fall apart
When there's no one in your bed

She said "Please keep your smile away
So we can still be friends"
I'm standing single file
While sex melts in my hand
Desiring other things
That other eyes in other rooms desire
They pay her with their diamond rings
Then she has me wait outside
Then they come crawling out

So, how dare you smile so sweet?
(We are all walking in the dark
With scissors in our hands)
And how dare you speak so soft?
(We are here when you fall apart
When there's no one in your bed)
No, don't try to undress me
No, nobody else at all
Nobody else at all
Nobody else at all
Nobody else at all, hey
