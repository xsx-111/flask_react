Games Lyrics
We bury ourselves in our bottles
Bury ourselves in our bibles
And you come around
Saying how Rome is burning
Why do you come around?

It's all just a game
Til he walks through the door
Holding Death in his hand
Then he lets it unfold
Yesterday it happened again
Or was it the day before?
I can't be sure...
No, cause I can't
Keep up with this shit anymore

Cause we bury ourselves in our bottles
Bury ourselves in our bibles
Then you come around
Saying my house is burning
Why do you come around?

When it's all just a game
Save for your license to kill
Said, it's all just a game
And I'll be your favorite thrill, yeah
But I played myself
Too many times this year
Yes, I played myself
Too many times this year
Say now
Cause we bury ourselves in our bottles
Bury ourselves in our bibles
Then you come around
Setting my house on fire
Why do you come around?
