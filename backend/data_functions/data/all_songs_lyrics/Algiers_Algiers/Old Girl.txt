Old Girl Lyrics
(Oh Lord, what the devil sees in them)
(Oh Lord, what the devil sees)
(Oh Lord, what the devil sees in them)
(Oh Lord, what the devil sees)
(Oh Lord, what the devil sees in them)
(Oh Lord, what the devil sees)
(Down, down, down, down)

Old girl, old girl
I know you're rabid with disease
And your eyes say that you're lying
So I don't care where you sleep

Old girl, little girl
I know you get close with your friends
And every time I see you lying
I can feel you lying within

The dark can only hide you for so long
He's going to find you where you sleep
And he's going to make you wish for dawn
Old girl, little girl
You know your age don't mean a thing
When all the years pile on like cancer
Just like the way you grew on me

Old girl, old girl
Don't want to see your face again
Just like I know what was the beginning
But now I know just how it ends

The dark can only hide you for so long
He's going to find you where you sleep
And he's going to make you wish for dawn

Old girl, old girl
Already dead before your time
Just like you took your life for granted
And then you sell your diamond skies
You better get your house in order
You better get your mind right
The darkest hour's coming
And then we'll be all out of time
The dark can only hide you for so long
He's going to find you where you sleep
And he's going to make you wish for dawn

Keep me waiting
Keep me still
Sprawled and pinned beneath your
Beneath your heel
Minutes clangor
Battle cries
Brittle conscience
Empty eyes
Killing slow the empty parts
Watching worlds fall apart
Misconstrue our precious time
Keep me watching falling skies
Keep me in the box you hide
Underneath your bed at night
No more siren
Cast her down
Seven circles
Further downEmbed
