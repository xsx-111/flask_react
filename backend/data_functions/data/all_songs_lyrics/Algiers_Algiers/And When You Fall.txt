And When You Fall Lyrics
You stripped the message, yeah, you changed the frame
Washed it in white and stole our name
Tried to slip away through the back door
Did you pull it off? No, you can't be sure
Cause confusion, hide behind
Misdirection, lies implied
Tried to empty out the cultural ties
Then you fill it with your signifiers
So walk on down your ragged mile
Cause we won't be too far behind

And when you fall
You're gonna want to know who
Who it really was
Who took you down
And when you fall
We'll be there waiting for you
No there's no exit
You can't turn around

When you got it, you forgot it
It was never yours
You won't know how, but when it falls down
You'll know exactly who we are
While you're spending yourself
We're saving
While you're playing yourself
We're planning
While you're folding your hand
We're holding
Where you're ending yourself
We begin
While you're sleeping on us
We're stalking
When you jump at the gun
We stand still
(We're still standing)

And when you fall
You're gonna want to know who
Who it really was
Who took you down
And when you fall
We'll be there waiting for you
There's no exit
You can't turn around

When you got it, you forgot it
It was never yours
You won't know how, but when it falls down
You'll know exactly who we are2Embed
