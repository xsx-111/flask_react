In Parallax Lyrics
He's my Master
He's my friend
He's my spirit and my conscience
He's my Master and
He won't be here when you think
No

It's been five months now
And still no sign of peace
People wear the signs all over
But still don't know the meaning
The serpent sings in lamb's wool
He says he's come back for his people
He says he's gonna fly them away
Forever in a dream
Two woes have uttered down
And there's one more to come
And this abomination
Is their kingdom come

But not one's got the seal and
I know that not a one is saved
By he who takes the first one
But by He who's coming later
(He's my Master)
(He's my friend)
(He's my spirit and my conscience)
(He's my Master and)
(He won't be here when you think)
(No)

The sixth seal was broken
The sixth vial and then the trump
He said "All you do is follow me
And I'll give you what you want"
But they've been taken out of season
And now they're pregnant with his seed
This is the Great Falling Away
They've been infected and deceived
I can still hear old Moses a'calling
Mourning all the lost
Yeah, they killed both him and
Elijah just about three days ago

But not one's got the seal and
I know that not a one is saved
By he who takes the first one
But by He who's coming later
He's my Master (He's my Master)
He's my friend (He's my friend)
He's my spirit (He's my spirit)
And my conscience (And my conscience)
He's my Master (He's my Master)
And he won't (And he won't)
Be here when you think (Be here when you think)
No
