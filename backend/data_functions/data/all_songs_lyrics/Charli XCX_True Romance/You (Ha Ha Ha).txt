You (Ha Ha Ha) Lyrics
Yeah, we got a situation
Lock down, and I'm trapped in the basement
I'm a victim of replacement
'Cause you acting so leather
Trying to put across your statement, oh

'Cause I know you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied
Ha ha ha ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

'Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blue print
But we threw it in the flame
And now we're never gonna trace it, oh
'Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blue print
But we threw it in the flame
And now we're never gonna trace it, oh
'Cause I know you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied
Ha-ha-ha-ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

And now you're walking on your own
Rain falls down, I'm not answering my phone
I got to phase you out my zone
Hope you realize now that I am never coming home
You were meant to be alone

You, you lied
Ha-ha-ha-ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up
It's a front, good job
Good job, you fucked it up
