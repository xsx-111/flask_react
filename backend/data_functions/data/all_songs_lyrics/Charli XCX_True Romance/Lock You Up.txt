Lock You Up Lyrics
It’s a long way home, but I’m making my way
With so many things still left to say
I try to think about the one I need the most
When my mind goes black
And then it hits me like a ton of bricks
I want you, no, nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

I always wanted you
But sometimes it’s hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart

Nothing says tomorrow is a guarantee
There’s no way of knowing that you’ll be with me
As I walk upon the edge of no escape in a world so flat
And then it hits me like a bolt of faith
I love you, not-nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

I always wanted you
But sometimes it’s hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up
We won’t stay, we run
Love like melting sun
Please don’t leave, don’t run
Won’t you stay in tonight?
Taste my lips, don’t let go
I’m in your hand
I’m in your hand
I’m in your hand

I always wanted you
But sometimes it’s hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up
I want to lock you up inside my heart1Embed
