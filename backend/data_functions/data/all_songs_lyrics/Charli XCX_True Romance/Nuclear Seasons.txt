Nuclear Seasons Lyrics
Let my car run out
Cars burn out
I won't scream or shout
Lost my breath now
Let's die together, no one lives forever
(Cars burn out)
Let's die together, no one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
No one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
('Cause I feel like I'm in heaven, dancing)
No one lives forever

When you go, please don't leave your love in the sun
My heart will melt away
In the night, with your twisted tongue
When you drop the bomb, I'm blown away

'Cause I refuse to hide in the page of your story
I come out the box, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone
Now I'm facing this on my own
'Cause you taste the blast and it shook your bones
I'm a warrior all alone
In the field of lies, I won't go home

‘Cause I didn’t burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I come out your hands, I won’t say I’m sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

We survived nuclear seasons
We survived nuclear seasons

I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it, inside of my soul
Inside of the soul

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)16Embed
