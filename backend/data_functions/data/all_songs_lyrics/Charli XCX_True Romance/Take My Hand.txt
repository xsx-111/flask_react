Take My Hand Lyrics
Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away, lost in the dark
Get real high and never come down
Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away, lost in the dark
Get real high and never come down

C'mon baby, put your hands on my hips
Then swing your lips to my lips
Wanna taste your heart, don't interfere
Into the night, we'll disappear

Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
(Let's dance!)
Won't you please just take my hand?
Can you feel the neon lights?
It's like the milky way
I swallowed something stupid, it's making me stay awake
And now I'm on the cloud
I'm talking extra loud
I keep on dancing
Gonna lose my body in the crowd

Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away, lost in the dark
Get real high and never come down

Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
(Let's dance!)
Won't you please just take my hand?

C'mon baby, put your hands on my hips
Then swing your lips to my lips
Wanna taste your heart, don't interfere
Into the night, we'll disappear
C'mon baby, put your hands on my hips
Then swing your lips to my lips
Wanna taste your heart, don't interfere
Into the night, we'll disappear
Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
(Let's dance!)
Won't you please just take my hand?

(Let's dance!)
Won't you please just take my hand?
(Let's dance!)
Won't you please just take my hand?
(I'm in your hand)
(I'm in your hand)3Embed
