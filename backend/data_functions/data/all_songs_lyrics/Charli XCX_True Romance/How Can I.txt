How Can I Lyrics
My hands are frozen into chains behind my back
So please, don’t swallow down the key
Let me out now
Yeah, I’m in trouble
Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t blame this one on bad luck

How can I? How can I?

How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

Iced out, got hot, bit the dust hardcore
But I’m at the same place I was before
Yeah, I’m in trouble
Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t blame this one on bad love

How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

It was boys and girls, and girls, and boys
The Southern Comfort from your comforter got destroyed
It was shady eyes with the violent noise
We on the graveyard digging where the love is void
We had a meltdown underground
Just a cemetery chick, but it's over now
But I still taste your bones when I’m all alone
You’re the best I ever had, but now you’ve got to go
And now I’m on my own
I said, “Please don’t go.”
Please don’t go

How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
I miss your touch and my skin on yours
I want a taste of what I adore
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?2Embed
