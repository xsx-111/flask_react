Black Roses Lyrics
Purple and scarred
It's the color that will be on my heart, my heart, my heart
When you are done and dusted with me
I fall apart when I wash your touches off of my skin, my skin, my skin
I know you're tired of sticking to me

Why am I deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses

You've got a diamond desire
Gonna step into the blue fire
Touching your lips with my skin
I'm on another level
I can't let go
Sat in the garden of sin, like an angel with the dirty wings
Tainted by tastes of the soul, this is another level
I need to know

Why am I deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
You're turning me off
Out of phase and into focus you keep turning me on
You're turning me on, you're turning me off

Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, black roses

Deep in black roses
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses, black roses4Embed
