Stay Away Lyrics
You choke my throat with words of wonder
You make it hard to breathe
Your love's so cold, just like an arrow
Pierced through my skin, I bleed

I knew you were no angel
But God, what did I do?

Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison
On my hands, on my knees, pulled on the chains
Licking up the blood, yeah, I made this decision

You took my light
Trapped in the prison
You threw away the key
You are the curse, I am the captive
Walking on hands and knees
Never learn, never learn
Never learn, never learn

You were no angel
But God, you're just electric blue

Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away

I climbed a wall to touch your shadow
I hear you call for me
But you're not there, you're just an echo
Why did you fall for me?
Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison
Won't you just stay away?8Embed
