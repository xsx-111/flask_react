What I Like Lyrics
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

Used to come around, you'd be knockin' on my front door
Playing board-games, horror films with the super gore
Thought that you were cute from the start
Yeah, I’m pretty sure
You were like the medicine, the medicine, I wanted more
All along, I wanted someone to vibe with
Found the guy I want the rest of my life with
Ha, we on some husband and wife shit
I don’t really care, 'cause I know that I like it

And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
Smoking, smoking
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

Oh, now I got a plan
I hope you gonna be my man
I can see us cushy in the house right by the ocean sand
And when I wanna cry, I hope you're gonna hold my hand
And when the shit goes down, I hope you're gonna make a stand
This shit is super wild
This shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta'
I think I’m into you
This shit is super wild
This shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta'
I think I’m into you
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like6Embed
