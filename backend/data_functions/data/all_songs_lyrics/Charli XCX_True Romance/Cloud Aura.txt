Cloud Aura Lyrics
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Uh, uh, Brooke Candy

We were on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
Kept the blunts rolled, always let you take the first hit
When the feds caught us, I said I would take the rap
'Cause I knew it ain't easy livin' life in the trap
I was the Queen B and you were like my Jay Z
Only one who held me down when I was fuckin' crazy
Ivana and Trump, shit, we coulda ran the world
You were my Chris Brown, I was your only girl
Let you put your feet up while I was cookin' you breakfast
Thought I found my ride or die, but now I just regret shit
Log into your email 'cause I knew that shit was wrong
Pullin' up a private photo of a bitch showin' her thong
Then I look a lil' closer, it's my home girl Lisa
Time to terminate shit, hasta la vista
Married to the mob, so I put a hit on it
Handed you my heart, then you took a shit on it
That's fucked up
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

Now I'ma fuck your shit up
Set fire to your pick-up
And drive it super sonic
Crash and burn it with my sister
No, I don't need a mister
Cancel the babysitter
I'm never going down that road
It's easy to resist ya

You broke my heart
And I'm never gon' forget this
You broke my heart
And now I'm comin' back to get ya, don't you know?
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart12Embed
