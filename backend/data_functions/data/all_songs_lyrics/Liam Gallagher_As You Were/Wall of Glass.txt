Wall of Glass Lyrics
You would keep the secrets in ya'
You be keeping paraphernalia, oh
I think you know
Anyone can walk up to ya'
Anyone can see right through your eyes
All night

And I don't mean to be unkind
But I see what's in your mind
And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass
Wall of glass
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

You believe in fascinations
And designer vaccinations, love
You get along
You were sold a one direction
I believe the resurrection's on
And you were wrong
And I don't mean to be unkind
But I see what's in your mind
And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass
Wall of glass
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass


And I don't mean to be unkind
But I see what's in your mind
And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass
Wall of glass
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass14Embed
