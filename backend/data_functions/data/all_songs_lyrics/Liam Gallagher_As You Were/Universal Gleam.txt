Universal Gleam Lyrics
Here comes my epiphany
Been sitting all so patiently
Give me something I can shout about
Oh Lord don't let me down
I give you universal gleam
I'll help you fix your broken dreams
I'll give you something you can shout about
I won't ever let you down

But I'm older now
Gonna show you how for real
Gonna spit you out
Of my motor mouth
I won't ever let you down

You can make or break my day
They're only words I hear you say
Give me something I can shout about
Oh Lord don't let me down

But I'm older now
Gonna show you how for real
Gonna spit you out
Of my motor mouth
I won't ever let you down
I'm gonna make you mine
We'll bring it on home, bring it all night
Sending you love and light
We'll bring it on home, bring it all night
I'm gonna make you right
We'll bring it on home, bring it all night
Sending you love and light
I won't ever let you downEmbed
