All My People / All Mankind Lyrics
Hold tight, I got what you need
Speak now, or forever hold your peace
I just want you to know
It's my time
Show boats, not up to speed
High notes, are for birds in the trees
I just want you to know
It's my time

All my people, all mankind
All truth-seekers shine

Stand down and less of the cheese
Selfies, what a fucking disease
I just want you to know
It's my time
Slap back, you know what I mean
Fat cats, in my Pretty Green
I just want you to know
It's my time

All my people, all mankind
All truth-seekers shine
Get on up, get on up
Gonna leave you all behind
Wanna look, wanna touch
Gonna see now I'm the ride

All my people, all mankind
All truth-seekers shine

Get on up, get on up
Gonna leave you all behind
Wanna look, wanna touch
Gonna see now I'm the ride

Get on up, get on up
Gonna leave you all behind
Wanna look, wanna touch
Gonna see now I'm the ride3Embed
