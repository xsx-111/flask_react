Paper Crown Lyrics
When they gave you roses and believed your wild excuses
You were sealing the deal
Halfway down the road and ain't it
Funny how the ghosts they fade and
Suddenly appear

You went too far
Oh, woman, now you're feeling the fear
'Cause you've never been alone before, oh
And the wolf is at the door, oh
Now it's better if you hold your breath and don't look down
At the pages of your paper crown

You reached out for more and as the waves hit
At the shore you felt
The fading of your will
Choke back the metaphors
The bottom of the ladder ask me
If I love you still

You went too far
Oh, woman, now you're feeling the fear
'Cause you've never been alone before, oh
And the wolf is at the door, oh
And the hounds of hell, they won't lie down
On the ashes of your paper crown
In the bright light of the sun
Will you make sure everyone can see your face?
You make fun of everyone who falls
And meantime they were saving you a place

'Cause you've never been alone before, oh
And the wolf is at the door, oh
And the talking heads don't make a sound
At the aging of your paper crown
Better if you don't look down
At the pages of your paper crown1Embed
