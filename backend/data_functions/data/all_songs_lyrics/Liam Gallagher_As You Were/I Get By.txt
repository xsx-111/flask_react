I Get By Lyrics
No one loves like you do
I’m all messed up but I'm over you
See your face, lead your mind
Contemplate, scrutinize
Well, I get by

It’s only love, only love can break my heart
Only love, this thing will tear us all apart
Only love, only love can break my heart
Only love, this thing will tear us all apart

It’s in my life, it's in your hands
There’s no love lost, sycophant
Well beam me up, beam me down
I’ll show you love, I’ll show you round
Well, I get by

It’s only love, only love can break my heart
Only love, this thing will tear us all apart
Only love, only love can break my heart
Only love, this thing will tear us all apart
Never look back, go where you’re going to
I waited a lifetime for you
So cut me some slack, I wanna see all of you
I never hold back from the truth
So never look back, go where you’re going to
I waited a lifetime for you
So cut me some slack, I wanna see all of you
I never hold back from the truth

Unlike you
Unlike you
Unlike you
Unlike you2Embed
