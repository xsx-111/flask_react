You Better Run Lyrics
See me, a living wonder
I’m gonna meet you on the other side
Well I’m gonna steal your thunder
You’d better run, you’d better hide

I see you, you think you’re something
Well you’re nothing, you’re a butterfly
You've no love, you've no reflection
You better run, you better hide

Angels, give me shelter
'Cause I’m about to fall
Stone cold, Helter Skelter
I’m not afraid
I’m gonna face you all

Wake up, I’m onto something
You got me shaking and I feel alive
You know me, I'm all or nothin'
You better run, you better hide

Angels, give me shelter
'Cause I’m about to fall
Stone cold, Helter Skelter
I’m not afraid
I’m gonna save us all
I got to stand for something
That's why I'm not standing for you
And I won’t fall for no one
That's why I'm not falling for you
We got to stand for something
That's why we're not standing for you
And we won’t fall for no one
That's why we're not falling for you

Ain't that something
Ain’t that true
To walk in someone
Else’s shoes
Ain't that something
Ain’t that true
To walk in someone
Else’s shoes4Embed
