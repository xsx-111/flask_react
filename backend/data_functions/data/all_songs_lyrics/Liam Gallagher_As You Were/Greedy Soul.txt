Greedy Soul Lyrics
I'm going toe-to-toe
With a greedy soul
He’s going down tonight
Gonna be out a while
She got a six six six
I got my crucifix
She's got a spinning head
Like seeing Grateful Dead

You're getting told
You greedy soul
You've been telling lies
You're slippery kind

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way round
And now it's all too much
I've got the Midas touch

They’re digging me for gold
Well if the truth be told
You got you kiss and tell
I hope you go to hell
I’m going rope-a-dope
You think I’m giving up
I got a rhino hide
Don’t give a fuck, alright?
You're getting told
You greedy soul
You've been telling lies
You're slippery kind

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way round
And that was all too much
I got the Midas touch


And it's a long way down
I'm at the lost and found
And now it's all too much
I got the Midas touch
And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way round
And now it's all too much
I've got the Midas touch4Embed
