Come Back To Me Lyrics
I've gone so far, my hands are hard
But I wanna touch you
'Cause I know you're lonely
I've seen despair, but I still care
My heart is together
My head is exploding

Everyone out there says you've been goin' a bit too hard
Everyone out there says you've been testin' man and god
Tryin' to make the scene
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me

Tied-off myself, then got some help
I'm comin' and goin'
I can't get enough, man
Get high, get saved
Look out, be brave
The waves are still rolling, you're hooked on a feeling

Everyone out there says you've been goin' a bit too hard
Everyone out there says you've been testin' man and god
Tryin' to make the scene
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me

Everyone out there says you've been goin' a bit too hard
Everyone out there says you've been testin' man and god
Tryin' to make the scene
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me
Why don't you come back to me3Embed
