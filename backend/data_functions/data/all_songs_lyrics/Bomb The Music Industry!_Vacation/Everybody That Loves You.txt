Everybody That Loves You LyricsRoll down the windows, Chris, I'm gonna turn this song up
I know it's hella early but I don't give a fuck
When it's eighty degrees and you're at the beach, you gotta sway with the breeze
And on the 8 AM flight home there's a girl about my age
Highlighting psalms in her bible in the seat that's next to me
And I wonder when she comes home is it to a family?
And if she needed a breather but just ended up lonely
Oh, 'cause everyone who loves you isn't always gonna be around to have your back but
Being kind of lonely for a second here or there is really really so much better than someone always poking you
They love you but they're always breathing down your neck. But
Every now and then somebody calls you up and says "I'm coming back!"
So I won't wake you when you're sleeping
I won't call you when I'm freaking
Out again if you are busy
I won't take it personally
Even nerves of steel deserve a breather
Weight wears down the infrastructure
And hearts of gold can still feel lonely
If they don't know they're not the only ones
They love you but they're always breathing down your neck. But
Every now and then somebody calls you up and says "I'm coming back!"
And everybody that loves you will be leaving some day soon
They've got problems to undo
They've got paperwork to do
When I show up at 6 AM I hope somebody lets me in
I know I've been gone a long time, but you know I'm still your friend
And I hope you get the job that you've been looking for
You are a decent girl and you don't need this anymore
And yeah, I get that, for sure
And I hope that when I sit around watching snow collect in banks on the ground
That I don't get too down because you're not around1Embed
