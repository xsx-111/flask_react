The Shit That You Hate LyricsMy telephone's been abuzz all morning
And I don't know who is trying to get through
I did some shit that I should have done smarter
But they get away with everything
So I thought I could get away, I thought I could get away too
Down in the gulf there's a black sea-monster
And my crime ain't huge, a world-tattered cube
That I didn't affix with a shiny new sticker
Go swallow the summer and choke on the fumes
Because they get away with everything that they do
So hold onto your home
It's shaky, I know, but if you flee trash will follow
Home, onto your home
It's shaky, I know, but if you flee trash will follow
The winds that you left in your wake and you'll fall down again
Oh, the office called. You're in deep, deep trouble
The shit you're afraid of has made you hateful
And you're letting on, tired eyes, all spiteful
And nobody cares. We all got sorrows
So hold onto your home and onto your hope
Sorrow don't answer problems
Hold onto your home and onto your hope
Sorrow don't answer problems
Hold onto your home and onto your hope
Sorrow don't answer problems
Hold onto your home and onto your hope
Sorrow don't answer problems
Nobody cares. We're all in trouble
The shit that you hate don't make you special
Nobody cares. We're all in trouble
The shit that you hate don't make you special
Nobody cares. We're all in trouble
The shit that you hate don't make you special
Nobody cares. We're all in trouble
The shit that you hate don't make you special
The shit that you hate don't make you special
The shit that you hate don't make you special
The shit that you hate don't make you special
The shit that you hate don't make you special
The shit that you hate don't make you special
The shit that you hate
The shit that you hate
The shit that you hate don't make you special
The shit that you hate
The shit that you hateEmbed
