Sick, Later. LyricsI didn't cause too much trouble at sixteen years old
I snuck out and I stole highway signs
Piled 'em up in the hallway up against the wall
Sidewalks, train stations, construction sites
And nobody died, and nobody died
I remember the common room was really cold
And the vending machines and the snow was iced over outside
I drove back, and the bridge had felt way too narrow
Over potholes and through yellow lights
Did I hug you goodbye? Did I say goodnight?
And I thought I'd see you again under the glow of a soft light
Without fluorescent days and nights. With no hum, no network TV
The consolation prize: with resigned eyes I still held tight
And with resigned eyes you still held tight
And I'm glad it wasn't like that summer when everybody died
I'm such a guarded guy 'cause I've been hurt too many times
The first time that I took you to the hospital
I was tired and you wanted to die
I drove off like I didn't understand at all
Fuck, I couldn't even walk you inside
I thought we all wanna die, we all wanna die
And I thought that was fine, I thought that was fine, I thought that was fine
And I thought I'd see you again under the glow of a soft light
Without fluorescent days and nights. With no hum, no network TV
The consolation prize: with resigned eyes I still held tight
And with resigned eyes you still held tight
And I'm glad it wasn't like that summer when everybody died
I'm such a guarded guy 'cause I've been hurt too many times
And I'm glad it wasn't like that summer when everybody died
I'm such a guarded guy 'cause I've been hurt too many timesEmbed
