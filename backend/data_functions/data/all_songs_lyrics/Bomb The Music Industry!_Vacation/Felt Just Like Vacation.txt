Felt Just Like Vacation LyricsYour floor felt like falling backwards in a steady slipstream
The lazy tide is bringing me to shore
Eighty degree water, I see right to the bottom
Take the pressure off for good. Don't give me anymore
Give me the worst sleep spots, corners to get stuck in
Pump me full of friends and alcohol
And I'll be thinking of you long after the night's through
Long after I'm peeled off of the wall and shipped to Brooklyn
And it might be cause I'm not alone
But this vacation feels more like home
Than habitually checking my phone for texts
I won't respond to from people I don't talk to
In truth, December destroyed me. January crushed me
By February, I was not myself
March rolled in like beatings and rolled out like a bear hug
In April I stared out the window for a fucking month
I don't want October. I don't want November
I don't want to feel those crippling blows
That I can't explain to myself, my friends or you
So I soften them with hours of Nintendo
And it might be cause I'm not alone
But this vacation feels more like home
Than refreshing e-mails I won't respond to
From people I don't talk to
Please give me Caye Caulker, my feet in the water
Someone who doesn't yawn when I go on
And I'll be thinking of her long after the summer
Long after the crowd is bored and talking shit and moved away and everybody's gone
So the winter never kills me
Winter won't kill me
So the winter never kills me2Embed
