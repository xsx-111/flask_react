Everybody That You Love Lyrics
They're looking at me with their glassy eyes, they're gonna bury me
Dripping with Hennessy and ecstasy, they're gonna bury me
I guess I probably should have done my research
Hey!

And I know that it's darkest before dawn
'Cause I've been staying up for way too long
And I know that it only takes one call
But we've got no options

Some people can fake it, but my arms are weak. My hands are shaky. No one's scared of me
Trying to keep the kamikazes still they're gonna bury me
I guess I should have watched where I was pissing instead of off the rocks
Of an abandoned Greenpoint dock
We had such an awesome night and getting shanked would be a disappointment

Oh, I understand the calm before the storm because
I like to hang out where it's warm
And I know that it's darkest before dawn
But I see clearly. Oh, I get it now

All the people I love the best
Are starting to get frustrated with me being a mess
And the people I kinda hate are always impressed
All the people I love the best
Have grown increasingly impatient with the person I am
And some people I hardly know will never understand
And I know that it's darkest before dawn
'cause I've been staying up for way too long
And even if I never get to call, I still loved you
Hope you loved me too

They're gonna bury me
They're gonna bury me
They're gonna bury me
They're gonna bury meEmbed
