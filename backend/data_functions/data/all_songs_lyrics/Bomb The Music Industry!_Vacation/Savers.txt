Savers LyricsI'm kicking the party trash that coats the floor
Empty whiskey bottles that serve reports
Of nights where all I could afford
Was to sell myself short
Our windows don't overlook the busy streets
So I count the raindrops and drink my tea
Oh I'm living! in a city
That's killed so many better men than me
Hey, can you save my life
'cause I would save your life
I would save your life!
I got so hung up on things that keep me down
That I start feeling lost when they're not around
When relaxing feels like sinking
Into a bubbly pit with one arm reaching out
Hey, can you save my life?
'cause I would save your life
Yeah I would save your life!
And I say, hey, can you save my life?
'cause I would save your life
'cause I would save your life!
And I know everyone has bad nights, but you know I, I, I, I don't wanna die
Can you save my life?
'Cause I know everyone has bad nights
And you know I don't want to die
Can you save my life?
I know everyone has bad night
But you know I, I, I, I don't wanna die
Can you save my life?
'Cause I know everyone has bad nights
But you know I, I, I, I don't wanna die
Can you save my life?
'Cause I know everyone has bad nightsEmbed
