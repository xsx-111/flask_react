Why, Oh Why, Oh Why? (Oh Oh Oh Oh) LyricsEver since you were young you'll be begging them to treat you like an adult
But even when you're not they will treat you like you're six years old
Condescending stares down your nose from the back corner of a party
Oh, your little clique's got cool but you aren't any fun
So why oh why oh why am I hellbent on acceptance here
Like a non-sarcastic smile would really fix my day
When I get so depressed sometimes I can barely put the bottle down
And I know that you won't care if I go away?
So, I won't care, not from this point forward
If you're so stuck on feeling cool
Why oh why did I ever care about you? Oh oh oh oh
When you're down and out, those acquaintances that treat you like a stranger
Scramble to the phone for the scoop on your latest little fall
They're the ones who call you, but only when they're looking for a favor
And you can hear the cracks when they tell you that it's been too long
So why oh why oh why do I even stay in touch with you
When you're only here to leech off my good days?
When I get so depressed at night it's a wonder that I'm still around
And I know that you won't care if I go away
So, I won't care, not from this point forward
If you're so stuck on feeling cool
Why oh why did I ever care about you? Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh I get so depressed sometimes it's a miracle that I'm still around
And I know that you won't care if I go away
There's a marathon that I watch as a kid every new years
Of The Twilight Zone and I wonder if it's still on
These days I get shithoused and make plans to lose weight before the summer
Oh tell me, why I'm first in line to find what I'm doing wrong?
'Cause, I won't care, not from this point forward
If you're so stuck on feeling cool
Why oh why did I ever care about you? Oh oh oh oh
Why oh why did I ever care about you? Oh oh oh oh
So, I won't care, not from this point forward
If you're so stuck on feeling cool
Why oh why did I ever care about you? Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh1Embed
