Hurricane Waves Lyrics
Took the train today, Rockaway for the hurricane waves
I got sick yesterday, but it'll take much more to keep me away
I know that today could be the end of summer and hey
I've been procrastinating anyway, so what's one more day?
So what's one more day?

I can be sick tomorrow, I can work and Iâ€‹ can catch up
I can wait 'til tomorrow to pay my rent and start to grow up

All the headlines say "Surf's Up for the Hurricane Waves!"
But the bodies say "it's gonna be a weekend filled with pain."
I know usually I can find a cloud to cover anything
Even on the clearest days but uncharacteristically
I will retain some optimism

Cuddle through the storm
Cuddle up in the storm
Cheap Girls records
Instant Netflix

I can eat well tomorrow. I can sweep and I can clean up
I can wait 'til tomorrow to pay my rent and start to grow up
I can be sick tomorrow. I can work and I can clean up
I can wait I can wait 'til tomorrow
There's only so many days you can spend waiting for the turn
You're gonna get bored
There's only so many days you can spend waiting until you don't love anything anymore

You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't do anything anymore."
You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't love anything anymore."
You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't do anything anymore."
You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't love anything anymore."
You get yourself a bottle and say, "I don't do anything anymore."
You get yourself a bottle and say!
I can wait 'til tomorrow to pay my rent and start to grow up
I can wait I can wait 'til tomorrow1Embed
