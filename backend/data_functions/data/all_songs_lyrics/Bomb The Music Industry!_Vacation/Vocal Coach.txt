Vocal Coach LyricsI'm such a skeptic when they flail their arms screaming "OH GOOD GOD!" again
All the records we love have dirty covers, dusty grooves and deep scratches
Kind of blacking out when all the lights go bright 'til the room gets dark again
'cause we put up our guard for superstars and their sharp movements, big fashion
I'm aware that I'm kind of getting scared
The love that I thought had no bounds is coming to an end
So leave me here, you can just leave me here
To find something new so I don't feel as good as dead
I get embarrassed when I hear my voice and it's not like in my head
If I got a new vocal coach and I could hit the notes, you'd fall in love again
Nothing's forever, dude
Nothing's forever, dude
I've lost so much I'm running out of things to lose
Oh, I get so embarrassed when I hear my voice and it's not like in my head
If I got a new vocal coach and I could hit the notes, you'd fall in love again
If I got a new vocal coach and I could hit the notes, you'd fall in love again
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
So leave me here, you can just leave me here
To find something new so I don't feel as good as dead
Oh, I get so embarrassed when my voice pops out and it's not like in my head
If I got a new vocal coach and I could hit the notes, you'd fall in love again
If I got a new vocal coach and I could hit the notes, you'd fall in love again
If I got a new vocal coach and I could hit the notes, you'd fall in love again2Embed
