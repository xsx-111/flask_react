Burst LyricsOnce you had this promise
On the tip of your tongue
But it went without saying
It went on too long
All the straws you clutched at
Have burst into flames
And so you smile that way
Tantalisingly lame
The smart ones understand
How your heart bursts
Like a bottle of champagne
Your just deserts
The smart ones understand
You shouldn't settle for less
You're gonna forget yourself
In my happiness
Keep your silence to yourself - you will forget yourself
Keep your silence to yourself - you will forget yourself
You will forget yourself - you will forget yourself
You will forget yourself - you will forget yourself
Keep your silence to yourself - you will forget yourself
Keep your silence to yourself - you will forget yourself
You will forget yourself - you will forget yourself
You will forget yourself - you will forget yourself
You will forget yourself - you will forget yourself
You will forget yourself - you will forget yourself1Embed
