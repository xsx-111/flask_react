Motorcade LyricsI believe all that I read now
Night has come off the corners
Shadows flicker sweet and tame
Dancing like crazy mourners
The man with the hotdogs sells lemonade
Someone over there needs first aid
While me and the rest of the world
Await the touch of the motorcade
No one finds time to turn a blind eye
You can't be too careful nowadays
And my friend says 'listen..
To the stupid things they're making you say'
Here comes the motorcade
Moving so slow and hard
Like a snake in a closet
Holding sway in the boulevard
Here is your man
All faces turn unanimously
The small fry who sizzle in his veins
In all security
In the back of his car
Into the null and void he shoots
The man of the centre of the motorcade
Has learned to tie his boots
In the back of his car
In the null and void he sees
The man at the centre of the motorcade
Can choose between coffee and tea
In the boulevard - the motorcade hold swayEmbed
