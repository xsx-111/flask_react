Recoil LyricsDashing through Paradise
So polite in what I say
Last in the one I'm in
I won't a world to give away
I know what's mine
You'll learn what's yours
I know what you want to see
You scratch my back
And I grow claws
Falling in love awkwardly
Dancing in my own good time
My words stick out of your face
If you're not feeling so weak today
Somebody will take your place
I know what's mine ...
Dashing through Paradise
So polite in what I say
Last in the one I'm in
I won't a world to give away
Dancing in my own good time
My words stick out of your face
If you're not feeling so weak today
Somebody will take your placeEmbed
