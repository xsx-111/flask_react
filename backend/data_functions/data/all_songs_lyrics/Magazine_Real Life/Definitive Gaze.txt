Definitive Gaze LyricsI've got this bird's eye view
And it's in my brain
Clarity has reared
Its ugly head again
So this is real life
You're telling me
And everything
Is where it ought to be
I like your nerve
I like watching you
But I don't watch what I'm doing
Got better things to do
So this is real life
You're telling me
Now I'm lost in shock
Your face fits perfectlyEmbed
