Kathaarian Life Code LyricsFace of the goat in the mirror
We've become a race of the cursed seeds
I entered the soul of the snake
We are a blaze in the northern sky
Desert... Night...
Coyotes feel the cold wave of the dark
Red eyes eats through
The vast nocturnal landscape
A strong light - the only night
This is where he made sculptures
From the visions that created the force
Baphomet in steel
For the flesh of Cain
A throne made by remains
Of twelve holy disciples
New disciples rose
One by one, ten by ten
All met under the desert moonlight
Knowledge fired across the landscape
Sparks that mixed with coyote eyes
Diabolic forces in a ceremonial union
A throne made by remains
Of twelve holy disciples
And each beast of the land
Took its own way in living
The seven forbidden things
Were eternally desecrated
Desert... Night...
Coyotes feel the cold wave of the dark
Red eyes eats through
The vast nocturnal landscape
A strong light - the only night
New disciples rose
One by one, ten by ten
All met under the desert moonlight
Knowledge fired across the landscape
Sparks that mixed with coyote eyes
Diabolic forces in a ceremonial union
Kathaaria was built - world without end2Embed
