Where Cold Winds Blow Lyrics
Where cold winds blow I was laid to rest
I can not reach my rusty weapons
The blood and sword that guided my path
For they drowned in the sands of wisdom

I was, indeed, a king of the flesh
My blackened edges; still they were sharp
Honoured by the carnal herdes
But asketh thou: closed are the gates?


My mind cut my winged weapons
The teeth that was my pride
And from the forest all would hear:
"Wisdom opens the gate for the king"


My weapons sighted, my tears they tasted
Summon my warriors, to the land of desire
To the domain of hate, where cold winds blew
For lust for Hell, we rode with the north wind
Only I could accomplish a fucken self-deceit
There are only two paths, the mind or the sword
And the mind was open like the sights in a dream
But the sword was like a stone around my neck

I entered the soul of the snake
And slept with the armageddish whore
But without my throne and my weapons
Where cold winds blow became my graveEmbed
