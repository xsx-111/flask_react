The Pagan Winter LyricsHorned master of endless time
Summon thy unholy disciples
Trained for centuries to come
Gather on the highest mountain
United by hatred
The final super joint ritual
This, the pagan winter
Kept for the obscure ones
Candles hold the only light
Sextons hide in fear
For this eternal winter
A new god ruled the sky
The million hands of joy
Have something holy to burn
From the top of the world one could see
The white light servants flee
Engulfed in an infernal cyclone
Created by our blasphemy
Religious bodies crossed the sky
The vision was our wine
Roar of fire, feeble fools
Into the furnace fire
Face of the goat in the mirror
We've become a race of the cursed seeds
I entered the soul of the snake
We are a blaze in the northern skyEmbed
