Simple Boy Lyrics
I'm high above the world
Why should I feel pain, or feel at all?
To be protected like a simple boy
If I choose to let you down, begin to know

You're free to go
You're free to go

I will fight till there's nothing left
Watch the world together from this sinking ship
Or drown alone here
On the coast, facing nothingness
Drawn to feel the emptiness, so help me now
Describe the scene

You're free to go
(Can't face this face for another day)
(There's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)
You're free to go
(Can't fake this face for another day)
(There's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)
You're free to go
You're free to go
Simple boy, stay here
Simple boy, don't wander
Simple boy, you're safe here
Simple boy, simple boy

When did we lose the plot?
We're running against the clock
Don't hesitate, or you will never know

You're free to go
(Can't face this face for another day)
Simple boy
(There's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)
You're free to go
(Can't fake this face for another day)
Don't wander
(There's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)
You're free to go
(Can't face this face for another day)
Simple boy
(There's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)
You're free to go
(Can't fake this face for another day)
You're safe here
(There's not one thing here that I wouldn't change)
You're free to go
My simple boy
My simple boy
My simple boy
My simple boyEmbed
