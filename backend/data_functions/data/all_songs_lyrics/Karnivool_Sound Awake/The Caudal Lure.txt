The Caudal Lure Lyrics
Ask a question
Are the answers loaded like this one?
You better pull yourself along
Time is precious and you must act
This isn't inevitable
I still stand
I won't get back in my cell
I will not let a savior define my freedom
I'm going out alone
No one is gonna save us from this

We should have known better not to taste this wine we swallow
For all and more, we set our recourse for tomorrow
Now we command, we will awake this snake and follow

Shatter the hourglass and what do you see
Memories like grains of sand are blowing away
Is this who you are? A product of fear
The shell of a man who lost his innocence

Hold your nerve
Keep your focus
There's something peculiar about the way you pay to save your soul
You forfeit your dream
Just let it go
We should have known better not to taste this wine we swallow
For all and more, we set our recourse for tomorrow
Now here we stand, we will embrace it or be defiant
Final moment, taken by these chemicals you can't control

Ask the question
Ask the question
Ask the question

We should have known better not to drink this wine we swallow
For all and more, we set our recourse for tomorrow
Now we command, we will embrace it or be defiant
Silent moment, induced by these chemicals you can't control

(Where's your God at?)
(Where's your God at? Alone)
(Where's your God at?)
(Where's your God at? Alone)
(Where's your God at?)
(Where's your God at? Alone)
(Where's your God at?)
(Where's your God at? Alone)1Embed
