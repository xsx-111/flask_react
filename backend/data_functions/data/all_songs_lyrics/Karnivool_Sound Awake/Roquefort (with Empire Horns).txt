Roquefort (with Empire Horns) Lyrics
You want to chase this rabbit down a hole
You start to slide and lose grip of control
Make haste, it's time to ruin or reward
You say, "Give in!" Then you beg for more

You'll bury this, slow down
It's all this system breeds
You'll bury this, slow down
It's time to make amends

Save your eyes for
This place where I define you
Myth or desire
When it's true love you held dear
Feel it rising

So cut me to size, I'm losing shape through all this
You call me sublime
You know that's such a waste of energy
Will I change your mind if I could show you my way?
A black stain on your heart
You know that's not what I wanna see
You'll bury this, slow down
It's time to make amends
(Always in vain now)

Save your eyes for this place where I define you
Myth or desire
When it's true love, you held dear, fear your horizons

You want to chase, this rabbit down a hole
You start to slide and lose grip of control
Make haste, it's time to ruin or reward
You say, "Give in", and then you beg for more

You'll bury this, slow down
It's time to make amends
I crave you

Set your eyes on
This place where I define you
Myth or desire
When it's true love you feel
Save your eyes for
This place where I define you
Myth or desire
When it's true love you feel here
Feel it rising, yeahEmbed
