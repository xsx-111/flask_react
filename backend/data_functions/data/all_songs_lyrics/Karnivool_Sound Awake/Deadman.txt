Deadman Lyrics
A change of a tone
Changing my mind
Changing the weather
I feel it at first
Blow from the dark
Take it for better
Still I remind myself
How I define myself

Blacker the bruise
Coming up clear
Bound to get better
Blessed with a curse
Hoping I fall
The deeper, the better

I needed
I needed to know
I needed
I needed to know why
Oh no, this can't be happening
Oh no, this can't be happening
Pain is a door
A fever burning for more
A red light in my mind that I feed on
You must've been so surprised to see
There you were staring back at me
Caught in a web now
Out on your own
You've got nothing to stay for
So you keep saying

This year, it's coming
And guess what we're running from
Too late for running
The stitches are coming undone
Grab your belongings
The exit is near
Making your way through indecisiveness

I needed
I needed to know
I needed
I needed to know why
Oh no, this can't be happening
Oh no, this can't be happening
This myth is methodized
You're colorblind in this madness
I'll bide all of my time for your love
Old crooked man you'll die
Like excuses pouring out a child
Sing "S.O.S., you saint"
I'll make room for laughter
It all ends right here

This water's dark and cold
God's not where you hoped
He's more than come and gone (Gone, gone, gone)

It's too late, mayday
Call out, "Mayday!" while I'm still alive
Hey, no matter
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't think this will end well

Hey, there goes my love again
No one's coming now
Hey, I'm out on my own again
Fading faces, broken frowns
Hey, I guess I fucked up again
No one will find out
Hey, stare at your feet again
Don't say you don't know
This water's dark and cold
God's not where you hoped
He's more than come and gone
It's time we all moved on
It's time we all moved on
It's time we all moved on
Away

Still I remind myself
How I define myself
Still I remind myself
(I needed to know)
How I define myself
(I needed to know)
I needed to know
I needed
I needed to know

So if you like the sound of
The glass that breaks against the wall
I'd trade it all for several
Pieces of your anger
I am the interest of your heart
Say, "This would wash away"
I'm climbing this rope, I feel God
Would I care to stare you down?
I portray you in different lightEmbed
