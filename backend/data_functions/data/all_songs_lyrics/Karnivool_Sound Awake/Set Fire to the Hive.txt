Set Fire to the Hive Lyrics
I don't know what's wrong but I'm on fire
It sears through my hands, leaving skin on the wire
Awake in this womb with a crown sting in my self
When I listen, the same cry plays on

We're slaves
In this medicated cage
Make a decision to face this change
To rules they don't explain
So, why do we obey?

Politics, religion, your vision's the same
You played us, as both a cancer and a cure
Which reminds me that it's just a game
Your alibi's a sales pitch
Your pretty boy, pretty face dolled up again
A star for us to adore
And you, man, you've got to be more
'Cause this affects all

It's nice to know you're with us today
I've seen you in the fog along the way
I'll spit in the mouth of your god
Who whispers in the minds of our children
You've been sold again
Set fire to the hive as you flee
It's fiction, a faceless illusion
You've been had again
You swing this wrecking ball
A violent pendulum
To hypnotize them all
The writing on the wall
That we keep missing
A structure built to fall
Still we all obey

It's nice to know you're with us today
I've seen you in the fog along the way
I'll spit in the mouth of your god
Who whispers in the minds of our children
You've been sold again
Set fire to the hive as you flee
It's fiction, a faceless illusion
You've been had again

There's no second chances here
There's no second chances here
There's no second chances hereEmbed
