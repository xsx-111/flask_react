Goliath Lyrics
I'm on to you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Bow to the ones you make believe
All I hear is the sound of sleep
Deafening, comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I'm on to it
I've watched you
Patiently
Guiding the light that you deceived
I've crawled for you
And so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Pave way for the fall
Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?
Sellout
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you all enjoy the view
Wide awake, and still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it, can you see?
Honestly wide awake, but still asleep

Don't leave this too long (It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come (Hang on)
You won't have to wait long (We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
Please wake up
Please wake upEmbed
