Umbra Lyrics
Paint me in your own way
Color my eyes
See what feelings I hide
No one knows why
No one can forgive
Second thought
Why do I care?
I'll hide from subtleties while
I try to face my kind
And you call this feeling
It's not enough
Come again another day
Now that my world feels out of place
I'll follow you home

Wake me with a bottle 'cross the head
I'll sleep 'til it's over and I'm sober again

Safe
No, I don't feel so safe here
Imagine that everything's affected by a cause
In this game you call luck (There's nowhere to go)
Well, I don't feel so lucky, no (Lie to yourself)
Just when I think I've worked it out
These pieces move and I'm back to the start
Wake me with a bottle 'cross the head
I'll sleep 'til it's over and I'm sober again
Hey, it's nothing that you'd understand
I promised to maybe, always

Do you think it matters?
(Here I will stand)
Do you think at all?
(Here I will fall)
Do we complicate it?
(Hopeless recovery)
Do we know it all?
(My will is gone)

I don't want to
(Here I will stand)
I just have to
(Here I will fall)
I don't need it
(Hopeless recovery)
I just want it
(I'll always go)
Allay this troubled sinner
With a gun in your hand
Now you live for no one
Knowing what you held on your own
Wasted moments
Set in stone and blood
Hold your promise
Save your cheap remarks, just leave me here alone1Embed
