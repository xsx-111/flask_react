Illumine Lyrics
Don't listen
Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you
Unspoken
Words that taunt you when you listen
Forgotten
Worlds that haunt you while you're sleeping

You seem afraid, don't be alarmed
It's only the face of things to come

Servant to the sun, we appease, we've become as one
Lighting every cell, every shape, we will never fall
And is it relevant?
Our fears, our faults
As foolish as it sounds

So lead us on (Only one way down)
Through the free world of false promise
It's one thing to be forgiven (Only one way home)
Only you could learn how to let it go
So we are
Servant to the sun, let us see, we are still as one
Here lie my faults
I'd give up everything
To see what you see
And dream on
Why can't we dream on?

Don't listen
Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you
These words won't help
To save you

Servant to the sun, we appease, we've become as one
Lighting every cell, every shape, we will never fall
These words won't help
To save you
Servants of the sun, let us see, we are still as one

You seem afraid, don't be alarmed
It's only the face of things to comeEmbed
