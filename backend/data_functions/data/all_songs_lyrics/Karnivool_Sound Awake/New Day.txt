New Day Lyrics
How did they find me?
How did they know?
This misconception of fate
I'm about to let go
Awake in a new light I'm alone in this room
Heavy at heart, it may be a lie
You will not see me

It's a new day
Why did they follow me home?
It's a new day

One more step
It's here waiting for you
Now go slow, take your time
Leave no mark
You lost your way
I hope you're watching me
One more step
It's here waiting for you
Now go slow, take your time

Subtle breakdown
From the one so free
You lost your way
No one held you back from me
How do you all speak
With a lying tongue?
How do we all sleep
With a dying sun?
Sit down
Lighten your own
This storm is coming
You should stay home
But I fear you won't

Hey, let's get lost in a crowd, while
Searching for something worth holding
Hey, let's get lost in a crowd
I'll show you so much more
Much more
So much more
So much more

Are we waiting?
For the savior?
Someone to heal this
Or erase us

How did they find me?
How did they know?
This misconception of fate
I'm about to let go
Awake in a new light I'm alone in this room
I'm heavy at heart, and maybe a lie
You will not see me
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day

Are we waiting?
For the savior?
I'm so sick of waiting
I've been waiting my whole life

This is a new day
This is a new day
This is a new day4Embed
