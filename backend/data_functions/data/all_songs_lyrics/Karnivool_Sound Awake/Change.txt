Spare a little of your imagination
You will see many things that answer many questions
Spare a little of your imagination
You will see many things that answer many questions
Many questions, many questions
Answers many questions
Many questions, many questions
Answers many questions

Hello
Hollow halo
Hello
(Can you hear them say?)
Hollow halo
(Can you hear them calling?)

You'll never
You'll never leave this world alone
You'll never
You'll never leave this world alone, and I've
Become a martyr to the stars
Become a model to the same
Side that I've been fighting
I'm still afraid to crawl
(No more pointing fingers at mistakes that lie)
I'm drowning like a saint
(Here in our reflection)
I'm still afraid to fall
How do you suppose
We can light the way to get us home?
What you thought was lost, now found within
Feel this weight lift
No more pointing fingers at mistakes, and I'm
Here in a reflection

What a way to see this thing out
What a way to lay this burden down
What a way to sing this sorrow
What a way to stand this one out

Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo

All this leads to nothing
Still this world won't wait
Complicated nothings
Still this world won't wait
What a way to see this thing out
What a way to lay your burden down
What a way to signal tragedy
Hello, hollow halo

Hello hollow halo
Hello hollow halo
(Can you hear them say?)
Hello hollow halo
Can you hear them calling?
(Can you hear them calling?)

"You can see all of this
And watch it before your eyes
Everything owes its existence
Solely and completely to sound
Sound is a factor which holds it together
Sound is the basis of form and shape
Spare a little of your imagination
And say that it into the great voids of space
Came a sound, and matter took shape
Please watch carefully"
Sine waves and mirrors
A smoke that you inhale
Dry mouth and bitter tones
Better left unsaid
I know this will burn you
So I'll become the fire
These days will change us all

Don't you feel the same?
Don't we fear the same things?
Don't we feel the same?
(Don't you fear at all?)

But lately
Maybe the damage has been done
As we float away like embers
Beneath us, the fire, still it burns
And I don't, I don't know why
Question who we are and then we die
I guess, I'll see you when it ends
I'll see you 'round the bend, my
Sober sorry friend

Don't you feel the same?
Don't we feel the same?
(I guess, I'll see you when it ends)
Don't you feel the same? (I'll see you 'round the bend my sober sorry friend)

When we collide
Some say goodbye
Some save their words
Leaving no resolve
There's a break in the wall
You can feel it
It's letting us all escape
So people, tell me you need
The waking day
To fall asleep
Light your way
Find your place
In youEmbed
