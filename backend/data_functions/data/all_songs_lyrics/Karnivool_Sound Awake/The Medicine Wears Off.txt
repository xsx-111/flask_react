The Medicine Wears Off Lyrics
See what I get
When the medicine wears off
You're moving fast
Try a little, see if I can make the moment last
You'll burn, you'll light up like a star
You'll break this heart you hold

Now you're coming 'round
You're taken by the wonder of it all
Where are you now?
Longing for a state of mind
Oh, I remember why we started blocking all we said

See what I get
When the medicine wears off
See what I get
When the medicine wears offEmbed
