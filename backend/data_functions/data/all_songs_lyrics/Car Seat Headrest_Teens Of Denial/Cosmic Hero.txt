Cosmic Hero Lyrics
If you really wanna make it last
You could commit yourself completely
You could lie down in the river at last
And let the dread complete you
And if you really don't want the pain
You can disengage completely
Because it wasn't healthy anyways
And you've got a job and a family

If you really wanna fall asleep
Then you'll have to find some punctuation
And if you wanna ride it out to the end
You can tie your thoughts together
And if you really wanted to be kind
You'd have forgiven them a long ass time ago
And if you really wanna know how kind you are
Just ask yourself why you're lying in bed alone

I know you wish my flesh would yield
I love you but I can’t stand the touch
And of course I’m alright with death
But why you talk about it so goddamn much?
I will go to heaven
You won’t go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won’t see you there
I will go to heaven
You won’t go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won’t see you there
I will go to heaven
You won’t go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won’t see you there
I will go to heaven
You won’t go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won’t see you there

If you really wanna know yourself
It will come at the price of knowing no one else
This guy, he was so high
I asked my friend to punch him out
Can you kick his ass?
Can you kick his ass for me?
And if you really wanna make the change
Then you would cut yourself off completely
But if you just want it to be OK
It will never be OK

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright (fuck!)
It'll be alright (fuck!)
It'll be alright (fuck you!)
It'll be alright
It'll be alright (fuck!)
It'll be alright (fuck!)
It'll be alright (fuck you!)
It'll be alright
It'll be alright (fuck!)
It'll be alright (fuck!)
It'll be alright (fuck you!)
Now you gotta change addresses again
If they knew where the fire was they'd put it out
Someone's knocking on your door
Fire turned towards me with an open mouth
And if you don't come home tonight
You will never call it home again
And if you need some peace and quiet
There is room for all in heaven

I will go to heaven
You won't go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won't see you there
I will go to heaven
You won't go to heaven
I will go to heaven
I won't see you there7Embed
