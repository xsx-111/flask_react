Joe Goes to School LyricsI saw a horse and it saw me
You know their skulls are so crazy but they still can see
It had big brown eyes, shining and sad
It was just a horse, I couldnâ€™t tell if it was sad or not
Held out my hand like there was something in it
Managed to touch it, it did not seem interested
Then a car pulled up, so I split the scene
I am a tourist attraction biking down DoG Street1Embed
