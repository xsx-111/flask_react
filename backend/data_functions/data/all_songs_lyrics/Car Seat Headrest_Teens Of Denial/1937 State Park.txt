1937 State Park Lyrics
(I never thought it would happen to me but
I never thought​ it would happen to me but)

No one should ever have to look at themselves
I steer clear of graveyards
They are cliche
In my death-obsessed generation
No one should ever have to look at themselves
High school teen dream dies in the hospital
Leaves behind a journal and a pair of Air Jordans
Lyrics of popular rock ballads
Changed to include his name
I’m taking back my heart
You were digging a hole for it six feet deep
(At the state park, at the state park)

I didn’t want you to hear
That shake in my voice
My pain is my own
And when the cops shook me down
I cried walking home
I cried walking home
You and me are connected now
We were in one photograph and we don’t even look happy
I can't commit to a crime to commit
I need to get one done for the biography because
When I split the scene
Leave the party early
What am I leaving behind me?
Just a memory
Another body
It ain’t no pair of Air Jordans
Something is ringing
Death is playing his
Xylophone ribs for me

I didn’t want you to hear
That shake in my voice
My pain is my own
And when the cops shook me down
I cried walking home
I cried walking home
I didn’t want you to hear
That shake in my voice
My pain is my own
And when the cops shook me down
I cried walking home
I cried walking home
Don’t worry
I’m worrying for two
So don’t worry baby
Don’t worry
I’m worrying for two
So don’t worry baby3Embed
