Vincent Lyrics
And half the time I want to go home
And half the time I want to go home
For the past year I’ve been living in a town
That gets a lot of tourists in the summer months
They come and they stay for a couple of days
But hey, I’m living here every day
I don’t need the complications
I’m just in it for the beating
It’s almost a point of pride
They say that it doesn’t happen that often
Pure sadism
Pure sadism
Pure sadism
Pure sadism

I find it harder to speak
When someone else is listening
In the back of a medicine cabinet
You can find your life story
And your future in the side effects
I haven’t played guitar in months
My strings all broke
They got a portrait by Van Gogh
On the Wikipedia page
For clinical depression
Well, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it
Yeah, it helps to describe it...

I don’t have the strength
(I don’t have the time)
I poured myself a drink
(I told myself a lie)
You know I’ve worried
(You know I’ve tried)
Don’t you know I’m not strong?
(Don’t you know I’m not kind?)
Someone’s getting lucky
(Someone’s calling the cops)
Someone takes me away
(Someone make it all stop)
I had a bright tomorrow
(I spent it all today)
Now I am silent at last
Now I have nothing to say
Now I have nothing to say
If I’m being honest with myself
I haven’t been honest with myself
It must be hard to speak in a foreign language
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado
Intoxicado

I find it easier to sleep
(And half the time I want to go home)
When I'm not holding the noise machine
(And half the time I want to go home)
And half the time, I’m like THIS -
They’ll send in Matt
CAPtain Trash!

(I don't have the time)
(I told myself a lie)
(You know I've tried)
(Don't you know I'm not kind?)
(Someone's calling the cops)
(Someone makes it all stop)
(I spent it all today)
(Now I have nothing to say)
I don’t have the strength
(I don’t have the time)
I poured myself a drink
(I told myself a lie)
You know I’ve worried
(You know I’ve tried)
Don’t you know I’m not strong?
(Don’t you know I’m not kind?)
Someone’s getting lucky
(Someone’s calling the cops)
Someone takes me away
(Someone makes it all stop)
I had a bright tomorrow
(I spent it all today)
Now I am silent at last
Now I have nothing to say8Embed
