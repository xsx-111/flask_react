Connect the Dots (The Saga of Frank Sinatra) Lyrics
(Hahahaha, it's all downhill from here! Alright.)

Little boy says I’ll be in love with my fists
Little boy says I’ll be in love with my punches
Little boy says what should I do with my hands mom?
Little boy is told not to do anything wrong

When I die I’ll be taken to the constellations
Have a drink, relax, there’ll be some introductions
This is Cassiopeia, this is Orion
This is Cindy, this is Nathan
That’s Chrissy and the other Nathan

I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it’s a lot to remember says father
I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it’s a lot to remember says father

I speak these words in utter isolation
I drive the car in a line from star to stardom
Little boy says I’ll touch the heart of the nation
Little boy says I’ll punch the heart of everyone
When I die I’ll be taken to the constellations
Have a drink, relax, there’ll be some introductions
This is Cassiopeia, this is Orion
This is Cindy, this is Nathan
I just met him, no that’s the other Nathan!

I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it’s a lot to remember says father
I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it's a lot to remember says someone

You won’t see who you want to see there
No one will want to be in your band
You’ll have to learn how to make it on your own
Spend a little time with your own hand
(We were heroes back home
We are heroes back home
Heroes back home
We were heroes back home)

Little boy says I’ll be in love with my fists
And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
Fuck off teens!
(Yeah!)1Embed
