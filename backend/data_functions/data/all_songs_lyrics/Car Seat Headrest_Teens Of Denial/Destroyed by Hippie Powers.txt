Destroyed by Hippie Powers Lyrics
I am freaking out in my mind
In a house that isn't mine
My end goal isn't clear
Should not have had that last beer
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's more than what you bargained for but it's a little less than what you paid for
My bowtie's come undone, my microphone hangs limp on the mic stand

Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers
Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers

That guy I kinda hate is here
Should not have had that lastâ€¦woo! hit of DMT!
La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

What happened to that chubby little kid who smiled so much and loved The Beach Boys?
What happened is I killed that fucker and I took his name and I got new glasses
Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers
Tell my mother I'm going home, I have been destroyed by hippie powers9Embed
