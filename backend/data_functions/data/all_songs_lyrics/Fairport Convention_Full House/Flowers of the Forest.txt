Flowers of the Forest LyricsI've heard them lilting
At our ewe-milking
And I've heard them lilting
Before light o' day
Now they are mourning
For all time lamenting
The flowers of the forest
Are all wede away
Sad they for the order
That sent them to the border
The English by guile
For once won the day
Now they are mourning
For all time lamenting
The flowers of the forest
Are all wede away
I've heard them lilting
At our ewe-milking
And I've heard them lilting
Before light a-day
Now they are mourning
For all time lamenting
The flowers of the forest
Are all wede awayEmbed
