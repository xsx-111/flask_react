Walk Awhile LyricsWalk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together love, the better we'll agree
We'll agree
One hand in your mouth and a finger in your eye
Undertakers bow their heads as you go walking by
Walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together love, the better we'll agree
We'll agree
Here comes another Sunday, ringing on the bell
And here comes your own dear child with another tale to tell
Walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together love, the better we'll agree
We'll agree
Bring along the brewer's head, bring the cuckoo tree
Bring your lady mother along to keep us company
Walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together love, the better we'll agree
We'll agree
Two miles down the road, Henry Tomkins' wife
Three miles down the road, he's running for his life
Walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together love, the better we'll agree
We'll agree
O walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together love, the better we'll agree
We'll agreeEmbed
