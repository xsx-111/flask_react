Sloth LyricsJust a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun
Now the right things, the wrong things
No more excuses to come
Just one step at a time
And the war has begun
Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun
She's run away, she's run away
And she ran so bitterly
Now call to your colours, friend
Don't you call to me
Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Don't you cry upon the sea
Don't you cry, don't you cry
For your lady and me
Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun
Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begunEmbed
