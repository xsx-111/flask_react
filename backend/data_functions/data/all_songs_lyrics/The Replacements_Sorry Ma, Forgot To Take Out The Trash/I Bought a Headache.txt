I Bought a Headache LyricsAnd all I had needed was
Just a breath of fresh air
I want a, I want a folding chair

St. Paul Civic Center
Giving me a eight dollar and fifty cent
I bought a headache
I bought a headache
Headache
Smoking marijuana that's coming out of my ears
A long haired girl shaking way past her years
So come on, c'mon
So come on, c'mon
Eight dollar and fifty cent
I bought a headache
I bought a headache
Headache
I bought a

All right, thank you
Everybody feel alright?
Party alright
Everybody happy?
