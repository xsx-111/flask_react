Love You Till Friday LyricsSome girls are a pain in my life
When they try to be my wife
So some may come and some may go
Round each night
Just don't try to be my wife
Oh no, I'll call you on Friday
I'll call you on Saturday
I'll love you till Friday
Come on
Some girls are a pain in my life
When they try to be my wife
So some may come and some may stay
Out each night
If they try to be my wife
Oh no, I'll call you on Friday
I'll call you on Saturday
I'll love you till Friday
Come on, come on
Oh no I'll love you till Friday
I'll call you on Friday
I'll love you on Saturday
On Friday
On Friday
On Friday
On and on and on
(I'll call you later)Embed
