Careless LyricsYeah!
Irresponsibility's my closest friend
Forget my duty, obligation
Tell me about the city ordinance
Tell me that we're insubordinate
Plan tomorrow, money to borrow
I'm careless, careless
Couldn't care less, careless
I'm careless, careless
That's the way I stay
I never pay attention, watch my step
Never pay my bills, way in debt
Tell me about the fucking ordinance
Tell me that we're insubordinate
Plan tomorrow, money to borrow
I'm careless, careless
I'm careless, careless
So careless, careless
Yeah, that's the way I stay
Stay!
Stay!
Careless, careless
So careless, careless
Yeah, careless, careless
So careless, careless
Careless is the way I'll stayEmbed
