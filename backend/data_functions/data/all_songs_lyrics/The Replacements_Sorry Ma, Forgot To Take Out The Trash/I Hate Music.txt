I Hate Music LyricsI hate music
Sometimes I don't
I hate music
It's got too many notes
I hate my high school
Sometimes I went
Hate music
Man I never Heaven sent
Tommy said,"So"
Tommy said,"So"
Tommy said,"So"
Tommy said,"So so so so what?"
I hate my father
One day I won't
I hate father
Just got my back
I hate music
It's got too many notes
Are you listening?
So
Tommy said,"So"
Tommy said,"So"
Tommy said,"So"
Tommy
I hate music
Sometimes I don't
I hate my father
One day I won't
Hate music
Turning me on
I hate musicEmbed
