Shutup LyricsWell apathy's got a hold on me
And it won't let go
Tell me your problem, I'll tell you mine
Motherfucker you're gonna know
Well I can go for a change
Go for a jog
Tell me about your rock band
Tell me about your job
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
Well Tommy's too young
Bobby's too drunk
I only can shout one note
Chris needs a watch to keep time
We'll never find the time to vote
And I can for a change
Go for a job
Tell me about your girlfriend
Tell me about your job
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
Shut upEmbed
