Kick Your Door Down LyricsYour radio is playing rather loud
It don't sound like me
Your attitude you know, not so proud
That don't bother me
I'm gonna keep on knocking
Gonna keep on pounding
I knock, I'm gonna pound
I'm gonna knock
I'm gonna kick, kick your door down
Gonna kick, kick your door down
I wonder what goes on
Behind closed doors?
I'm waiting outside your door
Don't enter more
And so I keep on knocking
I keep on pounding
I knock 'em all, I pound 'em all
I knock, I pound
I'm gonna kick, kick your door down
Kick, kick your door down
Yeah, baby
Keep on knocking, keep on pounding, aah
Your radio is playing way too loud
And that don't sound like me
Your attitude just so proud
That don't bother me
Oh I'm gonna keep on knocking
Keep on pounding
I knock, I pound, I knock
Now I'm gonna kick, kick your door down
Kick, kick your door down
Kick, kick your door down
Kick, kick your door downEmbed
