More Cigarettes LyricsI don't watch the TV, I watch the clock
Party going up there on the block
The neighbors complain, that we can hear
I smoke my cigarettes, drink my cola
I need more cigarettes
More cigarettes, I need
Everybody's waiting, sittin' on a stool
Black leather jacket, and she's oh so cool
Everybody's waiting, they better show
Chased out back all the way home
More cigarettes
More cigarettes, I need
At six o'clock batten the hatches
We got cigarettes but ain't got no matches
I put some holes in my filter
Holes in my head
I better get better
I'm reading in bed
More cigarettes
Give me more cigarettes, I need
Gotta get more cigarettes
Got more cigarattes
Cigarette
They are nutsEmbed
