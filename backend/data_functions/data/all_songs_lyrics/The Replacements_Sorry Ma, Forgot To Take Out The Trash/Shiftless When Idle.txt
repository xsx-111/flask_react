Shiftless When Idle LyricsOh, everybody that's on my block
They're tired of me, that ain't no shock
And I ain't got no idols
I ain't got much taste
I'm shiftless when I'm idle
And I got time to waste, yeah
They tried to tell me that I should learn
They told me, it's best I wait my turn
I can't wait forever
I can't wait that long
I'm shiftless when I'm idle
I wanna play this
Oh! Na na, na na
Na na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
I thought so!
I'll get it!
Aah, I'm shiftless when I'm idle
I'm shiftless when I'm idle
I'm shiftless
I'm shiftlessEmbed
