Rattlesnake LyricsWow!
Cruising on my belly all night long, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, you got a rattlesnake, say, "I'm a rattlesnake"
I'm cruising on my belly all night long, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, 'cause I'm a rattlesnake, say, "I'm a rattlesnake"
I'm a rattle, rattle, rat, I'm a rattle, rattle, rat
I'm a rattle, rattle, rat, you hold on
I'm cruising on my belly all night long, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, 'cause I'm a rattlesnake, I'm a rattlesnake
A rattle, rattle, rat, I'm a rattle, rattle, rattle, rat
I'm a rattle, rattle, rat, but you know I'm a sticker
Ah! Cruising on my belly all night long, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, I'm a rattlesnake
So, I'm cruising on my belly all night long, you gotta hold on
You gotta hold on, 'cause I'm a rattlesnake, say, "I'm a rattlesnake"
I'm a rattlesnake, I'm a rattlesnake
Said I'm a...
Yeah, a rattlesnakeEmbed
