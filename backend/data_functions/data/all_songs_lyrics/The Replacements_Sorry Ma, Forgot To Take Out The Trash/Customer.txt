Customer Lyrics"Tape's rolling"
Okay, I'm in love with the girl who works at the store where I'm nothing but a customer!
I'm a customer
Yeah, I'm a customer
I'm a customer
How about cigarettes?
I'll take sugarless
You sell waternuts?
I'm a customer
I'm a customer
Customer
I'm a customer
Yeah, can I get change?
Ah, where're the Twinkies?
What's on sale?
I'm a customer
I'm a customer
I'm a customer
I'm a customer
I love you
Customer
I'm a customer
I'm a customer
I'm a customer
I'm in love with the girl who works at the store where I'm nothing but a customer
Oh!
I'm a customer
I'm a customerEmbed
