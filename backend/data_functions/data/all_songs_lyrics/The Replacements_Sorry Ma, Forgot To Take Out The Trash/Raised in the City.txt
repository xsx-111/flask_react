Raised in the City LyricsRaised in the city
Ready to run
Cruise to the lake
Fun fun fun
Disinclined to groove around
Raised in the city
Raised on beers
She gets rubber
In all four gears
Disinclined to lay down
Get outta my way
I can't see it
Outta my way
Can't see no band
Raised in the city
Ready to drop
Cruise to the lake
Call my pop
Tell him that I'm doin' just fine
Raised in the city
Ready to listen
Keep tellin' me
What I been missin'
Why don't you just sit down
Get outta my way
I can't see it
Outta my way
Can't see no band
Raised in the city
Ready to run
Cruise to the lake
Fun fun fun
Disinclined to groove around
Raised in the city
Till I'm old
Buy a car maybe
When I'm old
This my goddamn band
Outta my way
I can't see it
Outta my way
Can't see no band
Outta my way
I can't see it
Outta my way
Can't see no bandEmbed
