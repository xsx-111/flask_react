Pamphlets LyricsThat's why I don't go outside
That's why I don't go outside
Pale teeth and white smiles
They don't care and I don't mind
Pale bricks and wide smiles
That's why I don't go outside
I've got a brand new car right on my drive
But those pale bricks and white smiles
It's why I don't go outside
I don't go outside, outside, outside
I've got flagpoles firmly in my sights
I don't go outside, outside, outside
I've got flagpoles firmly in my sights
I don't go outside, outside, outside
I've got flagpoles firmly in my sights
Legs still but the herd is in motion
Legs still but the herd is in motion
Legs still but the hеrd is in motion
Could you do another and could we be in motion?
Lеgs still but the herd is in motion
Legs still but the herd is in motion
Legs still but the herd is in motion
Could you do another and could we be in motion?
Pamphlets through my door and pamphlets on my floor
Open wide, we've got everything, everything that you like
Pamphlets through my door and pamphlets on my floor
Open wide, we've got everything, everything that you like
Pamphlets through my door and pamphlets on my floor
Open wide, we've got everything, everything that you like
Pamphlets through my door and pamphlets on my floor
Open wide, we've got everything, everything that you like1Embed
