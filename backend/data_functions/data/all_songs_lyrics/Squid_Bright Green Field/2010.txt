2010 Lyrics
(All these eyes) In offices
(All these eyes) In palaces
(All in piles) When looking out
(All in piles) From ’round the table
(Losing sense) Meet for the feast
(Near stacked up files) Where there’s no taste
(All in lines) But just a flavour
(All in lines) Of things to come
(All these eyes) You’ll come inside
(All these eyes) You’ll be a friend
(And at night) We’ll satisfy
(And at night) Your every need
(All in piles) Your expectation
(All in piles) Your every need
(All in piles) Your expectation


(Locked in lines) And there’s a kink
(Fours or fives) It’s in the blanket
(All in lines) And on the spikes
(All in lines) But they weren't there
(All these eyes) The week before
(All these eyes) And they will shine
(All in piles) See your reflection
(Upside down) I’m upside down
(Upside down) You’re upside down
(All in piles) The wrong way round
(All in piles) And inside out
(Both so weak) I’m upside down
(Week by week) You’re upside down
(All in lines) I’m upside down
(All in lines) And inside out
(All in lines) I’m upside down
(All in lines) I’m upside down
(All in lines) I’m upside down
You’re upside down
I’m upside down
You’re upside down
I’m upside down
The wrong way round
