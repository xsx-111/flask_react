Sludge LyricsThere’s a place I go where I’m all alone
There’s a place I go where nobody knows
On my bed, one eye closed
I’m fixated on the endless glow
There's a place I go where I'm all alone
My ears are closed, the blinding glow shows videos of what I know
My minds made up, I see the glow of faces that I'll never know
I’m on my bed with one eye closed, the echo in my chamber grows
I’m on my bed with one eye closed, I sink my teeth in TV shows
Scrape my teeth out on the floor
I don’t want any more
Scrape my teeth out on the floor
I don’t want any more
Scrape my teeth out on the floor
I don’t want any more
Scrape my teeth out on the floor
I don’t want any more!
I’m lying on my bed
With celebrity chefs
But what do they know?
I’m lying on my bed
With celebrity chefs
But what do they know?
And I’m filtering through
And I’m bubbling up
And I think that's just about enough
When I’m lying
When I'm lying
When I'm lying1Embed
