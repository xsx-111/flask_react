Narrator Lyrics
I'm trying real hard, I think I've made it up
Flushing out your face with the features from a magazine
One slow sequence just to find my feet
Ten toes, I've got five on each

Losing my flow and my memories are so unnatural
I am my own narrator
Losing my flow and my memories are so unnatural
I am my own narrator

Footsteps erased
I'll play my part
Path doesn't change
Mould beauty out of clay
I'll play my part
Write words for me to say
The mirror guards his reflection
I'll play mine
A story becomes resurrection
I'll play mine
I'll play my part
I'll play my part
I'm trying real hard, I think I've made it up
Flushing out your face with the features from a magazine
One slow sequence just to find my feet
One slow sequence, well, that's all I need

Losing my flow and my memories are so unnatural
I am my own narrator
Losing my flow and my memories are so unnatural
I am my own narrator

Mold beauty out of clay
Write words for me to say
The mud is deep
It floored me
One person gained
Let me play
Let me narrate
I'll play my part
I'll play my part
I'll play my part
I'll play my part
Crystalline, so serene
I'll play, I'll play
Let me see
I can know of dying laces
Finishing parts
I'll play my part
I'll play my part
And then I'll play my part
I'll play my part
I'll play my part

I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine
I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play mine, I'll play
My part, my part
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play, I'll play
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play, I'll play3Embed
