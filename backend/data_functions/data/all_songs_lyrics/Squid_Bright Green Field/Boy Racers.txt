Boy Racers LyricsWere you mangled by a tree?
Were you a teen girl fantasy?
It's not okay that we can't sleep tonight
With boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racer, did you see that light?
No?
Okay
Are you suspended in time?
Does anyone even know what you might look like?
It's not okay that we can't sleep tonight
With boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racers in our dreams at night
Boy racer, did you see that light?
I always stayed at home
I always stayed at home
I always stayed at home
I should have stayed at homе
Your face
Doesn't age
And you'rе always small
And you're always small
( a photograph)
And there are things that you'll never know
Things that you'll never...1Embed
