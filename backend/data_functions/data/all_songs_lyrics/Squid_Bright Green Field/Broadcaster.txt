Broadcaster Lyrics
I'm in the tall grass
Broadcaster speaks to me
I'm as small as a bug
The lights are so pretty
I'm in the tall grass
Broadcaster speaking to me
I'm as small as a bug
The lights are so pretty

In the tall grass
Tall grass
Tall grass
In the tall grass
Yeah

Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?

In the tall grass
In the tall grass
In the tall grass
In the tall grass
In the tall grass
Can't you see me?
Yeah
