Paddling Lyrics
Patient, in control
(Patient and in control)
Dig holes like a mole
(Dig holes like a mole)
Patient, oars in stow
(Patient and oars in stow)
Just do what you're told
(But just do what you're told)

There are people inside
And they're changing in shape and in size
Where you going? Don't wanna go there
You comb your hair and you tense the muscle
There are people, there are people inside
When they're changing in shape and in size
Where you going? Don't wanna go there
But you comb your hair and you tense the muscle

Patient, in control
Dig holes like a mole
Patient, oars in stow
Just do what you're told
There are people, there are people inside
And they're changing in shape and in size
Where you going? Don't wanna go there
You comb your hair and you tense the muscle
There are people, there are people inside
And theyâ€™re watching while I'm taking the dive
Where you going? Don't wanna go there
But you comb your hair and you tense the muscle

Thrash 'round, make it worse
In your day of firsts
Sink down through the waves
Red faced now but safe

There are people, there are people inside
And they're changing in shape and in size
Where you going? Don't wanna go there
You comb your hair and you tense the muscle
There are people, there are people inside
Put me in a coat and set me in line
Where you going? Don't wanna go there
But you comb your hair and you tense the muscle
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Well, you're pushing me in
Well, you're pushing me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Well, you're pushing me in
Well, you're pushing me in

(You're pushing me in)
(You're pushing me in)
(I don't wanna go there)
(You're pushing me in)
(You're pushing me in)

Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me in
Don't push me inEmbed
