Peel St. Lyrics
-innit?

Oh, where were you when the ice came to town?
Oh, where were you when the ice came around?
You don’t remember? You don’t remember?
Was there enough to kill the whole damn street?
Was there enough to improve your swing?
You don’t remember? You don’t remember?
Where were you when thе ice came around?
Oh, wherе were you when the ice came to town?
You don’t remember? You don’t remember
Did your fame come a little too late?
Did you find it carries far too much weight?
You don’t remember? You don’t remember?

I’m falling in, I’m falling out
I’m falling back, I’m falling in
I’m falling out, falling in
Falling out, oh, Anna
Oh, Anna
I’m falling in, I’m falling out
I’m falling back, I’m falling in
I’m falling out, falling in
Falling out, oh, Anna
Oh, Anna
Well, I’ve always been told what to do
And now I’m free, there’s no warden following me
Following me
Following me

And now I’m free
There’s no warden following me
Following me
Following me
Following me
Following me
Following me
