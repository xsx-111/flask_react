G.S.K. Lyrics
As the sun sets on the GlaxoKline
Well, it's the only way that I can tell the time
Bright neon bikes on the hillside
Mosquito nets, they cover the buildings

On Concrete Island, I wave at the businessman
On Concrete Island, well, I hope my dinner is warm
On Concrete Island, I wave at the businessmen
On Concrete Island, well, I've been here far too long


(I go from pharmacy to pharmacy)
I'm speeding along, speeding along
(And from the shop to the floor)
I go through the windshiеld
(He says, "It's time you don't get back")
I'm speeding along, speeding along
(From thе other side of the wall)
I hope my dinner is warm
(When all of this has come to light)
(I'll be the one to deplore)
I'm speeding along
I pray to the G.S.K
I'm speeding along
(With the time I didn't get back)
(From the other sweet spot side of the wall)
I'm speeding along
(I go from pharmacy to pharmacy)
(From the shop to the floor)
I'm speeding along
(He said, "It's time you don't get back")
(From the other sweet spot side of the wall)2Embed
