Documentary Filmmaker Lyrics
Well, a documentary filmmaker passes by on the hospital ward
And a documentary filmmaker poses for a photo
And a documentary filmmaker goes home at the end of the day
But Iâ€™ll sit and watch the seasons change

Cause it was warm in the summer
Warm in the summer
Warm in the summer
Warm in the summer
But snowy in February
Snowy in February
Snowy in February
Snowy in February
The sweat dripped off my plastic sheets
Oh, the sweat dripped down onto my knees
It was warm in the summer
Warm in the summer
Warm in the summer
Warm in the summer
Oh, oh

Because the eggs are cheaper the day after Easter
And the eggs are always cheaper, the day after Easter
And I know, oh I know, it must be hard to pass them by
And I know, oh I know, he's filming all the timeEmbed
