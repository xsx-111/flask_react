Badhead Lyrics
So far I've not really stayed in touch
Well, you knew as much
It's no surprise that today
I get up around two from a lack of anything to do

And I might as well just grin and bear it
Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument

And you have not really stayed in touch
Well, I knew as much
It's no surprise that today
I get up around two with nothing to do, except get a touch of flu

And I might as well just grin and bear it
Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a bad head in the morning
And I know


And I might as well just grin and bear it
Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a bad head in the morning
So I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
You're like a bad head in the morning
And I know5Embed
