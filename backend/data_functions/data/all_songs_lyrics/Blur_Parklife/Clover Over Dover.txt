Clover Over Dover Lyrics
I'm on the white cliffs of Dover
Thinking it over and over
But if I jump, it's all over
A cautionary tale for you

I'd like to roll in the clover
With you over and over
On the white cliffs of Dover
And then I'd let you push me over

If that is the fact, then in actual fact
It's not where it's at, and it's over, oh-oh
If that is the fact, then in actual fact
I'm not where it's at, it's all over (Yes, it is)

And now the bluebirds are over
(I floated away)
Over the white cliffs of Dover
(Spent twenty years upon the sea)
And when you push me over
(And when I came back)
Don't bury me, I'm not worth anything
(I found that you turned into me)ï»¿
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la

If that is the fact, then in actual fact
It's not where it's at, and it's over, oh-oh
If that is the fact, then in actual fact
I'm not where it's at, it's all over (Yes, it is)

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
