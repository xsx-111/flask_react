End of a Century Lyrics
She says there's ants in the carpet, dirty little monsters
Eating all the morsels, picking up the rubbish
Give her effervescence, she needs a little sparkle
Good morning TV, you're looking so healthy

We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special

Sex on the TV, everybody's at it
The mind gets dirty as you get closer to thirty
He gives her a cuddle, they're glowing in a huddle
Good night TV, you're all made up and you're looking like me

We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special

Can you eat her?
Yes, you can
We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special
We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special, oh
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special8Embed
