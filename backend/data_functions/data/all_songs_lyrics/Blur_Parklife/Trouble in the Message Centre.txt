Trouble in the Message Centre Lyrics
I am the message centre
Local and direct
Room to room, an operator
(No calls today, dear, they'll just have to wait, dear)
I call and I collect
(So just strike him softly, away from the body)

You're made up too shiny today (In so much trouble)
Your thoughts are just pissing away (In so much trouble)
So much trouble

I am a manager
And I am in control
As the local delegator
(No calls today, dear, they'll just have to wait, dear)
I offer no guarantee at all
(So don't take it lightly, you'll put yourself under)

You're made up too shiny today (In so much trouble)
Your thoughts are just pissing away (In so much trouble)
A new typeface, a new day (In so much trouble)
You can't remember ten minutes ago (In so much trouble)
Too much trouble

La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la
(You'll put yourself under)

You're made up too shiny today (In so much trouble)
Your thoughts are just pissing away (In so much trouble)
A new typeface, a new day (In so much trouble)
You can't remember ten minutes ago (In so much trouble)
Just too much trouble

La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la4Embed
