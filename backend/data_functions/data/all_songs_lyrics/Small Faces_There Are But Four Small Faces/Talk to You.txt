Talk to You LyricsListen, it's been three months
Since I was last with you
So many people tryin' to
Stop me getting through
The doorman he just laughed
But I don't want no autograph
Now you listen to me baby
All I want to do
Is talk to you
You know I didn't stop you doing
Things you wanted to do
But now it's gone too far
It looks like I'm losing you
But I don't want sympathy
But please don't turn your back on me
Listen baby
All I want to do
Is talk to you
I got to talk to you
I got to try to make you see
Just how very very much
You mean to me
Would it be too much
To try and jog your memory
You remember me baby
I hope that I'm still
Part of your history
Now I don't wanna share your car
No no no, or stop you being a star
All I want to, all I wannna do
You know what I've gotta to do
Got to keep on tryingEmbed
