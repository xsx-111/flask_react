I Feel Much Better LyricsEasy and lazy we go
It seems so hazy and slow
(shoop shoop duweddy weddy)
Long before the long before we know
(shanga langa langa dulang)
Times were so high they were low
I'm only writing the rhyme
Dont find me taking my time
Please pass me my glass of wine
I feel much better
I feel much better
I feel much
(shoop shoop duweddy weddy x2)
Please feel aat home to come and go
(shanga langa langa dulang)
Easy and lazy and slow
(shoop shoop duweddy weddy)
Smiling so nicely to know
(shanga langa langa dulang)
Winds of good fortune must blow your way
These things won't come in a day
These things are coming to stay
There's really not much to say
I feel much better
I feel much better
I feel much
(shoop shoop duweddy weddy x7)
