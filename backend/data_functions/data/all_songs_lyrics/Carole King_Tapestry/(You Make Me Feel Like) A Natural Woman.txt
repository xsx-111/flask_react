(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman LyricsLooking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
(what you've done to me)
You make me feel so good inside
(good inside)
And I just want to be
(Want to be)
Close to you
You make me feel so alive
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
You make me feel
You know you make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
You know you, you make me feel
You make me feel like
You make me feel like
A natural woman
