Out in the Cold LyricsI only wanted to play
I thought what he didn't know
Wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and
Someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold
He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man
And he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing
Worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold
I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heartache
I'm paying, paying for my mistake
Now, girl, take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door
You may find the old one's closed
So be true to your good man
Take a lesson from this story I have told
Or you just might get left now
Out in the cold
You just might get left now
Out in the cold
Don't let yourself get left now
Out in the cold
Don't let yourself get left now
Out in the coldEmbed
