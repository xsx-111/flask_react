Smackwater Jack LyricsNow Smackwater Jack, he bought a shotgun
Cause he was in the mood for a little confrontation
He just let it all hang loose
He didn't think about the noose
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation
You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand
Shotgun
Now Big Jim the chief stood for law and order
He called for the guard to come and surround the border
Now from his bulldog mouth
As he led the posse south
Came the cry, we got to ride
Clean up the streets for our wives and our daughters
You can't talk to a man
When he don't want to understand
No, no, no, no, no, no
The account of the capture wasn't in the papers
But you know, they hanged ole Smack right then instead of later
You know the people were quite pleased
Cause the outlaw had been seized
And on the whole, it was a very good year
For the undertaker
You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand
Shotgun in his hand
Smackwater Jack, yeah
Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun
Yeah, Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun
Smackwater Jack, yeah
Smackwater Jack, yeah
Talkin' about Smackwater Jack, yeah
Talkin' about Smackwater Jack, oh
Talkin' about Jack and his shotgun
Talkin' about Smack, talkin' about Jack
Smackwater Jack, yeah2Embed
