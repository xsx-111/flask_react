River Styx LyricsWill you lay me down
Will you lay me down
Will you lay me down inside heaven's walls
Where every soul is a setting sun
Will you take my hand
Will you take my hand
Will you take my hand down to the water's edge
Where every sin has been washed away
But I can't run if I can't walk
And I won't love if I can't stop
Every minute the pressure drops
From your first breath 'til your heart stops
Will you let them pass
Will you let them pass
Will you let them pass across this killing floor
Where every shadow is cast in stone
But I can't run if I can't walk
And I won't love if I can't stop
Every minute the pressure drops
From your first breath 'til your heart stops
Carry me
Carry me
But you take
Take
It's never enough
You just take
Take
It's never enough
You just take
Take
Every part of me
All of meEmbed
