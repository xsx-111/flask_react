Long Way Down LyricsDon't you try to explain all the words that you've made for love?
But you can't even pray 'cause the words make you frail and hollow
Don't you cry to yourself just to feel like someone who's hit bottom?
But you can't run away 'cause the hole that remains will follow
Don't you care just enough?
Don't you feel your heart stop?
But you can't know what you want
But what matters now is enough
It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way out
It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way out
Don't you sleep in the day just to dream it away for good?
But I know you're afraid 'cause the best that you gave was not enough
Don't you care just enough?
Don't you feel your heart stop?
But you can't know what you want
But what matters now is enough
It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way out
It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way outEmbed
