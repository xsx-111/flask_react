The Toll LyricsI'd never known her to cry
But this time is different for sure
She's shaking with tears in her eyes
As she picks up what's left of the night
The hope for a reason seemed pure
As we leave what's left on the wall
But oh, how it's taken its toll
Oh, how it's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll
There was more than a break in the smiles
They rose and slowly they tired
As she turned the moments were made
There were none that could prove where she lay
There's a calm in the stories now told
And the distance will always be home
And oh, how it's taken its toll
Oh, how it's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll
It's a moment we carry alone
With a cause there's a cure for the soul
But oh, how it's taken its toll
Oh, how it's taken its tollEmbed
