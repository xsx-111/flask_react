1:51 LyricsJust give me something to feel
I’m waking out of a dream
Never had to feel love
Never had to really know
Just give me some other way
I’m holding on to the grave
Never had to realize
Never had a real love
I don’t need no one
I don’t want no one
I ain’t got no one
I don’t need no one
I don’t want no one
I ain’t got no one
I don’t need no one
I don’t want no one
I ain’t got no one
Don’t wanna be alone
Don’t wanna be alone
Just give me something to pray
The light is slipping away
Never had a real love
Never had to feel alive
I don’t need no one
I don’t want no one
I ain’t got no one
I don’t need no one
I don’t want no one
I ain’t got no one
I don’t need no one
I don’t want no one
I ain’t got no one
Don’t wanna be alone
I don’t need no one
I don’t want no one
I ain’t got no one
Don’t wanna be aloneEmbed
