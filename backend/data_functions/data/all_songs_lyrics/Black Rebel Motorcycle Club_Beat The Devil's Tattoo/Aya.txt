Aya LyricsShe's a reckless lover with blood-stained hands
Around the neck of her helpless man
She's the midnight silence, an outbound train
She's the glory of fallen names
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
She's a patient killer, a timeless hand
The choke of the falling sands
She's a proven saint with a witch's tongue
The gods of war at her command
Sweet Aya, bring it on, I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Sweet Aya, bring it on, I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Till they're all gone
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
She's the broken shadows on the fallen walls
With no master, there's no call
She's the faithful silence that visits all
With no mercy and no remorse
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
Sweet Aya, bring it on, I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Sweet Aya, bring it on, I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Till they're all gone
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're aloneEmbed
