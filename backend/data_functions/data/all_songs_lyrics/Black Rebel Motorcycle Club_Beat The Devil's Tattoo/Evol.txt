Evol LyricsI'm waiting for you to say
The words to make me stay
As you're walking out the door
My heart steps on the floor
I never dreamed it'd be
You make me feel so free
I'm waiting for you to say
The words to make me stay
As you're walking out the door
My heart steps on the floor
I never dreamed it'd be
You make me feel so free
It sure feels like love again
I wanna feel love again
It sure feels like love again
I wanna feel love again
I'm waiting for you to say
The words to let me stay
Standing here alone
I should have never shown
I never should have dreamed
The feeling's never free
It sure feels like love again
I wanna feel love again
It sure feels like love again
I wanna feel love again
I'm waiting for you to say
The words to let me stay
Standing here alone
I should have never shown
I never was the one
To leave things so undone
It sure feels like love again
I wanna feel love again
It sure feels like love again
I wanna feelEmbed
