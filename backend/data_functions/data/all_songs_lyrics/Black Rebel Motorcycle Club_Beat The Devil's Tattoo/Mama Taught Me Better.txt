Mama Taught Me Better LyricsCan you scream the words I could never hear?
Can you feel the silence begin to tear?
But it just takes so much to make it real
That it hardly matters
But if you could see inside yourself
Your world would shatter

My mama taught me better than that
Don't play with angels
If my lost soul could be given back
It would be fatal
Can you see a world you've never felt?
When you sleep the nightmare becomes yourself
But it just takes so much to make you sick
When your heart's a bullet
But if you could fill some lead in me
You would pass through it

My mama taught me better than that
Don't play with angels
If my lost soul could be given back
It would be fatal
Your soul keeps lifting away
My world keeps turning
And it brings me down
Yeah, it brings me down
Oh, you're so afflicted
Your love keeps burning
But it brings me down
Yeah, it brings me down
Can you scream the words I could never hear?
When you speak the silence begins to tear
But it just takes so much to make you sick
When your heart's a bullet
But if you could reach the edge in me
You won't break through it

My mama taught me better than that
Don't play with angels
If my lost soul could be given back
It would be fatalEmbed
