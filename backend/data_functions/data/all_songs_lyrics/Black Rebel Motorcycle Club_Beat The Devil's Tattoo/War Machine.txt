War Machine LyricsYou just turned so white
Never needed you so bad
There's nothing left to disguise
You never wanted it so bad
You don't need your soul
They'll keep you high
I keep chasing your ghost
But it all keeps us coming back for a little while
You don't look so good
But you smell like you would
You don't seem so proud
In the cries and thunder
And the ones you beg
They won't kiss it away
I just need your hand
When it all keeps coming down for a little while
Yeah, I called my friend the doctor
Just to keep your heart alive
He said I ain't too good at healing
But I'll make you stand
I need just one more line
I need you to stand tall
And it all keeps coming out into the light
You never seemed so cruel
It's just a question of time
We used a war machine
Now it burns out your spine
You don't prove your worth
You just make it obscene
Yeah, it ain't no crime to blow your mind
If it feels to you like a never ending dreamEmbed
