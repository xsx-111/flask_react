Let Me Sing Your Blues Away Lyrics
Well hop in the hack
Turn on the key
Pop in the clutch
Let the wheels roll free

Come on honey, let me sing them away
Come on honey, let me sing them away
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away

Give me a little of that old time love
Cause i ain't never had near enough
Honey, walk that walk with style and grace
This ain't no knock-down drag-out race
It don't matter much, pick any gear
Brind you a pound and drop the rear
Baby, baby what can i say
I'm here to drive those blues away
I sent a letter to a man i know
Said, "one for the money and two for the show."
I wait all summer for his reply
Said, "three to get ready and four to fly."
Only two things in the world i love
That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove
When i was a young man i needed good luck
But i'm a little bit older now and i know my stuff
