Troubled Waters LyricsI'm gonna drown down in those troubled waters
They're creepin' round my soul
They're way beyond control
And they'll wash my sins away before the morning
Oh, they say that I'm one of the devil's daughters
They look at me with scorn
I'll never hear that horn
I'll be underneath the water judgment morning
Oh lord, am I to blame?
Must I hang my head in shame?
Yeah, people go around scandalizing my name
I'm gonna drown down in those troubled waters
They're creepin' round my soul
They're way beyond control
And they'll wash my sins away before the morning2Embed
