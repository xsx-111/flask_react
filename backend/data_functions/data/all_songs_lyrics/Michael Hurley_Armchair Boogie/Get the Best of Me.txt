Get the Best of Me LyricsCome on and get the best of me
Come on and get the best of me!
Come on and love me big honey
Cause your lovin' sets me free!
You know somethin' right here, and I'll tell you for a fact
A man can't let easy ease
But soon as he get a little bit of slack
He starts reelin' it in till he's in a tight squeeze
Now I've been sailin' on the ocean for twenty-five years
Seen many a woman in her BVD's
But I ain't never seen a pair of ears flappin' like a mainsail flappin'
Like yours are, Dumbo, as I shoot the breeze
A long time ago I had to break down
And let you start to set me free
But, Mama, since I've been with you in town
I believe that it's got the best of me
Well if I could only take my easy ease
And see another woman walkin' in her BVD's
Then I believe I'd dive in and swim the sea
Like I let you, baby, get the best of me
Come on and get the best of me
Come on and get the best of me!
Come on and love me big honey
Cause your lovin' sets me free!
Cause your lovin' sets me free
Cause your lovin' sets me free!
Oh, you make me free an' easy
Like a sailboat on the sea
Like a sailboat on the sea
Like a sailboat on the sea...Embed
