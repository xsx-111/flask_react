Open Up LyricsOpen up eternal lips
And swallow me
Free fallin, through the abyss
That's where I want to be
I don't need no parachute
Can't you see the stars are winkin'?
This time I will uproot
And down in the sky go sinkin'
Take me up
Take me down
Through the milky way
I don't care about my crown
Neither night and day
Well it's just a little bit where I'm feelin' kinda naughty
Take me to the tit of the heavenly body
Open wide, let me slide
To sweet by and by
Let me glide, let me fly
Oh, don't you know why?
If I only had a care then I would begin to tryin'
To find a way somewhere to keep the night from dyin'
Open up eternal lips
And swallow meEmbed
