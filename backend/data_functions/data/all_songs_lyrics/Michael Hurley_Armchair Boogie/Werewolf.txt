Werewolf LyricsOh the Werewolf, Oh the werewolf
Comes a-stepping along
He don't even break the branches
Where he's been gone
You can hear his long holler
From way across the moor
That's the holler of a werewolf
When he's feeling poor
He goes out in the evening when
The bats are on the wing
And he's killed some young maiden before the birds sing
For the werewolf, For the werewolf
Have sympathy cause the werewolf
He's somebody like you or me
Once I saw him in the moonlight
When the bats were flying
All alone I saw the werewolf
And the werewolf was crying
Crying "Nobody, nobody
Nobody knows
How much I love the maiden as I tear off her clothes
Crying nobody, nobody
Knows my pain
When I see that it's risen, that full moon again"
When I see that moon moving
Through the clouds in the sky
I get a crazy feeling and I wonder why
Oh the werewolf, oh the werewolf
Comes traveling along
He don't even break the branches
Where he's been gone
For the werewolf have pity, not fear, and not hate
Because the werewolf might be someone
That you've known of late
Oh the werewolf, oh the werewolf
Comes traveling along
He don't even crush the leaves
Where he's been gone2Embed
