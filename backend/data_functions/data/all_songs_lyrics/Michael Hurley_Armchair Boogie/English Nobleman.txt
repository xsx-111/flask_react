English Nobleman LyricsOh, Oi am an English Nobleman
A Nobleman am Oi
My dignity would be besmirched
If you hit me in the face with a pie
My nobility is blended with senility
To this institution I've been committed
But the officials and me should have a cup of tea
And with that I should be aquitted
For Oi am an English Nobleman
A Nobleman am Oi
My dignity would be besmirched
If you hit me in the face with a pie
As a child I drew in the dust on the stairs
Envisioning sword fights frightful scary
But not a wielder of the sword became Oi
But a wielder of the common pie
For Oi am an English Nobleman
A Nobleman am Oi
My dignity would be besmirched
If you hit me in the face with a pieEmbed
