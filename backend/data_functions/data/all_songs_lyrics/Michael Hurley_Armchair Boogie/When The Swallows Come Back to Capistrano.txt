When The Swallows Come Back to Capistrano LyricsWhen the swallows come back to Capistrano
That's the time I hope that you'll come back to me
When you whispered "farewell" in Capistrano
That's the time the swallows flew out to the sea
All the mission bells would ring
The chapel choir would sing
The happiness you bring when we go
Hand-in-hand
When the swallows come back to Capistrano
That's the time I hope that you'll come back to me
When you whispered "farewell" in Capistrano
That's the time the swallows flew out to the seaEmbed
