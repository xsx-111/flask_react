Grand Canyon Line LyricsOn the Grand Canyon Line I was ridin', ridin' along!
On the Grand Canyon Line I was singin' those songs
On the Grand Canyon Line I was ridin' along
Couldn't go back to Texas, I know I done wrong
I passed the state bank and no money I had
Wasn't that I really meant to be bad
I robbed the state bank with a tremblin' hand
With the pistol and the money, through the big door I ran
On the Grand Canyon Line I was ridin', ridin' along!
On the Grand Canyon Line I was singin' those songs
On the Grand Canyon Line I was ridin' along
Couldn't go back to Texas, I know I done wrong
Sitin' all alone in a boxcar's four walls
Just cause of a break in the rich man's laws
I thought about my sweetheart and I started to cry
When I get caught by my neck I will die
The boxcar did open and a posse walked in
The sheriff said, "Now, grab him, boys, I think that's him!"
They took me to a jailhouse and now I must die
Five hours to live, how the time flies
On the Grand Canyon Line I was ridin', ridin' along!
On the Grand Canyon Line I was singin' those songs
On the Grand Canyon Line I was ridin' along
Couldn't go back to Texas, I know I done wrongEmbed
