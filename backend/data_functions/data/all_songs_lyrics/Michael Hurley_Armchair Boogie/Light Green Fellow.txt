Light Green Fellow LyricsI'm going to your house, gonna knock on the door
I'm going to your house, gonna knock on the door
Then you'll see your light green fellow once more
I'm a light green
I'm a light green fellow
Light green, I'm a light green fellow
There ain't nobody know
Your light green fellow
Looking all around, looking for the telephone
Looking all around, looking for the telephone
Thinking of calling you 'cause I know you're alone
Your sheets are green and your light is yellow
Your sheets are green and your light is yellow
Nobody knows your light green fellow
I'm a light green
I'm a light green fellow
Light green, I'm a light green fellow
Ain't nobody know
Your light green fellow
Looking in the window, but it's so dark I don't see you
Looking in the window, but it's so dark I don't see you
Why don't you light a candle?
Your curtains are drawn, but I'd see through
Looking in the window, but it's so dark I don't see you
Looking in the window, but it's so dark I don't see you
Why don't you light a candle?
Curtains are drawn, but I'd see throughEmbed
