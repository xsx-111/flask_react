Biscuit Roller LyricsTell me, Corrine
Where your biscuit roller gone?
Don't your house look lonely when you find your daddy moving on?
You can always tell
When your woman got another man
When your meals ain't ready and your house ain't never clean
I wonder what
What made grandpa
Crazy about my grandma so
She got the same old "celle" that she had 30 years ago
I got something to tell you
Make the hair rise on your head
I got something to tell you
Make the springs fry on your bed(?)
Sometimes you make me wonder
Momma where'd you get your
Momma where'd you get it from
You got your sugar from your pappy way down on the sugar farmEmbed
