Sweedeedee LyricsMy little woman causes me a whole lot of trouble sometimes
She worries me so bad
I don't know what to do
I take a walk
Figure the rolling of my feet would come to ease my mind
I'll just go away
And I won't know
Where I'm going
And I won't know where
That I am going to
Cause she bugger me
She bugger me
Oh man, she'd bugger you
I'm with you in the morning, baby
'till the break of day
I know you won't take my heart
Tryin' to make me go away
Seems like everybody
Has got a little hard luck, sometime
And I know one thing for sure, baby
I've been having mine
We had one of them old fleabag apartments
You know the kind I mean
You walk up on the fifth floor there
Sometimes on a sunny day from the roof
You can see them flying kites in Washington Square
I go up on the roof and I watch her hanging up the clothes and I'd say to her:
"Wash the clothes, Sweedeedee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way you wash the clothes
Your cooking must be fine"
I'm with you in the morning, baby
'till the break of day
Well, I know you don't want my heart
Tryin' to make me go away
Seems like everybody
Got a little hard luck sometime
And I know one thing for sure
I've been having mine
I remember that old scumbag coffee shop we used to hang out at
The manager there he'd let us stay without paying a cover
And I was always asking her sometime
We gotta leave the city
And I'd say to her:
"You wash them clothes, Sweedeedee
And hang 'em on the line
And I can see by the way
You wash the clothes
Your cooking must be fine"
I'm with you in the morning baby
'till the break of day
I know you won't take my heart
Don't make me go away
Seem like everybody
Got a little hard luck, sometime
And I know one thing for sure, baby
I've been having mine
Baby, I've been having mine
You wash them clothes, Sweedeedee
And hang them on the line
And I can see by the way
You wash the clothes
Your cooking must be fine1Embed
