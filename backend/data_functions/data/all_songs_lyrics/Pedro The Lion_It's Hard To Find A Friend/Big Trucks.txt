Big Trucks Lyrics
Dad, Dad, why did you let that man
Push you around like that?
You should have beat him down
Down to the ground
Down to the ground for that

He said son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun

There's real people in the big, big trucks
That you flip off when they get in the road
You get so hacked that you pay no mind
To the great big sign that says 'oversize load'
Do you really think they can go as fast
As you in your '87 Trans Am?
They know you're in such a terrible rush
But they're going just as fast, as fast as they can

Dad, Dad, I really don't understand
What driving big trucks has to do with that man
You shoulda' taught him a lesson about being rude
About talking to you with such an attitude
He said son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun

There's real people in the big, big trucks
That you flip off when they get in the way
You get so hacked that you pay no mind
To the great big sign that says 'oversize load'
Do you really think they can go as fast
As you in your '87 Trans Am?
They know you're in such a terrible rush
But they're going just as fast, as fast as they canEmbed
