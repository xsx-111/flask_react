The Well Lyrics
If you could really see
Then you would ask of me
She knew the well was far too deep
For him to wet his lips
But something told her that he spoke
Of so much more than all of this

When he spoke she wanted to believe
The things he said
But who could this man be
That she might never thirst again
Her heart raced
Could he be the one
We've waited for
The one we've waited forEmbed
