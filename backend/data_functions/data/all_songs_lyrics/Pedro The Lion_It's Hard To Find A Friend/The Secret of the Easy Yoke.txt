The Secret of the Easy Yoke Lyrics
I could hear the church bells ringing
They pealed aloud your praise
The members' faces were smiling
With their hands out stretched to shake
It's true they did not move me
My heart was hard and tired
Their perfect fire annoyed me
I could not find you anywhere

Could someone please tell me the story
Of sinners ransomed from the fall
I still have never seen you
And some days I don't love you at all

The devoted were wearing bracelets
To remind them why they came
Some concrete motivation
When the abstract could not do the same
But if all that's left is duty
I'm falling on my sword
At least then I would not serve
An unseen distant lord
Could someone please tell me the story
Of sinners ransomed from the fall
I still have never seen you
And some days I don't love you at all

If this is only a test
I hope that I'm passing
Cause I'm losing steam
And I still want to trust you

Peace, be still
Peace, be still
Peace, be still
Peace, be stillEmbed
