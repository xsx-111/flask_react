When They Really Get to Know You They Will Run Lyrics
What makes you think that it won't grow back
In a day or two?
Husbands in winter, they know the truth
But what can they do?

I don't like girls the way they are
So shave their legs and make them look like movie stars
Then we can pretend that it's natural

Put on whatever makes you attractive
If it's not you then do it for the sake of fashion
Your friends like a certain you
That's who you've got to be

Junior high legs, blond hair gone brown
From removing it
Waxing since thirteen, wisdom from a beauty queen
Her tiara digging deep in her head

Put on whatever makes you attractive
If it's not you then do it for the sake of fashion
Your friends like a certain you
That's who you've got to be
That's who you've got to be
I'm starting to think that I'm kind of shy
Or at least I'd like to be

Winter legs give me heart attacks
So take it off with lasers so it never comes back
Then we can pretend it's naturalEmbed
