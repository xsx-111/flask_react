Bad Diary Days Lyrics
Barely ever fight, she knows that I love her
At first we made it every night, but I don't wanna bug her about it
She just has a funny way of loving me

A pair of ticket stubs in her desk - a movie I'd never seen
I probably shouldn't ask - it sounds so accusing
She must have forgotten to mention girl's night out

The breakfast cereal talked more than we did all day long
I asked her for a walk, but she had to be on her way
So I told her that I knew she'd been stepping out

She swore that she could explain
She swore that it would not happen again
She swore that she could explain
We both knew her words were in vain2Embed
