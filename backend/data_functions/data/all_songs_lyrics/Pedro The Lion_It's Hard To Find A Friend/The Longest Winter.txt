The Longest Winter Lyrics
Spring comes slowly
To this old frame
Still I'm frozen
I still live alone
In time memories fade
Senses numb
One forgets how it feels
To have loved completely

Love well, young man
While you still can
Once your leaves turn
You won't love again
In time memories fade
Senses numb
One forgets how it feels
To have loved completely, completely
Is it special when you're lonely?
Will you spend your whole life
In a studio apartment
With a cat for a wife?
The seasons when they call you
Do you barricade the door?
Are you stubborn, stubborn
Stubborn to the core?
Is it your way, or the highway?
Is it your way, or the highway?
Then the longest winter is on her way
You called her without knowing it
And now it's too lateEmbed
