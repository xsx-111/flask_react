Promise Lyrics
I'll take something to believe
Something with long sleeves, cause it's unpredictable
That Jesus said He'd fill my needs, but my heart still bleeds
He's just not physical
Why can't I see?

If I look up and the sky's not there
Is there any reason that I should be scared?
But a promise, is a promise, I know

Now we've established a lack of sight
Maybe vision's the right word
And when I need, cause I can't see with human eyes
Lord knows I've tried to follow where He leads me
Why can't I see?


For what I've seen so far
I can't believe my eyes
And what a nice surprise
