Suspect Fled the Scene Lyrics
Your horse is ready to ride when morning comes
From this church town
Where damning rumors drip from holy tongues

It won't go away
It won't go away
It won't go away

Fever to find the scapegoat fast and fix the blame
I know you never meant to leave the way you came


Looking down from that stain glass steeple
They'll never know why you had to run

Ride as fast as you can
They're shooting to killEmbed
