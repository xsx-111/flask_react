Of Up and Coming Monarchs Lyrics
Sunken ships rest
Upon the ocean floor
Where I've made my home
To dodge the draft once more

There once was a time
One could flee to the north
But Canada's not what she used to be
Boycott the war, well she could not afford to
Thanks to the new American queen

Swim with me and we'll escape
All the trouble of the present age
Finally free

The mermaids teach us
How to breath beneath
The line that now divides
Action from apathy

Swim with me and we'll escape
All the trouble of the present age
Finally freeEmbed
