The Longer I Lay Here Lyrics
You're up with the sunrise
And down when the work's been done
With excellence, industry, diligence
Naturally, I would like to be you
Just for a few habit-forming years
Laziness cuts me like fine cutlery

I need a miracle, someone to help me help myself

Sweet Jesus, I need you
Forgive me this sin
Not hookers or heroin, gambling or gin
It sounds so ridiculous but I just can't lick this
