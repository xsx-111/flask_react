Johnny Too Bad LyricsWalking down the road
With no blade in your hand
Johnny you're too bad, that's what they say
Walking down the road
With a blade in your waist
Oh Johnny you're too bad, Johnny you're too bad
With your blade come flicking, You're licking, and sticking
Too bad
With your running, and shooting,looting and tooting
You're too bad
Cos one of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Ooh, Johnny too bad
One of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Cos Johnny, you're so bad
Ooh, That's what they tell me about you
With you licking and sticking
Switchblade a picking
Too bad
With you're looting, your're shooting, looting, your tooting
You're too bad
That's what they say about you
Walking down the road
You're going to hear a voice say
Come, Johnny, where you're going to run to
Come that sweet day
You be walking down the road
You'might hear a voice say
Come, Johnny, where you're going to run to
Come that sweet day
You might run to the rock for rescue
You'll find no rock, you'll find no rock there
Run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock, be no rock at all
Walking down the road
With a blade in your waist
Johnny you're too bad, Johnny you're too bad
Walking down the road
With a blade in your, with a blade your waist
You're too bad Johnny, too bad Johnny, too bad Johnny
With your blade a picking, switchblade licking
Too bad
With your licking and sticking, blade come picking
Too bad, that's what they say about you
With your blade come licking, licking, sticking
That's what they say about you
Licking, sticking, too bad
Johnny go walking
Ooh, Johnny go talking
Johnny go walking
Johnny go talking
Johnny go walking now
Johnny go talking
Johnny go walking out
Johnny go walking
Johnny go walking outEmbed
