Our Love LyricsOh baby, take a look
Take a look in your heart for me, baby
Baby take a look, take a good look, baby
Baby take a look in your heart
Our love
Once was sweeter than the April rain
But now I have to beg before you even say my name
Our love
Once was warmer than a summer's day
And now I have to ask before you even want to look my way
People go talking
People go talking around
Putting us down, putting us down
Putting us down, putting us down
People go talking
But they don't talk to me
I know they just don't see
Our love
Once was you and me against this world
Made a man from a boy
And made a woman from a little girl
Our love
Once was deeper than the darkest blue could be
Now I find
I have to search my mind
To find the smallest trace of you in me
Lovers part
You can read about it
Can read about it every day
Read about it every day
Lovers part
Then they just walk away
Our love
Once was sweeter than the April rain to me
Now I find I have to beg before you call my name
Please call my name, please call my name, and
Baby take a look, take a good look, baby
Baby take a look in your heart
Baby take a look, take a good look, baby
Baby take a look in your heart
Baby take a look, baby take a look
Baby take a look in your heart for me
Ah baby, please babyEmbed
