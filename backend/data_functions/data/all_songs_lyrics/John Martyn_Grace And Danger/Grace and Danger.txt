Grace and Danger LyricsYou know I wished you all you wish yourself
It makes me feel so good to know you've found somebody else
You want a word from me
I'll give you two
I mutter desperately darling
As you say goodbye
As I start to cry
Grace and danger
Grace and danger, grace and danger
Grace and danger, grace and danger
Sort of pretty in an ugly sort of way
Jagging strokes and hustling folks every live long day
My heart goes out to you
I think of me
I mutter desperately darling
As they say goodbye
Let me wish you as you fly
Grace and danger
Grace and danger
I never knew the road that carried me along
Crazy sidewalk, concealed by pretty song
You want my life from me
I'll give you two
You'll be no strife for me
As we say goodbye
Let me wish you as you fly
Grace and danger
Sweet grace
No danger
Sweet grace
No danger
Grace and dangerEmbed
