Baby Please Come Home LyricsBaby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby baby, please, come home
I'll try to put the things we've done
Back where they belong
And that's in the past
I need our love to last
But I feel somehow to blame
For the way our love has changed
But please believe me
I just can't stand to see you go
And I swear that I don't know
Just what made me hurt you so
What made you want to go
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby baby please, baby please, baby please, come home
Try to put the things I said
Right out of your head
I didn't mean a single one
Now you see what words have done
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby please, baby please, baby please, baby please come home
Try to put the things we've done
Back where they belong
That's in the past
I need our love to last
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby baby, please come home, please come homeEmbed
