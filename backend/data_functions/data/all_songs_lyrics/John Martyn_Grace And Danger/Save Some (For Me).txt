Save Some (For Me) LyricsSave some
Save some
Just save some
Won't you save some for me
Please save some
Won't you save some for me
Oh, I felt so crazy when I read your little letter
Saying you were never coming home
Every day I wake up, now I feel a little better
Cos the way I live I'll never be alone
Save some
Try to save some for me
Oh Won't you save some
Please save some for me
I told my friends about us, and the way you feel about me
Through your teeth with every second word
I felt you like Ophelia in a repertory failure
Demented in a theatre absurd
Oh but I saved some
You didn't get it all, 'cause I
Save some for me
Yes, I save some
Ooh tell you, I save some for me
Should you read about me when you read your silly papers
Just pretend you never knew my name
Should I ever feature you when you
Talk to your, talk to your, talk to your neighbours
Tell them that I never played the game
Cos I saved some
You didn't get it all
Cos I saved some for me
Oh yes, I saved some
(I cheated on the side)
Yes I saved some for me
Yes I saved some
You didn't get it all, didn't get it all
Cos I save somed for me
Yes I saved some
Oh darling, saved some for me
Just a little bit, just a little bit for me
Just a little bit, saved some
Won't you save some
Won't you save some for meEmbed
