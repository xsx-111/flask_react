Hurt in Your Heart LyricsWhen that hurt in your heart has gone;
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Give me a call
Darling, that's all that you have to do
Show me a sign;
A word or a line
One stitch in time
To save this poor heart
From breaking
When that hurt in your heart has gone;
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
I'll still be your friend
Right to the end of forever
And further still
This hurting will mend
And I hope you'll remember all the time;
Hope you'll remember every line
Hope you'll remember
All the love, all the love, all the love
{guitar solo}
When that hurt in your heart has gone;
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Just say my name
You don't have to say it loud;
I'll still feel the same
And I'll still be true
Waiting for you
To come sailing through
'Cause you know you can
When that hurt in your heart has gone;
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Give me a call...Embed
