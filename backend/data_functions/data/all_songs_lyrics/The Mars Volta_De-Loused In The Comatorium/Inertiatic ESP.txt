Inertiatic ESP Lyrics
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

Last night I heard lepers
Flinch like birth defects
Its musk was fecal in origin
As the words dribbled off of its chin
Which said "I'm lost, I'm lost"

Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils
Cast in oblong arms length
The hooks have been picking their scabs
Where wolves hide in the company of men
Which said "I'm lost, I'm lost"
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

Are you peaking in the red?
Perforated at the neck
What of this mongrel architect
A broken arm of sewers set
Past present and future tense
Clip side of the pink-eyed fountain
What of this mongrel architect
A broken arm of sewers set
Past present and future tense
Clip side of the pink-eyed fountain

Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
It's been said
Long time ago
You'll be the first
And last to know
Aaah
You'll never know
Aaah
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know11Embed
