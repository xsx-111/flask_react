Drunkship of Lanterns Lyrics
You've got the lot to burn
A shelve of pig-smothered cries
Is there a spirit that spits
Upon the exit of signs?
Is anybody there? (Spined in a row)
These steps keep on growing long (Spined as an arrow)
Bayonet trials
Rust propellers await

Nobody is heard
Rowing sheep smiles for the dead
Nobody is heard

An antiquated home
Afloat with engines on mute
Sui generis ship spined around the yard
Is anybody there? (Spined in a row)
These craft only multiply (Spined as an arrow)
At the nape of ruins
Rust propellers await
No

Nobody is heard
Compass wilting in the wind
(kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod)
Nobody is heard
Rowing sheep smile for the dead
Trans-oceanic depths in this earth
In this cenotaph
Lash of a thousand eye-brows clicking
Counting the toll, counting the toll

You've got the lot to burn
A shelve of pig-smothered cries
Is there a spirit that spits
Upon the exit of signs?
Is anybody there? (Spined in a row)
These steps keep on growing long (Spined as an arrow)
Bayonet trials
Rust propellers await
No

Nobody is heard
Compass wilting in the wind
(kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod)
Nobody is heard
Rowing sheep smile for the dead
Trans-oceanic depths in this earth
In this cenotaph

(kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod)
Carpal jets hit the ground
Carpal jets hit the ground
Carpal jets hit the ground
Carpal jets hit the ground
Lash of one thousand eyebrows clicking
Counting the toll, counting the toll
Lash of one thousand eyebrows clicking
Counting the toll, counting the toll4Embed
