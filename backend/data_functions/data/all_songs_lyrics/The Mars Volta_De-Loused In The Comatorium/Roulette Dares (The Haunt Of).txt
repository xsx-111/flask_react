Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of) Lyrics
Transient jet lag
Ecto mimed bison
This is the haunt of roulette dares
Ruse of metacarpi
Caveat emptor
To all that enter here

Open wrists talk back again in the wounded of its skin
They'll pinprick the witness in ritual contrition
The AM trinity fell upon asphyxia-derailed
In the rattles of
Made its way through the tracks of a snail slouching whisper
A half-ass commute through umbilical blisters
Specter will lurk, radar has gathered
Midnight neuces from boxcar cadavers

Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
It's because this is

Cranial bleeding
Leeches train the living
Cursed are those who speak its name
Ruse of metacarpi
Caveat emptor
To all that enter here
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
It's because this is

Rattling the laughter, hinges splintering inside
Bludgeoned to a saddle, rang the cloister bell inside
Oh, oh, oh
Inside
Inside

Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed
It's because this is9Embed
