Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt Lyrics
You must have been phlegmatic in stature
The gates of Thanos are-a spread eagle wide
You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes
Out of a blind man's picaresque heart

You take the veil
You take the dive
You take the veil

It's not over till the tremulant sings
These ides of March, are they so make believe?
How tempts the revenant
Slice up and not across

You take the veil
You take the dive
You take the veil

A mass of gallon sloth (They're gonna get you)
As flies have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim (You better run now)
Someone said, but who's to know?
And when you find the fringe (They won't let you)
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary (You better fight now)
Spilling by the day

Iconoclastic had it coming for years
They know the prisons you have yet to fear
Where thumbs hide inside of sleeping bag mouths
Ad-libbing memoirs, casting a drought

You take the veil
You take the dive
You take the veil

A mass of gallon sloth (They're gonna get you)
As flies have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim (You better run now)
Someone said, but who's to know?
And when you find the fringe (They won't let you)
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary (You better fight now)
Spilling by the day

Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again
Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again

Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again
Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again

Oh! Virulent hives of bedpost piles
Virulent hives, virulent hives
Who brought me here?
Forsaken, deprived and wrought with fear
Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now
Who brought me here?
Forsaken, deprived and wrought with fear
Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now
Who brought me here?1Embed
