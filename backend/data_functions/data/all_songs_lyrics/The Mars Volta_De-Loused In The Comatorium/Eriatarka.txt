Eriatarka Lyrics
And there are those who
Hadn't found the speaking so wrong
Is it wrong?
Of Pavlov lore
They ran rampant through the floors, is this wrong?
Feels so wrong
Happened on a respirator
In the basement, are they gone?
Are they gone?

Strung the slang of a gallows bird
Rationed a dead letter pure

Track-marked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet
Tentacles smirk please, flinched the cocooned meat
Infra-recon forget

Now there are those who find
Comfort in the breathing wrong
Is it wrong?
It houses the watchful eyes
They're panting in a pattern in droves
Are they gone?
Happened on a respirator
In the basement, is it gone?
Are they gone?
Strung the slang of a gallows bird
Sanctioned a dead letter pure

Track-marked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet
Tentacles smirk please, flinched the cocooned meat
Infra-recon forget

Evaporated the fur, because it covers them
If you only knew the plans they had for us
Evaporated the fur, because it covers them
If you only knew the plans they had for us
They used to have pulses in them
But impulse has made them strong
They used to have pulses in them
But impulse has made them strong
Evaporated the fur, because it covers them
If you only knew the plans they had for us

Track-marked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet
Tentacles smirk please, flinched the cocooned meat
Infra-recon forget
Gotta be a way of getting out
Are you just growing old?
Track-marked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet2Embed
