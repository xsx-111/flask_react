Cicatriz ESP Lyrics
Do you recall its name
As if suggested beck and call
This face and heel
Will drag your halo through the mud ash of Pompeii
Erupted in a statue's dust
Shrouded in veils
Because these handcuffs hurt too much
Still scalping this ticketless applause
And when they drag the lake
There's nothing left at all

Sutured contusion
Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said, "I've lost my way"
Even if this cul-de-sac would pay
To reach inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling-clear blackened-ice
And when they drag the lake
There's nothing left at all

I've defected
I've defected
I've defected
I've defected
Sutured contusion
Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said, "I've lost my way"
Even if this cul-de-sac did pay
To reach inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling-clear blackened-ice
And when they drag the lake
There's nothing left at all

I've defected
I've defected
I've defected
I've defected


Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said, "I've lost my way"
Even if this cul-de-sac did pay
Beyond the anthills of, beyond the anthills of
Said, "I've lost my way"
Even if you, even if you, even if you
Who reached inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling-clear blackened-ice
And when they drag the lake
There's nothing left at all
I've (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
Defected (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
I've (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
Defected (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
I've (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
Defected (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
I've (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
Defected
