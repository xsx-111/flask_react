Ella Megalast Burls Forever LyricsWhen the night time burrows
Through my heart, love
Now, now, now the knife
Through my heart
None of it (none of it)
Seems so bad (seems so bad)
With a wink from (wink from)
You dear (you dear)
None of it (none of it)
Seems so bad (seems so bad)
With a wink from (wink from)
You dear (you dear)
Dear
The next day’s (the next day’s)
Worth the wait (worth the wait)
But when you (when you)
Rush to join up all of the days
(Join up all of the days)
The next day’s (the next day’s)
Worth the wait (worth the wait)
But when you (when you)
Run to join up all of the dots
(When you join up all of the dots)
The next day's (the next day's)
Worth the wait (worth the wait)
When you (when you)
Join up all of the dots (join up all of the dots)
(When you join up all of the dots)
When the night time burrows
(Get a load the devil crawled through my own door)
Through my heart
(Shame on you and me)
Then hold on love
(Get a load the devil crawled right through my door)
On to my heart
(Shame on you and me)
Now, now, now, now the knife
(Get a load the devil crawled through my own door)
Through my heart
(Shame on you and me)
Now, now, now, no one knows
(Get a load the devil crawled right through my door)
