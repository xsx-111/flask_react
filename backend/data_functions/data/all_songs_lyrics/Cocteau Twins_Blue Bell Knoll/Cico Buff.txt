Cico Buff LyricsEach day love found stone little
You see your singing is so vain
Each day love found stone little
Because you're fickle, oh that I find
So many stars take care of you
Let it out, we’re all inside your heart (let it out)
My love, my love
Love me, see no little
It seemed you looked like the sky was out
Our love will achieve no little (our love will)
Because you're fickle, oh that I find
So many stars take care of you
Let it out, lover, we’re all inside your heart
Our love, our love
There’s no weather like ours
All the marvel (all the marvel)
Strange and lovely
It’s just a second, start to stop
It’s just a second, start to stop, stop
It’s just a second, start to stop
It’s just a second, start to stop, stop, stop, stop
There’s no weather like ours
(We fall awake, be quiet)
I am not a normal woman
(We fall oh, with the devil)
Strange and lovely
So many stars take care of you
(These stars awake, be silent)
Full of love, love falling down
(These stars oh, with the devil)
Our love
There’s no weather like ours
(These stars awake, be silent)
Full of love, love falling down
(These stars oh, with the devil)
Strange and lovely day1Embed
