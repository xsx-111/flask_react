The Itchy Glowbo Blow LyricsStill slenderer than me
Less tall
He learned how
How a pepper-tree (he reads)
Lights off (can they do)
And you know just a fact
Several things don’t fit
He’s a star
Once again it’s a fact
That now you’re
Accomplishing your goals (accomplish your goals)
Far more
He learned he
How a pepper-tree (he)
Silence (he flailed)
So glad he
Cares
So glad he
Slowly died but sometimes
Where your face goes
To be tough
Those are things in your life
That a man loves
Emotional fever (emotion fever)
Futile
He learned how
How a pepper-tree (fever)
So cruel (this fever)
I do not
So don’t test me
You never glance
The wind never blows (the wind never blows)
To see
He learned how
How a pepper-tree (fever)
So cruel (this fever)
The spirit of life found me now
The spirit of life found me now
The spirit of life found me now
The spirit of life found meEmbed
