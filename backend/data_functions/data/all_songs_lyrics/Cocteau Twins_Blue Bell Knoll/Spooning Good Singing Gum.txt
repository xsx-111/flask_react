Spooning Good Singing Gum LyricsDays, nervous
Long by the sea
Love, long-found love
Long, long ago
Love, love (happy)
Happy love (love)
Love, love (happy)
(Cute love, cute love)
Do they find love?
Do they find love?
Happy in bed
Happy in bed
Love, long-blown love
Damaged by the sun
Days spent, bed made
Queueing on the floor
Love, love (happy)
(Love, love)
Love, love (happy)
(Cute love, cute love)
Do they find love?
Do they find love?
Happy in bed
Happy in bed
Do they find love?
Do they find love?
Happy in bed
Happy in bed
She lets memories go
Whatâ€™s sad goes
So long ago
Tell me sweet nothingsEmbed
