Blue Bell Knoll LyricsIt deshna dmula lono showa
I make up hundreds so always know how to make love
There, you can have my youth, itâ€™s not what I have loved
Start off to see him, not happily be
Tyearn abet yar atsad bedao
Drreol oh
Pasis disea mala faghat ama
And I have been so completely busy
Amentyao isna pagho
And your spangle, oh how it hurts, and I have had this feeling
Tyearn abet yar atsad bedao
Drreol oh
Tyearn abet yar atsad bedao
Drreol oh1Embed
