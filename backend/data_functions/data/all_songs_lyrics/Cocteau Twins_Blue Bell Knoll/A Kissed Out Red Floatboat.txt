A Kissed Out Red Floatboat LyricsI'm standing here
If I said “love,” you’d listen, my heart
Made love if you said
I thought he'd known love
Even but
He's so mean to her
Feonao hagaocolo dnula love
Eadu nasgha hedu lusogh gardea
He needed all, could he handle it
He had all he needed, all
He needed all, could he handle it
He needed all, could he handle it
I've been here
Herios mor hae asforpag
And I got what you’re here for
He gave me love
Haegi mi
He loved you, you know
He needed all, could he handle it
He had all he needed, all
He needed all, could he handle it
He needed all, could he handle it
He needed all, could he handle it
He had all he needed
He needed all, could he handle itEmbed
