For Phoebe Still a Baby LyricsLittle baby
No one gonna see
Hold your answer, be right out
And maybe
At a good time
Phoebe then I'll suck you out
Who says (who says)
I’ll never do it?
Listen, never doubt
Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (this whole world shines)
Don't tell (don’t tell)
Please smile angel
Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (it never grows cold)
Take thirty moonbeams
And a guitar
Phoebe first and suck you out
Little baby
No one better see
Caught your answer, be right out
Don’t speak (listen now)
Feed us (listen to me, dove)
Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (this whole world shines)
It's all the same
Please smile angel
Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (it never grows cold)
Who says (who says)
I’ll never do it?
Listen, never doubt
Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (this whole world shines)
Don't tell (don’t tell)
This whole world shines
Dawn and shine your heart from heaven (it never grows cold)Embed
