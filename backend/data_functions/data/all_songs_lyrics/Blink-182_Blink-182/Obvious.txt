Obvious Lyrics
I saw you again
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think you used me again
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Should we try this before we give up and move on?
And pretend to restore what we have and hold on

At times like these
It's obvious

I saw you again
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know you fucked him again
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you comfort yourself with the sense of revenge?
Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end?

At times like these
It's obvious
At times like these
It's obvious
I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never had vision?
I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never had vision?

I saw you again and again and again (At times like these)
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again (It's obvious)
How do we fix this if we never had vision?
I saw you again and again and again (At times like these)
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again (It's obvious)
How do we fix this if we never had vision?4Embed
