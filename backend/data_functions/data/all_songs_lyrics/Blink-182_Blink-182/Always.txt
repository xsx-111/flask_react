Always Lyrics

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me

So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you all night, always

And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real

So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you all night, always
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you all night, always

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying

Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you all night, always
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you all night, always

Always...
