Stockholm Syndrome Lyrics
This is the first (Thing I remember)
Now it's the last (Thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (Do you hear me whisper?)
An empty heart (Replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go? (Life's temporary)
After we're gone (Like New Year's resolutions)
Why is this hard? (Do you recognize me?)
I know I'm wrong (But I can't help believing)

I'm so lost, I'm barely here
I wish I could explain myself, but words escape me
It's too late to save me
You're too late, you're too late

You're cold with disappointment while I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
I'm sick with apprehension, I'm crippled from exhaustion
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me

This is the first (Thing I remember)
Now it's the last (Thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (Do you hear me whisper?)
An empty heart (Replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go? (Life's temporary)
After we're gone (Like New Year's resolutions)
Why is this hard? (Do you recognize me?)
I know I'm wrong (But I can't help believing)10Embed
