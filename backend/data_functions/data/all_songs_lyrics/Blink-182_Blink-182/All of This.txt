All of This Lyrics
With all of this I know now, everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how nothing I know changes me at all

Again, I wait for this to change instead to tear the world in two
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you

Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We know where we go)
Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We go where we know)

With all of this I feel now, everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how nothing I feel pulls at me at all

Again, I wait for this to pull apart, to break my time in two
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you

Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We know where we go)
Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We go where we know)

She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you

Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We know where we go)
Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We go where we know)

She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting you

Oh, again I wait for this to fill the hole, to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you5Embed
