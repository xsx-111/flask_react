Not Now Lyrics

Come here, please hold my hand for now
Help me, I'm scared, please show me how to
Fight this, God has a master plan
And I guess I am in his demand
Please save me, this time I cannot run
And I'll see you when this is done
And now I have come to realize
That you are the one who's left behind

Please stay until I'm gone, I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here, waiting

I see a light, it feels good
And I'll come back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish I gave you one last kiss
Please stay until I'm gone, I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here, waiting
And take my one last breath, and don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting

Please stay until I'm gone, I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here, waiting
And take my one last breath, and don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting
Please stay until I'm gone, I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here, waiting
And take my one last breath, and don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting...20Embed
