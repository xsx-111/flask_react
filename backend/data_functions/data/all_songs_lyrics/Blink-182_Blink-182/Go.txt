Go Lyrics
Are we all victims of opportunity
Locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man inside
And saw the look of fear in my mother's eyes

Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

Mom, get in the car and let's drive away
She said, "I'm sorry, Mark, but there's nowhere to stay"
Gave up all her hope and went back inside
Hid her broken heart and let the engine die

Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

Why do evil men get away with it?
Can't you see that I'm in a world of shit?
Turn your back on hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know3Embed
