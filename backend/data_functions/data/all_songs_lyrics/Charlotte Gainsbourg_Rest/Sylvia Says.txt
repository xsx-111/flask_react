Sylvia Says Lyrics
I sweep the cobwebs away
Rise from the slumber room
Kicking around come what may
Sell me a trick or two
The rising sky up above
Always au rendez-vous
Somewhere I've been dreaming of
Over the rainbow too

I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead
Sylvia says
I lift my lids and all is born again
Sylvia says
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead
Sylvia says
I lift my lids and all is born again
Sylvia says

Picking my socks for the day
Quietly states my mood
Can shape the future with clay
Stars waltzing out in blue
All is beyond and above
Nothing like deja-vu
This time I let down the gloves
Awaking to bring me through
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead
Sylvia says
I lift my lids and all is born again
Sylvia says
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead
Sylvia says
I lift my lids and all is born again
Sylvia says

What does the book have to say?
I really don't have a clue
If by the end of the day
Happy fool I salute
For what I'm about to receive
May the lord make me true-
-ly thankful, then I'll believe
Any crap, any cue

I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead
Sylvia says
I lift my lids and all is born again
Sylvia says
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead
Sylvia says
I lift my lids and all is born again
