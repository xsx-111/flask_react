Songbird In A Cage LyricsFlying through the sky
All our senses reeling
Now you sit and cry
At the shadows on the ceiling
Songbird in a cage
Wings that never flutter
Once I saw a bird
Pecking in the gutter
Flying through the sky
All our senses reeling
Now you sit and cry
At the shadows on the ceiling
Songbird in a cage
Someone that takes pity
Opens up the door
Fly above the city
Someone still may come
Someone who takes pity
And through an open door
You may fly above the city
Songbird in a cage
Stars will still be shining
Through the bars of steel
Picture how it was
Flying through the sky
All our senses reeling
Now you sit and cry
At the shadows on the ceiling
Flying through the sky
All our senses reeling
Now you sit and cry
At the shadows on the ceilingEmbed
