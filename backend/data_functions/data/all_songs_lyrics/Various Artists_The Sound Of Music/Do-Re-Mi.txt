Do-Re-Mi Lyrics
Let's start at the very beginning
A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-B-C
When you sing you begin with Do-Re-Mi
Do-Re-Mi

Do-Re-Mi
The first three notes just happen to be
Do-Re-Mi

Do-Re-Mi

Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti
(spoken)
Oh, let's see if I can make it easier
(sung)
Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a drop of golden sun
Mi, a name I call myself
Fa, a long, long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Ti, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do, oh, oh, oh

Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a drop of golden sun
Mi, a name I call myself
Fa, a long, long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Ti, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do
Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do, So-Do

Now children, Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-and-so on are natur'ly the tunes we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your head
You can sing a million diff'rent tune by mixin' them up
Like this:
(sung)
So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re
(spoken)
Can you do that?

So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re

So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do

So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do

Now let's put it all together

So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re
So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do

Good!

But it doesn't mean anything

So we put in wordsâ€”one word for ev'ry note, like this:
(sung)
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together!

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Do... a deer, a female deer
Re... a drop of golden sun
Mi... a name, I call myself
Fa... a long, long way to run
So... a needle pulling thread
La... a note to follow So
Ti... a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do
Do, Ti, La, So, Fa, Mi, Re
Do, Mi, Mi
Mi, So, So
Re, Fa, Fa
La, Ti, Ti
Do, Mi-Mi
Mi, So-So
Re, Fa-Fa
La, Ti-Ti

An-y-thing
Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a drop of golden sun
Mi, a name, I call myself
Fa, a long, long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread

That will bring us back to
