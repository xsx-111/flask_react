Lonely Goatherd Lyrics
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd
Layee odl, layee odl layee-oo
Loud was the voice of the lonely goatherd
Layee odl, layee odl-oo
Folks in a town that was quite remote heard
Layee odl, layee odl layee-oo
Lusty and clear from the goatherd's throat heard
Layee odl, layee odl-oo
Oho layee odllee-oo
Oho layee odl ay!
Oho layee odllee-oo
Hododlleeoay!
A prince on the bridge of a castle moat heard
Layee odl, layee odl layee-oo
Men on the road with a load to tote heard
Layee odl, layee odl-oo
Men in the mists of a chapel dote heard
Layee odl, layee odl-oo
Men drinking beer with the foam afloat heard
Layee odl, layee odl layee-oo
(Cough cough!)
One little girl in a pale pink coat heard
Layee odl, layee odl-oo
She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd
Layee odl, layee odl-oo
Soon her mama with a gleaming gloat heard
Layee odl, layee odl layee-oo
What a duet for a girl and goatherd
Layee odl, layee odl-oo
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Ode layee
Ode layee-ee
Ode layee
Oh Oh Oh Oh layee odl layee-oo
Oh oh layee odl lay
Oh Oh Oh Oh layee odl layee-oo
Layee odllee-o hododlleeoay!

One little girl in a pale pink coat heard
Layee odl, layee odl layoo-oo
She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd
Layee odl, layee odl-o
Soon her mama with a gleaming gloat heard
Layee odl, layee odl lay mmm mmm
What a duet for a girl and goatherd
Layee odl, layee odl-o
Happy are they layee odllayee-o oh layee odlayee layee-o
Soon their duet will become a trio
Layee odl, layee odl layee-o
Ode lay-ee
Ode lay-ee
Ode lay-ee-ee
Ode lay-ee
Odllayee odllay
Odllayee odllayee odlayee odlayee odlay!
