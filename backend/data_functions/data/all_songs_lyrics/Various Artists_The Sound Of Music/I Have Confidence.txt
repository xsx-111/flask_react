I Have Confidence Lyrics
What will this day be like?
I wonder
What will my future be?
I wonder
It could be so exciting
To be out in the world
To be free!
My heart should be wildly rejoicing
Oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed for adventure
To do the things I've never dared
Now here I'm facing adventure
Then why am I so scared?
A captain with seven children
What's so fearsome about that?
Oh, I must stop these doubts
All these worries
If I don't I just know I'll turn back!
I must dream of the things I am seeking
I am seeking the courage I lack
The courage to serve them with reliance
Face my mistakes without defiance
Show them I'm worthy
And while I show them
I'll show me!
So! Let them bring on all their problems
I'll do better than my best
I have confidence
They'll put me to the test!
But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me
Somehow I will impress them
I will be firm, but kind
And all those children
Heaven bless them
They will look up to me
And mind me!
With each step I am more certain
Everything will turn out fine
I have confidence
The world can all be mine!
They'll have to agree
I have confidence in me
I have confidence in sunshine
I have confidence in rain
I have confidence that spring will come again!
Besides, which you see
I have confidence in me!
Strength doesn't lie in numbers
Strength doesn't lie in wealth
Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers
When you wake up, wake up! It's healthy!
All I trust I leave my heart to
All I trust becomes my own!
I have confidence in confidence aloneâ€¦

Oh, help

I have confidence in confidence alone!
Besides, which you see
I have confidence in me!Embed
