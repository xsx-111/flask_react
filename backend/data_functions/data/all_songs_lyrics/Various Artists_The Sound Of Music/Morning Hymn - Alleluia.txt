Morning Hymn / Alleluia Lyrics
O God, inspire our morning hymn
Of love and gratitude
Oh, bless the sacrifice we bring
Thou Source of every good
Touched by Thy hand of love, we wake
And rise from sweet repose
Thy praise shall first the silence break
Thy peace within us flows
Thy miracle of love so sweet
Preserved us all secure
While helpless in unconscious sleep
Thy presence kept us pure
This blest to rise, O Lord, and join
With natureâ€™s minstrelsy
To hymn Thy praise at early morn
And offer thanks to Thee
Sweet morning is the time to pray
How lovely and how meet
To send our early thoughts away
Up to the mercy seat
The glorious sun has driven far
The mystic shades of night
So in our souls the morning star
Hath shed His wondrous lightEmbed
