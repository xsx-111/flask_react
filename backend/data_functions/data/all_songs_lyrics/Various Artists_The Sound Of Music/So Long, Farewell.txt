So Long, Farewell Lyrics
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple, too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say "cuckoo"
(Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)
Regretfully they tell us (cuckoo!)
But firmly they compel us (cuckoo!)
To say goodbye (cuckoo!)
To you...
So long, farewell
Auf wiedersehen, goodnight

I hate to go
And leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell
Auf wiedersehen, adieu

Adieu, adieu
To yieu and yieu and yieu
So long, farewell
Au revoir, auf wiedersehen

I'd like to stay
And taste my first champagne

Yes?

No

So long, farewell
Auf wiedersehen, goodbye

I leave, and heave
A sigh and say goodbye
Goodbye...

I'm glad to go
I cannot tell a lie
I flit, I float
I fleetly flee, I fly

The sun has gone
To bed and so must I

So long, farewell
Auf wiedersehen, goodbye
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
Goodbye...

GoodbyeEmbed
