Runaway Lyrics
There's no saving anything
Now we're swallowing the shine of the summer
There's no saving anything
How we swallow the sun

But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over

We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone

But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking forever

I'll go braving everything
With you swallowing the shine of the summer
I'll go braving everything
Through the shine of the sun

But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
And it's taking forever2Embed
