Lemonworld LyricsSo happy I was invited
Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' and dyin' in New York, it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the Army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins in colours and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me
I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now
Do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
Takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party
I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now
Do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath
Doo doo doo doo doo doo7Embed
