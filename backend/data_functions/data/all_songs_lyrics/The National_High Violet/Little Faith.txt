Little Faith LyricsLittle faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh, or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills
Now I'm stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
Still in line for the Vanity Fair
Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes
All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks that make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins
Awesome prince, get your sleep
Lose your heart in history
Make us laugh or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills
Don't be bitter, Anna
I know how you think
You're waiting for Radio City to sink
You'll find commiseration in everyone's eyes
The storm will suck the pretty girls into the sky
All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks that make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins
Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes4Embed
