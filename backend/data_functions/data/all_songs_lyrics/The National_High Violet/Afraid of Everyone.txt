Afraid of Everyone Lyrics
Then I'm radio and
Then I'm television
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone
Lay the young blue bodies
With the old red bodies
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone

With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out

I defend my family
With my orange umbrella
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone
With my shiny new star-spangled tennis shoes on
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of everyone
With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out
I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out

Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul
Yellow voices swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul4Embed
