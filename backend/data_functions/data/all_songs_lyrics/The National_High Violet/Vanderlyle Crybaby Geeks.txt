Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks Lyrics
Leave your home
Change your name
Live alone
Eat your cake

Vanderlyle crybaby cry
O, the water's a-rising
Still no surprising you
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
Man, it's all been forgiven
Swans are a-swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks

All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love

Vanderlyle crybaby cry
O, the water's a-rising
Still no surprising you
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
Man, it's all been forgiven
Swans are a-swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks
Hanging from
Chandeliers
Same small world
At your heels

All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love

Vanderlyle crybaby cry
O, the water's a-rising
Still no surprising you
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
Man, it's all been forgiven
Swans are a-swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks

I'll explain everything to the geeks
I'll explain everything to the geeks6Embed
