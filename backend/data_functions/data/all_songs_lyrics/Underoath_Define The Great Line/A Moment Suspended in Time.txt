A Moment Suspended in Time LyricsHeld captive, I'm a prisoner
In the back room where the water leaks and I'm oh, so cold
Command me on what to do, but we both know
Neither you or I are in control
There's nothing left for me here
I'm grabbing on to what's left of this hole
It's all too real, this can't be happening
Never again, ever again will I
Say I'm okay, I'm scared of the fate that will
Become mine, become mine
No time to talk, no time to talk
You know the drill
Under my desk, this can't be it
I'm only dreaming, I've got to be dreaming
But I can't get up, no time to talk, not this time
This is my place, this is where I arrange
Under my desk, this can't be it
I'm only dreaming, I've got to be dreaming
But I can't get up, no time to talk, not this time
This is my place, this is where I arrange
It's so funny how we see things so clear
When we have no time left to live
So lay back now and take it in
I won't say a word
So lay back now and take it in
And I won't say anything
I can't believe how it feels
To stand here in this room
And feel like it's gonna blow
I think we're all gonna blow
Under my desk, this can't be it
I'm only dreaming, I've got to be dreaming
But I can't get up, no time to talk, not this time
This is my place, this is where I arrange
I've got to be dreaming, I've got to be dreaming
We've got to be dreaming, we've got to be dreaming
We've got to be
I've got to be dreaming, I've got to be dreaming
We've got to be dreaming
Please don't wake me up
This is the end
This is the end
This is the endEmbed
