Casting Such a Thin Shadow Lyrics
Speak up
My ears are growing weary
I'll sing this to the end
And watch the waves crash over me
Speak up
My ears are growing weary
I'll sing this to the end
And watch the waves crash over me

Not too much to overcome
With enough time to turn it all around
In a picture perfect scenery
I've become a stick figure illustration

My eyes roll back and focus on what's ahead
I can still stand if you lend the hand to brace me
I'll take this on my own
I'll take this on my own
I'll take this onEmbed
