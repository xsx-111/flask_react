There Could Be Nothing After This LyricsIn the end we tend to think of how it began
I could never explain the picture it painted
And how it made me feel
Now the ceiling is in motion
The light centered and overlooked
You want to see me disappear
Well, so do I, well, so do I
Such a quiet evaporation
We're nothing but hollow vessels
In search of what makes us alive
I never said this was my revolution
When you looked me in the eye
Oh, how I've walked this white line
So many times before
What a feeble attempt
Just to feel alive
This is for you and all your hopeless case
You never would, you never would
Leave me in your wish to fail every time
Every time I try
So talk about, talk about it
At least it makes you feel something
Inside
Who have I become
Who have I become
Oh God, everything, everything
All around me is crumbling at my feet
Everything, everything
All around me is crumbling at my feet
I stare, so delicate and ashamed
At the shell I've shed myself from
I stare, so delicate and ashamed
In the eyes, in the eyes of my ghost
(This is for you and your hopeless case)
In the eyes, in the eyes of my ghost
(This is for you and your hopeless case)
And I will never look back
I will never
And I will never look back again1Embed
