In Regards to Myself LyricsWake up! Wake up! My God!
This is not a test!
And it's not too late to come clean
To get it off your chest
So, steady your hand before your face
And concentrate
There's gotta be some stable ground
Left to walk on
So, tear another page from the book
Are you asleep or just alone?
Clear this room from your lungs
Pull yourself together
Pull yourself together, man
Pull yourself together
Pull yourself together
On your back
You're sleeping in a bed of shame
Let the light
Breathe some new life
Into this room, it's what keeps you coming back
Made up of insatiable taste
Bury your
Head in your hands
Then sink into yourself
Oh!
Just what are you so afraid of?
What are you so afraid of?
You're staring truth in the face
So, come on down
What are you so afraid of?
You're busy living now, aren't you? No!
You're busy making vows
You're coming unglued
Time is shorter than you know
I know the light is blinding to the naked eye
So, why don't you take steps away from being alone?
I swear, it's not too late for you
It's all worth reaching for
It's all worth reaching for
It's all worth reaching for
The hands will pull you out
It's all worth reaching for
The hands will pull you out
Wake up, wake up, wake up
And step outside your box
Wake up, wake upEmbed
