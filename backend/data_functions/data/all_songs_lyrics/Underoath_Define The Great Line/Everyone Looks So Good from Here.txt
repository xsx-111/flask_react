Everyone Looks So Good from Here LyricsIn a deep breath it all starts to change
Flip my world inside out
Honestly, I like it better this way
When I mesh the night through the back of my eyes
I have put myself here
I'm the culprit, I am the culprit
I've been swallowed up alive
Shut down, building from the inside out
I can finally
Walk through the walls (Walk through the walls)
I've been swallowed up alive
Shut down, building from the inside out
I can finally
Walk through the walls (Walk through the walls)
I swear I've slipped right through the cracks in the floor
It's so easy when it's pulling me under
It's so easy when it's pulling me under
It's so easy when it's pulling me under
Now I can see things from the outside and
I will sit here with no place in mind
I swear I've slipped right through the cracks in the floor
I swear I've slipped right through the cracks in the floor
I can't escape from this place
I can't escape from...
This is so unfamiliar
This is so unfamiliar
To me (To me)
To me (To me)
I can hear the unsatisfying silence
My mouth is open but none of you can hear meEmbed
