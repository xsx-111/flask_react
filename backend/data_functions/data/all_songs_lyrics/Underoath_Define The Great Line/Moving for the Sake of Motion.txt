Moving for the Sake of Motion Lyrics
Someone please turn the lights back on
I've been wandering here for days
Disconnected and in search
For new air to breathe
I don't think I can fix this
Don't think I could change
(Breathe)
But that's the problem
We never speak to Him
Our closing walls have caged us in
And I can't quite remember
This was the first time
I didn't say enough
This was the only time
I kept it close enough

Brace yourself
Come on and brace yourself
They're not waking
They're not waking up
They're not waking
They're not waking
Oh, my God
Oh, my God
I hate the me that I've become
This needy, useless, forgetting one
Truthfully (truthfully)
Well, I can't be the me
The me that I've washed up to be

Don't stop breathing
The walls have just begun to spin
Just let the water calm you this time
It's all around you
Just open your eyes and take a look
It will never kill you, not this time
Don't stop breathing
Just let the water calm you this time
Don't stop breathing
Not this time

It's all around you
It's all around you
We're surrounded for all I care
Brace yourself right now
Lights out
I'm not breathing
I can't keep swimming
Can't keep my head upEmbed
