Caterwaul Lyrics
Eyes at night never see the day
Because it's not in my nature
Golden wings rise from the plane
They burn above the red earth
Scale these walls in front of me
Have you ever stopped to wonder?

Why they forced
Your voice to turn from silence to a caterwaul?
Why they forced
Your voice to turn from silence to a caterwaul?

Never knew I could feel this way
So old and and unremembered
Never thought that it could slip away
And fall like September
Scale these walls in front of me
Have you ever stopped to wonder?

Why they forced
My voice to turn from silence to a caterwaul?
Why they forced
My voice to turn from silence to a caterwaul?
I heard your caterwaul
And what has tried to bound me
I've severed every tie
And place your arms around me
And we'll leave the rest behind

What was I to say?
How was I to know?
Was it your soft voice that said so?
What was I to say?
How was I to know?
Was it your soft voice that said so?
What was I to say?
How was I to know?
Was it your soft voice that said so?
What was I to say?
How was I to know?
Was it your soft voice that said so?Embed
