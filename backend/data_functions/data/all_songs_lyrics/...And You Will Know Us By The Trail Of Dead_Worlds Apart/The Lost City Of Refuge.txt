The Lost City Of Refuge LyricsWith history, your bluest grace
Falls apart, cascading down
Speak to me of beautiful hate
Of island chains swept with the tide
Tragedy ripening on
The coral leis of a conquering king
They're swept away
Oh, but not lost
Beneath the waves of trembling stars
The road winds towards
The windward side
My soul is saved by these city lights
My face is framed by the blanket of night
They're swept away
Oh, but not lost
Was I too proud to say, or to wish for
Words that I knew were forbidden?
Because I don't want to know
I didn't want to see what I saw
When I looked in the distance
They're swept away
Oh, but not lostEmbed
