Will You Smile Again? Lyrics
And you will know us by the trail of dead

Close the door and drift away
Into a sea of uncertainty
Where all your hopes
And dreams have faded out of reach

Remember all the bad dreams
Not far from reality
Would you write again for me?

And you awake and there you are
Not far off from the line before
And just how long it take for you to understand
Where your feelings stopped and writing began
Convince yourself to take control
Play to the hilt this unlikely role

Remember all the bad dreams
Are not far from reality
Would you write again for me?
And who bade you stop this living art?
Have you forgotten just what you are?
If you don't want to then you could at least pretend
That the paper's your soul and your blood's in the pen
And maybe then you'd see the light
And read the truth that you had to write

If heaven sent you downstream
Where banished eyes haven't been
Would you smile again for me?

You misread your fate line
Had long run out ahead of time
Would you write again for me?

And you awake and there you are
Not far off from the line before
And just how long it take for you to understand
Where your feelings stopped and writing began
Convince yourself to take control
Play to the hilt this unlikely role
If heaven sent you downstream
Where banished eyes haven't been
Would you smile again for me?

Would you smile again for me?
Would you smile again for me?
Would you smile again for me?
Would you smile again for me?
Would you smile again?
For me?2Embed
