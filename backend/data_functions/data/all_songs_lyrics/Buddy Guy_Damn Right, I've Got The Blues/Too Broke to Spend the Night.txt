Too Broke to Spend the Night LyricsI'm catching hell out here
People and you know, I know it ain't right
I say, I'm catching hell out here
And people you know, I know it ain't right|
Cause I'm so broke, I'm so broke right now, that I can't even spend the night
My only son
I don't think he really know who I am
I said, my only son|
I don't think, I don't think he really know who I am
Frankly speaking people, I don't think, I don't think he really gives a damn
Look at here
I pawned my watch, and you know I pawned my dog-gone ring
I said, yes, I pawned my watch
Baby you know I pawned, I pawned my dog-gone ring
You know I'm trying to ride this old rack-e-ty bike
And I don't even have a dog-gone chain
Look at here
I'm catching hell, I'm catching hell, yeah
And people and you know that ain't right
I say, I'm catching hell, yeah
And people you know, you know, that ain't right
I'm so broke right now, that I can't even spend the night
Look at hereEmbed
