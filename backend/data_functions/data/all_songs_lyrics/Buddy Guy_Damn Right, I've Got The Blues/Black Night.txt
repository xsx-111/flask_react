Black Night LyricsBlack night is fallin'
Oh how I hate to be alone
Black night is fallin'
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
And there ain't another day is gone
I have no one to talk with
To tell my trouble to
My baby gone and left me
Someone tell me what more, what more can I do
Black night is fallin'
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
And there ain't another day is gone
Yeah
I have no one to talk with
To tell my trouble to
My brother's in Iraq
And I don't know, don't know what to do
Black night is fallin'
Oh how I hate to be alone
Keep crying for my baby
And there ain't another day is gone
Look at here
Goodbye baby
Oh God, I sure do hate to go
Goodbye baby, yeah
Oh God, I sure do hate to goEmbed
