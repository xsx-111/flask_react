Mustang Sally Lyrics
Mustang Sally
Guess you better slow your mustang down
Mustang Sally, baby!
I guess you better slow your mustang down

You been a runnin' all over town
I guess I better put your big feet on the ground
Oh yes, I will

All you wanna do is ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
One of these early mornings
You gonna be wipin' your weepin' eyes
Yes, you will

I bought you a vintage mustang
A nineteen and sixty-five
Now you goin' round a signifyin' woman, no
You don't wanna let me ride
Mustang Sally, baby, yeah
I guess you better slow your mustang down
Yes, you will darling
I hope you will
Going around running' all over town
I'm gonna put your big, fat feet on the ground
Oh yes, Sally
Well, lookie here

All you wanna do is ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
All you wanna do is just ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
All you wanna do is just ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally (ride Sally ride)
One of these early mornings
You gonna put your fat, fat feet on the ground
Oh yes, I will
Sally

Sally
(ride Sally ride)
(ride Sally ride)
(ride Sally ride)
(ride Sally ride)
(ride Sally ride)Embed
