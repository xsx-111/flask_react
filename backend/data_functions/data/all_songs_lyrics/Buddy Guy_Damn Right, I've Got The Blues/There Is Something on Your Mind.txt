There Is Something on Your Mind LyricsThere is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
Can what you're thinking bring happiness
Or will it bring me, huh just misery
No, no please don't try to tell me
I'll think I can understand
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ohohohohoh, don't try to tell me, baby
I'll think I will a understand
You want me to try and forgive you
But you can bet I'll do, I'll do, I'll do the, I'll do the best that I can
If you ever think about me
If I ever cross you're mind
Oh, Lord, if you ever, if you ever, if you ever think about me baby
If I ever cross your mind, yeah
I want you to know, I want you to know, ohohohohoh, yeah
That you, you, you , you are mineEmbed
