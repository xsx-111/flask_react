I Can Tell LyricsI can tell
You are the one and know I can be sure
When lies are real it hurts a little more
I could show you why I'll see right through your eyes
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
I can tell
You are the one I know so very well
You can't fool me with all your stories told
I can show you why our love will still survive
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You’ve got the magic that I need
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You know our love will soon succeed
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You’ve got that magic in your eyes
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You know I will show you
I can tell
You are the one I know so very well
You can't fool me with all your stories told
I can show you why our love will still survive
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You've got the magic that I need
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You know our love will soon succeed
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You've got that magic in your eyes
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You know I will show you
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You just wait and see
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
You've got the look I'll give the smile
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)
It's in your eyes from a distant mile
(I can tell)
(I can tell you now)Embed
