Isfahan LyricsIsfahan, your golden dreams lie sleeping
You are cold, your silent fountains dreaming
Isfahan, your splendors rich with keeping
You'll waken, your palace doors open wide to sing
Isfahan, your ancient walls are stirring
A higher age will come and live once again
Golden minarets in the sun will gleam
As I dream of you, Isfahan
As I dream of you, Isfahan
Isfahan, your golden dreams lie sleepingEmbed
