Red Balloon LyricsBought myself a Red Balloon, got a blue surprise
Hidden in the Red Balloon the pinning of my eyes
Took the lovelight from my eyes
Blue, blue surprise
We met as friends, and you were so easy to get to know
But will we see one another again?
Oh my, I hope so
Played with toys for children, as a child I got
I haven't any time for children although I got a lot
Took the lovelight from my eyes
Blue blue surprise
Bought myself a Red Balloon...Embed
