Speak Like a Child LyricsI speak like a child
I look like a child
Through dancing eyes
I wish more for you
I give more to you
Than jealous replies
There's nothing to say
That children don't say
Through lips that smile
I wish more for you
I give more to you
Than jealous replies
I look at you
And what i saw
Was far removed
And what i saw
Was never there
I speak like a child
I look like a child
Through dancing eyes
I give more to you
I wish more for you
Than jealous replies
I look at you
And what I saw was far removed
And what i saw
Was never thereEmbed
