Black Sheep Boy LyricsHere I am back home again
I'm here to rest
All they ask is where I've been
Knowing I've been West
I'm the family's unowned boy
Golden curls of envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shine in the Black Sheep Boy
If you love me, let me live in peace
Please understand
That the black sheep can wear the golden fleece
And hold a winning hand
I'm the family's unowned boy
Golden curls of envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shine in the Black Sheep Boy
I'm the family's unowned boy
Golden curls of envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shine in the Black Sheep BoyEmbed
