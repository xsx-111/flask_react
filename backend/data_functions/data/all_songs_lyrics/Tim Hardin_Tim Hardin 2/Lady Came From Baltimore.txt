Lady Came From Baltimore LyricsLady came from Baltimore
All she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor
She never saw my place
I was there to steal her money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none
The lady's name was Susan Moore
Her daddy read the law
She didn't know that I was poor
And lived outside the law
Her daddy said, I was a thief
And didn't marry her for love
I was Susan's true belief
Married her for love
I was there to steal her money
To take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none
The house she lived in had a wall
To keep the robbers out
She'd never stop to think at all
If that's what I'm about
I was there to steal her money
Take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with noneEmbed
