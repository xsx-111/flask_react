Tribute to Hank Williams LyricsGood bye hank williams, my friend
I didn't know you
But i've been in places you've been
In richmond where he just been
For some sits could not be found
But they planned to see him again
Next time hank williams in town
Hardly nobody knew that night how soon they'd be crying
Hardly nobody knew that night hank williams was dieing
He sang from his heart
Took the pain for his sins
We watched the pain in his heart
And they sang and then they clapped their hands
Good bye hank williams, my friend
I didn't know you
But i've been in places you've been
Shoffers steared the car that night
To the town next in line for the show
With his name in the deep blue lights
And the people with tickets to go
Hardly nobody knew that night how soon they'd be crying
Hardly nobody knew that night hank williams was dieing
Good bye hank williams, my friend
I didn't know you
But i've been in places you've beenEmbed
