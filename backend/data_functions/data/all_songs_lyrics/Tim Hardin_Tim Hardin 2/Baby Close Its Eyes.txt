Baby Close Its Eyes LyricsSinging a lullaby while the baby cries
Loving parents sigh, finally baby close it's eye
Every moment means so much
When your baby's skin is there to touch
Every moment bringing more
That's what mother and father are for
Finally baby close it's eyes
Every moment means so much
When your baby's skin is there to touch
Every moment bringing more
That's what mother and father are forEmbed
