You Upset the Grace of Living When You Lie LyricsListen to your heart for my reflection
Do your eyes stay with me when I say goodbye?
Listen to my changes in direction
Follow me to feel the same as I
I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you feel my love of you
Don't believe me if you're not convinced of me
Please come back along the changing sky
Every time you give yourself not loving me
You upset the grace of living when you lie
I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you feel my love of youEmbed
