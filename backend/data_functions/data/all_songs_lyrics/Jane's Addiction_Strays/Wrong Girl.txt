Wrong Girl LyricsYou messed with the wrong girl
She but small but she's fierce
She shattered the glass out
With the highs of a heels
You led with the wrong line
When you called her cunt and all
So what makes a guy think
That it hurts a girl?
It don't hurt a girl
Who loves her dangerous play
Kicks and screams as she dances
Keeps a pretty face
You messed with the wrong girl
She got her ways and means
She laughs at the traffic
From the easy streets
Enters in cages
With no bites when she leaves
If guys are too rough now
Then that's what you think
It don't hurt a girl
She loves her dangerous play
She kicks and screams as she dances
Keeps a pretty face, alright
She's like a mother eagle
Comin' down
She's like a mother eagle
Comin' down
Oh, now she's cutting every corner
She's tearin' the grass
'Cause cars ain't for parkin' man
A car's what you pass
It don't stop the girl
She loves her dangerous play
Kicks and screams as she dances
Keeps that pretty face
Oh, I love her pretty face
I love her pretty face
What a pretty face
Alright
