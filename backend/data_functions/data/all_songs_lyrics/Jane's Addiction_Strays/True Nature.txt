True Nature LyricsHere we go!
Power tripping your luck is switched
Oh, so now it's funny
When it's your turn is to laugh
You go poke the running joke!
Scoring points with God
Get no perfect marks
But your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling
Porn chick calls herself a therapist
Baby, call it what it is
All the money in the world
We'll go to war for you backward heroes
Come to rescue you
Just to lean on you
With interests soaring
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling
Please believe
We live and breathe
Through native tongue
And poetry
All those years, man, we believed, yeah
Scoring points with God
Get no perfect marks
But your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature callingEmbed
