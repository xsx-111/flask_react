Hypersonic LyricsYeah, I got a ticket to ride for two
I'm going up to the wild blue
I keep the surface ultra cooled
And all my fuel can be renewed
While we wait around with delay
The sudden news is just fast-talking
Your skin is oily, your story's old
So tell it while you're walking
We're flying
Hypersonic
Flying
With my hyper tonic
Yeah, I uproot all you terrorist
I am the guide to the perplexed
Man take this tip, I'm gonna win
I'll put it all on hydrogen
'Cause our lives have gotten tied
To people we should untangle
It's all at a fatal cost
To keep us over barrels
We are flying
Hypersonic
Flying
With my hyper tonic
You thought that we were fast before
We're going faster and faster and faster
We got time, we're doing fine
Mach 8 acceleration
The sky is clear don't interfere
With aspirations of this nation
Ah, shoot new cities into space
Drag you at the new space races
Fast as any line can flow
And look around, we leave no traces
We are flying
Hypersonic
We're flying
With a hyper tonic
Oh yeah
Hypersonic
We're flying
With a hyper tonic
Oh yeah
Hypersonic
We're flying
With my hyper tonic
