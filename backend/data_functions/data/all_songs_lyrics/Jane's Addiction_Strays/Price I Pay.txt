Price I Pay LyricsI always do the wrong thing
But for a very good reason
Always do it wrong
But it feels right
So forgive me now
And forgive me later
I'll pay you back
I always do the wrong thing
But I got a good reason
I always do the wrong thing
But it feels right
I always do the wrong thing
But I got a good reason
I could have it, but I walked away
Now I won't miss out, not even one day
What I lost off the line
I bring back all in my good time
There ain't no other way
Because this is
The price
It's the price
Always the price I pay, hey
I see you, you're going places
So, let's get the hell out of here
I'm a big liver man at the table
I got my long cock drawn
I'm able to lay you out
Hey, there ain't no other way
Because this is
It's the price
It's the price
Always the price I pay
I'm always having a good time
Always searchin' for more
I'm flying now and paying later
I'm flyin' now
I'm layin' in a bath of hot water
Hot water always my case
Finally nothing to say
Just put the cloth right over my face
Oh, there ain't no other way
Because this is
Always the price
It's the price
Always the price I pay
Oh, I got to thrust it out
Oh, the price that I pay
Oh, I got to get it out, ow
Always
Always the price that I payEmbed
