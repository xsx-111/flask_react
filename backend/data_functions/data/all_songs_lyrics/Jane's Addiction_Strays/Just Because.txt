Just Because LyricsIf I were you
I'd better watch out
When was the last time
You did anything
Not for me
Or anyone else?
Just because
Just because
You
Oh, you really should have known
Hey you
You really should have known
Just because, just because
You got the most
But nobody loves you
Nobody has to
Just because
You
Oh, you really should have known
Oh, you
I think you really should have known
Just because, just because
Oh
Oh, baby, watch out
When we first met
And we passed around gifts
That was a long time ago
And yours didn't fit
Yeah, you
Oh, you really should have known
Oh, you
Oh, you really should have known
Just because, just because, just because
Oh, now
Oh, you better watch out1Embed
