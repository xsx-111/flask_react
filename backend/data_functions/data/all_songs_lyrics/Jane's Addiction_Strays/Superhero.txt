Superhero LyricsYeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
You were smiling by my table
Had to call up everyone that day
A beautiful mind and body
What a happy ending I see
My mind had been enabled
In a memory you overflowed
I wanna be your superhero
Even if I tumble fall
I'm okay
You have that effect on me
But I need you desperately
You know I need you desperately
Brick or stone cannot hurt me
Madmen around the city go
They attack I'll bring 'em down
Making their chances super low
Oh my my, pretty naval
Dimple cheek, a face I adore
Wanna be your superhero
Fallin' from a running horse
I'm okay
You have that effect on me
But I need you desperately
You know I need you desperately
I, oh, I
I hold to that illusion
I, I
I'm not your average guy
Other guys they won't dare to
Join the line in order you peck
When they introduced me to you
My face had turned to super red
Your steady beck and call boy
Playin' on piano
Wanna be your superhero
Not afraid to tumble fall
I'm okay
You have that effect on me
But I need you desperately
You know I need you desperately
I'm okay
You have that effect on me
But I need you desperately
You know I need you desperately
I wanna be your superhero
Yeah, I wanna be your superhero
Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah1Embed
