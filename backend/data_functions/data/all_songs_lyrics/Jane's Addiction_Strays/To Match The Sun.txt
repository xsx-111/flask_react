To Match The Sun LyricsSit with me now
We'll watch the dusk
Sun falling on (sun falling on)
The two of us
Let's set our hearts
To match the sun
We're right on time
Here it comes
Oh! Yeah! Oh!
Yeah, countdown starting out
Coming to a sweet end
Aim my messy head strong
I'm going fast and furious
Curious don't
Kill us before we've thrown
Our arms out
Let's set our hearts
To match the sun
When it goes down
For keeping sake
A sign for our time
So we both know, oh
Oh! Yeah! Oh!
In the wind I wander
I don't know where I'll end up
Do what I can to get home
Right there, baby
There between the twilight
Finish the day into night
When we'll meet up again
Let's set our hearts
To match the sun
When it goes down
For keeping sake
A sign for all time
So we both know, oh
Yeah
Give and my name and dress you up
Use it to us express us
Make us at the same time
And then you claim me as your prince and my princess
Stretch out our royal mind
It grows longer
Knowing the will sun set our time
And knowing your heart beats close to mine
From where we are
When you see our mark
Signing our name
All across the colored sky
Just in time to match the sun
Just in time to match the sunEmbed
