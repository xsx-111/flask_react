Suffer Some LyricsShe's so lucky that she had to suffer some
Left her happy home began to drink and slum
She's got problems? C'mon name me one?
She makes problems like makin' new friends
She had to suffer some, be like everyone
Had to suffer some
She gets in free down at the Scream
Oh yeah, oh
All night running through her living room
All her sucked up friends and her daughter too
Oh, you poor mother, you cashed your little one in
Got a three bag fill up and a new syringe
Gotta suffer some, be like everyone
Gotta suffer some
Was in the pink now she's in the blue
Oh yeah, oh
And you know
She's seen better days
Did you hear?
How far she's gone?
Far away
Far away
She's gone far away
May be the last song you'll be sung
Ain't no sweet left in that emotion
She's got problems, but those to come
'Cause it's worse than murder
That's what you done
Now you go suffer
She had to suffer some, be like every one
Had to suffer some
Was in the pink, baby's feeling blue
Oh yeah
Gotta suffer some, be like every one
Had to suffer some
She gets in free, always was a freak
Oh yeah
Oh yeahEmbed
