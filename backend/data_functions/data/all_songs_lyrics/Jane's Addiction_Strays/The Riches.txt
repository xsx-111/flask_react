The Riches LyricsI love standing by the water
And just knowing what it's for
It's all right to swim and sip it
Let me have a little more
Like my woman like my shower
Get them hot until they're steaming
Love to find a little spot
Nice and shady that's for dreamin' of the riches
Oh, tell me where are you hidden?
'Cause ready or not man, I'm comin' in
Into the life
Into the life
Into the life of riches
Stretching out in the sun
Like a cat in the window
Hillside changing color
As I'm watching shadows throw
I'm laughing that is rich
It puts my stomach in a stitches
Early bird from a perch
Looking down can see all the worlds' riches
Oh, tell me where are you hidden?
'Cause ready or not man, I'm comin' in
Into the life
Oh, into the life
Into the life of riches
Never lookin' over my shoulder again
I wanna buy my time and finally own my fate
If you tell me no then I really must insist
And when the hunt is over kiss me on my lips
Kisses, oh
So let's talk 'bout our plan
You can count it's gonna work
Carry on feel immortal
At the risk of getting hurt
I'm praying that it rains
So someday we'll be sowin'
Living through a little pain
No complainin' as we're trainin' for the riches
Oh, tell me where are you hidden?
Oh, all of a sudden
There you are
I'm happy that the sky is blue and that the earth is green
And that there's lots of fresh clean air sandwiched in between
I love watching as the snow makes brushes out of trees
Swinging from the tops of all my guarantees
I'm happy that the sky is blue, I'm happy earth is green
And that there's lots of fresh clean air sandwiched in between
I love watching as the snow makes brushes out of trees
Swinging from the tops of all my guaranteesEmbed
