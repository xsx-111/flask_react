(They Long to Be) Close to You LyricsWhy do birds suddenly apear
Every time you are near?
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why
All the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why
All the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
Just like me
They long to be
Close to youEmbed
