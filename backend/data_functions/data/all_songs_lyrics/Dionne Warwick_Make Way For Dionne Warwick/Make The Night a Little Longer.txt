Make The Night a Little Longer LyricsMy days are years 'cause I don't see my baby
Till the stars are in the sky
And every night when we can be together
Time just seems to hurry by
So Lord I'm beggin' you to make the night
Just a little longer
Make the night
Just a little longer
So I can kiss him
Just a little longer
And hold him tight
Just a little longer
You made the world the way you thought it should be
So won't you make the night a little longer for me?
My nights are warm, 'cause when he hugs and holds me
Everything just feels so fine
But Lord, you know, I hate to see the sunlight
Takes away that man of mine
So Lord I'm beggin' you to make the night
Just a little longer
Make the night
Just a little longer
So I can kiss him
Just a little longer
And hold him tight
Just a little longer
Just a little longer
Just a little longer)
So Lord I'm beggin' you to make the night
Just a little longer
Make the night
Just a little longer
So I can kiss him
Just a little longer
And hold him tight
Just a little longer
Then embrace his arms
Just a little longer
Capture all of his charms
Just a little longer
Please Lord, make the night ....Embed
