I Smiled Yesterday LyricsThough I smiled yesterday
You know I'm not gonna smile anymore today
(Since you went away from me)
How I miss you
(Since you went away from me)
I long to kiss you
Until you are back with me
I'm never gonna smile anymore, oh no
Though I laughed yesterday
You know I'm not gonna laugh anymore today
(Every moment we're apart)
I get so lonely
(Every moment weâ€™re apart)
I love you only
Until you are back with me
I'm never gonna smile anymore, oh no
And baby, every day without you
Is a day that's gonna turn out wrong
I need, need your love so badly
So won't you, won't you, won't you
Won't you let me smile again
Like I smiled yesterday
I don't wanna cry anymore like I cried today
(Baby hurry back to me)
I need your lovin'
(Baby hurry back to me)
Your tender lovin'
Until you are back with me
I'm never gonna smile anymore, oh no
And baby, every day without you
Is a day that's gonna turn out wrong
I need, need your love so badly
So won't you, won't you, won't you
Won't you let me smile again
Like I smiled yesterday
I don't wanna cry anymore like I cried today
(Baby hurry back to me)
I need your lovin'
(Baby hurry back to me)
Your tender lovin'
Until you are back with me
I'm never gonna smile anymore, oh noEmbed
