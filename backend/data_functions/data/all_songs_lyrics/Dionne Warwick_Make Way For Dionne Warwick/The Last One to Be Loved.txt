The Last One to Be Loved LyricsAll of the friends I knew
Found someone, they could love
Right from the start
But I was forever alone and blue
Until you held my hand
And touched my heart!
Now here am I
The last one to be loved –
The last one to be kissed and caressed
And to be blessed from above!
And now you're here
All my lonely days are through –
Oh, I'm so glad
That I saved love for you!
If I hold you too tight
And kiss your lips until you're out of breath
Forgive me, but I am so new at this
That when I'm close to you I'm scared to death!
Remember, I'm
The last one to be loved –
The last one to be kissed and caressed
And to be blessed from above!
I need you so
So don't ever say goodbye –
Without your love
I just know, that I would die!
Remember, I'm
The last one to be loved –
The last one to be kissed and caressed
And to be blessed from above!
I need you so
So don't ever say goodbye –
Without your love
I just know, that I would die!
I'm the last one to be loved!
Oh, I'm the last one to be loved!Embed
