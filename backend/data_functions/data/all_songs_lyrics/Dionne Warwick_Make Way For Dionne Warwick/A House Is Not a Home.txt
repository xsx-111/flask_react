A House Is Not a Home Lyrics
A chair is still a chair
Even though there's no one sitting there

But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

A room is still a room
Even though there's nothing there but gloom

But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears
Darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart

I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs
And turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me

I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs
And turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me1Embed
