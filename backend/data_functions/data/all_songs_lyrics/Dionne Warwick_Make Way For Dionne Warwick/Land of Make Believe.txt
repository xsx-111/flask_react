Land of Make Believe LyricsYou are always here with me
In the Land of Make-Believe
In the Land of Make-Believe
In the Land of Make-Believe
You're mine tonight, although you are far away
In the Land of Make-Believe
I'm holding you tight
A silver moon is shining above
And there's love in your eyes
And I'm kissing you like I used to do
Yesterday in paradise
I've been livin' in the Land of Make-Believe
Since you've been gone
I need you so much that, without your love
I must deceive myself to go on
Your loving hand caresses my face
We embrace tenderly
Never will we part
Deep down in my heart
You are always here with me
You are always here with me
In the Land of Make-Believe
In the Land of Make-Believe
I need you so much
Your loving hand caresses my face
We embrace tenderly
Never will we part
Deep down in my heart
You are always here with me
You are always here with me
In the Land of Make-Believe
In the Land of Make-Believe
You are always here with me
In the Land of Make-BelieveEmbed
