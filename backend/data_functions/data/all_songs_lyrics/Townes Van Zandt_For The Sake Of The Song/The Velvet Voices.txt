The Velvet Voices Lyrics
I'll play upon my violin until the mountains ring
Of lonely laughter blindly thrown across an endless ark of strings
And the skies are set to dancing to a silent symphony
And the velvet voices all shall join the singing

The hall is filled to every corner by a tinkling hint of chimes
A melody careens and crumbles, leaving just a trace behind
A rhythm faltering faintly fails the silver on its wings
And the velvet voices all shall join the singing

The cymbals flash, the drums they crash, the trumpets rise to song
The brass baton plucks bits of diamond from a glittering wall of almost dawn
The crystal chords, they slash the wind in humble majesty
And the velvet voices all shall join the singingEmbed
