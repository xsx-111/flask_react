Unkind And Unwise LyricsHe was brought up in a house of women
In a city of heat that gave it's children
Faith in the fable of coral and fish
Told them the world was something to miss
I turn to hold you, you're gone
Fingers let go, I'm gone
That's just a little unkind
And just a little unwise
That's just a little unkind
And just a little unwise
The salt in the wind moves over the mudflats
Sticks to your skin and rusts up the lights
Blows through the ferns that breathe in the dark
I try to forget but it's so hard
I turn to hold you, you're gone
Fingers let go, I'm gone
That's just a little unkind
And just a little unwise
That's just a little unkind
And just a little unwise
What was once is a falling star;
It'll hit you and hurt you and open your heart
Burn in a river tangled with reeds
While a crane on the water silently feeds
I turn to hold you, you're gone
Fingers let go, I'm gone
That's just a little unkind
And just a little unwise
That's just a little unkind
And just a little unwise
(repeat till cicadas join in the fun)Embed
