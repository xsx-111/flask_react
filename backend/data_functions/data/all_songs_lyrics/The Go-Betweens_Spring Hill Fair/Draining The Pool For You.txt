Draining The Pool For You LyricsRemembered your name
Evidently, you've forgotten mine
You know a lot of people
I know, a mind dulled by work and wine
I got hired but I got tired of draining the pool for you
I got tired but not so blue
To see the cracks in you
I got hired against my wish
With better prospects, after this
Ten leaves
Ten leaves, on a river bank
Just like the glass
From the champagne bottles smashed where they sank
Chorus
Your interest in freaks
The side show, the low life holds nothing for me
Because I have seen it
Almost been it, and it's not my cup of thrills
Chorus
Fade: on swimming pools, hiring and tiring, and
Anything after thisEmbed
