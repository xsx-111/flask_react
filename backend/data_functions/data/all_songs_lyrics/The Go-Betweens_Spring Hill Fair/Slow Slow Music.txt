Slow Slow Music LyricsI got myself a mortgage
It didn't save the marriage
We weren't insureed
Insured against breakage
If you believe in orphans
There's still a chance for love
(The hand that warms you also harms you)
Pick me up in pieces
I'm scattered and broken
Slow, slow music
Pick me up in pieces
I'm scattered and broken
Slow, slow music
By the time I was 16
I knew the names of the planets
Stayed away from the doorstep
Was frightened of milk-bottles
If you believe in orphans
There's still a chance for love
(The hand that warms you also harms you)
I know I'm not an orphan
But I believe in love
(The hand that holds you also scolds you)
Chorus
So! Don't wake the children
Leave them in bed
In the land o the dreamless
They're better off dead
If you believe in orphans
There's still a chance for love
(The hand that warms you also harms you)
I know I'm not an orphan
But I believe in love
(The hand that holds you also scolds you)
