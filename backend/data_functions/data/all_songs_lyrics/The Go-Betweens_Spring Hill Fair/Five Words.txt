Five Words LyricsIt starts with a birthstone
And ends with a tombstone
Cathedrals in London
Cathedrals in Rome, all stone
And I just say (what do you say?)
And I just say (what do you say?)
Bury them don't keep 'em
And I just know (what do you know?)
And I just know (what do you know?)
Bury them don't keep 'em
Praise to the vision
That pays for the angel
Coins in communion
Ring like a halo.*
Lay me down
On my knees
By my bed
At night
Lay me down
On my knees
By my bed
At night
Hail to the generals
But hell to the public
Bows for the bishop
And bones for believers
Chorus
Rap, rap, rap on the lid
Rap, rap, rap on the lid
Bury them don't keep 'em etcEmbed
