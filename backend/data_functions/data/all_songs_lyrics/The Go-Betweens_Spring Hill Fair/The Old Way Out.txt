The Old Way Out Lyrics
Lord I feel you made the hills, watch them roll
I've seen the promised land, and that is all

Please be kind
Please be kind

What the others take, I let them believe
The old way out is now the new way in
The old way out is now the new way in
The old way out is now the new way
I see that life but it won't begin

Lord above you filled the sea, watch it roll
At your last port of call, you weren't saved
