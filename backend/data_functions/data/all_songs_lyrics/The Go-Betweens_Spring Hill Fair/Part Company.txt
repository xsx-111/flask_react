Part Company LyricsCome and have a look, beside me
A fine line of tears, part company
That's her handwriting, that's the way she writes
From the first letter I got to this her Bill of Rights, part company
And what will I miss? Her cruelty, her unfaithfulness
Her fun, her love, her kiss, part company
That's her handwriting, that's the way she writes
Like mud in the September rain it comes, back to me
Part, part, I said part
Part company, made he men disappear
Cut my swathe and spread my fear
Before we'd met, I hadn't wiped my feet
Seen myself naked or, part company
And I said it before, do I have to say it again
A fine line of tears, part company
That's her handwriting, that's the way she writes
From her first words to this, our last night
Part, part, she said part
Part company, made her men disappear
Cut my swathe and spread my fearEmbed
