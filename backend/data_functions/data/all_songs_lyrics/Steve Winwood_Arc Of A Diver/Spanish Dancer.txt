Spanish Dancer LyricsI see her walkin' down
In her pretty dress
The bot comes 'round w/a crate of beer
I feel like a "rude ol" fesse
Raisin' hell now...
Raisin' hell now...
I sing my boogie when the lights go out!
When the lghts go out!
I see her passin' by
In her hi-heel shoes
The boe takes the beer to someone else
We're stuck w/ the same ol' blues
I sing my boogie when the lights go out!
And all we got was
Cold women
Cold women and warm beer
Cold women...
Oh babe i need more
Come now little brother
Spare a dime for me
All my life i wasted here
Gave my soul for free
Raisin' hell now...
Raisin' hell now...
I sing my boogie when the lights go out!
When the lights go out!
And all we got wasEmbed
