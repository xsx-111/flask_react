Arc of a Diver LyricsShe bathes me in sweetness
I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams
I need my woman
This humble expression
Meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean
It has no meaning
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
I play the piano
No more running honey
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Lean streaky music
Spawned on the streets
I hear it but with you
I had to go
'Cause my rock 'n' roll
Is putting on weight
And the beat it goes on
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
With you my love
We're going to raid the future
With you my love
We're going to stick up the past
We'll hold today to ransom
'Til our quartz clock stop
Until yesterday
Whoa, until yesterday
Until yesterday
'Til our quartz clock stopEmbed
