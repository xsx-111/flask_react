Holdin On Lyrics
To keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on, holdin' on
To keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on, holdin' on

No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)

(Love, love, love)
Holdin' on, holdin' on
You loose, no, no
Can't turn you loose, no, no
'Cause I need all the joy you bring
Hey, I can't let you go with nobody
'Cause I love you, baby, yes, I do (Yes, I do)

No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
No, no, yes, I do (Yes, I do)
Oh, hip-shaking mama, I love you (I love)
Gonna give you everything you want
'Cause I gotta, gotta keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
I can't, I can't turn you
Can't let you go away, no, no, away, no, no
Oh, you'll be the only girl, you'll be the only girl
Holdin' on
I can't, I can't turn you
Can't let you go away, no, no, away, no, no

I can't turn you
I can't turn you (I can't, I can't, I can't)
Turn you (I can't, I can't, I can't)
I can't turn you
(Love)8Embed
