Insane Lyrics
You don't have to be afraid
You don't even have to be brave
Living in a gilded cage
The only risk is that you'll go

Go, go insane (Oh, oh, oh)
Go, go, go insane (Oh, oh, oh)
Go, go insane
And go, go insane
And go, go insane
And go, go, go, go insane
And go

Your mind is on track
For games we play these days
With every path we take
You know you're safe, safe, safe
The only risk is that you'll go insane
The only risk is that you'll go insane

And go, go insane
And go, go, go, go insane
And go, go insane
And go, go, go, go insane
Go insane
Go insane
Go insane
And go, go, go, go insane17Embed
