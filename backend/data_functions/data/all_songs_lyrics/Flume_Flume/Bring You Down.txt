Bring You Down Lyrics
Hush now, you're standing on a land mine
Tread lightly, get ready to explode
Hush now, those eyes cannot harm you
Keep your wits about, don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise this awful truth?

I've seen it all before, your eyes are wet
Your head is on the floor
And it's only a matter of time
Before we hit the ground running, running
Running, running, running

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise this awful truth?
Hush now, you're standing on a land mine
Tread lightly, get ready to explode
Hush now, your eyes cannot harm you
Keep your wits about, don't let it bring you down

And never let go
And I'm afraid of being too wrong
And I'm afraid of being too wrong in this side, oh

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise this awful truth?6Embed
