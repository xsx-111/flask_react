Sleepless Lyrics
On, on, on, on, on, on, on, on
On, on, on, on, on, on, on, own
On, on, on, on, on, on, on, on
On, on, on, on, on, on, on, own
On, on, on, on, on, on, on, on
On, on, on, on, on, on my own

Own, the way I want to be, be, t-tell me
The way I want to be-be-be, t-tell me

On, on, on, on, on, on, on, on
On, on, on, on, on, on, on, own
