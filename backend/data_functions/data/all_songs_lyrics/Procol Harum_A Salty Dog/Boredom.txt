Boredom LyricsSome say they will and some say they won't
Some say they do and some say they don't
Some say they shall and some say they shan't
Some say they can and some say they can't
(All right!)
All in all it's all the same
But call me if there's any change
Some say there's nothing and some say there's lots
Some say they've started while some say they've stopped
Some say they're going and some say they've been
Yes, some say they're looking and some say they've seen
(Oh, yes!)
All in all it's all the same
But call me if there's any changeEmbed
