All This And More Lyrics
It's not that I'm so cheerful, though I'll always raise a smile
And if at times my nonsense rhymes then I'll stand trial
My friends are all around me but they only breathe through fear
Were I to cry, I'm sure that still they'd never see a tear

In darkness through my being here, away from you
The bright light of your star confronts me shining through

Dull and sullen, much subdued, my skull a stony glaze
Whirlpools rage on constantly, I'm not so well these days
There must be something somewhere near
Who sees what's being done
The harbour lights are burning bright
My wax is almost run

In darkness through my being here, away from you
The bright light of your star confronts me, shining through


Come Lollard, raise your lute and sing
And to my ears her beauty bring
Like Maddox in the days of old
We'll feast and drink until we fold
And folding still we'll spare a thought
For what's been lost and what's been caught
And maybe then begin again
For love is life, not poison

In darkness through my being here
Away from you
The bright light of your star confronts me
Shining through
Oh, shining through
Keep shining through
Bright light of your star keep shining through
Oh!Embed
