Bluebird Lyrics
I thought of you too quickly, my body went to work
I sent signals to my fingers, my lips became a smirk
I stroked you out, I cleaned you up, I loved you into life
I sent you to another world, but you just turned the knife

I don't want your love, I need your love
Give me your love, don't love me
I don't want your love, I need your love
Don't love me

The shitehawk is nocturnal, he thrives in the night
Hiding in the bushes as he hawks his shite
He knows what's black and white and he knows what's good and true
He knows all the right thoughts to think and knows what's best for you

I don't want your love, I need your love
Give me your love, don't love me
I don't want your love, I need your love
Don't love me

We talk to no one, we talk to all
We gab with ghosts in windows
But to see is not to know, to like is not to love
Never present, never here, never there
Locked in our loops of half-truths and trifles
And who are you anyway? Who am I anyway?
Is there anybody there? Does anybody care?
I don't want your love, I need your love
Give me your love, don't love me
I don't want your love, I need your love
Don't love meEmbed
