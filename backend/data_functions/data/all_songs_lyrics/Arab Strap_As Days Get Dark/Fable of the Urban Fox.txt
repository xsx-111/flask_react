Fable of the Urban Fox Lyrics
They came in from the country
They were hounded from their homes
They'd always dreamed about the city
With its towers and spires and domes
So the dog fox and his vixen
Vowed to flee their savage fields
To a land of hope and glory
And the future it could yield

There's no rest however far we roam
Somewhere in this earth, we will find home

But the city didn't want the foxes, the city didn't carе
Their help and hope and hеart and hearth they dreamed of weren't there
So they scavenged and they foraged
Slept from shady place to places
Among the hostile architecture
And all the hostile faces

There's no rest however far we roam
Somewhere in this earth, we will find home
And the daily papers found their plight and presence most concerning
Their headlines screamed, "Enough's enough, we're overcome with vermin"
These foxes skulk around our streets
The locals live in fear
These scruffy scrounging parasites
They don't belong 'round here

There's no rest however far we roam
Somewhere in this earth, we will find home

One night they met a bulldog
He said, "What you doing here, then?"
They told him of the redcoats, of their fallen, hunted brethren
They said, "There is no going home now
The land we love is cruel"
The dog said, "Fuck off back to Foxland
These streets are fucking full"

There's no rest however far we roam
Somewhere in this earth, we will find home

One cold and hungry night, they find their dinner sitting pretty
The foxes can't believe their luck, who keeps chickens in the city?
But the chicken lover sees them prowl his pricey habitat
So he bashes both their heads in with his trusty cricket bat
There's no rest however far we roam
Somewhere in this earth, we will find homeEmbed
