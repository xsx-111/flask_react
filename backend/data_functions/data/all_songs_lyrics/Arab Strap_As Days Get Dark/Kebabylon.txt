Kebabylon Lyrics
I see through your swagger, I sweep up your sickness
I find what is lost and thrown away
I stoop for your secrets, I bend for your blood
I kill corruption, so it lives another day

I'm a wallflower in the darkness in fireproof clothes
Undercover, undervalued, underpaid
I ride the edges and the cracks, I see behind the curtain
I am invisible, I am your moonlight maid

Sifting through the streets of Kebabylon
Chasing down the ghosts of indiscretion and lust
These empty, filthy streets are where I belong
Down among the devilry, down in the dust

And you're already dreaming as I claw up your condom
As your syringe cracks underneath my boot
You've crashed on the couch, passed out on the porch
Such a lover, such a liar, such a brute
And with the evidence destroyed, your sleep will be sound
I'm your angel, your accomplice, and look what I've found
Sifting through the streets of Kebabylon
Chasing down the ghosts of indiscretion and lust
These empty, filthy streets are where I belong
Down among the devilry, down in the dust

So join me on the streets of Kebabylon
We can find a story for the ages tonight
These empty, filthy streets are where I belong
Always trying hard to outrun the lightEmbed
