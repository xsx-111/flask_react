Here Comes Comus! LyricsHere he comes through the crowd
Eyes black and limp
Buttons missing from a silken shirt
Shades inside at night, he's a full time flirt
Cocksure and vain
He's a walkin' state
Powders in his pocket end up on his knees
Puts an arm around you, says he aims to please
And you follow like the hound you are
Just take a sip, just take a hit
You can't refuse, the fuse is lit
You know you want to let him lead your soul astray
Says he can make the night sing
And he's got just the very thing
He takes you by the nose and you sniff his scent
Takеs you in the mouth on his knees by the bins
And then hе's straight back to the bar
Just take a sip, just take a hit
You can't refuse, the fuse is lit
It's not a game, you'll win, but how you love to play
And what has the night to do with sleep
There is no secret she won't keep
It's always sinful in the sunlight anyway
He's got his bloodshot eye on your sister
This rebel in rouge, this howling hipster
He's always in the dark but he knows his way around
He's always talkin' pish but he thinks he's so profound
All hail the false enchanter
Raise a full cup to the rebel ranter
He's got the double horn
Leaving all the lovely ladies all alone
And he teases and he toys with dumbstruck boys
We don't stand a fucking chance
There he goes through the crowd
Unprincipled and proud
Taking lots of numbers but he won't phone back
He's maybe wearing make-up but his tears are black
As he leaves you with another scar
You fuck it up again
Just take a sip, just take a hit
You can't refuse, the fuse is lit
With just a wink your superego starts to fray
(He sucks you in again)
What has the night to do with sleep
There is no secret she won't keep
It's only sinful in the sunlight anywayEmbed
