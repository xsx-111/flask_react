What You Need Lyrics
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close

I just want to take you there
He don't gotta know where
Does he touch you here like this, this, this, this?
Let me take the friction from your lips (Ooh woah)

And I'ma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you-
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you-
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I got everything you want with me
I do everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor
Doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby, leave them high-heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're looking down at me
I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn, shawty
Watch me knock your boots off

And I'ma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you-
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you-
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you-
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you-
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, ahh148Embed
