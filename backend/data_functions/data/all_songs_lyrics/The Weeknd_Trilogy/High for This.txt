High for This Lyrics
You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me (Ooh)
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

Take it off, you want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good, yeah

Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
You wanna be high for this

For this
You wanna be high for this
Ooh, woah
You wanna be high for this, yeah
You wanna be high for this195Embed
