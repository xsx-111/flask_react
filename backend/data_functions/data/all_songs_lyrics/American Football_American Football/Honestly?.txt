Honestly? Lyrics
Honestly I can't remember teen dreams
All my teenage feelings and the meanings
They seemed too see-through to be true
All the who's are there
But the why's (But the why's)
The why's are unclear (Are unclear)

Picture this:
The long awaited sickening kiss
How does it feel (Explain) to know (How)
We've re-written history (These things change)
Despite the complicated beginning to all of this
