Stay Home Lyrics
Don't leave home, again
If empathy takes energy
'Cause everyone feels just like you

But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social
But that's life, it's so social

But that's life, it's so social
So physical
But that's life, it's so so-so
So emotional
So, stay home10Embed
