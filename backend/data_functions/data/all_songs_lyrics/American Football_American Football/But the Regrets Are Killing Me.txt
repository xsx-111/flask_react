But the Regrets Are Killing Me Lyrics
Fools leave
Too soon
Built to
Fill roles
And fall
Standing alone again
Distant and
Dissatisfied

These four years
And how we say goodbye
To these four years
A long goodbye
With mixed emotions
Just fragments of
Another life (another life)

Not dead
Yet
But the regrets (Are killing me)
But the regrets (Are killing me)
But the regrets (Are killing me)
