The Summer Ends Lyrics
Thinking about
Leaving
And how I should say
Goodbye
With a handshake
Or an embrace
Or a kiss on the cheek?
Possibly all three

Well, maybe I've been wrong
Maybe my intentions
Are irrelevant
But honestly, it's not just for me
We've both been so unhappy
So, let's just see what happens
When the summer ends8Embed
