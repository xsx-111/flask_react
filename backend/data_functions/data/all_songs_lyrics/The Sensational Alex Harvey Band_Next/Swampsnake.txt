Swampsnake LyricsSsss...
Let me be your swampsnake 'til the real one comes along
Let me be your swampsnake 'til the real one comes along
I wanna be the medicine man and I won't do you wrong
Ssss...
Let me brush your carpet bring you coffee in your bed
Let me brush your carpet bring you coffee in your bed
Let me shape your pillow, root it underneath your head
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me wash the windows, let me clean away your sin
Ssss...
Let me wash the windows, let me clean away the sin
Float you in the water 'til your little ship comes in
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake 'til the real one comes along
Let me be your swampsnake 'til the real one comes along
I wanna be the medicine man and I won't do you wrong
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Let me be your swampsnake
Ahhh...? ha ha ha
Swampsnake
Swampsnake
I wanna be your swampsnake
Ssss...Embed
