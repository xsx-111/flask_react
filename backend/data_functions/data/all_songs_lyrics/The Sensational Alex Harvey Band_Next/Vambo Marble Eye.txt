Vambo Marble Eye LyricsHobo villa, Hobonee
Even dead, fear Ulandee
Even dead fear marble eye
He been living in a lullaby
Machinery overheat
Vambo teaching mastery
Overshaka, shaka fast
Even old marble eye go past
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Up the go-go river
Give away, lobster hobo, say OK
Long long lover
She say goodbye
He been living in a lullaby
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo never show him face
Hold him head in no disgrace
Hobo villa over Hobonee
Even the dead fear Ullandee
Even dead fear marble eye
Ain't no way for he to die
Tell me no story, tell me no lie
He been living in a lullaby
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo comin' to the rescue
Vambo comin' to the ...
