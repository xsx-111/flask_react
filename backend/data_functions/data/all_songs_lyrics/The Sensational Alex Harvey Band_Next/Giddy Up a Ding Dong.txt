Giddy Up a Ding Dong LyricsCome on folks and get in the groove, we gotta move
I went ridin' the other night
Two colour horse, oh my what a sight!
The name of my horse was Ding Dong
While we was ridin' and singin' a song
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
We rode and we rode the whole night through
My horse was tired, I was too
I had a date with my girl at eight
Come on Ding Dong we can't be late
I said
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Got to her house and I got down
There was the toughest guy in town
If I went in, he might use force
Mounted up again and I said to my horse
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
You got to giddy up a Ding Dong
You got to giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up a Ding Dong
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding DongEmbed
