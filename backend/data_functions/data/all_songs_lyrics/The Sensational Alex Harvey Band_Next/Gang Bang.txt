Gang Bang LyricsThere once was a woman with wings
Happy with the simple things
She had silk suspenders and high heeled stockinged thighs
Helping me in my need
She was a friend, indeed
She was my baby until the day she died
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the blues
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the blues
She was a woman who was twice my size
She looked into my eyes
She said "Only you can blow my blues away"
She said "I'll tell you what to do
Bring all your friends with you
And you can come up and see me any ol' time of day"
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the blues
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the blues
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the blues
There was twenty-seven guys
An unexpected surprise
She just kept on rockin' 'til the night was gone
She was smilin' through the tears
For a hundred and fifty years
Just lickin' her lips and helpin' me along
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the blues
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the blues
There ain't nothin' like a gang, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ...
... ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, gang bang
Ain't nothin' like a gang bang
To blow away the bluesEmbed
