Unsubstantiated LyricsGhost in flesh, I can see but you can't see
As we begin our descent into vanity
She's an X-ray of a woman
And she walks right out of the film
Dematerializes slowly
Scatters into the air
Unsubstantiated
Unsubstantiated
In the end, I can see but you can't see
The train is gone, we're alone in Germany
And the countryside is all golden
When the dream dissolves with a hiss
She's an X-ray of a woman
And she walks right out of the film
Unsubstantiated
Unsubstantiated
Hollowly, she whispers, follow me
Hollowly, she whispers, follow me
Ghost in flesh, I can see but you can't see
Decide to see what happens and it comes suddenly
Like an archetype of a lover
In the distance you will stand
And the countryside is all golden
When the dream dissolves with a hiss
Unsubstantiated
Unsubstantiated
Hollowly, she whispers, follow me
Hollowly, she whispers, follow meEmbed
