Chaos LyricsI wasn't expecting this
Now everything is destroyed
Underneath us are the nothings
Underneath them is a void
Beyond that void is a place
Where figments from bad dreams are banished
Childhood nightmares all come seeking
And adult logic nearly vanished
Chaos
Inside-down, upside-out (This is what they sing in concert.)
None of this is what I wanted
I truly asked for what I got
Bang the gavel, it's lawlessness
I can't unravel the knot
Half this wretched town is starving
While the other half are bloated
Everybody hates the bastards in power
But their pill is sugar coated
I didn't need any of this
I feel anxiety in my neck
The consequences now apparent
Feeding back unchecked
Incessant blue in spiral coils
Fingers underneath the skin
Adrenaline is not my mistress
But she always knows just where I've beenEmbed
