Swan Lake LyricsOh my ugly duckling, nobody loves you
Daddy said he'd buy you some ballet shoes
But he spent all he had on hash
And avoiding another crash
Now who will look after you
One night your shoulders will ache
But next day when you wake
You'll sprout wild wings, and fly
Just like in Swan Lake
Oh you helpless birdlings, nobody wants you
How will you ever survive out of the nest
And the wolf will put his nose in
And the water is so frozen
You'll have to swim like all the restEmbed
