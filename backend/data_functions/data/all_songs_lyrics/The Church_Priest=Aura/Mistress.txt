Mistress LyricsYou're shivering again
After all that we've been through
Is that all you can do
I didn't wanna come here
Now I don't wanna go
Is there some trick involved with this
As if you would tell me so
Everything is going wrong
All my songs are coming true
And another thing, that halo you wear on your head
I haven't seen one of those for years
Where have you been
In bed, you're dead
Vanishing again
After everything we've said
It's all too much for your poor little head
I've never ever been here
I'll never ever leave
Is there some string attached to this
Well I can well believe
(Repeat chorus and verse 1)Embed
