Dome LyricsI saw this film about some people who lived in a dome
In a beautiful field next to a river of foam
I fell asleep before it was over
I must have dreamt of the end
They'd be young forever as long as they stayed in the dome
But barbarians came and set fire to their home
Exposed the dome dwellers to the outside
They must have known it was the end
All of their wealth couldn't save them
All died inside the flames
Destined to make that same old mistake
God that's such a shame
The barbarians picked through the ashes of the dome
Then went on their way, yeah, continued to roam
But a curse was laid upon them
They must have known it was the end
All of their strength couldn't save them
All died inside the flood
Destined to make that same old mistake
The way of all flesh and blood
