If I Were King of the Forest - Extended Version Lyrics
If I were King of the Forest
Not queen, not duke, not prince
My regal robes of the forest
Would be satin, not cotton, not chintz
I'd command each thing, be it fish or fowl
With a ruff and a ruff and a royal growl - woof
As I'd click my heel, all the trees would kneel!
And the mountains bow and the bulls kowtow!
And the sparrow would take wing
If I, if I, were King!
Each rabbit would show respect to me
The chipmunks genuflect to me
Though my tail would lash, I would show compash
For every underling!
If I, If I, were King!
Just King!

Each rabbit would show respect to him
The chipmunks genuflect to him

And his wife would be queen of the mane
And I'll be monarch
Of all I survey
Monarch
Of all I survey
Mo--na-a-a--a-arch
Ah, shucks
Monarch
Of all I survey!

Your Majesty, If you were King, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

Not nobody, not nohow!

Not even a rhinocerous?

Imposserous!

How about a hippopotamus?
Why, I'd trash him from top to bottomamus!

Supposin' you met an elephant?

I'd wrap him up in cellophant!

What if it were a brontosaurus?

I'd show him who was King of the Forest!

How?

How?
Courage! What makes a King out of a slave?
Courage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave?
Courage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk, in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?
What makes the muskrat guard his musk?
Courage! What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder?
Courage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder?
Courage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the "ape" in apricot?
What have they got that I ain't got?
Courage!

You can say that again!
Courage is the king of kings
With courage I'd be king of kings
I'd be hailed and crowned by every living thing
If, if I, If I, were K-
King!Embed
