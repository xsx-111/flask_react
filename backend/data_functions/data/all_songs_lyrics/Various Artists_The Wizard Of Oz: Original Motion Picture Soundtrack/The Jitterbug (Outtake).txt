The Jitterbug (Outtake) Lyrics
Did you just hear what I just heard?

That noise don't come from an ordinary bird

It may be just a cricket, or a critter in the trees

It's giving me the jitters in the joints around my knees

I think I see a shadow, and he's fuzzy and he's furry

I haven't got a brain but I think I ought to worry

I haven't got a heart, but I got a
Palpitation

As Monarch of the forest, I don't like this sitchy-ation

Are you gonna stand around and let him fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar him down... but I think I lost my roarer

It's a whozis!

It's a whosis?

It's a whatzis!

It's a whatzis?

Whozat?

Whozat?

Whozat?

Whozat?
Who's that hiding
In the tree top?
It's that rascal
The Jitterbug
Should you catch him
Buzzin' round you
Keep away from
The Jitterbug
Oh, the bats and the bees
And the breeze in the trees
Have a terrible, horrible buzz
But the bats and the bees
And the breeze in the trees
Couldn't do what the Jitterbug does
So be careful
Of that rascal
Keep away from

The Jitterbug!
Oh, the Jitter!
Oh, the Bug!
Oh, the Jitter
Bug-bug-a-bug-bug-bug-bug-bug-a-boo!
In a twitter
In the throes

Oh the critter's
Got me dancing on a thousand toes!

Thar' she blows!
