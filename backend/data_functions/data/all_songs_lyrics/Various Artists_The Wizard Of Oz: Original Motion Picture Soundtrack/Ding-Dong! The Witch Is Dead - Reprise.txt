Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead - Reprise Lyrics
Ding-dong, the witch is dead
Which old witch? The wicked witch!
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out
Ding Dong's the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead!Embed
