Come Out, Come Out... Lyrics
Come out, come out, wherever you are
And meet the young lady who fell from a star
She fell from the sky, she fell very far
And Kansas, she says, is the name of the star

Kansas, she says, is the name of the star

She brings you good news. Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas, a miracle occurredEmbed
