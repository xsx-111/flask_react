Ding-Dong! Emerald City - Outtake Lyrics
Hail Hail, the Witch is dead;
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch;
Hail Hail, the Wicked Witch is dead!
Hail Hail, the Witch is dead;
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch;

Hail Hail, the Wicked Witch is dead!
She's gone where the goblins go;
Below, below, below, yo-ho;
Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out;
Ding dong, the merry-o;
Sing it high, sing it low;
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead!
Ding Dong, the Witch is dead;
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch;
Hail Hail, the Wicked Witch is dead!
Ha-ha-ha, ho-ho-ho, and a couple of tra-la-la's
Ha-ha-ha, ho-ho-ho, in the merry old land of Oz!
She's gone where the goblins go;
Below, below, below, yo-ho;
Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells (out);
We're off to see the wizard;
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz;
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead!
Hail, the Wicked old Witch is dead!Embed
