Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead Lyrics
Ding-dong! The Witch is dead
Which old Witch? The Wicked Witch!
Ding-dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out
Ding-dong's the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead!
-------------------------------------------------

As mayor of the Munchkin City
In the county of the land of Oz
I welcome you most regally

But we've got to verify it legally
To see

To see
If she

If she

Is morally, ethically
Spiritually, physically

Positively, absolutely

Undeniably and reliably dead

As Coroner, I thoroughly examined her
And she's not only merely dead
She's really most sincerely dead

Then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins
And their descendants
Yes, let the joyous news be spread
The wicked old witch at last is dead
Ding-dong the witch is dead
Which old witch, the wicked witch
Ding-dong the wicked witch is dead
Wake up you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up the wicked witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out
Ding Dong's the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

We represent the Lullaby League
The Lullaby League, the Lullaby League
And in the name of the Lullaby League
We wish to welcome you to Munchkin Land

We represent the Lollipop Guild
The Lollipop Guild, the Lollipop Guild
And in the name of the Lollipop Guild
We wish to welcome you to Munchkin Land

We welcome you to Munchkin Land
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
From now on you'll be history

You'll be his

You'll be his

You'll be history

And we will glorify your name
You will be a bust

Be a bust

Be a bust

In the hall of fame
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la1Embed
