It Really Was No Miracle Lyrics
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this:

The wind began to switch, the house to pitch
And suddenly the hinges started to unhitch
Just then the Witch,
To satisfy an itch, went flying
On her broomstick, thumbing for a hitch

And oh, what happened then was rich

The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation for the Wicked Witch
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation for the Wicked Witch
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch
Of what was once the Wicked WitchEmbed
