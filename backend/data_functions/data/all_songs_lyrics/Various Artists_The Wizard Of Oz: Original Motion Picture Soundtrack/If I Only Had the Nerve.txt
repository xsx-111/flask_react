If I Only Had the Nerve Lyrics
Yeah, it's sad, believe me, Missy
When you're born to be a sissy
Without the vim and verve
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse
If I only had the nerve
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandelion
A fate I don't deserve
I'd be brave as a blizzard
I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard

If the Wizard is a Wizard who will serve

Then I'm sure to get a brain

A heart
A home

The nerve!Embed
