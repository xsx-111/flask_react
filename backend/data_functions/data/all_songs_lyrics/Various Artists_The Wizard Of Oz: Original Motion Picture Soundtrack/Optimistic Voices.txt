Optimistic Voices Lyrics
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun, step into the light
Keep straight ahead
For the most glorious place
On the Face of the Earth
Or the sky
Hold onto your breath
Hold onto your heart
Hold onto your hope
March up to the gate
And bid it open
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun, step into the light
March up to the gate
And bid it open, openEmbed
