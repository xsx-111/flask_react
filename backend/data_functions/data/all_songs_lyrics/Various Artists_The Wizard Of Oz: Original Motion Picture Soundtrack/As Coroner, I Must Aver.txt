As Coroner, I Must Aver Lyrics
As Coroner, I must aver
I thoroughly examined her
And she's not only merely dead
She's really most sincerely dead

Then this is a day of independence
For all the Munchkins and their descendants, if any
Yes, let the joyous news be spread
The wicked Old Witch at last is dead!Embed
