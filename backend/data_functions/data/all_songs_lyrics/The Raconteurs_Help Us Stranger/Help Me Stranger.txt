Help Me Stranger Lyrics
If you call me, I'll come runnin'
And you can call me anytime
And these sixteen strings we're strummin'
They will back up every line, every line, every line
Yeah, more
Get me back
On my feet
Get me back
On my feet, on my feet

If you call me, I'll come runnin'
You can call me anytime
And these sixteen strings we're strummin'
They will back up every line
There's a motivation about you (Hey, hey)
That moves me when we're apart
It agitates my affection
And it wants to break my heart

Help me, stranger
Help me get it off my mind
Get me back on my feet
Brother, can you spare the time?
Help me, stranger
Help me get it off my mind (Oh yeah)
Get me back on my feet
Brother, can you spare the time?
It's not essential that I feel you
But it's a sensitive device
I'm reverential when I hear you
I genuflect to your advice (Your advice)
Well, I wish I had the words
And I want those words to rhyme (Oh)
And I wish I had the nerve (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I sure don't have the time

Help me, stranger (Yeah)
Help me get it off my mind
Get me back on my feet
Brother, can you spare the time? (Brother, can you spare the time?)
Help me, stranger
Help me get it off my mind
Get me back on my feet
Brother, can you spare the time?

(Yeah, hey)
Brother can you spare the time? (Brother, can you spare the time?)
Brother can you spare the time?
Brother can you spare the time?5Embed
