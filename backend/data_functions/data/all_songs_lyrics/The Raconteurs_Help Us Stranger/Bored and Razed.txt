Bored and Razed Lyrics
Rolling a juke joint box in the corner
Trolling myself in the mirror at night
Keeping an eye on my grindstone future
Staying away from the left and the right

California bored and razed
These days, she's living with another
Plastic features, perfect face
What a waste and I'm still thinking of her

Laying the cardinal sins on the table
Pouring the coffee out on the grounds
Changing the losses to wins if I'm able
Switching the pitch to an audible sound
Running the rounds of the mundane soldier
Trading the cards and erasing the names
Feeling a pounding, insane, colder
Sounding, system, feeding the flames

Well, I'm Detroit born and raised
But these days, I'm living with another
You tell me she can be replaced
But that's not the case, I'm so lost without her
Rolling a juke joint box in the corner
Trolling myself in the mirror at night
Keeping an eye on my grindstone future
Staying away from the left and the right7Embed
