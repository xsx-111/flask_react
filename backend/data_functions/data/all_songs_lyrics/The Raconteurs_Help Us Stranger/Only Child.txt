Only Child Lyrics
Only child, only son
Treated like a criminal ever since day one
Only child, where do you go?
And are you coming back again?
'Cause no one wants to know
Only child, one of these days
Someone's gonna come around
And try to make you change

Only child, sensitive soul
You see the beauty in everything
Without ever being told

I thought about leaving you once or twice
Leaving it all behind and never think twice
Somewhere far away on a beach sounds nice
Nothing on my mind, nothing on my mind

Only child, the prodigal son
Has come back home again
To get his laundry done
I thought about leaving you once or twice
Leaving it all behind and never think twice
Somewhere far away on a beach sounds nice
Nothing on my mind, nothing on my mind4Embed
