Shine the Light on Me Lyrics
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, what can you do?
Ooh, what does it prove, love?
New love comes (Ooh), so what can you do?

When you're searching in the dark
It doesn't matter if you're blind, does it?
Can't you see that even lightning's just a spark?
But it's so enlightening when you need to shine the light on me

Ooh, what can you do, love?
Ooh, if only we knew
Ooh, what does it prove, love?
New love comes, so what can you do?

My hands are colder when you're gone
It makes it hard to play the notes I write to warm your mind
But nothing's colder than the song
That's never played in a pile of papers left behind

Only God can know how the story's told
Over and over again
But we don't need to know why the flowers grow
Let's just be happy they can
When you're searching in the dark
It doesn't matter if you're blind, does it?
Can't you see that even lightning's just a spark?
But it's so enlightening when you need to shine the light on me

Ooh, what can we do?
Ooh, what can we do?
Shine the light on me
Ooh, what can we do?
Shine the light on me
Ooh, what can we do?
Ooh, what can we do?
Shine the light on me
Ooh, what can we do?
Shine the light on me
Ooh, what can we do?
Shine the light on me
Ooh, what can we do?
