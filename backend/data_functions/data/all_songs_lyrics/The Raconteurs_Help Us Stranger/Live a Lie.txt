Live a Lie Lyrics
I like it better when you tell me lies
When you hide what's behind those eyes
Don't wanna know about the things you do
I just wanna live a lie with you

I just wanna lie with you
I just wanna live a lie with you
I just wanna lie with you
I just wanna live a lie with you

I like it better when you lie to me
Well, I can't take all this honesty
And I don't need to know the cold hard truth
I just wanna live a lie with you

I just wanna lie with you
I just wanna live a lie with you
I just wanna lie with you
I just wanna live a lie with you

I wanna see you say it to my face
Come on man, now cut to the chase
And tell me it doesn't thrill you too
I just wanna live a lie with you
I just wanna lie with you
I just wanna live a lie with you
I just wanna lie with you
I just wanna live a lie with you3Embed
