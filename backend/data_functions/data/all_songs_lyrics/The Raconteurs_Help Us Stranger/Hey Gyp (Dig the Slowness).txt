Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness) Lyrics
Buy you a Chevrolet
I'll buy you a Chevrolet
I'll buy you a Chevrolet
If you just gimme some of your love, girl
Just gimme some of your love
Just gimme some of your love, babe
Just gimme some of your love

Buy you a diamond ring
Gon' buy you a diamond ring
I'll buy you a diamond ring
If you just gimme some of your love, girl
Just gimme some of your love
Just gimme some of your love, babe
Just gimme some of your love

I'll buy you a Cadillac
Gon' buy you a Cadillac
I'll buy you a Cadillac
If you just gimme some of your love, girl
Just gimme some of your love
Just gimme some of your love, babe
Just gimme some of your love

I'll buy you a sugar cube
I'll buy you a sugar cube
I'll buy you a sugar cube
If you just gimme some of your love, man
Just gimme some of your love
Just gimme some of your love, girl
If you just gimme some of your love3Embed
