Mia Lyrics
Watch me heap up what I sow
I'm made of peanuts and not of shells
God spares a quality in himself
Uniquely designed but we can't help ourselves, so

Why, I made a face that bugs you
I won't design conversation around you
I made a face that bugs you

Spyglass scans the field
Hold my hand, I feel a chill in here
Tired of lookin' through you
I've found myself, can you find you?

Why, I made a face that bugs you
I won't design conversation around you
I made a face that bugs you
I won't design

Spyglass scans the field
Hold my hand, I feel a chill in here
Tired of lookin' through you
I've found myself, can you find you?
Why, I made a face
I won't designEmbed
