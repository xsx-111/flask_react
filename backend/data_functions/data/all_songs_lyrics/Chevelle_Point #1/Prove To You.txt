Prove To You Lyrics
I'll fight your war
Promise not to lose
But you give in to circumstance
Not gonna prove to you

Learn of patience worth to you
Many teacher, no student
We go by name, not by rank
Too many sighs incompetent

There's no bond between some men
A concept already known
What little time you try to give
A big cheer for you alone

Relax and try again
Broke off, broke off and spent
He's choking in left field
Can't tell this place is doomed, now
No place like home
Doomed, now
No place like home
I'm gonna prove to you, I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you, I'm gonna, gonna
I'm gonna prove to you! I'm gonna prove to you!
I'm gonna prove to you! I'm gonna! Gonna!Embed
