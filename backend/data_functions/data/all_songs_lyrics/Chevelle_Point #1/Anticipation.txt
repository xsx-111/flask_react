Anticipation LyricsThis anticipation
Seen in you
As you prepare for new life
Don't forget your war
The cuts on his hands, speak a little louder
He takes that side, and lets you know
And what's in his speech, hands cover face
Yeah what's in his, you cover your
Your face
Face, face, face
Now you're anticipating
What went wrong
In this world you fall back into
Just isn't strong
The cuts on his hands, made way to his face
These spoke all the louder, my silent regret
I show that side, the pride of life
Won't let go
And what's in, hands cover
Yeah what's in his, you cover your
And what's in his speech, you cover your face
Yeah what's in his, you cover your
Face, face
Face, face
Your face
Face, face, faceEmbed
