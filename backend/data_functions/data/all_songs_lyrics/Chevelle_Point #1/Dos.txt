Dos Lyrics
Begging?
Do you mean groveling?
Settling?
It's not the same
Begging?
Do we take what's left
Settling? Settling this
I don't take requests

You two, you're what's left, I don't take requests
But you two, come this far
I might have something
To say
You two, you're what's left, I don't take requests
But you two, come this far
I might have something
To say

Now these two, treat them well
Upon themselves, showed up again
Now you sir, give up the gig
You haven't been repaid
Now these two, treat them well
Upon themselves, showed up again
Now you sir, Give up the gig
You haven't been repaid
You two, you're what's left, I don't take requests
But you two, come this far
I might have something
To say
You two, you're what's left, I don't take requests
But you two, come this far
I might have something
To say1Embed
