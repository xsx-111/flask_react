Skeptic Lyrics
Keep my pair of senses
Out of where it isn't clear
Kept his false creation
Teach on my own faith
Right I'll wreck this, too
But you made my day
I'll fail you, too
Speak through this voice, and
We can have life to take
And to mend these ways
We don't need tradition
This will wreck our mission

This isn't even clear
It doesn't tell them why
This is an incomplete
It doesn't tell the why

Even if I was all knowing
Wouldn't it mean that I love you?
See you move against ignorance
Why not try and get in
This isn't even clear
It doesn't tell them why
This is an incomplete soul
Set out a boom and line

What have scholars caught
Look to yourself to find a God
No, a lie, and
We can have life to take
And to mend these ways
We don't need tradition
This will wreck our mission

This isn't even clear
It doesn't tell them why
This is an incomplete
It doesn't tell the whyEmbed
