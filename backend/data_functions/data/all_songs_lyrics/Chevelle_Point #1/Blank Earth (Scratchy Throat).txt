Blank Earth (Scratchy Throat) LyricsA scratchy throat
I wish you would lift this, I drink liquids
Spreading true, I hope
A blank earth covered in nothing, living
Swear that it's something 'cause it's here
And we feel towards a place
And many pay by ignoring
And we feel towards a place
And many pay by ignoring
And you don't care
Where is the mother figure
While I'm here
And mostly it's hard when this happens
Don't keep inside life, 'cause that's not fair
And solder won't keep me together
If heat is there, the heat is there
I can feel you breathing
And patience is slow going
I'd like to obtain this
Now
And we feel towards a place
And many pay by ignoring
And we feel towards a place
And many pay by ignoring, ignoring, ignoring
And you don't care
Where is the mother figure
While I'm here
And you don't care
Where is the mother figure
Cause this is it made me think
Cause this is it made me think
Made me see caught this now
Caught me, caught me
Caught me, caught meEmbed
