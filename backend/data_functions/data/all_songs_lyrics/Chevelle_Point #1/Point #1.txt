Point #1 Lyrics
It seems I've gained the world but have nothing
To keep tabs upon this loss isn't wasted time
Face opportunities to recognize now we have the time
Rebuke, don't choke on this twisted dream

Cause he'll say pay for it
The whole sum
He'll say magnify pain
Is point number one
He'll say pay for it
The whole sum
To magnify pain
Is point number one

It seems I've gained the world but have nothing
To keep tabs upon this loss isn't wasted time
Face opportunities to recognize now we have the time
Rebuke, don't choke on this twisted dream

Cause he'll say pay for it
Yeah the whole sum
To magnify pain
Is point number one
We need a healing aloe plant
Your soothing hands run down my back
Hate, well couldn't do, couldn't do no wrong
Hate, yeah, this could do, this could do you in
We need healing aloe plant
Your soothing hands run down my back
We need healing aloe plant
Your soothing hands run down my back1Embed
