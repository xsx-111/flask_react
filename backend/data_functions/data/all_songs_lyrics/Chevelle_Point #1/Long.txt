Long Lyrics
Comrades bond
This day will be long
Don't blame your losses
Gain what he gave

Cause we blame him for having right
Anyone lose a god, cause I found a god

Raise the question that's given here
Ponder his answer, still bleeding clean
And the rhyme you've hidden in
Won't keep long
Cause we blame him for having right
Anyone lose a god

Reasons I ask you'll know why
As sure as I'm here you'll know why
Because he won't leave me out in the cold
See how the sparrows get fed from our Lord

Draw, close
Raise the question that's given here
Ponder his answer, your bleeding clean
And the rhyme you've hidden in
Won't keep long

Close, close
Close, closeEmbed
