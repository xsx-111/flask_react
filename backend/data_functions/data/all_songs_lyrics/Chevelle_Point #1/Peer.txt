Peer LyricsI'd like to leave this
In my youth
Pick me up on your way
Send away virus
Drink sight is water
Drink sight is water
Watch him sell mugs to bikers
To make a million dollars
Place you stamp here
Send out love letters
C'mon enough said
The skin on top his hands
Has dried to red
The words, want them touch them
The nerve, why are you here now
Why are you
Why are you
Back off peer
I am on top of this
Back off peer
I am on top of this
Back off peer
I need to make decisions
And I want to leave yea back off
Back off peer
I need to make decisions
And I want to leave yea back off
Back off, back off
Back off, back off
Back off, back off
Back off, back off
Back off, back off
Back off, back offEmbed
