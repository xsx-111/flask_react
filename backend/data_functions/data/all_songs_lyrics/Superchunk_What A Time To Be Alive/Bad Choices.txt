Bad Choices LyricsI could break every bone in my foot
Kicking down at your dumb door
I could waste all my breath asking
Lose all my early morning sleep
Wondering what for?
I could drain all the batteries
Searching for truth, searching for you
And the words you still wanna hear
We could scan every line in a script you bought for time
Keep our eyes peeled for a year
Oh but I won't
I got a lifetime of shit decisions
I might never learn from them
But all your bad choices
Are gonna cause suffering, yeah
You gotta get out
Out and about
Meet your weird neighbors
Once in a while
Take a deep breath of the air
Or get off of your bottom stair
Stop taking pride in your white style
Oh 'cause I won't
Oh, I got a lifetime of shit decisions
I might never learn from them
But all your bad choices
Are gonna cause suffering, yeah
All your bad choices
Bad choices
Bad choices
I could never forgive you them no
Oh noEmbed
