Break the Glass Lyrics
Nothing looks familiar out there
But everything's the same
It's just the center leaking out
While all the trees go up in the flames
Almost pretty from a distance
But it's hot beyond the glass
When the window breaks you'll feel it
And that thought might be the last

Break the glass
Don't use the door
This is what
The hammer's for
Yeah

Everyone is acting normal
But no one's sleeping through the night
There's a glow under the nightstand
It's a sickly kind of light
Maybe takes you down a hole
Maybe leads you out of reach
Use the darkness as a cover
Meet your friends down on the beach
Break the glass
Don't use the door
This is what
Our hands are for

Break the glass
Don't use the door
This is what
Our hands are for
YeahEmbed
