Black Thread LyricsThe problem
With letting go
No one to tell you
How low is low
The problem
With holding on
No way to know
When you're really gone
And it's stitched into your heart
And it's wrapped around your head
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
And it's wound
And wound around
It's a cocoon
It's a wall of sound
It's a rope and it's a chain
It's a sling, it's a stain
And it's stitched into your heart
And it's wrapped around your head
So
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black thread
Cut the black threadEmbed
