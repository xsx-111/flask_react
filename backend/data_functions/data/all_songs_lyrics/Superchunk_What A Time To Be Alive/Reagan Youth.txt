Reagan Youth Lyrics
95 degrees and it's summer '81
Window unit suffocation
Steam out on the lawn
Stretching khaki on the seats
Rubber melting on the streets
Cable's getting cheaper but there's something going on

Reagan Youth taught you how to feel
Reagan Youth showed you what was real
But to tell the truth
There was more than one Reagan youth

You can see your breath at the end of '89
'Cause the heat all drained away
And your friends do not look fine
Half of them go underground
Half just disappear
Either busted like a union
Or reanimate with fear

Reagan Youth taught you how to feel
Reagan Youth showed you what was real
But to tell the truth
There was more than one Reagan youth
Reagan Youth sharpening their teeth
Reagan Youth learning how to breathe
Now we know the truth
There was more than one Reagan youth
Reagan Youth
