I Got Cut LyricsOh, I got cut
Yeah, sew me up
I got cut
But it's what I want
Cut me up
Cut me up
Cut me up, yeah
All these old men won't die too soon
Flesh balloons still waving their arms around and
Slipping over the sides
Closing my eyes, making room
Oh, for somebody else
Oh, I got cut
Yeah, sew me up
I got cut
Yeah, it's what I want
Cut me up
Cut me up
Cut me up, yeah
Family planning, free Chelsea Manning
And all the kids crushed in canning from above
And fade like vapors, you actual traitors
To the ones you say you love
Yeah, I got cut
Yeah, sew me up
I got cut
Yeah, it's what I want
I got cut
Now sew me up
I got cut
Yeah, it's what I want
You try to tie us up
But we're free as fuck
Try to tie us up
But we're free, yeahEmbed
