All For You Lyrics
You think this is all for you
The pink and white
The black and blue
The silver stars
The deep gray sea
The damage you will never see

Fight me
I don't like to get hit but
Fight me
Not too worried about it
Fight me

You think this is all for you
A fairy-tale you're born into
The scales may never
Leave your eyes but
Tiny men are showed to size up

Fight me
I'm not a violent person but
Fight me
Can't really get any worse so
Fight me
Oh if you disagree just
Fight me
You think this is all for you
And something will be
When we're through
It's not a story of revenge
Just clearing air
That you have singed

Fight me
I don't like to get hit but
Fight me
Like we're just babies
Fight me
There's a million more just like me
Fight me
Fight me
Oh yeah fight meEmbed
