Erasure Lyrics
And now it's night
But I've seen our silhouette fade
And weaken to gray
We used to be sharp against the light
Our empathy weaponized
Our history bleaching out during the day

What you're after, what you're after
Erasure
Erasure

But we're the weeds
And you need a path now clear for you
A single golden tear for you won't fall
As if that's all we have to leave
To bleed, for the blank you want to fill
The heart you want to kill won't die
Can't you see?

What you're after, what you're after
Erasure
Erasure
Hate so graceless and so cavalier
We don't just disappear
Shifting shapes you're just an auctioneer
But we're still here

What you're after, what you're after
Erasure
