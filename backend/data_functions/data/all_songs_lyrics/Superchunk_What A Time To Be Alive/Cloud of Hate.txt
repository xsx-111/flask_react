Cloud of Hate LyricsYou broke the world that you're not long for
You broke the world we're living in
Opened a crack that you have longed for
The sickness you have always been
Oh cloud of hate
Oh cloud of hate
Oh cloud of hate float me away
Oh cloud of hate
Oh cloud of hate
Oh cloud of hate float me away
You have a dream
A bloody nightmare
For every human that's not you
You scare the kids
I hope you die scared
Of all the kids that know the truth
Oh cloud of hate
Oh cloud of hate
Oh cloud of hate float me away
Oh cloud of love
Give me a shove
Oh cloud of love, oh cloud of hateEmbed
