What a Time to Be Alive Lyrics
You brushed your teeth
And found your calling
At the bottom of a swamp
There was no air
But to be clear
Darkness was all you wanted
And now just floating to the surface
Hoping to find some kind of light
Revised your look but something stinks
And you will never smell right

There's a crooked line that runs
Through every crease in this map
And you want to take us all the way back

To see the rot in no disguise
Oh what a time to be alive
The scum, the shame, the fucking lies
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive

You've been carving tales for dummies
Out of live oak and out of pine
Let's turn your heroes into mummies
Throw them straight onto the fire
Yeah just below the surface lurking
A shadow breathing through a straw
Clinging to the myth that you were cheated
Yeah the myth that you were robbed
And there's a crooked line that runs
Through every crease in this map
And you want to take us all the way back

To see the rot in no disguise
Oh what a time to be alive
The scum, the shame, the fucking lies
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive

We can't pretend to be surprised
Oh what a time to be alive
The seasons change and some survive
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive

Oh what a time
To be aliveEmbed
