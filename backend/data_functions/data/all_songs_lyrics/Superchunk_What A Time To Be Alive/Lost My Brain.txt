Lost My Brain LyricsI don't know
And I can't explain
Lost my heart
And I lost my brain
I surrender to the flow of shit
I gave up all my sleep
I didn't learn anything from it
And I lost count of all the sheep
I don't know
And I can't explain
Lost my heart
And I lost my brain
Looking for something just to hold on to
Like grabbing knives when they slip
With small people looking up at you
You better find a new grip
I don't know
And I can't explain
Lost my heart
Oh and I lost my brain
It's an intentional thing
Making you wonder again and again
If you're the one that's insane
So grab a hold and let's make a chain
'Cause I lost my brainEmbed
