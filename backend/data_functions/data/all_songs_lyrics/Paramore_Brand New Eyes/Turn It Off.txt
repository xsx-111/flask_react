Turn It Off Lyrics
I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I
Will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
Or taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero
Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking, turning
It's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent
It's nonexistent but we just keep believing
And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I
Will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
And turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off
Just turn it off
Again
Again, again

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall
I will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom
And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I
Will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom
