Looking Up Lyrics
Things are looking up, oh, finally
I thought I'd never see the day
When you'd smile at me
We always pull through, oh, when we try
I'm always wrong but you're never right
Oh, you're never right

Honestly
Can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'll never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

Could've given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
Taking for granted most everything
That I would have died for just yesterday
Just yesterday

Honestly
Can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'll never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for
God knows the world doesn't need another band
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
But what a waste it would've been
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
We're just getting started!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Honestly
Can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'll never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
We're just getting started!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
We're just getting started!
Yeah, we're just getting started!10Embed
