Wind Below Lyrics
Flip this capital eclipse
The vocal tone has got 'em sweating their own apocalypse
Yes, rebel of the grains stand masterless
The masked ones cap one, NAFTA coming with the new disaster
And yes, we in with the wind and the Plan de Ayala kin
Coming back around again
The slave driver saliva, one night, power turns
Them devils mouths dry, now Mexico burns
So here they come, one by one, them killers of the new frontier
Occupy, causing fear, come on

With the wind below
We in with the wind below
With the wind below

Flip this capital eclipse
Them bury life wit' IMF shifts, and poison lips
Yo, they talk it while slicing our veins, yo, so mark it
From the FINCAS overseers to them vultures playing markets
She ain't got nothing but weapon and shawl
She is Chol, Tzotzil, Tojolobal, Tzeltal
The tools are her tools, Ejidos and ovaries
She was strangled, now through a barrel she breathes
She is the wind below
The wind below
She is the wind below

And all the shareholders gonna flex and try to annex the truth
While the new trust is gonna flex and cast their image in you
Yeah, all the shareholders gonna flex and try to annex the truth
And while the new trust tries to flex and cast their image in you
And GE is gonna flex and try and annex the truth
And NBC is gonna flex and cast their image in you
And Disney bought the fantasies and piles of eyes
And ABC's new thrill rides of trials and lies
And while the gut eaters strain to pull the mud from their mouths
They force our ears to go deaf to the screams in the south, yeah

But we in with the wind below
But we in with the wind below
But we in with the wind below4Embed
