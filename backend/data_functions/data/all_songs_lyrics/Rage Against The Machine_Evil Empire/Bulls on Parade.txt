Bulls on Parade Lyrics
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The triggerâ€™s cold, empty your purse

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
Bulls on parade, uh

Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
