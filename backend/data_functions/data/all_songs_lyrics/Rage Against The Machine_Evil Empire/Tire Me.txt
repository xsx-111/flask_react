Tire Me LyricsYeah, ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
I can see you in front of me, front of me
Ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
Why don't you get from in front of me?
Oh, she's got everyone's eyes (Yeah)
In every home there's a sickening distress (Yeah)
Of roll that film she's a precious, a precious one
But we're all gonna, nah, we're already dead
We're already dead
And those colorful words for the Laos frontiersmen
Who passed away with the truth amidst the eulogies of bliss
Who will know now what I know about you?
Now that history's a flowery cancerous mess
Yeah, ya tryin' to tire me, a mess
Overbearing, yes, ya tryin' to tire me, a mess
Yeah, ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
So get the fuck from in front of me
Nah, let's see it broken, bloody and undressed
We're already dead
{Guitar solo}
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
I wanna be Jackie Onassis
I wanna wear a pair of dark sunglasses
I wanna be Jackie O
Oh, oh, oh, oh, please don't die
Yeah, ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
I can see you in front of me, front of me
Ya tryin' to tire me, tire me
Why don't you get from in front of me?
We're already dead
We're already dead
We're already dead
We're already dead4Embed
