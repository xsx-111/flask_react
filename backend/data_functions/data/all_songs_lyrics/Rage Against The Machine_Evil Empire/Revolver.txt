Revolver Lyrics
His spit is worth more than her work
Pass the purse to the pugilists
He's a prize-fighter
And he bought rings and he owns kin
And now he's swinging
And now he's the champion

Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver

A spotless domain
Hides festering hopes, she's certain there's more
Pictures of fields without fences
A spotless domain
Hides festering hopes, she's certain there's more
Pictures of fields without fences
Her body numbs as he approaches the door
As he approaches the door
As he approaches the door
As he approaches the door
As he approaches

Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver

Yeah
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver
Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers? Revolver

Revolver
