Year of tha Boomerang Lyrics
The sisters are in so check the front line
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind
Cast me into classes for electroshock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimming in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
Ya weigh me on a scale, smelling burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screaming from within
'Cause I'm cell locked in the doctrines of the right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm running into Hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass the shells to my classmates
Aw, power to the people
'Cause the boss's right to live is mine to die
So I'm going out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
With the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang
In the year of the boomerang

I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it
So let the guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it
So let the guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it
So let the guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it
In the year of the boomerang

Yeah
Now it's upon you
Now it's upon you

The sistas are in so check the front line
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind
Cast me into classes for electro shock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimmin' in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
Ya weigh me on a scale, smellin' burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin' from within
'Cause I'm cell locked in tha doctrines of the right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm runnin' into Hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass the shells to my classmates
Aw, power to the people
'Cause the bosses right to live is mine to die
So I'm goin' out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
With the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang
In the year of the boomerang

I got no property but yo, I’m a piece of it
So let tha guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I’m a piece of it
In the year of the Boomerang
I got no property but yo, I’m a piece of it
So let tha guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I’m a piece of it
In the year of the boomerang
Yeah
Now it's upon you
Now it's upon you
You
