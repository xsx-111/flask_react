Roll Right Lyrics
Mic check and one, two, one, two
Mic check and one, two
Mic check and one, two

Lick off the shot, my stories shock ya like Ellison
Mainline adrenaline, Gaza to Tienanmen
From the basement I'm dwellin' in
I cock back the sling to stone a settler
Breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross
The capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo

Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm

This hits like fists, bomb with the left and don't miss
With the sickest stilo, I spark fear like pigs in the park
Head crack, I hijack the papers
The vapors caught fire up in your mind, come back, rewind one time
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross
The capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call

We gotta take 'em to the seventh level
We gotta take 'em to the seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on

Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled1Embed
