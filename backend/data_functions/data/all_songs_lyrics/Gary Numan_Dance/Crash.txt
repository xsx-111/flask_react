Crash LyricsDon't things change?
Don't we all?
What's it like to
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash
Like some down boys
You know
You are live
Nothing more to prove
So please just send in the machines
We know little of celebrations
And how things are with you?
You're hung up on time
You're hung up on age
Now there's me
Now there's me
What is it like to
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash?
I remember not
Half the things like
Such down and out
You drink to rumours and talk
About someone new in your bed
There is no game to win so
Get out as fast as you can
Hung up on 'the time'
Hung up on 'my age'
Hung up on 'the time'
Hung up on 'my age'
Oh woah, You don't know
Oh woah, You don't know
What it's like to
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driver
Crash? The driverEmbed
