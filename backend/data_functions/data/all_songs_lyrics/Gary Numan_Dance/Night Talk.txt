Night Talk Lyrics
Boys watch from windows tonight
I'm not surprised to see you waiting here
You keep them in business just supplying you
Get in the car I've something to say
Stay in bed, why waste my time
Open your eyes but only if you can
Office in a side street is no place for you
Night talk and romance like beat the clock

Boys like me aren't supposed to cry
But it's so easy to do
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry
But just look at you

Night talk, all I find, night talk
Night talk, all in, night talk

Take things slow, you can crack
Like your face I don't understand
How you smile and pretend it's fun
Do you laugh when the rats come round to play?
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry
But it's so easy to do
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry
But just look at you

Night talk, don't craze me, night talk
That don't craze me, night talk
Night talk
Nice boys like me like the night talk
Don't craze me, night talk
Night talk
Don't craze me, night talk
Night talk
Night talkEmbed
