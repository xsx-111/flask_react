Slowcar to China LyricsShe'll take a slowcar to China
She'll pay the rent for the use of you
She'll take a slowcar to China
She'll pay the rent for the use of you tonight
We are not afraid to love, but no new ideas
You almost get used to such things, you know
A mechanic's on the phone again, we break down
The others you'd remember if I could spare some time
In love with this elegant bitch
We are, we are
And here am I just a shy young fool
We are, we are
In love with this elegant bitch
We are, we are
She only sparkles at times for you tonight
She forgets that we know
She forgets who we are
I suppose the things I overheard were quite by chance
The only story I ever knew or cared for
Best left unheard I suppose, don't you?
You look for somewhere to start to look
We'll take a slowcar to China
We will, we will
Everything that you need is here
We are, we are
We'll take a slowcar to China
We will, we will
Everything that you need is here tonight
I forgot not to call
And now we're out of love
She'll take a slowcar to China
She will, she will
A little green worm inside my head
She will, she will
She'll take a slowcar to China
She will, she will
A little green worm inside my head tonight
Just pretend it's for real
You will pay like before
Just pretend it was me
You will pay Mr. Jones
There's nothing much to keep us alive, but 'Dance'
All that she can say is goodbye
All things change I suppose
We'll sing without voice, without heart and leave no address
I will never ever see you again, I know
Don't take a slowcar to China
We did, we did
She needed nothing and no one so
We did, we did
Don't take a slowcar to China
We did, we did
She needed nothing and no one here tonight
You will pay like before
Always one step behind
You will pay Mr. Jones
Always one step away
There's no one here to leave you behind
There's no one here to leave you behind but me
There's no one here to leave you behind
There's no one here to leave you behindEmbed
