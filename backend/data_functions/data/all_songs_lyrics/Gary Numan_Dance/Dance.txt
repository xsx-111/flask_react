Dance LyricsNo more than chance
I'm told it's quite surprising
I could walk out and just impress myself
I need to hurt
I need to crash for my sake
You are something
That I could do without
And I could always
Take the pills and leave
But you have to stay awake
To stay away
And I would die for you
And I would cry too
And I would sing like rain
And I would find you
I dream of rumours
Like a favourite pastime
With conversation like
"I need to breathe"
This celebration makes me
Crawl away and hide
And you must know that
I would die for you
And I could always
Take the pills and leave
But you have to stay awake
To stay away
And I will die for you
And I will die for you
And I will die for you
And I will die for you
And I will die for youEmbed
