Stormtrooper in Drag Lyrics
So here am I quite by chance near the phone
I could call and make you crawl into bed
Questions always questions
I'll just speak in slow motion
About obsessions with boys on the floor
Take that smile off your face
Wipe that tear from your eye
Don't say you're sorry for me
Take that smile off your face
Wipe that tear from your eye
Don't say you're sorry for me

Now look at me like a stormtrooper in drag
And I'll let you feel exactly like I do
It's so disgusting, I'm so tired of rhythm
And needles in arms
I don't want your point of view
Nothing to do
Nothing to steal
And there's nothing to say
Nothing to do
Nothing to steal
And there's nothing to say
I don't cry like love it, love it, love needs to cry
Like some boys cry love it, love it, love needs to
Love cries like some boys cry, love it, love needs to cry
Stop it
Like some boys
Like some girls
Look at you
Like a boy on the ground
Look at youEmbed
