Boys Like Me LyricsListen Zara
Listen Zara
Listen Zara
Boys like me
We get used to
Things like you
Boys like me
We don't understand
Lies like yours
Listen Zara
Listen Zara
Listen Zara
Boys like me
From rags to riches
Bleed for you
Boys like me
Regret things sometimes
Things like you
But it can wait
Boys like me
But it can wait
Boys like me
Listen Zara
Listen Zara
Listen Zara
Boys like me
We are short stories
Shapes for you
Boys like me
We live in dreams
But they're yours not ours
Is that okay?Embed
