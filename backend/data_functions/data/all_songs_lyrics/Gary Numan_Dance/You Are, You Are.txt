You Are, You Are LyricsYou are you are
Hopefully mistaken
Like old ties
You'll soon be broken down
Like all the rest who tried
You are you are
Something quite surprising

Concerning love
The scene will change for you, you know
You are you are

To see you leave
You are you're a
Living exhibition
Defying age
Like a seasoned veteran
Of the men for cash
I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait I won't forget
Exactly what you are
See her shine like stars
Before they burn
See her shine with stars
Before they fade away
Such a shame
The best of fame
I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait I won't forget
Exactly what you are

I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait I won't forget
Exactly what you are

I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how toEmbed
