If You Wanna Be My Lover LyricsIf you want to be my lover
Your anchor is too far out to sea
I'm completely out of order
And your bed is just too tidy for me
While you're playing hide and seek
Gloves with dinner plates and watching who's real
And if I were in your place
I would drive you home instead of our bed
Don't invite me out to dinner in a crowd
If you want to be my lover, love me now
If you want to be my lover
That fancy suit is not what I want to see
I can't help but being natural
What's underneath is more important to me
While your playing hide and seek
Teasing peep shows I'm still waiting to see
If I were in your place
I would stay in bed instead of the chase
Don't invite me out to pictures anymore
If you want to be my lover, love me now
If you want to be my lover
There's no necessity don't give me a mind
Give me what you mean to give me
That's exactly what it takes to get me high
Your still playing hide and seek
Your bluffing hasn't distracted me
Well don't you come into my space
It's appealing complimenting my pace
I won't ask you out to dinner, I'm too proud
If you want to be my lover, love me now
If you wanna be my lover
If you wanna be my lover (Love me now)
If you wanna be my lover (Love me now)
If you wanna be my loverEmbed
