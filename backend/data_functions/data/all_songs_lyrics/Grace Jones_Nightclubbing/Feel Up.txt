Feel Up LyricsFeel up, feel up, feel up
Feel up
Feel up, feel up, feel up
Down town rob, try to run, feel up
Don't give up, don't give up, feel up
You've had your dream, your dreams aren't real, feel up
Don't give up, don't give up, feel up
Feel up
Feel up, feel up
Feel up
Just 16, full time dad, just feel up
Don't give up, don't give up, feel up
You've had your dream, your dreams aren't real, feel up
Don't give up, don't give up, feel upEmbed
