Use Me Lyrics
My friends feel that
It's their appointed duty
And he keeps trying to tell me
All you wanna do is use me
But my answer to all that use me stuff
Oh, babe

Now I wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Keep on using me 'til you've used me up
(Use me)
(Use me)

Mother sat down
And you know she told me:
"If he can overcome you
All he's gonna do is use you"
But my answer to all that use me stuff
Oh, babe

Now I'm gonna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Well, keep on using me 'til you've used me up
(Use me)
(Use me)

Now I'm gonna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
C'mon and keep on using me 'til you've used me up
(Use me)
'Til you've used me up
(Use me)

Sometimes it's true
You really do abuse me
I lost the only people
Who ever really didn't use me
But oh baby, when you love me I can't get enough
Oh, baby

Now I'm gonna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Well, keep on using me until you've used me up
(Use me)

'Til you've used me up
'Til you've used me up
(Use me)
Until you've used me up
Come on and use me up
(Use me)
(Use me)
(Use me)Embed
