Art Groupie Lyrics
I'll never write my memoirs
There's nothing in my book
The only way you see me, an Art Groupie
I'm hooked

Some people like to be used
I've been used and amused
But that's the way I see me
My Art Groupie look

Love me in a picture
Kiss me in a cast
Touch me in a sculpture
Whisper in my mask

Don't ask me any questions
My personal life is a bore
Admire me in glory
An Art Groupie, that's all

Love me in a picture
Kiss me in a cast
Touch me in a sculpture
Whisper in my mask
I'll never write my memoirs
There's nothing in my book
The only way you see me, an Art Groupie
I'm hookedEmbed
