Walking in the Rain Lyrics
Walking down the street
Kicking cans
Looking at the billboards
Oh so rad
Summing up the people
Checking out the race
Doing what I'm doing
Feeling out of place

Walking, walking
In the rain

Feeling like a woman
Looking like a man
Sounding like a no-no
Making what I can
Whistling in the darkness
Shining in the night
Coming to conclusions
Right is night is tight

Walking, walking
In the rain
Come in all you jesters
Enter all you fools
Sit down no-no's
Vulgar fools
Trip the light fantastic
Dance the swivel hips
Coming to conclusions
Button up your lips

Walking, walking
In the rain
Walking, walking
In the rainEmbed
