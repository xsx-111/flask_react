Nightclubbing LyricsIt's much louder than before, man
Can you hear me?
Nightclubbing, nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing, nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people, brand new people
They're something to see
We're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?
Nightclubbing, nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing, nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances, brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
We're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?
Nightclubbing, nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing, nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people, brand new people
They're something to see
We're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?Embed
