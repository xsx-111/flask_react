Pull Up to the Bumper Lyrics
Driving down those city streets
Waiting to get down
Want to ditch your big machine
Somewhere in this town
Now in the parking lot garage
I found the proper place
Just follow all the written rules
You'll fit into the space

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to the bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up to it
Don't drive through it
Back it up twice
Now that fits nice

Operate around the clock
So why don't you come in?
Lots of space for everyone
One for you my friend
My lines are short, I'll fix you up
So won't you please come on
Shiny sleek machine you wheel
I've got to blow your horn
Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up to it
Don't drive through it
Back it up twice
Now that fits nice
Grease it, spray it
Let me lubricate it

Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up
Pull up to my bumper baby
