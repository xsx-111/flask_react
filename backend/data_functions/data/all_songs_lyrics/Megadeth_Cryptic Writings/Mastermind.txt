Mastermind Lyrics
Anonymous existence
Rendered useless to mankind
Destroy the logic volume
In the confines of the mind
Enmassed and purposeless
Marching in a perfect line
Neo-neuro torture
Mental meltdown, a heinous crime

Mastermind, I tell you what to think
Mastermind, I tell you what you need
Mastermind, I tell you what to feel
Mastermind

Invade the core of souls
To wipe the lives away
Design vacant beings
Welcome the inhuman race
Encrypted horror codes
Directive psyche overwrite
Processing brains to pabulum
Delete and format living drives
Mastermind, I tell you what to think
Mastermind, I tell you what you need
Mastermind, I tell you what to feel
Mastermind, I tell you what's real...


Hail to the power age
Lest the viral hour comes
Raise the flag of voltage
Bow to circuitry unknown
Kneel before the processor
Lords of static laugh
Electrons in submission
You must know who I am

I tell you what to think
I don't care what you thought
I tell you what to get
I don't care what you got
I tell you what to think
I don't care what you thought
I tell you what to get
I don't care, I don't care what you got
Mastermind, I tell you what to think
(I don't care what you got)
Mastermind, I tell you what you need
Mastermind, I tell you what to feel
(I don't care, I don't care what you got)
Mastermind, subject!3Embed
