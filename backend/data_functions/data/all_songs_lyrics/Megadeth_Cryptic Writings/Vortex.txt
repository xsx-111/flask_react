Vortex Lyrics

Internal combustion
Multiple personalities
Terror inside of me
A mask of silent agony
Curse the falling rain

The vortex of pain

As medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Lucifer in transition
It's time, time the price was paid
Scorching the domain

The vortex of pain

A telestic message
Written in torment
Howl out dirges
Like the horns of Jericho
Distorted faces writhing in rage
Walls of purgatory tumble down
Endless death, the jewels of a crown
The jewels of a crown...
