Blonde Blood Lyrics
I just want you in my bedroom
But I'm too nice to say the truth
I just want to taste your perfume
But you might have better things to do

But if you want to
You know I want to
If you want to
You know I want you too

I might act like I'm an asshole
Mean guys always get close to you
I want that too

So if you want to
You know I want to
If you want to
You know I want you too
So if you want to
You know I want to
If you want to
You know I want you too
Hey, you're in
No, you're in
No, you're in
