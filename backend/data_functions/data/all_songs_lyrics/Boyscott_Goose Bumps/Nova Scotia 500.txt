Nova Scotia 500 Lyrics
On a field trip
I grew some legs
Climbed up Cadillac Mountain
Dove in Frenchman Bay
On Porcupine island
Somebody lay
In a sandy coffin
Riding Atlantic waves

On a field trip
I grew some legs
Climbed up Cadillac Mountain
Dove in Frenchman Bay
On Porcupine island
Somebody lay
In a sandy coffin
Riding Atlantic waves

Nova Scotia bones
I found them all alone
Nobody knows
I just found me some goldEmbed
