Marco Polo LyricsIn the corner of her eye
She sees a sudden fright
But the water keeps holding her down
Her tears couldn't spring a frown
But her mind kept racing
She said
Can you canoe a few strokes
Through the pond
'cause my arms are falling off
Where had she been?
What had she seen?
Such a lovely girl
Drenched in front of me1Embed
