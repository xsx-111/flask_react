R.I.P. Sophie Moore LyricsYou looked in the mirror
And saw paint on your teeth
From your tiny fingernails
Hidden underneath the table
Where we sat on your birthday
Did you like that?
Did you like that?
Did you mind that?
Do you remember that?
I know I remember that
Sophie no more
You're just a sophomore
We carved our names into an oak tree
With a thousand other hearts saying rest in peace
Did you know baby
We were dying
Oh the irony sophie oh the irony
We were dying
Etched into an oak tree
Rest in peace
Sophie and me
Sophie and me
Rest in peaceEmbed
