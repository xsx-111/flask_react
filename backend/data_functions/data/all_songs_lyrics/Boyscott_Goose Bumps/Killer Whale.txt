Killer Whale LyricsToo soon
You're leaving and I just met you
I won't drift too far apart
I know it's hard
But I'll never let go
Just promise me you'll be here when I get back
I swear i will be here when you get back home
Shark tooth now hanging around her neck since june
She's been slowly losing heart
He hopes and thinks she will not fold
I will be here waiting until you come back home
I can't believe the stories
That I read when I was a boy
They waited and waited forever
To be with the ones they loved1Embed
