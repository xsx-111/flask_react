Testament to Youth in Verse Lyrics
Should you go looking
For a testament to youth in verse?
Variations on the age-old curse
You blame the stations
When they play you like a fool
And like a fool, you get played with
Baby, think twice
Maybe it's not all, maybe it's not alright
Maybe it's not all, maybe it's not alright

Finally a decent picture of the exodus
I don't know much but other singers know less, and
Can we control ourselves for once?
Keep our hands off each other
And keep our minds on the sum
Keep our hands off each other
And keep our minds on the sum of each other

So should you go looking
For a testament to youth in verse?
Dedications to the same old curse
Don't blame the stations
When they play you like a fool
And like a fool, you get played with
Baby, think twice
Maybe it's not all, maybe it's not alright
Maybe it's not all, maybe it's not all...
Oh my sweet witness, can't you hear the voices?
They're telling the children to rock for their choices, oh
The bells ring
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no
