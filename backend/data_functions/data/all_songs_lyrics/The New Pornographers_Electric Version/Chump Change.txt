Chump Change Lyrics
I stole a page from your book and a line from your page
And flew into a lesbian rage
Cursing mine and my own rotten luck
Another nude descends a staircase to get fucked up

A city scene, darkness falls
Now skate hard down the gallery walls
Explore those themes
I heard your work's informed by queens
Hey so is mine now

There's a plague on
There's a rat-tailed ensemble
Burying all of our heads in the sand
The same sand the desert uses
The same sand the desert uses

Now, wipe that look from your face
The world is that which is the case
It's okay to be seen, don't dethrone the drama queen
Just for putting everybody in their place
There's a plague on
There's a rat-tailed ensemble
Burying all of our heads in the sand
The same sand the desert uses
The same sand the desert uses

Now, wipe that look from your face
The world is that which is the case
It's okay to be seen, don't dethrone the drama queen
Just for putting everybody in their place
Yeah, wipe that look from your face
The world is that which is the case
It's okay to be seen, don't dethrone the drama queen
Just for putting everybody in their place

Go, don't stay, just throw it all away
There is you and then there is your body
Go, don't stay, just throw it all away
There is you and then there is your body
Go, don't stay, just throw it all away
There is you and then there is your bodyEmbed
