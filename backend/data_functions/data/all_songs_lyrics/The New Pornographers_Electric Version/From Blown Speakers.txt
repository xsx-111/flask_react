From Blown Speakers Lyrics
When the contact high
From the real life
Adventures wear off, you find
In the tiny moments
That bomb your old files
Rain down from the skies

And would they fall down
Like cymbal crashes
Would the alarm bell sound?
Would your eyelashes
Keep all this in time?
If not, I won't mind

It can be impractical
It can be impractical

So can you tell me
Why in every version
Of the events shown here
There's another season
That crawls by like years
From blown speakers, hear?
It came out magical
It came out magical

Just a contact high
One in every mood
I've ever declined to fight
One in every single
Exchange you might find
From blown speakers time

It came out magical
It came out magical
Magical, out from blown speakers
It came out magical, out from blown speakers
It came out magical, out from blown speakers
It came out magical, out from blown speakers
Out from blown speakers
Out from blown speakers
Out from blown speakers
Out from blown speakersEmbed
