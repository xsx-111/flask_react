July Jones Lyrics
Come clean through the waves of debris
The mind's eye is first to go
So hang onto that number like gold
And get thee back to the old truth
July Jones, July Jones
'Cause, baby, there's a lot we don't know

One of the greats on the way, hold on
One of the greats on the way, hold on
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?

Class war, held your hands through your plans
But not me, I stayed free
Baby, there are worse things to be
So lay free in your faith beside me
But lay low, but lay low
'Cause, baby, there's a lot you don't know

One of the greats on the way, hold on
One of the greats on the way, hold on
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?
Class war, kissed your lips left you stripped
To your toes and I know
That baby, it's so much to outgrow
So get thee back to the old truth
July Jones, July Jones
'Cause baby there's a lot we don't know

One of the greats on the way, hold on
One of the greats on the way, hold on
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?
One of the greats on the way, hold on
One of the greats on the way, hold on
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?
Behind the daylight, who knew what it could feel like?Embed
