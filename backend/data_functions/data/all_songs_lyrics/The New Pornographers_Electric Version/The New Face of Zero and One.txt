The New Face of Zero and One Lyrics
The how-to guide to become
The new face of zero and one
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
So fall into the new line
Hanging off the truth of the times
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Parade of sisters through New York
A trail that, once it began
Snaking its way through the memory of
Faking its way through the hallelujahs
Became a parade of sisters through New York
A trail of sisters through New York

You can't tell what the controls hide
From the door that locks from the outside
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
But you'll know why one day when
When you cross the line into godsend
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Parade of sisters through New York
A trail that, once it began
Snaking its way through the memory of
Faking its way through the hallelujahs
Became a parade of sisters through New York
A trail of sisters through New York
In the night, asleep and awake
Trust is just the dreams we've come to know
In the night, asleep on the case
Changed the words from chasing back to follow
Lovely words from chasing back to follow

Parade of sisters through New York
A trail that, once it began
Snaking its way through the memory of
Faking its way through the hallelujahs
Became a parade of sisters through New York
A trail of sisters through New York

In the night, asleep and awake
Trust is just the dreams we've come to know
In the night, asleep on the case
Changed the words from chasing back to follow
Lovely words from chasing back to followEmbed
