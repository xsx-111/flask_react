All for Swinging You Around Lyrics
Exploding international, the scenes, the sounds
And famously, the feeling that you can't squeeze 'round
While tearing off another page
Of loose change, outrage
It's another perfect day
Until the night show

Exploding international, the wind did howl
The sky above was thick with rings of smoke and clouds
And hanging on the bleeding end
Of conscious, who's this?
Was there anything I missed
As far as you know?
As far as you know?

Was it all for swinging you around?
All for swinging you around?

Exploding international, the sun, the sights
The moments you are viewing through a beam of light
Propel you through the golden age
We crash-land the first page
On a crumbling world stage
Into the front rows
Into the front rows
And all for swinging you around
All for swinging you around

And off your feet, all the love you found, spinning 'round
And off your feet, all the love you found, spinning 'round
And off your feet, all the love you found, spinning 'round, spinning 'round, swinging 'round

We're twisting incognito with no time, can't talk
Can't tell if this is fantasy or culture shock
Or remnants of a golden age
That's near mint, unplayed
Or a welcome overstayed
Beneath the light show
Beneath the light show

All for swinging you around
All for swinging you around
All for swinging you around
All for swinging you around
All for swinging you around
All for swinging you aroundEmbed
