The End of Medicine Lyrics
The angel cries, "You bastard"
As we analyze the accent
So look out, you rock 'n' rollers
Over forty million served
And that's a record for the master
Stood forever after

So are we, are we, are we, are we facing
The end of all, of all the drugs we're lacing?

With common sense and courtesy
And other things we thought would be the end of us
But now they won't allow us our intentions
Oh, the mother of invention
It's her pleasure to repeat with feeling

Are we, are we, are we, are we facing
The end of all the medicine we're taking?

Somewhere in the system
There's an open-ended list
Of all the lies we tell
Unblinking, thinking
What could we be living?
Is it life?
Or is it even in the realm of possibility?
You see it when you're missing
Who you came to see, is this thing
Even on and on and on?
Are we, are we, are we, are we facing
The end of all the medicine we're taking?
Are we, are we, are we, are we facing
The end of all the medicine we're taking?Embed
