The Laws Have Changed Lyrics
It was crime at the time
But the laws, we changed 'em
Though the hero for hire's
Forever the same one

Introducing for the first time:
Pharaoh on the microphone

Sing, 'All Hail'
What'll be revealed today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the line to the throne?

Awakened to cheers
After years on the faultline
We are shocked to be here
In the face of the meantime

Pharaoh, all your methods have taught me
Is to separate my blood from bone
It will all fail
Feel what I feel today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the line to the throne

Form a line, to the
Form a line, to the
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne

Alone in the chain
It remains to be seen how
How well you can play
When the pawn takes a queen now

Introducing for the first time:
Pharaoh on the microphone
Sing, 'All Hail'
What'll be revealed today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the line to the throne?
Sing, 'All Hail'
What'll be revealed today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the line to the throne?

Form a line, to the
Form a line, to the
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne

It was crime at the time, but the laws have changed, yeah
It was crime at the time, but the laws have changed, yeahEmbed
