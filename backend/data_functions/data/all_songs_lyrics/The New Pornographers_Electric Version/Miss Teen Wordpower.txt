Miss Teen Wordpower Lyrics
Our words move aimlessly through empty city squares
Collecting into mobs and angry like their prayers
They breathe the air we fought to leave behind
This kind of blank adventure happens all the time

Because nobody knows the wreck of the soul the way you do
The way you do

We fought to find our thoughts, the runway walked us through
The swimsuit portion of the evening cancelled due
To rain, the pageant's called again, you'll find
This kind of blank adventure happens all the time

Because nobody knows the wreck of the soul the way you do
The way you do
Miss Teen Wordpower
Miss Teen Wordpower

So we float through the streets
Breathe city lights, claims of the crown forgotten
So we float through the streets
Breathe city lights, claims of the crown forgotten
So we float through the streets
Breathe city lights, claims of the crown forgotten
So we float through the streets
Float through the streets
The way you do
The way you do
Miss Teen Wordpower
Miss Teen Wordpower

Nobody knows the wreck of the soul the way you do
The way you do
