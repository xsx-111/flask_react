Miss Missing You Lyrics
Don't panic, no, not yet
I know I'm the one you want to forget
Cue all the love to leave my heart
It's time for me to fall apart

Now you're gone, but I'll be okay
Your hot whiskey eyes have fanned the flame
Maybe I'll burn a little brighter tonight
Let the fire breathe me back to life

Baby, you were my picket fence, I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin, I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better, the darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh, we're fading fast, I miss missing you now and then

Making eyes at this husk around my heart
I see through you when we're sitting in the dark
So give me your filth, make it rough
Let me, let me trash your love

I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh, and I've heard you got it, got it so bad
'Cause I am the best you'll never have
Baby, you were my picket fence, I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin, I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better, the darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh, weâ€™re fading fast, I miss missing you now and then
Now and then, now and then, now and then

Baby, you were my picket fence
I miss missing you now and then...40Embed
