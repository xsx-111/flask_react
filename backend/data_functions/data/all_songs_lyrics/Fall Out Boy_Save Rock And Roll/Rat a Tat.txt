Rat a Tat Lyrics
It's Courtney, bitch
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
So they just DIY'd that shit and they built their own bombs
She's his suicide blonde, she's number than gold
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!

Are you ready for another bad poem?
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in
Remember me as I was, not as I am
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow
If I don't wake up dead"
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition
And she'd let it go to my head

Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If my love is a weapon, there's no second guessing when I say
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If my heart is a grenade, you pull the pin and say
We're all fighting, growing old, we're all fighting, growing old
In the (Hope!) hopes of a few minutes more
To get-get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never getting any better than this

We are professional ashes of roses, this kerosene's live
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
You settled your score, this is where you come to beg
'Cause it's never getting any better than this
Unborn and unshaven, killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
This is what we do, baby, we nightmare you

I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heart beat in reverse
Our guts can't be reworked
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert getting burned
But I'll take your heart served up two ways
I sing a bitter song
I'm the lonelier version of you
I just don't know where it went wrong
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If my love is a weapon, there's no second guessing when I say
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If my heart is a grenade, you pull the pin and say

We're all fighting, growing old, we're all fighting, growing old
In the (Hope!) hopes of a few minutes more
To get-get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never getting any better than this

Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this

She's sick and she's wrong, she's young dirty blonde
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb
He says, "I've seen bigger," she says, "I've lit better"
And they throw the matches down into the glitter
Not a dry eye left in the house
Talk less, mean more
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
Let's be electric, like we were before
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
Talk less, mean more
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
We're all fighting, growing old, we're all fighting, growing old
In the (hope!) hopes of a few minutes more
To get-get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never getting any better than this

Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Are you ready for another bad poem?19Embed
