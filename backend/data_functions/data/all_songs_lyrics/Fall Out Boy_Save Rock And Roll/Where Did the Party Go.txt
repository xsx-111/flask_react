Where Did the Party Go Lyrics
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I'm here to collect your hearts
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say
But I can't stop listening
This is the story of how they met
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
And when she touched him he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget, never forget

And all the boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again

Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
I know I expect too much
And not enough all at once
You know I only wanted fun
And you got me all fucked up on love
I looked for your name on the ouija board
And your naked magic, oh dear lord
You and me are the difference between real love
And the love on TV, love on TV

And all the boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again, yeah

Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

We were the kids who screamed, "we weren't the same," in sweaty rooms
Now we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs
Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema life
So let's fade away together one dream at a time
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
