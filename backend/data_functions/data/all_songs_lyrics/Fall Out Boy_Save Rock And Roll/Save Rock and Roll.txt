Save Rock and Roll Lyrics
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your
Forever, forever

I need more dreams and less life
I need that dark in a little more light
I cried tears you'll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean, and leave me be

You are what you love, not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'yes', I'm here to scream

No, no (no, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll (forever, forever)
No, no (no, no), wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll (forever, forever)

Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your
Forever, forever
Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence for the voice of a generation
Whoa! How'd it get to be only me?
Like I'm the last damn kid still kicking that still believes

I will defend the faith going down swinging
I will save the songs, that we can't stop singing

No, no (no, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll (forever, forever)
No, no (no, no), wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll (forever, forever)

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
(Until your breathing stops, stops, stops)
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
(Until your breathing stops, stops, stops)
Oh no, we won't go
(Until your-your-your-your-your)
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
(Forever, forever)
You are what you love, not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'yes', I'm here to scream...

No, no (no, no)
Wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll (forever, forever)
No, no (no, no), wherever I go, go (go, go)
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll (forever, forever)

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
(No, no)
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
(Wherever I go, go)
Oh no, we won't go
(Trouble seems to follow)
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
(I only plugged in to save rock and roll)
Oh no, we won't go
(No, no)
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
(Wherever I go, go)
Oh no, we won't go
(Trouble seems to follow)
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
(Only plugged in to save rock and roll...)36Embed
