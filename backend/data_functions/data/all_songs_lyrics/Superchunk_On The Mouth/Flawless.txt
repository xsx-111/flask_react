Flawless LyricsYour skin is so thin
That i can see right through
And you don't think i can
Cause my heart is made of stone
And i'm kicking just for hurt
And you don't like that hurt
It's more than i can stand
You just watch the band and you think that you can
Tell me how it is
I will not be there when the curtain comes down
And you think that you're not fooled
Like everybody else
And i can see the world
Destruction is a bore
And i'm mad about the business
And i'm mad about my projects
It's taking me apart
You just watch the band and you think that you can
Tell me how it is
