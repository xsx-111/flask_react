For Tension LyricsI've got bruises from where you brushed against me
They feel good and i'm history
Here comes a shower of sparks
That will one day give us away
For tension
Guess what i use?
For tension
You can use me
For tension
Your attention
For tension your attention's all i ever need
Need
Yeah
Do something wrong you must be joking
Do something right i'm only kidding myself
You take a look down off the shelf
And change address and i can't help myself
For tension
Guess what i use?
For tension
You can use me
For tension
Your attention
For tension your attention's all i ever need
Need
For tension
Guess what i use?
For tension
You can use me
For tension
Your attention
For tension your attention's all i ever need
Need, need, need...Embed
