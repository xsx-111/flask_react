From the Curve LyricsIs this what you expected?
Flat and empty, how i feel?
The brain is emptied out and clean
Clean is not a state that's real
So take what you are given
Just forget what you deserve
People think you're out there living
But you fell from the curve
Give me a name
Right now i'm just a cycle
Waiting to end
Right now i feel recycled
And i'm ready to leave again
Some tree in bloom like crazy hair
Some man in feathers flying
I want to stay i don't i'm lying
Getting used to it's what i feel
So much to answer for
We have so much to answer for
So sick of talking about it
Falling asleep on the floor
Give me a name
Right now i'm just a cycle
Waiting to end
Right now i feel recycled
And i'm ready to leave againEmbed
