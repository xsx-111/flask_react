The Question Is How Fast LyricsThe hair is blonde and falls
Down your face
An unsuccessful attempt
To try and erase
The fog(?fall) is blue and settles
Settles with the heat
This bitching is familiar i can
Trace you with my feet

To winter in your ear
Bleeds you draining cup of oil
It's bitter, makes me cheer
??grasping body front
??cleaning into moon
Sheets are wrapped around i will be
Joining you there soon
The matter is not where we go
But how long it will last
The question is how fast
This is not a test, it's just an ask
And the question is how fast
And the question is...Embed
