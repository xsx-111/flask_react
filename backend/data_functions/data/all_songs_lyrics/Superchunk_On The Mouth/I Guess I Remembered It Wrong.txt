I Guess I Remembered It Wrong LyricsI remember flying
Straight over the top
When the car it hits the curb
How could we had stopped
Passed right over, went around
Passed right over, went around
?? up into my eye
Up from the ground
I know there is no way
It could have happened that way
There is no way it could've
Happened in any other way
I guess i remember it wrong
I guess i remember it wrong
I think that my memory's strong but
Whatever you say
I remember digging up the yard
I remember carrying you from the car
And i stuffed the valuables into the seat
Everything was brighter than it seemed
I guess i remember it wrong
I guess i remember it wrong
I think that my memory's strong but
Whatever you say
It's all coming back to me now . . Embed
