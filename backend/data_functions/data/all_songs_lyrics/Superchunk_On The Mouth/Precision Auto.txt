Precision Auto LyricsHave you got a minute?
Can you fit me into it?
Have you got a minute?
Have you got a year?
Have you got a year?
Have you lost your sight?
Have you lost your strength
Just to prove your might?
Do not pass me just to slow down
I can move right through you
Do not pass me just to slow down
I have precision auto
I see you way too slow
I see you in slow motion
You've got muscles, use them
Do not hand me a chapter
Do not hand me a story
I will only lose them
Do not pass me just to slow down
I can move right through you
Do not pass me just to slow down
I have precision autoEmbed
