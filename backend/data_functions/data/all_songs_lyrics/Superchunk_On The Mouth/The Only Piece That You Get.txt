The Only Piece That You Get LyricsWhat do you mean
This is the only piece that I get
Just let us sleep
And you'll hear everything that's been said
And the languages change in the dark
But on paper it makes perfect sense
In a box on some wheels in a room
And use any word but intent
This is the only piece that you get
This is the only piece that you get
If the right side eludes you this time
There's another one standing in line
If the right side eludes you this time
There's another one standing in line
And the languages change in the dark
But on paper it makes perfect sense
On paper it makes perfect senseEmbed
