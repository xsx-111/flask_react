New Low LyricsCome on follow me ??
I will run straight home
When i can't be true (betray you)
To you i turn to go
Say you wanna be in my shoes
You must be crazy
Say you wanna be in my shoes
Well you must be crazy
We are reaching a new low
We are reaching a new low
We are reaching a new low
Come on shake me down
And i will run your drug
I don't want to sleep alone
I wanna sleep in your bunk
Tell me you are not forgotten
Tell me you are not forgotten
Tell me are you feeling rotten now?
Tell me you are not forgotten
Tell me that you want it and how
Tell me are you feeling rotten now?
Yeah!Embed
