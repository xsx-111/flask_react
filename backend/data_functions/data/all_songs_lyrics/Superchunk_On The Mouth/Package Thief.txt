Package Thief LyricsRunning with both hands outstretched
Accepting the package
Only a son understands
He's in the basement
The kids around are scared
They keep their distance
Room after room stolen goods
It means nothing to her
I've been home
I've been out
Something's kept him off (from) his route
The boxes never reach my house
All the kids around are scared
They keep their distance
She's got a deal no one believes it
It means nothing to herEmbed
