Trash Heap LyricsArranged by color
By pattern a ??
The right things in their place
There's room for a new one
The pile, the mess, the trash heap
The smile, the caress I might keep
The pile, the mess, the trash heap
The cotton dress, I can't sleep
I need a name, I need a number
I need a piece of paper
I need a button marked static
And I feel better
The pile, the mess, the trash heap
The smile, the caress I might keep
The pile, the mess, the trash heap
The cotton dress, I can't sleep
Hold the mirror up to me
Hold the mirror up to me
Hold the mirror up what do you see?Embed
