Untied LyricsI stand on one end of the board
She drops the rock hard on the other end
And i'm flying through the air
And it's a trip i never planned
And i didn't bring much with me
You wouldn't let me bring much with me
But you're riding now beside me
So where will we land?
You pull the string and i come untied
Pull the string and i come untied
It's always me coming to your door
With some stuff i found in the trash
And these things i brought you before
Well i guess they didn't match
So now whenever you are down
Take me down with you
Pull the string and i come untied
Pull the string and i come untied
What's the use if this thing has died?Embed
