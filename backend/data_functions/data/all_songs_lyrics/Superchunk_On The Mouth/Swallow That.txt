Swallow That LyricsSpreading out
It could be tar
It could be blood
It could be not fluid at all
And if it helps you sleep
And if it helps you get to sleep
Swallow that
Swallow that until you're full
I find it true
I find it to be true
That all your little deaths
Are more imagined than not
And if it helps you to live
And if it helps you to stay awake
Swallow that
Swallow that until you rot
It's wrapped and tied
Just like it should be
It's wrapped and tied
Enough to fool me
I'm pretty sure there's someone near me
It's just a body
It looks without life
It looks lifeless enough to me
It's inside out
Like a carpet should be
Who helped with this one
I mean what brought this
Particularly to the floor
There is always a trigger
Things don't just happen
They don't just happen
By themselves
It's just the wind
It's just the hinge
It's not an angry ghost
Closing that door
It's wrapped and tied
Just like it should be
It's wrapped and tied
Enough to fool me
I'm pretty sure there's someone near me
It's just a bodyEmbed
