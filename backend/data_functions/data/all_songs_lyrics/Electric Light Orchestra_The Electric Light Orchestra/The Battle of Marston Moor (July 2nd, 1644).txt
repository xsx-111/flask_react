The Battle of Marston Moor (July 2nd, 1644) Lyrics
My lord, king:
You stoop to betray your own people
And even in the eyes of God do you not relent?
I am therefore bound by no other course
I shall raise an army
Together, we will march against you and your kind
And every born man will fight to regain his own freedom
And cleanse his wretched soul
(Aye! Aye!)Embed
