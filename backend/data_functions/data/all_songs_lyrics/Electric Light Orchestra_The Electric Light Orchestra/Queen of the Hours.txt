Queen of the Hours Lyrics
Queen of the hours lies waiting for the wind
To blow away the veil of time
Slowly now the threads of age
Are starting to unwind

Queen of the hours, along, along, along
The path of time, of time
She is still, the clock shall tell the tale
When all is well, is well

Black was the night that came in from the East
And caused the land to sleep
Riding on a storm
It carved a message in Isabella Creek

Queen of the hours, along, along, along
The path of time, of time
She is still, the clock shall tell the tale
When all is well, is well

Dawn is the death wish night has passed away
It left the sacred flower
Opened up the grave and bowed
Its life unto the queen of hours
Queen of the hours, along, along, along
The path of time, of time
She is still, the clock shall tell the tale
When all is well, is well1Embed
