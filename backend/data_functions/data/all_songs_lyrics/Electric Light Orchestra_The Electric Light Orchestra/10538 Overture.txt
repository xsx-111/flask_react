10538 Overture Lyrics
Did you see your friend
Crying from his eyes today?
Did you see him run
Through the streets and far away, aah?
Did you see him run?
Did you see him fall? (Aah, aah, aah)
Did his life flash by
At the bedroom door? (Aah, aah)

(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)

Did you hear the news?
It came across the air today
Someone had been found
On the rocks down in the bay, aah
Did you see him hide?
Did you see him crawl? (Aah, aah, aah)
Does his life mean more
Than it did before? (Aah, aah)

(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
Did you see that man
Running through the streets today?
Did you catch his face?
Was it 10538, aah?2Embed
