Whisper in the Night Lyrics
Whisper in the night over silent evening air
Angel's gown shines white all at once you're glad she's there
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me

For I'll be here 'til light
Whisper in the night
'Til she has forgiven me

Night turns into gold, so the tide may turn today
Though God gave the world, it's not mine to throw away
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me

For I'll be here 'til light
Whisper in the night
'Til she has forgiven me
Whisper in the night
'Til she has forgiven me

Help to face what the day may bring
Angels sing
You were sent to make the night be kind
What will I find?
Angels sing
Snowflake bird she comes
Taking grey clouds from your door
Face the midnight sun
You have something to live for
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me

For I'll be here 'til light
Whisper in the night
'Til she has forgiven me
Whisper in the night
'Til she has forgiven meEmbed
