Nellie Takes Her Bow Lyrics
Who thanked the Lord for the clothes
That she wore and mended?
Nellie with the big old-fashioned eyes
Who won the heart of a crowd
Tore apart, took a bow?
Nellie, there's a different world backstage

I see the floodlights burning
I hear the band play on
Now Nellie takes her bow

She said she really could not stay
Nellie, she had a brand-new play to play
And so she paints her face and smiles
And she'll be someone else in a while

I see the floodlights burning
I hear the band play on
Now Nellie takes her bow

Just a lonely girl
Who could not face a broken world
And so she acts out all her dreams
And wishes that's how it had been
But when the audience is near
It seems as though she doesn't even care

Nellie just sent me a line
To tell me she was doing fine
She got the lead and on Broadway
And really digging her today
And so she turns that doggone page
Living someone's life upon the stage

I see the floodlights burning
I hear the band play on
Now Nellie takes her bowEmbed
