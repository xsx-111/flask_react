Woman (in mirror) LyricsWhere a bookshelf goes or a throw rug
How you shape any common space
And the language you make out of looks and names
All the motions of ordinary love
All the weight it can hold when you say one name
All the motions of ordinary love
They grow and change
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
In the bathroom off the kitchen
Leave the door ajar in a brand new dress
Let me watch put your make up on
Let me in give me holy privileges
There's a dinner thing Thanksgiving
Dress up nice make a dish to bring
There are moments here only yours and mine
Tiny dots on an endless timeline
Tiny dots on an endless timeline
Tiny dots on an endless timeline
Tiny dots on an endless timeline
Tiny dots on an endless timeline
In the mirror with your eyes wide
Trace outlines ask for wine
But you never look away when you do
Your eyes don't move I never move mine from you
And I watch you your reversal
It's an honest thing when there's no one there
Some days they feel like dress rehearsals
Some days I watch and you don't care
There's a dinner Thanksgiving
Dress up nice make a dish to bring
There are moments here only yours and mine
Tiny dots on an endless timeline
Tiny dots on an endless timeline
Go on and on and on
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
I know, I know
All the motions of ordinary love
I know, I know
A glance back
The small of yours
On the sink where I set your glass
A hand that rests there flat
A moment
Retracts
And the recognition
That you give
When you shift position
Move your hip
Slightly in
We say nothing then out loud and
That's what feels the most profound
And I watched you in that apartment somewhere from across the room
But it's all a haze I remember vaguely lights then staring there to you
It's the slowest days by the bathroom that somehow never seem to go
Where I watched you put your make-up on
The smallest sounds leave the clearest echoes
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
I know, I know
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
I know, I know
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
I know, I know
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
I know, I know
All the motions of ordinary love...8Embed
