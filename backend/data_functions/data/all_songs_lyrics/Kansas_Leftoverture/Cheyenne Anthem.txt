Cheyenne Anthem Lyrics
From the mountains to the sun
Life has only just begun
We wed this land and pledged our souls to meet its end
Life has only just begun

Here my people roam the earth
In the kingdom of our birth
Where the dust of all our horses hides the sun
We are mighty on the earth
On the earth

You have come to move me, take me from my ancient home
Land of my fathers, I can't leave you now
We will share it with you, no man owns this earth we're on
Now the wheels are rolling; hear the howling winds of war
It's my destiny to fight and die
But is there no solution?  Can we find no other way?
Lord, let me stay!

Under the endless sky and the earth below
Here I was born to live, and I will never go
Oh, no...
But we cannot endure like the earth and the mountains
Life is not ours to keep, for a new sun is rising

Soon these days shall pass away
For our freedom we must pay
All our words and deeds are carried on the wind
In the ground our bodies lay
Here we'll stay...Embed
