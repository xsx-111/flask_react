Opus Insert Lyrics
There's a reason for all that rhymes
It's the fact and the way of the times
Moving emotion
It's high and it's low, no matter where you go

There is something for all who look
There's a story in every book
All of the pages
Between all the lines, so much that you can find

But there's too many empty lives my friend
And we just can't let them waste away
For this life is a precious thing my friend
And we can't wait another day

There's a message in every word
And it's more than the word you heard
Moving emotion
It comes like a sea, washing all over me

But there's nothing that we can't do my friend
Cause the spirit is with us all
It's here and it's now, it's up and it's down
You can feel it surrounding us all
After all its all the same
Only difference is the name, and where we are
In this crazy mixed up deal
There's so many things to feel, near and far
It's where you are!

And there's times when I can't contain
All the feelings of love I'll gain
There for the asking
It's for all of you, if you would take it too

But there's too many empty lives my friend
And we just can't let them waste away
For this life is a precious thing my friend
And we can't wait another day1Embed
