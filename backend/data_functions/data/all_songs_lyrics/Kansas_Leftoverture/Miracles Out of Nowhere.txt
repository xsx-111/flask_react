Miracles Out of Nowhere Lyrics
On a crystal morning, I can see the dewdrops falling
Down from gleaming heaven. I can hear the voices call
When you coming home now, son? the world is not for you
Tell me, what's your point of view?

Hey there, Mister Madman, what you know that I don't know?
Tell me some crazy stories; let me know who runs this show
Glassy-eyed and laughing; he turns and walks away
Tell me, what made you that way?

Here I am, just waiting for a sign
Asking questions; learning all the time
It's always here; it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere

Tell me now, dear Mother, what's it like to be so old?
Children grown and leaving; seems the world is growing cold
And though your body's ailing you, your mind is just like new
Tell me where you're going to

It's so simple, I mean right before your eyes
If you'll only look through this disguise
It's always here; it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
Love and miracles out of nowhere

I sang this song a hundred, maybe a thousand years ago
No one ever listens, I just play and then I go
Off into the sunset like the Western heroes do
Tell me what you're gonna do

Here I am, I'm sure to see a sign
All my life, I knew that it was mine
It's always here; it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere;
Love and miracles out of nowhere
(Out of nowhere)1Embed
