Questions of My Childhood Lyrics
When the sun is in the mid-sky, well, he wears a golden crown
And he soaks the world with sunshine as he makes another round
Been a faster year than yesterday, all the things that I have planned
And when I think I might be gaining...
I'm in the sunshine once again, yea

Well, I walked the road of life among the strong, among the weak
And I asked them for the shortcut to the answers that I seek
But no one seems to understand what is and what will be
For the questions of my childhood weave a web of mystery
Just a web of mystery

Can you get me through these changes?
Well I sure don't know about life, but one thing's for sure
All I need is you, babe!
We can find the golden key to unlock the door

I don't wanna face a world of disillusion
I've come to one conclusion, that I know you know is true
In a game of silent searching, the cost of love is rising
And I'm just now realizing I'd be better off with you...
Better off with you, ohhh!
It's a game that I've been living, now, I need to know what's real
Can you help me find the answers, can you tell the way I feel?
Will you stay with me forever, or just stay with me tonight?
And we can talk about tomorrow, if it all works out alright
Yes, if it all works alright!

Can you get me through these changes?
Well I sure don't know about life, but one thing's for sure
All I need is you, babe!
We can find the golden key to unlock the doorEmbed
