Drew Lyrics
Pull up the blinds
Open the door and wide
Feel the cold arrive
In my bones

Put on my face
Iâ€™ll wear your dress tonight
Feel like you tonight
On that day

Falling lemon moon
You burn, then crash in dirty snow
Ode to a sin, I might as well
Melt into Sunday

Remember the time
We stood there by the lake
Watching boats and planes
Great white clouds

I smelt the sweat
I felt the sun again
Dreams on your skin
On my tongue
Falling lemon moon
You burn, then crash in dirty snow
Ode to a sin, I might as well
Melt into Sunday

Pull up the blinds
Open the door wide
Feel the cold arrive
In my bones

You, me, and the moon
We burn, then crash in dirty snow
Ode to a sin, we might as well
Melt into Sunday
