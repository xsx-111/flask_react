Ulla Lyrics
Swirling horses throw you high
Carried on their tales the tide
Sailing on the seven seas
Seven suns and seven winds, were we blinded

Take me where the camphor grows
Where the moon and freedom sigh
Caribou are crossing out
Mailing elk and where we found our sunset

Sailors sail on all night, all day
I’m not lost, I’m wandering your way
I know you’re waiting
Carry me there

Float on glass a mirror hot
With the universe above
Try to find a line, connect
With a world that make no sense. I’ve a feeling

Stream you babble in a rush
Busy river flow and wind
Always ask the lake – it knows
Always ask the lake – you’ll get all the answers
Sailors sail on all night, all day
I’m not lost, I’m wandering your way
I know you’re waiting
Carry me thereEmbed
