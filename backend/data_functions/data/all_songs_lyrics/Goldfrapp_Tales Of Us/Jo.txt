Jo Lyrics
Heard a shout and someone calling
Strained in darkness
Vapour, like a veil, hangs over
The city tonight

Hanging there behind the trees
A blood-red moon is watching
I was waiting for you
Dread in my heart

Where the wind sings by the river
Laughing, broken
Hair swept out into the water
Ripples of black

Run, you better run
You better run for your life

Oh, it rips through the sky
Oh, a light flickers on
Jo, I know you would say
“Don’t wait for me now”
Shiver while you’re breathe in
Hold on while you breathe loud
I see the dawn
Shiver while you breathe in
Hold on while I breath loud

Filigree of time demeaning
Sunset, spoken
Where the wind sings by the river
Ripples of black

Days, you gotta run
You gotta run for your life
Run, you better run
You better run for your life
Days, you gotta run
You gotta run for your life
Run, you better run
You better run for your life
Days, you gotta run
You gotta run for your life
Run, you better run
You better run for your life
Oh, you live 'til you breathe
Don’t run with me
Breathe your life while you wait
Don’t wait for me nowEmbed
