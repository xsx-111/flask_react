Clay Lyrics
Words sail
Out into the wind
Their meaning
Taken by time

Your deep seeing eyes
Ancient stars

We wanted only to love
How will I find you again?
Fate or chance

A beauty
In uncertainty
We fought them
On great white sand

Our shadows reframed
Memories

We want only to live
Only to love and breathe again
Your white waves in the night
Longing I'm lost
In dreams of mine
Blue billowing green waves of grass
The iron sky
Turning in the looking glass

Your deep seeing eyes
Ancient stars

You are wonderful light
My only love
Sleep well
Good night3Embed
