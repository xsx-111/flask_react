Stranger Lyrics
Stranger, when you look at me
Eyes strong as steel
Light as day
Born a mystery
You're the in between
Boy or girl

Wilder than I've known before
Fire rushes through every vein
With a smile that sings
You'll be killing me tenderly

Every word is soft as fur
I'm drifting deep, deeper in


Stranger, will you remember
Stranger, make me remember you

Taken by the crowd, a tide
Its there, then gone, do or die

Stranger, I dream of you
Stranger, I will never know2Embed
