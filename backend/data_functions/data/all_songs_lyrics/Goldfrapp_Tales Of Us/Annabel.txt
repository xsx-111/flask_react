Annabel Lyrics
When you dream, you only dream, you're Annabel
All the secrets there inside you, Annabel

Born beneath an emerald sky, sing, Annabel
Nothing that they did will stop you, Annabel

Land of the lights, tangled hair and porcelain
Under the stars you begin

When you dream, you only dream, you're Annabel
Sleep reminds you, takes you there, oh Annabel

Gentle whispers, endless winters, Annabel
Why they couldn't let you be both, Annabel

Land of the lights, of the ice, but love still lies
You are the truth they denied

Red like the sea, tangled hair and porcelain
Under the stars you begin3Embed
