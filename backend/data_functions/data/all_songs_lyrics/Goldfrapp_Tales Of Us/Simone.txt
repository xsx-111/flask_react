Simone Lyrics
Hold me in your arms
Oh, in the sense of you
When we're alone I'm free
Until the morning comes
Who are we

I felt your coldness come
You're insatiable, me I was blind
I gave to you the world, all my world is you

At the mirror you gently comb your hair
Humming your favorite song
You are the younger me in his arms

I felt your coldness come
My own Simone too casually
Daylight trickles in on your tremulous skin

A moonlit tear a devil designs
You're insatiable, me I was blind
I gave to you the world, all my world is you
A tale to tell the world it's now your's SimoneEmbed
