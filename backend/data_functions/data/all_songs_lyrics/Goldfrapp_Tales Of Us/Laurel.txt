Laurel Lyrics
Looking for light
A golden light
Red red hair
And almond eyes

Searching for love
A wallet's hot
The price is right
It's money for love

Looking for light
A golden light
With your red red hair
And almond eyes

Laurel, you came here

Looking for light
A golden light
With your red red hair
Your almond eyes
Strange how he's cold
Behind the smile
An angry mind
Don't wait for tonight

Lying for lies
A golden lie
Your red red hair
Your almond eyes

Laurel, you came here
Laurel came here

Fear is a fog
Rolling in and around

Laurel whispers from inside
Laurel running out of timeEmbed
