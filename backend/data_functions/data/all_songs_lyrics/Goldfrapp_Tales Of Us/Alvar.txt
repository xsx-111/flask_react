Alvar Lyrics
I felt it come – a blade of autumn alive
The amber shapes of sunset dance on the wall
I step outside – no boat, no sign of you there
In the endlessness, two worlds looking back at me now

Oh, I've never seen the winter lights on the lake

I want to swim your silk-black skin to the floor
On lava moons, a song of hooves playing loud
The day you came, they took your name, they renounced
Took your right, your life – your heart can't wait forever

Oh, I've never seen the winter lights on the lake
Oh, I've never seen the winter lights on the lake

I want to swim your silk-black skin to the floor
On lava moons a song of hooves playing
