Myriad Harbour Lyrics
I took a plane, I took a train
(Ah, who cares, you always end up in the city)
I said to Carl, "Look up for once"
(See just how the sun sets in the sky)
I said to John, "Do you think the girls here
(Ever wonder how they got so pretty?)
Oh, well I do!"

Look out upon the myriad harbour
Look out upon the myriad harbour
Look out upon the myriad harbour

All the boys, with their home-made microphones
(Have very interesting sounds)
All the girls falling to ruin, dropping out of school, breakin' daddy's heart
(Just to hang around)
I walked into the local record store and asked for an American music anthology
It sounds fun
They tore off my skirt and stuck it on the walls of PS1

I took a plane, I took a train
(Ah, who cares, you always end up in the city)
Stranded at Bleecker and Broadway
Looking for something to do
Someone somewhere asked me, "Is there anything in particular I can help you with?"
(All I ever wanted help with was you)
Look out upon the myriad harbour
Look out upon the myriad harbour
Look out upon the myriad harbour
Look out upon the myriad harbourEmbed
