The Spirit of Giving Lyrics
You went looking for shelter
In all the wrong spaces
You grew gluttonous and famous with faces
Nameless and blank
Superstitiously you named them
St. Christopher and Johanna
St. Christopher and Johanna
St. Christopher and Johanna

Overcome with the holiday spirit
Mark says the herald angels won't hear it
And remember the wolves that you run with are wolves
Don't forget
They exist to give you something to regret, I'll beat them to it
With something sadder than that brass portrait that shines through your morning dim
Something sadder than that brass portrait that shines through your morning dim

I'll give you something to be sad about
Hey the picture really captures your mouth
Poised to say:
"It's your turn to go down now, it's your turn to go down now
It's your turn to go down now, it's your turn to go down now"
In the spirit of giving in

(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
All I wanted was an answer to the secret
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
Ground floor Mary come on
Outboard Mary come on
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
All I wanted was an answer to
Your money or your life? Your money or your life?
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
I was sick of America and her screaming decay
I was in a band, we were singing 'hooray' quite often
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
But your mama was poor, your daddy was poor
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
Whatcha gonna do?
Your mother was poor, your father was poor
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
Whatcha gonna do
About it?
(Cloud prayer Mary come on)
Cloud prayer Mary come on
Cloud prayer Mary come on
Cloud prayer Mary come on
Cloud prayer Mary come on
Cloud prayer Mary come onEmbed
