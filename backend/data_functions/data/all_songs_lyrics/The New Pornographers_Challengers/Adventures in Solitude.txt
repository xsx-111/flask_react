Adventures in Solitude Lyrics
Balancing on one wounded wing
Circling the edge of the never-ending
The best of the vanished marvels
Have gathered inside your door
More than begin, but less than forget
But spirits born from the not happened yet
Gathering there to pay off a debt
Brought back from the wars

We thought we lost you
We thought we lost you
We thought we lost you
Welcome back

Sleeping for years, pick through what is left
Through the pieces that fell and rose from the depth
From the rainwater well
Deep as a secret nobody knows
Less than forget, but more than begun
These adventures in solitude never done
To the names of our rooms
We send the same blood back from the wars
We thought we lost you
We thought we lost you
We thought we lost you
It will all come back

I know you want to run far away from one more
And that it's coming at a bad time
Some cold grace, countless ways
For all we know
I know you need to breathe through, come back, come to
But it's coming at a bad time
Some lost heart, tangled days
For all we know


I know you want to run far away from one more
And that it's coming at a bad time
Some cold grace, countless ways
For all we know
I know you want to breathe through, come back, come to
But it's coming at a bad time
Old scarred face, survivor's gold
For all we know2Embed
