Go Places Lyrics
Yes, a heart will always go one step too far
Come the morning and the four corners, I see
What the moral of the back story could be
Come with me, go places

And a heart will always stay one day too long
Always hoping for the hot flashes to come
For the glue to dry on our new creation
Come with me, go places

Come hell or full circle
Our arms filled with miracles
Play hearts, kid, they work well
Like classics, play aces
Stay with me, go places
Once more for the ages

Yes, a heart should always go one step too far
Come the morning and the day winding like dreams
Come the morning, every blue shade of green
Come with me, go places
Come hell or full circle
Our arms filled with miracles
Play hearts, kid, they work well
Like magic, play aces
Stay with me, go places
Once more for the ages

Come one now, come all ye
This story breaks free here
Tears from the back pages
From somewhere unseen, a
Deus ex machina
Good morning, Christina

Come hell or full circle
Our path blocked but sure we'll
Make records, then set them
Make copies, win races
Stay with me, go places
Once more for the ages1Embed
