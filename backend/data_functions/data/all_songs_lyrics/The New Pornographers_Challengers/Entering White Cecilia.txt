Entering White Cecilia Lyrics
Cruising the magnetic strip, I seized the ship
I wanted it to be me that was with you
Site unseen shot through with meaning
I ran to the door, looked around
I fell to the floor just to see if it was down there

Your little chorus of angels
Howling, "What gives in? Hey, what is with you?"
Just look around at how the other half lives
So you did, but you couldn't decide it

Entering white Cecilia, entering white Cecilia
What's eating you tonight? Who cares?
There's a bunch of them
So what if you saw one of them go?

Cruising the magnetic strip, I seized the ship
I wanted it to be me that was with you
Site unseen shot through with meaning
You ran to the door, I fell to the ground
You had a feeling the ballroom was down there
Entering white Cecilia, entering white Cecilia
What's eating you tonight? Who cares?
There was a bunch of them
So what if you had one of them go?Embed
