Challengers Lyrics
Yes I know it was late
We were greeting the sun, before long
And you live with someone
I live with somebody too, leave it there
For safe keeping
Wander the West Village in flames
That was the custom come dawn

On the water today
In the shade of the sun we wrote down
Another vision of us
We were the challengers of the unknown
"Be safe", you say
Whatever the mess you are, you're mine, okay
If that is the custom,  I'm down

Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-na
Until I see you around
Until we clear the accounts leave it there
Leave it to us
We are the challengers of the unknown
Oh-la, oh-la, oh-la, oh-la
Oh-la, oh-la, oh-la, oh-laEmbed
