Unguided Lyrics
In every story, every secret told
You are not the first to wake up
To learn your lines before you have the part
You woke up early and you woke up torn
You the temporary boarder
The heat wave humming in the house of cards

You spun chapter into rapture there
Yeah, you were as brave as traffic
You chased the spotlight into her arms
And you forgot that you could fly, but not
That you were still the person sleeping
The heat wave humming in the house of cards

A play for the girl
A cross for a hook
Sinking into the green sea wonder
Under the sea
Walking the floor
Over the waves that we lived under

Something's unguided in the sky tonight
There is something unguided in the sky
You wrote yourself into a corner, safe
Easy to defend your borders
A fallen saint into a whispered time
Killing time because I have to, why?
Because it isn't mine, remember?
Killing time because it wasn't mine

You're earning your stripes
You're counting the stars
You're winding your barely working watch
You're lucky to be on the lam like you are
Lucky you've already been caught

There's something unguided in the sky tonight
There is something unguided in the sky

Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
And why wait for the weakened state
To lie next to the weaker sex
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
And why wait for the weakened state
To lie next to the weaker sex
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo
Do do do do do lo

You're earning your stripes
You're counting the stars
You're winding your barely working watch
You're lucky to be on the lam like you are
Lucky you've already been caught

There's something unguided in the sky tonight
There is something unguided in the sky

There is something unguided in the sky tonight
There is something unguided in the skyEmbed
