Failsafe Lyrics
Ready to bolt at the first glimpse of failsafe
Signing my checks with a name that's not mine
Clocking the hours that spin round through the tail end
There's gold in these hills ahead
We both had a hand in it

You and me both, kid
You and me both, kid

Raising a flag at the first sign of failsafe
Another red flag and we've lost half the team
I left the game to find you at the day's end
There's gold in these hills ahead
We both had a hand in it

You and me both, kid
You and me both, kid

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh
You and me both, kid
You and me both, kid
You and me both, kid
You and me both, kidEmbed
