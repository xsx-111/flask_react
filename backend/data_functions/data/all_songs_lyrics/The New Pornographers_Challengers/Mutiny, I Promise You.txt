Mutiny, I Promise You Lyrics
Sweetheart, I was trapped in transit, my lost ride
When your wild eye wandered here, lady
Go out by the sweetheart tree but don't let go
It's how my friend history here made me

What's the weight of the world worth to you, kid?
Go write down what you see and see how far it can go
What's the weight of the world worth to your side?
Here is where you got lost and here is how you got by

And here is the mutiny I promised you
And here is the party it turned into

Heartbeat, you abandoned searches, your lost ride
You're in my lost country now, lady
Sweethearts in the crosstown wild, we don't let go
To the new live history goes with me

What's the weight of the world worth to you, kid?
Go write down what you see and see how far it can go
What's the weight of the world worth to your side?
Here is where you got lost and here is how you got by
And here is the mutiny I promised you
And here is the party it turned into
Here is the mutiny I promised you
And here is the moment it turned into
And here is the moment it turned into
And here is the moment it turned into
Here is the moment it turned into

Sweethearts on a green, flung pistols in high tide
Like my friend history here told me
Clear-skied when the clear eye opened
My new moon to the new land, won't you come with me?

What's the weight of the world worth to ya, kid?
Go write down what you see and see how far it can go
What's the weight of the world worth to your side?
Here is where you got lost and here is how you got by

And here is the mutiny I promised you
And here is the party it turned into
And here is the mutiny I promised you
And here is the moment it turned into1Embed
