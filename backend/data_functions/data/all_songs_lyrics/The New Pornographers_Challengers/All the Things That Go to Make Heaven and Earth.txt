All the Things That Go to Make Heaven and Earth Lyrics
All those things that go to make heaven and this
Where midnight once was splashed across the canvas
Midnight, who wants a go
Midnight, who lost control and found this world

With matter removed of divine dimension
Our time reduced to an honorable mention
This world, which time forgot
This world, it lost control and then saw God

All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is

Did you think up something He didn't think up?
Crashing into horizons, on the brink of
Success, hurrah
Success, which was survival gone too far
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still isEmbed
