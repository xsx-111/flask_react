All the Old Showstoppers Lyrics
When Johnny he saw the numbers he lied
Made up the whole thing, failed when he tried
To cash in on his cautious new fame
Always the numbers, but never the name

When we hit the numbers we broke
Broke in and changed 'em, changed as we spoke
We knew that we would always be down
Hitting the numbers spun the wheel 'round

And somebody beside you
Slipped your head inside the crown
The princess of the paupers
And all the old showstoppers
'Til this moment still unknown

Sirens' songs have tried, too
Yet, she takes you as her own
The princess of the paupers
And all the old showstoppers
'Til this moment still unknown
And when he got the numbers he thought
Thought of his friends who slowed to a halt
Who had questioned to no avail
Some knew the answers, some wouldn't tell

When Gabriel saw the numbers he fell
Fell through the clouds into the great well
But woke up before he hit the ground
No one had noticed, still he looked 'round

And somebody beside you
Slipped your head inside the crown
The princess of the paupers
All the old showstoppers
'Til this moment still unknown

Sirens' songs have tried, too
Yet, she takes you as her own
The princess of the paupers
And all the old showstoppers
'Til this moment still unknown
With her hand to guide you
You are nothing if not home
The princess of the paupers
And all the old showstoppers
'Til this moment still unknownEmbed
