My Rights Versus Yours Lyrics
Under your wheels, the hope of spring
Mirage of loss, a few more things
You left your sorrow dangling
It hangs in air like a school cheer
Complex notes inside the chords
On every wall, inflections carved
Deep as lakes and dark as stars
Remember we were the volunteers

(Ooh...) Courts knew this and nothing more
(Ooh...) Now it's my rights versus yours

Under your wheels, your hopeless reign
You fall too hard, we're up too late
We hang suspended from the heights
Until it's safer to walk here
Under your wheels, your chance is with
The easy call, the called-off search
The medicine, it still won't work
But there's dangerous levels of it here
(Ooh...) Same thing as the other time
(Ooh...) But now it's your rights versus mine

The truth in one free afternoon
The truth in one free afternoon

Under my wheels, the chance is held
Gave me to save me from myself
Spectacles painted with my shaking hand
Fingers in paints, in paints we brought
Thinking we'd need them when we're not
Flying the flags of new empires in rags

The new empire in rags, the truth in one free afternoon
A new empire in rags, the truth in one free afternoon
A new empire in rags, the truth in one free afternoon
A new empire in rags, the truth in one free afternoon

Under your wheels, the fits and starts
The time to dabble in the arts
To tease the packs of dogs in charge
But, kid, it's all wasted on me
Under your wheels, the hope of spring
Mirage of loss, a few more things
The medicine, it still won't sing
But there's dangerous levels of it here

Your rights over my rights now
We came to the right place
Your rights over my rights now
Your rights over my rights now
We came to the right place
Your rights over my rights now
Your rights over my rights nowEmbed
