Lamplight Symphony LyricsOn a winter's night, stars are cold and bright in the sky
The slumber of the earth is pure and deep
From a distant wood, drifts the echo of a beast
The old man stirs and wakens in the night
He stands before his window gazing at the grave
Forgotten dreams are flashing through his weary mind
And though his life is empty, he pretends that she's still there
With hunger in his soul, he yearns for life and love gone by
With memories his one and only joy
And all he has to give, you know he would gladly give to bring back the life
And raise the one who lies beneath the snow
He lights a lamp and looks at pictures of the past
The faces of their youth still glow with new-found love
But the picture's faded, and time has stolen youth away
With a spoken word that he thought he heard from her lips
He felt another presence in the room
He was filled with fear but filled with joy he arose
And turned to face the image that he knew
She stood before him and her hand reached out for his
A peaceful light shone in her eyes
She said she'd come to soothe him, and that someday they'd be as one
She began to fade and her image disappeared
So he was left alone to face another night
Never in his life, had he been so held in awe
As he faced the apparition of his wife
He stood before the window gazing at the grave
And with a lightened heart he saw the first of dawn
He knew that she was waiting, and that someday they'd be as oneEmbed
