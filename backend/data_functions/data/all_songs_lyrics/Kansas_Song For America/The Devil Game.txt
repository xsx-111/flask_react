The Devil Game LyricsI've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall
So many men have drowned in evil
And left Lucifer standing tall
Don't take the Devil's dare
Don't gamble when the game ain't fair
Lock and bolt the doors
Can't let the Devil use you anymore
You got to listen all you mugs and reivers
If you do any wrong you make it right
You can't be a make-believer
'Cause soon you're gonna pay the price
Lying, hate and pain
All part of the Devil game
Got his foot inside the door
But you can't let him use you anymore
Take, he will take, he will take, give him nothing
He'll will take, he will take, he will take
He will give nothing but he'll take
Pray, for devils have no reason
Satan waits to curse your ways
Have you seen it in his eyes in the sunset?
Have you wondered if he's laughing when you play?
Has he asked if you're alone, if what he sees is all you own?
Has he offered you happiness, money, or much better lays?
Satan leave me, leave me lonely
Satan leave me, leave us alone
Satan leave me, leave me lonely
I've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall
Take a look at what the future's holdin'
Won't be yours if you don't heed the call
Life is a game, and the stakes will remain the same
Now you've gotta choose, is the Devil gonna win or lose again?Embed
