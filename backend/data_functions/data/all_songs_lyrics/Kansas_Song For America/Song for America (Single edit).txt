Song for America (Single edit) LyricsVirgin land of forest green
Dark and stormy plains
Here all life abounds
Sunlit valley
Mountain fields
Unseen in the rain
Here all life abounds
No man rules this land
No human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently
So much to see
So rich in Earth's delights
Painted desert
Sequined sky
Stars that fill the night
Here all life abounds
Rivers flowing to the sea
Sunshine pure and bright
Here all life abounds
No man rules this land
No human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently
So much to see
So rich in Earth's delights
So the maiden lies in waiting
For the sails to reach the shore
Land of beauty and abundance
Innocent, you opened wide your door
Wanderers found the waiting treasure
Full of gifts beyond their measure
Milk and honey for our pleasure.....
Across the sea there came a multitude
Sailing ships upon the wave
Filled with visions of Utopia
And the freedom that they crave
Ravage, plunder, see no wonder
Rape and kill and tear asunder
Chop the forest, plow it under.....
Highways scar the mountainsides
Buildings to the sky
People all around
Houses stand in endless rows
Sea to shining sea
People all around
So we rule this land
And here we stand upon our paradise
Dreaming of a place
Our weary race is ready to ariseEmbed
