Everything Happens LyricsIt happens every time
There's really nothing I can do
It happens every time
I guess I'm just a fool for you
Everything that I could beg
Borrow or steal I gave to you
Well I guess that the fault was mine
Really nothing I can do
It happens every time
Somebody somewhere mentions your name
It happens every time
I'm just about to go insane
Everything that I could beg
Borrow or steal I gave to you
Well I know that the fault was mine
What else could I do?
It happens every time
I guess there's nothing left to say
It happens every time
I guess it's just a game we playEmbed
