Green Rocky Road LyricsKeep on talkin 'bout
Green rocky road
Promenade in green
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Mary runnin' to the wall
Don't you stumble don't you fall
Don't you holler, don't you shout it
When you hear me singin' come runnin' out
Green rocky road
Promenade in green
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
When I go to Baltimore
I got no carpet on my floor
I said I got no carpet on my floor
When I go to Baltimore
Singin' Green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
See the bluebird in the sky
He don't walk but he just fly
If you ever touch the ground
Well I know he'll die
You see the bluebird flyin' in the sky
Green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you loveEmbed
