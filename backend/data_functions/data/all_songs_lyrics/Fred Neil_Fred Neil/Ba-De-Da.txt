Ba-De-Da LyricsI get so tired
Hangin' around this town
All this old city life
Should bring us fellow down
Badada dada
Dadada dada
Dadada dada
Ba-de-da
I get so tired
Trying to sleep at night
All this old city life
They keep on burning bright
Badada dada...
I get so tired
Hangin' around this town
All this old city life
Should bring us fellow down
Badada dada...Embed
