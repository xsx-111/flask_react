Sacrilegious Lyrics
Gloomy on sunny days, shadows, no house or trees (Trees)
Prayers not close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see (The eye could see), hoodies and weaponry ('Ry)
Naive to being free (Free), locked us, we chasing keys (Ayy)
How your eyes investigate us ('Gate us)
While we look up to entertainers, ballplayers, pistol-bangers (Bangers)
Big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger (Ugh), and burn, fucker, burn (Burn)
Every step to getting deeper, survival my main concern ('Cern)
Marinating in Satan's sweat (Sweat), take a sip of this holy water (Water)
Hoping God still keep me blessed (Blessed), with a dark shield for my armor (Armor)

Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Ayy, ayy)
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Heart)
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Soul, soul)
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Ayy, ayy)
Promises, man, I promised (Promised), none of them goals accomplished ('Complished)
Promises, man, I promised (Promised) to be loyal and honest (Honest)
Promises, man, I promised (Promised), lied on separate occasions ('Casions)
Promises, man, I promised (Promised), my promises is aging (Aging)
Hennessy, what my system like (Like, like, like, like), feeling like Superman ('Man, 'man)
I might Crip tonight ('Night, 'night, 'night, 'night), I bring loss to life (Life, life, life, life)
A gruesome sight (Sight, sight, sight, sight), look who done got involved (Got involved)
It's no different from wars: It's kill, or be called upon (Called upon)
Feeling teary-eyed (Teary-eyed), thinking I've gone too far (Gone too far)
Ask God for forgivenessâ€”shit, I doubt He heard me at all (Heard me at all)
They say, "Clean your hands before you eat, rinse our sins with prayer" (Rinse our sins with prayer)
But I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away (Ayy)

Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Ayy, ayy)
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Heart)
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Soul, soul)
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah (Ayy, ayy)
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy48Embed
