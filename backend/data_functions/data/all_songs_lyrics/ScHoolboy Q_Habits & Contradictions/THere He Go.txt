THere He Go Lyrics
Yeah!

Ain't got no jewelry on—still, I'm shining hard (Hard)
Ain't got no bodyguard, walking solo through the mall (Mall)
Bitches and the hoes know—they see me, they like, "There he go!" (Oh)
They be like, "There he go! Schoolboy, there he go!" (Go)
Chiefing like a motherfuckin' Seminole
Here we go, off probation, probably go to Mexico
Furthermore, can't find this in the store, this shit ain't for the low
Got my daughter swaggin' like her motherfuckin' daddy, though (Daddy, though)
The patio—what a motherfuckin' view (View, ooh)
Nappy chin hairs, bitch, I'm motherfuckin' Q (Q, Q, Q, ugh)
Motherfucker, motherfucker
Yeah, "fucking" is my favorite word—reason why I'm fucking her
She swallow my dick and balls, whatever occur
Purr! (Purr-r-r) I love that kitty-cat
Ass fat, throw it back—I can't believe you wifing that
Deepthroat, seven or eleven, she's a double-gulp (Mm)
My pistol drawn, her boyfriend got me paranoid (Paranoid)
Nigga try sneaking up on me, and I'm making noise, ugh (Bla-kah, bla-kah, bla-kah)
But what I failed to understand: I'm the motherfuckin' man (Hey, hey)
Ran into him (Hey), he's a fan, goddamn

I—I'm shining hard, they be like, "There he go!" (There he go)
No—No bodyguard, they be like, "There he go!" (There he go)
U—U—U—Up in your broad, they be like, "There he go!" (There he go)
They be like, "There he go! Schoolb—boy, there he go!" (There he go)
Hiii—Hiii—Hiii—HiiiPower, bitch, they be like, "There he go!"
Bl—Black Hippy shit, they be like, "There he go!" (Yeah)
Ma—Magnificent, they be like, "There he go!" (There he go)
They be like, "There he go!" (Ayy) "Schoolboy, there he go!" (Yeah, yeah)
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane (Plane, yeah)
No, it be this nigga here just looking at you lames (You lames)
With my nigga June, we betting on the Laker game
Even though my niggas lost, another iTunes check done came (Hey)
Garcia Vegas, yeah, that bitch be burning slow
Crip a four, now the blunts go back around like merry-go (Ugh)
Ugh, for sure, ain't no need for niggas out here fronting, though
Metaphor, how I come up with it? I don't fucking know (Don't fucking know)
Y'all acting like that TDE don't run LA (Ugh)
Coast ain't been this hard since Pac, Death Row, and Dr. Dre (Ugh)
Word to Dr. Dre, "Detox" is like a mix away
So go ahead and let the grown-ups work, and go somewhere and play (Yeah)
Worldwide Holocaust, cuh, we murder shit (Murder shit)
Without a gun or knife, it's just a fucking hit (Ayy)
Pussy drips, raining in her cervix, I'm a fuckin' pimp (Fuckin' pimp)
Sagging low, crack a nigga bitch just like pistachio ('Stachio, 'stachio, 'stachio, 'stachio)

I—I'm shining hard, they be like, "There he go!"
No—No bodyguard, they be like, "There he go!" (Yeah, nah-nah-nah)
U—U—U—Up in your broad, they be like, "There he go!"
They be like, "There he go! ScHoolb—boy, there he go!" (Yeah)
Hiii—Hiii—Hiii—HiiiPower, bitch, they be like, "There he go!"
Bl—Black Hippy shit, they be like, "There he go!"
Ma—Magnificent, they be like, "There he go!" (There he go)
They be like, "There he go! Schoolboy, there he go!" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
