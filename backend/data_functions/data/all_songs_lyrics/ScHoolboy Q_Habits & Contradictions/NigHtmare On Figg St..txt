(Ball so hard) What's fifty grand to a muh'fucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Tch, I mean, you can’t be serious, right?)
Shit, I'll remind you (Aw)
Put that steel behind you, put five inside you
Better chill out with all that flossing, partner
(Ball so hard) You must be cray (Ugh)
Leave 'em in the streets with his shoelaces missing and socks up off his feet (Ugh, ugh)
Pistol-holding, gonorrhea nigga— skeet-skeet (Ugh, ugh)
Soul dropped, Rock dropped (Yeah), Dot dropped (Yeah)
Black Hippy, TDE (Huh)—well, fuck it, nigga, let's four-peat (Ugh)
A dope Hoover dealer, ugh, ADHD (Yeah)
Fuck that, let's bake coke and cook crack (Crack)
Fuck the sheriffs, the gang unit, fuck CRASH (CRASH)
Pimp hoes— ho, run your bread— she love tracks (Yeah, biatch!)
Crack of dawn, Figg get it— yeah, we get it, yeah (Yeah)
Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year (Year, ugh, yeah)
Niggas better hope I start popping (Ah)
Before I start robbing and re-up with Oxycontin
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
It's storming, it's snowing, it's flooding, we still out here thugging
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah

Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
(Ball so hard) You must be cray (Ugh)

(Ugh) What's fifty grand to a muh'fucker like you?
You still need a reminder? (Ha)
(Yeah, I thought so)
Shit, I'm loco
Thirty-eight brown—had to call him "cocoa"
"Stick around the block, boy, tell 'em, 'Go, go'"
Don't stop shooting 'til you all red though (Yeah)
Yellow tape, muh'fucker, shoulda yield, ho (Shoulda yield, ho)
Why you all tough for? See your thug ass later at the crossroads (Figg get it)
(Figg get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, yeah)
The landlord turn your lieutenant into a tenant (Ugh, yeah)
And if your rims spinning, your jaws dented
I'm— I'm a grown man, dog, I ain't kidding (I ain't kidding)
The end has come (Come), so (So), keep big weed and big lungs, big guns
Broad on her knees, the Holy Ghost— she speak in tongues (A-wa-wa-wa-wa)
Murder searching, why even run? One shot, he done (Ooh! A-wa-wa-wa-wa)
Huh? Nigga, you must got me confused (Ugh)
Bitch, I'm from the Groove, on Figg Side, making Hoovs (Figg side)
Drive to pussy more than I do to church (Yeah, ugh)
No AC, but the heater work (Err!), murk! (Pop)
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
It's storming, it's snowing, it's flooding, we still out here thugging
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
