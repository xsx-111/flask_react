Tookie Knows (Interlude) Lyrics
Everybody get low, get low!
Head shots, head shots, head shots!
Yawk! (How you want it?)

Sniff it, then I inhale it, fickle me blowing powder
Sprinkle me, inhale it, sniff it, head bobbing
Sprinkle me, inhale it, sniff it, head bobbing
Sprinkle me, inhale it, lift it, head bobbing

Giving away toe tags, toe tags, toe tag
One tag, two tag, three tag, four tag, yawk!
Yawk! Uh! Yeah!
Uh! Yeah! (Yawk! Yawk!)
(Where's the mothafuckin' money, my nigga?)
