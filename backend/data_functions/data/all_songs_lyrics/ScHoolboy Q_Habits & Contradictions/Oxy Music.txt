Oxy Music Lyrics
Yeah, I got my hustle, dog (Dog)
I gets my hustle off, Oxycontin, heroin
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog (Dog)
Don't make me chop him off
Chop-chop-chop-chop, knock him off

Blood on the wall (Wall), death in the air (Air)
Birds on the ground (Ground), pistols everywhere (Where)
Devils in the eyes (Eyes), babies always cry (Cry)
Papa never home, fuck it, we all alone
Tryna get rich and that cork in right (Right)
Grab me the beaker, I'll measure the white (White)
Heat up the water, drop it in pot
Baking soda and ice cubes make it rock
Get you a saucer, the razor go chop (Chop)
Get you a Glock and invest in a block (Block)
Set up your shop, dare 'em to pop
Fucked by the cop, jacked his ass with a shot, YAWK-YAWK

Yeah, I got my hustle, dog (Dog)
I gets my hustle off, Oxycontin, heroin
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog (Dog)
Don't make me chop him off
Chop-chop-chop-chop, knock him off
Crazy, I got my hustle, dog (Ouu, ouu)
I gets my hustle on, prostitutes and raps and all
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog
Don't make me chop him off
Knock-knock, knock-knock, knock him off
Ugh, Satan in your soul, let it take control ('Trol)
Oxycontin fiends (Fiends), keep the foil low (Ayy)
Let the pill burn (Burn), inhale, exhale it slow
Let your heart explode, drop you to the floor
I gets the dough, I hustle hard
Ace Hood ain't got shit on moi (Moi)
Green beans, 80s for sure (Sure)
They like what I'm talking 'bout (What I'm talking 'bout)
You know what I'm talking 'bout (What I'm talking 'bout)
No syringes or nothing, just heroin's cousin, smoke mufflers out

Yeah, I got my hustle, dog (Dog)
I gets my hustle off, Oxycontin, heroin
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog (Dog)
Don't make me chop him off
Chop-chop-chop-chop, knock him off
Crazy, I got my hustle, dog (Ouu, ouu)
I gets my hustle on, prostitutes and raps and all
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog
Don't make me chop him off
Knock-knock, knock-knock, knock him off (Off)

Only Lord knows (Knows) and only time'll tell (Tell)
Will I go to Heaven (Heaven), or will I burn in Hell? (Hell)
Music in my mind (Mind), vibrating down my spine (Spine)
Travels to my heart (Heart)
Should've been here from the start (Yeah)
Now, I get bread from my audio
(Ho, I'm your pusher, these bars that I'm pushing)
You know I ain't talking a Xanny, bro
(Nigga, we on it, be up by the morning)
New record, new bitch wearing panties, go
(Threw out my line) Fish hooked, for sure
(Nigga, we eating, youâ€”) Oughts to know
(Put my Big Boi in her) Love Below
(There she blows!) HiiiPower controlling
Our hustle keep going, sh-shitting on niggas
Excuse all our colons, bars after bars
Don't be pissed that we balling, we here for the moment
(We getting this cash) My flows be imported
My bitch be imported, my grind get distorted
Your life get deported, ch-ch-ch-ch-choppers deploying
Losing my brain while recording, um... Hahahaha
Hahaha
