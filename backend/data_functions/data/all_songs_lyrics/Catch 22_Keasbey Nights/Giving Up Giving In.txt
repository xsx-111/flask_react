Giving Up Giving In LyricsI got no cash, got no girl
But I got the world in the palm of my hand
And I don't care if you care or if you understand
Because i'm a little kid and I've got little problems
And I don't give a shit if you don't understand because:
I got me. (x2)
That's all I need. (x2)
And I live comfortably, (x2) and I sleep peacefully
I got no cash, got no girl
But I got the world in the palm of my hand
And I don't care if you care or if you understand
Because i'm a little kid and I've got little problems
And I don't give a shit if you don't understand because:
I got me. (x2)
That's all I need. (x2)
And I live comfortably, (x2) and I sleep peacefully
I give up
I don't want to hear
I don't want to be near you or your friends
And your dime a dozen miseries
I don't care if you care about the way you wear
Your hair or your shoes or your idiot attitude
Don't stop because I want to hear your problems
Don't you stop because I want to help you solve them
Don't stop
I give up!
I got no cash!Embed
