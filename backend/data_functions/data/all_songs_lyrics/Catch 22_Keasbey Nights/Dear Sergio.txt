Dear Sergio Lyrics
Run, run, run, all you do is fucking run
But you'll never run away from yourself
I know it's hard but you've been there before
And now you're gonna be there again
I don't care what the stars may say
They always feed their bullshit to me
It's kind of sad how you lost what you had
And you're never gonna have it again
And so I said

"Hey Sergio, it's getting kinda hot in here"
And I said "Hey Sergio, it's getting kinda hot in here"
And I said hey

Every other day you don't care what they say
'Cause they always leave you two steps behind
You try to smile and it lasts for awhile
But they always send you back to the start
Eenie meenie miney mo, they shoot down everyone you know
And then they leave you there all alone
You wish they'd stop but they never give up
And you know deep inside that you're stuck
And so I said
"Hey Sergio, it's getting kinda hot in here"
And I said "Hey Sergio, it's getting kinda hot in here"
And I said hey

"Hey Sergio, it's getting kinda hot in here"
And I said "Hey Sergio, it's getting kinda hot in here"
And I said heyEmbed
