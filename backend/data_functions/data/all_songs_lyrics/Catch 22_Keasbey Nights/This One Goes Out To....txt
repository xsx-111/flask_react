This One Goes Out To... LyricsStaring out the window of somebody's pick up truck
Well I never mind the boredom cause I use it for a crutch
Just to get me to that plane its a different state of sane
And everytime I try to change I always end up quite the same
Thinking back to happier days
When everyone was ignorant and all the kids behaved
But me and my friends and the ice cream man
That was our existance, that was our clan
This one goes out to the friends I never had:
Hey I don't understand
But I'd like to anyway
I don't understand
But I like it anyway
I don't understand
But I like you anyway
I don't understand
Hey I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
Shelter in the city we decided to go in
And I gave a man some money to buy his herion
But the homeless man returned and he gave me back a dime
He said, "put it in your sock my friend and save it for another time"
But: lessons are learned and later unlearned
If he knew then what he knows now well he could rule the world
But I'm not one to judge what happened yesterday
Cause I got me I got myself my future is at stake
This one goes out to the friends I never had:
Hey I don't understand
But I'd like to anyway
I don't understand
But I like it anyway
I don't understand
But I like you anyway
I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
Hey I don't understand
Shelter in the city we decided to go in
And I gave a man some money to buy his herion
But the homeless man returned and he gave me back a dime
He said, "put it in your sock my friend and save it for another time"
But: lessons are learned and later unlearned
If he knew then what he knows now well he could rule the world
But I'm not one to judge what happened yesterday
Cause I got me I got myself my future is at stake
This one goes out to the friends I never had:
Hey I don't understand
But I'd like to anyway
I don't understand
But I like it anyway
I don't understand
But I like you anyway
I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
Hey I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understandEmbed
