As The Footsteps Die Out Forever LyricsShe was diagnosed on a friday
The kids were almost home
The kids were on their way back home from school
Lying face down in the gutter
Of unaccomplished dreams
And broken memories of things to come
"Sorry ma'am, I really am
I have to break the news
I have to make the phone call
To tell you that you're due you know where
And I'll tell you when
And I suggest that you start living the next three weeks
The best that you can,"
Every night for three long weeks
She'd roam the hallways half asleep
And as the footsteps fade away
In my mind I can swear I can swear I heard her say:
"Don't wait for me
I got a lot to do
I got a lot to be
And in the end maybe I'll see you there"
Lost her strength on a saturday
Spent the day in bed
"Yeah, I'm fine it's just the flu," she said
With a smile
But when they turned their backs
The tears would flow
She knew she only had a while
To live
To breathe
To be
To see
To bleed
To stand on her own to weakened feet
And so I prayed
Every day
"Don't take my mother away"
Every night for three long weeks
She'd roam the hallways half asleep
And as the footsteps fade away
In my mind I can swear I can swear I heard her say:
"Don't wait for me
I got a lot to do
I got a lot to be
And in the end maybe I'll see you there"
Every night for three long weeks
She'd roam the hallways half asleep
And as the footsteps fade away
In my mind I can swear I can swear I heard her say:
"Don't wait for me
I got a lot to do
I got a lot to be
And in the end maybe I'll see you there"
Don't wait for me
I got a lot to do
I got a lot to be
And in the end maybe I'll see you thereEmbed
