On & On & On LyricsI still remember that night, it was the Fourth of July
It's still engraved in my mind and I'm not surprised
Gang wars no guns hand to hand
You're black I'm white he's purple but I still don't understand
I'm going to be alright, I'm going to be okay
Everything is going to be fi-i-i-i-ine
Back off, I want to be alone
I want to think it out and I'm thinking that I want to go home
Look who's laughing now
I'll pull it off somehow, and he said
As I passed her by I could see her cry
And I'll never forget the look that was in her eye
And the music, you know it played on and on and on
So won't somebody tap her on the shoulder, tell her life goes on?
Three years, two months, one week, four days
I'm always counting down 'cause there ain't no easier way
So trust me you know that I tried
And if I said it's easy then you know that I told a lie
I'm going to be all right, I'm going to be just fine
One down, five billion to go
Am I next in line and do I really want to know?
Look who's laughing now
I'll pull it off somehow, and he said
As I passed her by I could see her cry
And I'll never forget the look that was in her eye
And the music, you know it played on and on and on
So won't somebody tap her on the shoulder, tell her life goes on?
Still remember that night, it was the Fourth of July
Still engraved in my mind and I'm not surprised
Gang wars no guns hand to hand
You're black I'm white he's purple but I still don't understand
Gonna be alright, I'm gonna be okay
Everything is going to be fi-i-i-ine
Back off, I want to be alone
I want to think it out and I'm thinking that I want to go
Three years, two months, one week, four days
I'm always counting down, there ain't no easier way
So trust me you know that I tried
And if I said it's easy then you know that I told a lie
I'm going to be all right, I'm going to be just fine
One down, five billion to go
Am I next in line and do I really want to know?
Look who's laughing now
I'll pull it off somehow, and he said
As I passed her by I could see her cry
And I'll never forget the look that was in her eye
And the music, you know it played on and on and on
So won't somebody tap her on the shoulder, tell her life goes on?Embed
