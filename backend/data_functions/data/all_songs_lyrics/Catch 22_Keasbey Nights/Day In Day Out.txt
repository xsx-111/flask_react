Day In Day Out Lyrics
Two, three, four!

I don't want to barge in on your secrecy (see)
Dependency (see), it means nothing to me
I don't want to hear about your problems
And I don't want to listen to your apathy (see)
You're not like me (see)
You mean nothing to me
All your cash doesn't make you any greener
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to tell me what to feel
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to hate the world with me
(Day in, day out) It's not that bad
(I worry and I worry) But you'll never have to worry again
(Day in, day out) It's not that bad
(I worry and I worry) But you'll never have to worry again
(Won't have to worry again)
Never be alone
I don't want to barge in on your secrecy (see)
Dependency (see), it means nothing to me
I don't want to hear about your problems
And I don't want to listen to your apathy (see)
You're not like me (see)
You mean nothing to me
All your cash doesn't make you any greener
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to tell me what to feel
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to hate the world with me
(Day in, day out) It's not that bad
(I worry and I worry) But you'll never have to worry again
(Day in, day out) It's not that bad
(I worry and I worry) But you'll never have to worry again
(Won't have to worry again)
Never be alone

Alone in my room with a bucket full of phlegm
I don't need a music scene to tell me who I am
Should've got a warning
Should've came a year ago
Should I send her a birthday card?
My conscience tells me no

I don't need anyone, I don't anyone
I don't need anyone to tell me what to feel
I don't need anyone, I don't anyone
I don't need anyone to hate the world with me
(Day in, day out) It's not that bad
(I worry and I worry) But you'll never have to worry again
(Day in, day out) It's not that bad
(I worry and I worry) But you'll never have to worry again
(Won't have to worry again)
Never be, never be
Never be aloneEmbed
