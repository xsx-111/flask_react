Supernothing LyricsHe wakes up sad again
Wonders when the rain will end
She'll act like she don't care
Cause to her it's just a game that he plays
I'm a super...nothing... no one... going nowhere fast but I don't care
All the times he said he would
She never really understood
What he said or what he meant
He won't forget what wasn't said
He'll find himself alone standing in the rain
I'm a super...nothing... no one... going nowhere fast but I don't care...I'm a super...nothing... no one... going nowhere fast but I don't care. But I don't careEmbed
