Walking Away Lyrics
Well, hello, how are you?
Won't you pull up a chair?
Won't you tell me your story because I
Really do care about talking, talking, talking away
Here's to me, to you, to us, to everything
I hope it never falls apart
We're talking, talking, talking away
Well, you look so fine
And you seem so kind
And I've got to say that I'm having a
Good time dancing, dancing, dancing away
Here's to me, to you, to us, to everything
I hope it never falls apart
We're dancing, dancing, dancing away

Could things get any better now?
If they can, I cannot see how
But as the time goes by, you stop and sigh
You stop and sigh and then you wonder why

I can't stop this feeling, as I'm walking away
And I could never understand half the things you'd say
As we're walking, walking, walking away
Here's to me, to you, to us, to everything
That ever fell apart, as we're walking, walking, walking away
Things weren't better then
You felt that you had to pretend
But as the time goes by, you stop and sigh
You stop and sigh and then you wonder whyEmbed
