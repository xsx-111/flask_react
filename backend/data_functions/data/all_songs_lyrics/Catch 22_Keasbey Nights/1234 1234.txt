1234 1234 Lyrics[You, you try
You try to get by
"You're never going to pull it off
You shouldn't even try
You're a wet cigarette
You're always second best"
But they're never going to give a shit
About anybody but themselves
So you fight for them to realize;
There's more to life
There's more to you
There's more than meets the eye
And when you're done
The battle's been won
You sit back, you smile
And this is what you hum, you hum x2]
1234, 1234
You, you try
You try to get by
"You're never going to pull it off
You shouldn't even try
You're a wet cigarette
You're always second best"
But they're never going to give a shit
About anybody but themselves
You fight
For them to realize
There's more to life
There's more to you
There's more than meets the eye
And when you're done
Your battle's been won
You sit back
You smile
And this is what you hum, you hum
1234, 1234
Years go by
The time it does fly
Every single second
Is a moment in time
That passes oh, so quick
And it seems like nothing
But when you're looking back
Well it amounts to everything
I've got myself
I've got my friends
I've got my little family
But that's not where it ends
This one goes out to you
It goes out to everyone
It's in the name of honesty
Because life has just begun
1234, 1234
Look around little brother
Can you tell me what you see?
You're a big boy now
So take responsibility
You never had it hard
But now it's getting tough
So you whine, whine, whine
And you say you've had enough
You say I'm full of shit
That I'm a hypocrite
I shouldn't talk
When I can't take the advice that I give?
Well maybe you're right
But open your eyes:
The main difference here
Is that I try, try, try...
1234, 1234
