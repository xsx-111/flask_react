9mm And A Three Piece Suit LyricsWell, I know I shouldn't care but I do and I don't
And I always crack a smile when I see your punk rock clothes
And you try, try but you never fit in and
You're never going to so pack it up, pack it in, so there
Steve took three or four, Heather took more
Lit a cigarette and now they're walkin' out the door
With a semi automatic and a ski mask on
They look to one another and they say to themselves, "What fun"
Well, I never wanna bother and I never wanna hover
Over his or her affairs because that's not fair
And it seems to me that you're running out of time
And it seems to me like you're never gonna do what's right
Jack dropped 21, Jill 22
The look in his eye said "Brother, whatcha gonna do
With a nine millimeter and a three piece suit?"
They look to one another and say, "Hey, motherfucker, who's the fool?"
Steve took three or four, Heather took more
Lit a cigarette and now they're walkin' out the door
With a semi automatic and a ski mask on
They look to one another and they say to themselves, "What—"
Jack dropped 21, Jill 22
The look in his eye said "Brother, whatcha gonna do
With a nine millimeter and a three piece suit?"
They look to one another and say, "Hey, motherfucker, who's the fool?"
That's horrible, I can't hear the—Embed
