Lovers Game Lyrics
I call you up and tell you that I love you
I call you up and play my lovers game
Love is just a game to me, dear
Love is just a game I'd like to play

I call you up and tell you that I love you
But really to me every girl's the same
Love is just a game to me, dear
Love is just a game I'd like to play

If I really loved you, then I'd never call you
'Cause I know I'd only hurt you
If I really loved you, then I'd never call you
'Cause I know I'd only hurt you, my love


I call you up and tell you that I love you
I call you up and play my lovers game
Love is just a game to me, dear
Love is just a game I'd like to playEmbed
