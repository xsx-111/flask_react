Fade Away Lyrics
Flowers and gardens, abandoned from view
Cry for their love, like I do

People talk, they love to whisper
Think of all the boys who've kissed her
But to me it doesn’t matter they

Fade away fade away
Fade away

When we met we fell together
Now she's gone I can't forget her
Love is chance but time won't let her

Fade away and fade away
Fade away, fade away


Like flowers in this world I’ve never seen
I wanna hold your love
I wanna win your love for me
Fade away

For me there was no sunshine
For me there was no rain
For me until I met you
Every day was the same

Fade away, fade away, fade away


Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
Fade, fade, fade, fade away
Fade......away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
Fade awayEmbed
