This Love Will Last Lyrics
If I had to tell now the way I feel about you I'd say nothing
'Cause when I try to tell how I feel you know I'd only end up crying

This love will last
This love will last

Remembering back times now I know these bad times could never last forever
Wiser men than me have told me what to do when hurt and I'd forgive her

This love will last
This love will last

So take your hand and put your hand in mine and tell me
That you'll never leave me, forever, together, two lovers for forever

This love will last
This love will last

If I had to tell now the way I feel about you I'd say nothing
'Cause when I try to tell how I feel you know I'd only end up crying

This love will last
This love will last
This love will lastEmbed
