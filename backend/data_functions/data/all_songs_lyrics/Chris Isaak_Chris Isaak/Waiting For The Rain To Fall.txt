Waiting For The Rain To Fall Lyrics
You and I don't love each other, we don't talk to one another
I don't think you love anyone in this world at all
I'm just waiting for the rain to fall

Tears may fall and clouds may gather, I should go I think I'd rather
Wait until there's no chance left at all
I'm just waiting for the rain to fall
I'm just waiting for the rain to fall

Rain will fall and leave me crying
But there's no clouds up in the sky
But you don't care there's no denying
'Cause there's no tear drops in your eyes


You and I don't love each other, we can only hurt each other
I don't think there's no love left at all
I'm just waiting for the rain to fall
I'm just waiting for the rain to fall
I'm just waiting for the rain to fallEmbed
