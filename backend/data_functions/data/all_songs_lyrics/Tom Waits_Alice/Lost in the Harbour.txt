Lost in the Harbour LyricsOver here, the ladies all want sweet perfume
But there's never a rose
And over there, the roses are frightened to bloom
So they never can grow
And over here, they need wool
For weaving their baby's new clothes
But nobody has any wool
And the sheep are all lost in the harbour
Lost in the harbour
And over here, they want diamonds to wear
But there aren't any here
And over there, everyone's hiding their tears
But they're crying inside
And the wall won't come down
Till they're no longer afraid of themselves
If you don't believe me, ask yourselves
And then I can come down to the harbour
Down to the harbour
And then I will fill the ocean
Back up with my tears
I still have a couple more years
And then I can come back to the harbour
Down to the harbourEmbed
