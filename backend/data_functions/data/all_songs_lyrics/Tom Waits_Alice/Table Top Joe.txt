Table Top Joe LyricsWell, my Mama didn't want me
On the day I was born
I was born without a body
I got nothin' but scorn
But I always loved music
All I had was my hands
I dreamed I'd be famous
And I'd work at The Sands
Singing
Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
How everyone will know Tabletop Joe
I had trouble with the pedals
But I had a strong left hand
And I could play Stravinsky
On a Baby Grand
I said I'm gonna join the circus
'Cause that's where I belong
So I went to Coney Island
I was singing this song
Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
Now everyone knows Tabletop Joe
They gave me top billing
In the Dreamland show
I had my own orchestra
Starring Tabletop Joe
And the man without a body
Proved everyone wrong
I was rich and I was famous
I was where I belonged
Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
Now everyone knows Tabletop JoeEmbed
