Desert Trip LyricsIt's a good
Good desert trip
And when you see a Billy Kid
Dance on your head
And my body makes that? moon shine
My daddy's sound
He's loving you tonight
Pretty spirit make a smile
And will never let this wicked world drive us wild
Fill your heart with soul
Alone we make??
And tomorrow I'm finding you a booker
Missed you as postman
Bring me a booker
Pretty spirit make a smile
It will never let this wicked world drive us wild
It's that good old Billy laugh
Now you and me
Begging a photograph
And that?? a song
And in our hearts
Is where every note belongs
A pretty spirit make a smile
It will never let this wicked world drive us wild
Pretty spirit make a smile
It will never let this wicked world drive us wild
You're gonna smileEmbed
