Dear Friend LyricsDear friend you'll find
A message in beauty is written right there in the sky
Dear friend you'll find
The message in beauty is written right there in the sky
Dear friend you'll find
The message in beauty is written right there in the sky
Dear friend you'll find
The message in beauty is written right there in the sky
Dear friend you'll find
The message in beauty is written right there in the sky
Dear friend something eating you up from the inside such a boring thing
It's got you and it's studied you
You do not grow your garden hose
...Dear friend you will never see I should just let it be but it worries me
Dear friend, dear friend
You do not hear the harmonies we hear
Dear friend, dear friend
You do not see the life in everything
Dear friend you'll find
The message in beauty is written right there in the sky
Dear friend you'll find
The message in beauty is written right there in the sky
Yeah brother when we shared those times the heaven wants those latest nights
Though I cannot ever tell you what it really is
I just agree with you man, it's all showbiz
The mantra bends the day look it's dying tonight
Summerbreezes pass, the mantra bends the light
Forever days of your but a marrows bone
The 2012 in store lord I'm coming home
Dear friend, dear friend
You do not hear the harmonies we hear
Dear friend, dear friend
You do not see the life in everythingEmbed
