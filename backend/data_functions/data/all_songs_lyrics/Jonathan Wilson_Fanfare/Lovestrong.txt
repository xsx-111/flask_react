Lovestrong LyricsMystic music come and save me from my memories
I was so alone this time
Cosmic harmony
Perfect harmony
The mystic frees inside my mind
Hold on…
Love…Strong…
Love…Strong…
Just a while ago went up the road a piece
Fanfare when you are born
A ballad when you are released
And all the while are the lyrics that you sang
Every lifetime plays the song of every living thing
Hold on…
Love…Strong…
Love…Strong…
Now I'm hearing about your bourgeois life out on the beach
Coyote'd chew off his own paw to get out of what you've tried to achieve, lady
And all the while you could have laid here in my arms
And all the while we shared this mystic in our hearts
Hold on…
Love…Strong…Embed
