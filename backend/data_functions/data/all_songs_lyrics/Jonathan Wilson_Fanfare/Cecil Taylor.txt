Cecil Taylor LyricsHeaven and earth collide
May the spirit’s guide be the one I navigate tonight
Well I’m just another hardened set of eyes
Looking for a miracle
Never the twain shall meet
Not even Jesus and al-Salam upon the street

Disappear as energy
Completely alone I remember the story
We all see the thunderbolt
We all feel the glory
It moves underneath us
The river - the blood of our heart
It’s been there from the

Strangers and old friends arrive
Cecil Taylor’s on the White House lawn tonight
Still now hope it travels wide
Uncertain times
Listen for the miracle…
Heaven and earth collide
May the spirit’s guide be the one I navigate tonight
Well I’m just another hardened set of eyes
Looking for a miracle …
When completely alone I remember the story
We all see the thunderbolt
We all feel the glory
It moves underneath us
The river - the blood of our heart
It’s been there from the
Start…
Start…
Start…
