Love to Love LyricsWell I flew in from this old furniture town
A long, long time ago
At nineteen I was one of the lucky ones
A lad bright enough to leave
That old dirty town where they all put me down
So I brought with me these here 3 guitars
Yeah One for the cuts, 2 for the scars
But I'm not the only one who rolled into town
Just t lay my burden down
Well she's living high up there with the sun
With the fern and eucalyptus hey way up in the canyon
Cheer up child, drink that strawberry wine, another time
We've arrived in the state of mind
Where everything's moving gears
Like limb to limb and mouth to mouth and hey
You gotta love to love
You gotta love to love
You gotta love to love
La da da da da da da da
I was in Topanga just about long enough
To see what it's got to turn into to expect the dust
I saw Venus just North of Zuma Beach
She was too Hollywood to even recognize me
Hey they say the boulevard board it sparkles like diamonds
Hey Tall and malachite, Always light up the night
I lost you baby on Yamashiro hill
Those pagodas in your eyes light up the city even still
Well she's living high up there with the sun
With the fern and eucalyptus hey way up in the canyon
Cheer up child, drink that strawberry wine, another time
We've arrived in the state of mind
Where everything's moving gears
Like limb to limb and mouth to mouth and hey
You gotta love to loveEmbed
