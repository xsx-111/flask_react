Her Hair Is Growing Long LyricsAlone again
I can feel my spirit fly
I can see a single line
Drawing in the reaches of my mind
The roads unpaved
But still rainbow touches leads the way
Age old wisdom still remains
She lies behind her dessert island name
The bloodline it is thin
Will it wrap around again
Or am I singing with the end
I know that I am singing with the end
I am saved by her rainbow eyes
Now I've placed her in this song
She smokes she sees
Her hair is growing long
And we dance
And we dance
And we dance
And the night goes oooooon...Embed
