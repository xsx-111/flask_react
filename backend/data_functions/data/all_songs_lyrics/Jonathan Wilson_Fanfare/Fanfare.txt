Fanfare LyricsOoh, let me love you
It's all that I can do
Not to touch you
Ooh, I'm in love with you
You're here in my piano
Yeah, you're never too far
And hey, you make my heart beat faster
I just cannot believe you'll come back again
I need to look into your eyes
I see my life floating by, yeah
Looking in your eyes
Look at our lives floating by
Yeah, looking in your eyes, yeah
Look at our lives floating by
Yeah
Look at our lives floating by
Floating by
Ooh, heyEmbed
