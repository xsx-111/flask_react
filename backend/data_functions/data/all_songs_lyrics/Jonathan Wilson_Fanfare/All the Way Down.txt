All the Way Down LyricsVerse 1:
Take it all the way down
You're something I can feel
With the drugs and the fleecing dancer
With the cats and the card board manners
Yea I like it down here
No one judges my sad eyes
And there's no one small talking
At this point... why would you bother?
Chorus:
I'd never heard the song
Still it made me cry
Man oh man
Sits and watches nameless traffic
And maybe thats the reason I can't let you go
I'll never know
Verse 2:
Yea I remember being close to you
Ya I promise i can almost imagine
Now finally, an array of hotel rooms
That do not contain the family
I need to speak with a mystic
Need to hear him glide right across the ocean
Yea I need to speak with a mystic
Need to hear him sing she's about to move her
Chorus:
I'd never heard the song
Still it made me cry
Man oh man
Sits and watches nameless traffic
Maybe thats the reason I can't let you go
I'll never know
Take it all the way down (5)Embed
