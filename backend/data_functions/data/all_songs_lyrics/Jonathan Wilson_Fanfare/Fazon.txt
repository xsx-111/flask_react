Fazon LyricsWho's gonna live
In all those cities underground
If they move there
When will they ever come out of the ground
Are they gonna raise their children
In tiny caverns in the ground
Send the children out to play
In the soundbay I found
Fa fa fa fa fa fazon fazon fazon
Who's gonna be the ones who live beneath the sea
All their lives a thousand feet beneath the sea
Pushin mother tells her baby it used to be a lighter place
If she's a good baby baby might feel the sun upon his face someday
Fa fa fa fa fa fazon fazon fazon
Who's gonna go on all those trips in outer space
All their lives in the darkened outer space
After a hundred generations billion miles from the sun
All the spaced out people finaly find another one
And they say:
Fa fa fa fa fa fazon fazon fazon
Fa fa fa fa fa fazon fazon fazonEmbed
