New Mexico LyricsYou were making noises
You wanted to come back
So we met up again
And it almost hit the sack
But I stopped
I wanted were I was
Should I be doing this
Was I just really lost
When you hurt me so much
I was confused, so confused
It's scorn from betrayal
So easily, so easily excused
So I turned around
And I ran, lord I ran
I was haunted by the memories of the same old place
I couldn't let you into my mind
I couldn't get you out of my mind
I couldn't let you into my mind
I couldn't get you out of my mind
I had to go
Vapors millin me
Time to grieve
I had to bite the bullet
The bullet that was killing me
I drove away into the night
I didn't know where to go
I took the fast road out of sight
Down to all New Mexico
Where the eagle flies
From the river to the sky
Where the eagle flies
From the river to the sky
And the sky is as open as the question
Why, why, why, why, why, why
I knew that I loved you
I loved you just the same
I knew I couldn't trust you
But I loved you just the same
I knew that I loved you
I loved you just the same
I knew I couldn't trust you
But I loved you just the sameEmbed
