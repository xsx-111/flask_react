Right Right Now Now LyricsNow, once upon a time up on this mic
MC's be really workin' on what they write
With the sound delight we rock all night
And yes we're gonna party for the right to fight
We're international like Matt Takei
Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Say what we mean, mean what we say
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll
And what we do now is future molding
Columbine bowling, childhood stolen
We need a bit more gun controlling
Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?
We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on
Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone
We gotta work together it's been too long
When I get on you scream, "HOO, TIGHT!"
Rockin' this flow I could go all night
I'm not here to fight, or incite
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The U.S. attacking other nations
And narrations, on every station
False elation's got me losing my patience
Well I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way
And yes I got to say fuck the KKK
And oh yeah hey, how about today?
If you want to set if off then let me hear you say
Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?
We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on
Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone
We gotta work together it's been too long
I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down "HUMAN" inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an Iron Chef when I slice and dice
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice
Please pass me the Riunite on ice
Well let's go to work and not berserk
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
Try to smooth it out like Levert
I keep the mind alert and not revert
Right-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?
We-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on
Be-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone
We gotta work together it's been too long1Embed
