3 the Hard Way LyricsFresh dressed 'cause I shop at Modell's
Deep in Brooklyn, I rode the L's
Used to ride the D to beat the morning bell
At Edward R. Morrow out on Ave. L
Now we be grillin' cheese and flippin' flapjacks
With the diamond stylus, yo, we cutting wax
We're the super-elastic, bubble-plastic
Got ethereal material that's straight up classic
You try to vex, reject, but you should respect
Or we'll have JC send you out a FedEx
So don't start to flex up in the discotheque
Or we'll make you extinct, tyrannosaurus rex
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Three the hard way
Three the hard way
Your rhyme technique, it is antique
To all my heads, Qu'est-ce-que tu fabriques?
Che cazzo fai? Come stai?
Ho fatto molte telefonate
I said, oops, gotcha, clutch like Piazza
Sneak between the sheets so hide the matzoh
Holler back, challah bread... next
We are the crew who put the crew in Cruex
I can see that Def Jam doesn't recognize me
I'm Mike D, the one who put the satin in your panties
Time to count MC's in this place to be
Not five, not four, not two, just three
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Three the hard way
Three the hard way
Round-house kick the mic out your hand
Drunken mantis, my name brand
If you're slick with the tricks and the sleight of hand
I'm hip to the shit that you're trying to scam
Gnip-Gnop, I got shit to pop
I'm an exceptional professional that just don't stop
So pack up your bag and your mic and don't wait
E.T., phone home, now get the fuck out my face
You know we shake 'em, bake 'em, then we take 'em
Treat MC's like leaves, go out and rake 'em
Sell our CDs on Canal before we make 'em
Serve you on a platter like Steak-umm
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Three the hard way
Three the hard way2Embed
