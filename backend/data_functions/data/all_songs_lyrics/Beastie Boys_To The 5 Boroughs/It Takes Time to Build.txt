It Takes Time to Build LyricsIf you don't like the news then press eject
Baby Davis, getting older, can't take a rain check
It's time to let 'em know what we expect
Stop building SUV's, strung out on OPEC
Hold up, wait up, you know, we come correct
You wanna change things up, well, hey, then get set
It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck
It's easier to break things than build it correct
We've got a president we didn't elect
The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect
And still the US just wants to flex
Keep doin' that, what, we gonna break our necks
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
You gots to chill
Ah, yo, hate-filled people wanna keep us in check
Tearin' down each other is what they expect
If you want love, well, hey, that's a bet
We've got to give before we can get
Waiting like a batter who is on deck
When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck
So let's calibrate and check our specs
We need a little shift on over towards the left
I don't really know but I suspect
I think it's due time that we inspect
How they get their information and their facts are checked?
Another press conference someone's talking out their neck
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
You gots to chill
So step up to the window and place your bets
Is the US gonna keep breaking necks
Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex
And the military muscle that he wants to flex
By the time Bush is done what will be left
Selling votes like E-pills at the discotheque
Environmental destruction and the national debt
But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest
What the real deal, why you can't connect?
Why you hating people that you never met?
Didn't your mama teach you to show some respect?
Why not open your mind for a sec?
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
It takes a second to wreck it
It takes time to build
You gots to chill
It takes
It takes
It takes
It takes
It takes
It takes
