Rhyme the Rhyme Well LyricsAnd now my name is Adrock, I've got a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd, well the crowd will all yell
And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell
And when I start to rhyme, well I rhyme the rhyme well
Oh you didn't know, I got the flow
I could sing, rap, dance in just one show
With the cornbread stuffin', with the Blimpie Bluffin
Mother fuckin' Yossi with his goddamn muffins
Hey could you please, pass me the peas
And let me get a tissue if you think you're gonna sneeze
I'm the player and the coach, I'm no roach
I bought my grandma a brand new brooch
Well I'm MCA with a story to tell
When I rock the crowd, I rock the crowd well
And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme, well I rhyme the rhyme well
'Cause I'm a craftsman, who ain't fastin'
I'll take you to task, everyone of y'all draftsman
I'm rehashin' and ain't maskin'
Bringin' the beat back, and keepin' it lastin'
Keepin' it topnotch, beyond passin'
Simmer in the pan 'cause, I ain't a-flashin'
I'm party crashin' so you better batten
Down those hatches stop procrastin-
Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd, the crowd will all yell
And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme, I rhyme the rhyme well
Went to the top and never went pop and
Came back down but still not stopping
I'm not even asking, "Yo, what's cracking?"
Serving MC's on a platter like baked Alaskan
So start packin', 'cause I'm back in
The game of hip-hop representin' Manhattan
Now push the pause button, then start ducking
Shhhhh, you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton
Hutton shhhhhhhh, Hutton shhh, Hutton shhhhhhh
Hutton SHHHHHHHHH!!!
"And I was trying on the Batgirl costume, what's wrong with that?
Now, now I was the Catwoman."
Hey, Adam. It's Felicia…
Hey, Mike. It's Felicia…
Hey, Adam. It's Felicia…Embed
