Mary Lyrics
Burn up with the water
The floods are on the plains
The planets in rows
Who knows what they contain?
And my brain is like an orchestra
Playing on, insane
Will you love me like you loved me in the January rain?

Mom and Dad and violins
Somber country silence
The needle stopped the kicking
The clothes pins on the floor
And my heart is playing hide and seek
Wait and count to four
Will you love me like you loved me and I'll never ask for more

What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind
Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning, high and smiling
Cheap drink, dark and violent
Full of butterflies, the violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush, the constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band when April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round, Mary
In your famous story book

We overcome the sirens
We look both left and right
And I can feel the numbness accompany my plight
And I know that someday soon I'll see you
But now you're out of sight
And you'll kiss me like you used to in the January night
What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning, high and smiling
Cheap drink, dark and violent
Full of butterflies, the violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush, the constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band when April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round, Mary
In your famous story book7Embed
