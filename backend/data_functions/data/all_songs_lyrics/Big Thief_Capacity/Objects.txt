Objects LyricsOld volcanoes melting
Love is overwhelming
Letting your insides out
Blind altercation
Open invitation
Breaking your guard down
Leaving the familiar
Air is getting chillier
Stepping outside your skin
No ordinary measurement
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me
Walking through your garden
Pulling up the garlic
Getting our hands dirty
Kissing on the vampires
Kissing on the werewolves
We have no enemies
No ordinary measurement
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of meEmbed
