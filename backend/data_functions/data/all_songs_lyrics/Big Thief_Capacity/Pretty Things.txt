Pretty Things Lyrics
Matthew, please do not regret
With your silk in my hand
And your heart in my sweat as you're
Lighting the end of my last cigarette
I will warm you, warm you

These things that lonely ones do
Baby, that's what I'm here for
I'll take care and make all your wishes come true
If you want to, do you want to?

Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me
There's one inside of you, too

There is a meeting in my thighs
Where in thunder and lightning
Men are baptized in their anger and fighting
Their deceit and lies
I've got lips like sugar, lips like sugar

Holding my wrist to the bed
He was thrusting and moaning
And pressing his head to my temple
His head was a temple
I said you've got lips like sugar, daddy
Lips like sugar
Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me
There's one inside of you, too
And she don't always do pretty thingsEmbed
