Capacity Lyrics
Flight is a beautiful word
Flowered with consonance
That’s what I'll followed
Forever
I am a beautiful bird
Fluttered and floating
Swollen and hollowed
For heaven

Do what you want with me
Lost in your captivity
Learning capacity
For make-believing everything
Is really hanging on

Slipping away from the party
Totally vacant
Everyone gone from their bodies
You were outside kissing another
She was a friend of mine
I was surprised to discover

I wrapped my arms around her
She was a beautiful figure
There are no enemies
We’re make-believing everything
Is really hanging on
There is a castle that stands
High in the canyon
The blue knights are crying together
A child is holding my hand
She is directing, the red crystal pine with a feather

Do what you want with me
Lost in your captivity
Learning capacity
For make-believing everything
Is really hanging on
Really hanging on
Really hanging on3Embed
