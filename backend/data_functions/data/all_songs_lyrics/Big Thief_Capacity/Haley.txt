Haley LyricsJust like that, she is
I mean
We are, we are gone for good
For closing my eye
Too soon
Missed the room
Old magpie
It just passed me through

Oh, when it gets you down
When you get that notion
Any way you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open
Just like how it used to be, Haley
Kicking around, burying letters we wrote
Oh, wondering what yours might've said to me
Mine went
There are the geese
Over the trail
We have the open road
Oh
And oh when it gets you down
When you get that notion
Any way you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open
Just like that, he's holding my hand
Redirect, rearrange, bringing the moon to land
Oh

And oh, and it gets you down
When you get that notion
Any way you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always openEmbed
