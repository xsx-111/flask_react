Great White Shark Lyrics
Mercury, creeping on the sea
How she wails, flails her arms and weeps
Accumulation of debris
Lips apart, flapping as a lark
For in the dark there is release

Every familiarity scarce as the great white shark

Oh, to build walls with golden gills
Spike in hand, high above the sand
To kill the sanctuary
Every mile that is owned
Only stands still by the grace of the stone

Every familiarity scares as the great white shark

Look, daughter an owl
Listen to her howl
I howled when you were born through me
And you're alive with a breath you can't see
Oh, by the grace of this dreamEmbed
