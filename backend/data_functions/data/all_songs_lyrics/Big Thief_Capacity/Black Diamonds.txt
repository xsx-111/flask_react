Black Diamonds LyricsSo much coming in
I do not know where to begin
I just follow the lead you're pulling
And I get lost in your trail
So much more to tell
You just ask me if I'm doing well
But I do not know what the hell
I just swallow hard
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing
So much you can see
Should I let you make a woman of me?
Should I let you take the mystery from me?
See the inside of my room at night?
Sometimes you will find
Things I do not know how to leave behind
I've been grappling with my mind
I've been stuck inside a jail
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing
The cold of winter warms my blood and he's hot
Like a bed of steel
He finds his peace of mind
In the rivers and the whip-poor-wills
I could follow close behind
And slowly disappear
But I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
In his eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
So much more to do
Come on, let me make a man outta you
I could gather you and you tell the truth
You could cry inside my arms
You could cry inside my arms like a child
You could cry
You could cry1Embed
