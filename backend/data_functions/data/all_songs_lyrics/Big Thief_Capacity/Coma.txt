Coma Lyrics
He brought her in to get out, to get out
He kissed her skin to get off, to get off, off
You can wake up now, momma
From your protective coma
When you wake up, you wake up

You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the iris of the body?
Iris of the body?

You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your houseEmbed
