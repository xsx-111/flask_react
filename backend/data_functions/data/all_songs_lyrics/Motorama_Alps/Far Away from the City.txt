Far Away from the City Lyrics
Listen to me, brother
You see how times had changed

Now I want to be buried
Now I want to be buried
Far away from the city
Far away from the dust

Sit down and tell me, son
Have I lost my mind?

Cause now I want to be buried
Now I want to be buried
Far away from the city
Far away from the dustEmbed
