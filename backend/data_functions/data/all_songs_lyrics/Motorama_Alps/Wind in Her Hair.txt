Wind in Her Hair Lyrics
Oh mother of seas, I saw her so long ago
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands
I am drunken by wine, quite as a child, so close to thee
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands

I am tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
You are so tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
I'm sorry for the pain
Inside of forest shades
We saw each other hardly
So sorry for the pain
Stand still in forest shades
We saw each other hardly, my dear

Oh mother of trees, I saw her so long ago
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands
I am drunken by wine, quite as a child, so close to thee
Wind in her hair, gold ribbons in hands

I am tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
You are so tired and our traveling
Our traveling is over
I'm sorry for the pain
Stand still in forest shades
We saw each other hardly
I'm sorry for the pain
Stand still in forest shades
We saw each other hardly, my dear, hardly, hardly
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear
Hardly, my dear3Embed
