Ghost Lyrics
My hopes, my will
Were never a part of you
Those days were sad and cold
I'll never want them back again

But in this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow

Your voice is pure and soft
It's throwing me back to my hopes
My ears were deaf and cold
Please hold me tight in your arms again

But in this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillow
But in this moment we are close to each other again
It's like a merge of different colors
In a silver mountain lake
(We are at home again)
It's like dancing in the room with a female ghost
It's like falling from the edge
To the bed with cold clean pillowEmbed
