Normandy Lyrics
Normandy
I haven't been here before
I haven't been here before
I haven't been here before

Where everything sinks in her beautiful thoughts
Where her pleasure is light of a firework
Still on the edge, can't remember that feeling
Can't remember the place

Rain and fog
I travelled by train too long
Travelled by train too long
Travelled by train alone

A familiar sound of a mystery place
I was lying alone, hands on my face
I was lying alone with a miserable feeling of felicityEmbed
