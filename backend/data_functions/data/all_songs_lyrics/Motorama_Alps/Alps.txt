Alps Lyrics
Like a foam in an antique bath
White snow has covered my head
I am slow slow slow slow slowly dying
My blue colored eyes are almost blind

And I see
Huge walls of trees
Huge walls of ice shelves
It takes my breath away

If everyone is falling on knees
I will almost die for this beauty

She touched me
My heart was beating too fast
She walked close to me
My heart was beating too fast

How it feels?
Cold arms on me
Hot blood in my chest
I've done everything I can
If everyone is falling on knees
I will almost die for this beauty
Everyone is falling on knees

And I see
Huge walls of trees
Huge walls of ice shelves
It takes my breath away

If everyone is falling on knees
I will almost die for this beauty
Everyone is falling on knees
Everyone's falling5Embed
