Ship Lyrics
Flying like a paper bird, covered eyes we saw
From the lighthouse up to young clouds
An open path
Flying like a paper bird, grown up trees we saw
From the leopard paw to your heart
Insanity

No one knows, to where our ship floats
From ocean grey and cold, how long will it care about you?
Will it care about us?

Flying like a paper bird, golden hills we saw
There's no arrogance, oh brother
Flying like a paper bird, anxious waves we saw
From the lighthouse up to young clouds
An open path

No one knows, where our ship floats
From ocean grey and cold, how long will it care about you?
Will it care about us?
From ocean grey and cold, how long will it care about you? Or shall we die?Embed
