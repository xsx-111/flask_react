The Book of Right-On LyricsWe should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on
It was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on
It was right on
I killed my dinner with karate â€”
Kick 'em in the face, taste the body;
Shallow work is the work that I do
Do you want to sit at my table?
My fighting fame is fabled
And fortune finds me fit and able
And you do say that you do pray
And you say that you're okay
Do you want to run with my pack?
Do you want to ride on my back?
Pray that what you lack does not distract
And even when you run through my mind
Something else is in front; you're behind
And I don't have to remind you
To stick with your kind
And you do say that you do pray
And you say that you're okay
And even when you touch my face
You know your place
And even when you touch my face
You know your place
And we should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on
It was right on
And we should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on
It was right onEmbed
