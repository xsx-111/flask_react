Sprout and the Bean LyricsI slept all day
I woke with distaste
And I railed
And I raved
That the difference between
The sprout and the bean
It is a golden ring
It is a twisted string
And you can ask the counselor;
And you can ask the king;
And they'll say the same thing;
And it's a funny thing:
Should we go outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?
And as I said
I slept as though dead
Dreaming seamless dreams of lead
When you go away
I am big-boned and fey
In the dust of the day
And in the dirt of the day
And the Danger! Danger!
Drawing near them was a white coat
And the Danger! Danger!
Drawing near them was a broad boat
And the water! Water!
Running clear beneath a white throat
And the hollow chatter
Of the talking of the Tadpoles
Who know th'outside!
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?1Embed
