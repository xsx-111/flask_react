Cassiopeia LyricsFeel the mattress tense beneath me
Like the muscle of non-sleepy;
Feathers flexing will defeat me
And it vexes me completely
And the hexes heat covertly
Like a slow low-flying turkey
Like a Texan drying jerky
But his meaty mitts can't hurt me
With my steely will compounded
In a mighty mound that's hounded
By the snap your steel string sounded
Just before your snores unwound it
And in store are dreams so daring
That the night can't stop from staring
And I'll swim sweetly as a herring
Through the ether, not despairing
Go to sleep, you stunning sky;
Gently creep cunning by
A quiet hum is amplified
By your thumb, that you suck dry
Hundred raging waters
Snare the lonely sigh
And you hold your breath
And clasp at Cassiopeia
Hundred raging waters
Snare the lonely sigh
Hold your breath
And clasp at Cassiopeia
Cassiopeia, Cassiopeia
Oh oh, CassiopeiaEmbed
