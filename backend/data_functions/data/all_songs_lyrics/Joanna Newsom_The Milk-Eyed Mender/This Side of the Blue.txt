This Side of the Blue LyricsSvetlana sucks lemons across from me
And I am progressing abominably
And I do not know my own way to the sea
But the saltiest sea knows its own way to me
And the city that turns, turns protracted and slow
And I find myself toeing th'Embarcadero
And I find myself knowing
The things that I knew
Which is all that you can know
On this side of the blue
And Jaime has eyes
Black and shiny as boots
And they march at you two-by-two
(re-loo re-loo);
When she looks at you
You know she's nowhere near through:
It's the kindest heart beating
This side of the blue
And the signifieds butt heads
With the signifiers
And we all fall down slack-jawed
To marvel at words!
When across the sky sheet the
Impossible birds, in a steady
Illiterate movement homewards
And Gabriel stands beneath forest and moon
See them rattle & boo
See them shake, and see them loom
See him fashion a cap from a page of Camus;
And see him navigate deftly this side of the blue
And the rest of our lives
Will the moments accrue
When the shape of their goneness
Will flare up anew
Then we do what we have to do
(re-loo re-loo)
Which is all that you can do
On this side of the blue
Oh, it's all that you can do
On this side of the blue1Embed
