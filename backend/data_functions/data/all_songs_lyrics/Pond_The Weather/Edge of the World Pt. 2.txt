Edge of the World Pt. 2 Lyrics
Pornography—
Prosecution for a number of years—
Deeper— *applause*

On the edge of the world
There's a limestone jail that stands
It's the work of convict hands
And we sleep on sacred bones
While the sea breeze hollow moans
And we sleep under languid fans
And beside our phones
And the very worst human beings I know are police or MPs
So we stare out to sea
And whisper to the sunset
Oh, it's nice to be

On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world

And I feel like I'm stranded
It's nothing like I planned it
I should be on a star
Drunk at a Fitzroy bar
I'll trade the swans for bats
Live among the rats
Wear alluring hats
I'm gonna move to the East
And I'm never coming back

And if the highway gets you down
And if the violence gets you down
And if Lateline gets you down
And if your own faith gets you down
And if the cokeheads get you down
If Gina Rinehart gets you down
And if the white guilt gets you down
And if El Niño gets you down
We've got the water
We've got the water
We've got the water for now
We've got the water
We've got the water
We've got the water for now
Oh, well, actually
Rather than talk about it, I can read y—
Oh, that'd be great5Embed
