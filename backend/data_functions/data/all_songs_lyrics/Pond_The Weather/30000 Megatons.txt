30000 Megatons Lyrics
There's thirty-thousand megatons pointed at her
And him and you and me and everyone we serve
I look out at the mirror, look out at the world
Thirty-thousand megatons is just what we deserve
And I don't get out of bed no more
Beasts learned to talk a bit just to survive
But we're not even beasts, it's a wonder we're alive
We're baser than the base, deaf and dumb and blind

I'll not stand for Maybelline, or Kyle or Jackie O
Or my sunburnt country burning people I don't know
I'll not stand alone, or sing in one tune
To see a Virgin air hostess serve Bolly on the moon
And if I was the man on the Moon, I wouldn't let us near
I'd stand on a crater with my shotgun to the sky
And leave us to our mines and our Tinder 'til we die
And the Earth will sigh, and the Moon will wipe its brow

We need thirty-thousand megatons
Push the button now
We need thirsty-thousand megatons
Push the button now
Out on the street, it's only vitamins and hate
We'll soon be out of Xanax and then it'll be too late
We need thirty-thousand megatons, why wait?
Why wait?

We need thirty-thousand megatons
Push the button now
We need thirty-thousand megatons
Push the button now3Embed
