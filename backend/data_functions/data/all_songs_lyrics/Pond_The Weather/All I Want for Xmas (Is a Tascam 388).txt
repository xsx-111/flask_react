All I Want for Xmas (Is a Tascam 388) Lyrics
As far as I know
All that I want for Christmas
Is a TASCAM 388, don't you know?
Oh, and all I want for Christmas

I don't want a boat
Don't want universal remote
And I don't need you
Oh, no

Oh, and all I want for Christmas
As far as I know (Oh)
All that I want for Christmas
Is a TASCAM 388, don't you know?
Oh, and all I want for Christmas1Embed
