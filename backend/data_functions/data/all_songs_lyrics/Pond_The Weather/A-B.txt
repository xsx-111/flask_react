A/B Lyrics

Pax Americana, fax Australiana
Smoked a banana and visualised a liquid metal Virginia Woolf
Liposuction Tuesday, steak night Wednesday
Breast augmentation payed for caviar on Christmas Day
And if I work on an afternoon
By May, we'll both be on the moon
Touching glasses with Richard Branson
And his harpy queens
I'm too apathetic to defend my heterosexuality
But I'll not lie here on my phone while being fucked by the Man

He—
The body of a man who died—
Do you wan—
Sixty seconds—

Angel, angel, you talked to me
And I don't even care if you were lying about being clean
Angel, you're still an angel despite the speed
Only seventeen, with blackened teeth
Angel, you talked to me
And I don't even care if you were lying about being clean
Angel, you're still an angel despite the speed
Only seventeen, with blackened teeth1Embed
