Paint Me Silver Lyrics
Paint me silver and call me Hermann Hesse
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again

The power to devour all the creeping things he made
Slip up in the shower singing "home-made lemonade"
Bring me Louis Cartier, I need a diamond halo
For me and my seven billion brothers

I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe
But I never know what to do, babe
Do, babe, ooh

Soldiers and the children still shivving in the Jago
And whoever runs the ship for the others

I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe
But I never know what to do, babe
Do, babe, ooh, babe
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

Paint me silver and call me Hermann Hesse
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again

I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe, oh, oh
But I never know what to do, babe
Do, babe, do, babe, ooh, babe
Never know what to do, babe (Save me)
But that's not nothing new, babe (Save me)
I'm the champion of the few, babe (Save me)
But I never know what to do, babe (Save me)

Save me
Save me
