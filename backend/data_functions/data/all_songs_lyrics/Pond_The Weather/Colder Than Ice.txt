Colder Than Ice Lyrics
C-c-c-colder than ice
C-c-c-colder than ice
C-c-c-colder than ice (Colder than ice)
C-c-c-colder than ice

Colder than ice if you give it a try
It's that look in your eyes, it's your hand on the fire
It's the lure of the pipe
C-c-c-colder than ice (You know you want to)
C-c-c-colder than ice
Colder than ice if you give it a try
Look in your eyes, rub your hands on your thighs
From the lure of the pipe
C-c-c-colder than ice (You know you want to)
C-c-c-colder than ice

There's been a substantial increase in methamphetamine use in Perth, according to doctors
And the drug is more potent
The highly addictive drug is linked to crime and psychosis
Emergency staff say it puts them and the patient at risk
(C-c-c-colder than ice)
Frightening pictures from Royal Perth Hospital
Staff try to control patients high on amphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant
(C-c-c-colder than ice)
There's a huge effect on the mental health with psychosis
And often they're completely physically out of control
And in the past two months, there's been a spike in—
Walking through the suburbs
Eyes down (C-c-c-colder than ice)
Skulking through the suburbs
Ice town (C-c-c-colder than ice)

Colder than ice if you give it a try
It's that look in your eyes, it's your hand on the fire
It's the lure of the pipe
C-c-c-colder than ice (You know you want to)
C-c-c-colder than ice
Colder than ice if you give it a try
Look in your eyes, rub your hands on your thighs
From the lure of the pipe
C-c-c-colder than ice (You know you want to)
C-c-c-colder than ice
Colder than ice if you give it a try
Look in your eyes, rub your hands on your thighs
From the lure of the pipe
C-c-c-colder than ice (You know you want to)
C-c-c-colder than ice
Colder than ice if you give it a try
Look in your eyes, rub your hands on your thighs
From the lure of the pipe
Not appropriate... a child
Tonight, there is a clear leader—Embed
