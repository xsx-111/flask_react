Too Much Love (Tour Edition) LyricsCome on, come on
Got to sit you down baby, gonna talk to you
Now you're a real good woman and you treat me right
About to lose my job and what do we do?
When you get that fever, you keep me up all night
Singing...
You give me too much love, too much love
You give me too much love, I'm gonna lose my mind
You give me too much love, too much love
Too much love, I'm gonna lose my mind
Now ain't no disrespect and I'm terribly thankful
You know we're both adults, know that love ain't cheap
Try to give you what you want with the heaven I'm able
See I can't turn around cause I'm in too deep
You give me too much love, too much love
Too much love, I'm gonna lose my mind
You give me too much love, too much love
Too much love, I'm gonna lose my mind
Come on, come on...
Come on, come on
Give you what you need
Come on, come on
Give you what
You give me too much love, too much love
Too much love, I'm gonna lose my mind
You give me too much love, too much love
Too much love, I'm gonna lose my mind
Too much love, too much love
Too much love, I'm gonna lose my mind...Embed
