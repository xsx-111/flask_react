Good Luck LyricsYou got me cold
Standing in the doorway all night
If you are so unhappy, baby
I'm sorry I'm wasted your time
But you didn't know that
I let you go without a fight
Well, it's gonna hurt right now
But later you won't even cross my mind
Oh it's so hard
All I got to say is
Good luck, good luck baby getting on without me
Good luck, good luck baby but you're gonna be sorry
What can I say
You got one foot out the door
If you are so unhappy baby I'm sorry my kisses got old
Day after day there's something that I can't ignore
Night after night I offer my body and you leave me cold
Oh it's so hard
All I got to say is
Good luck, good luck baby getting on without me
Good luck, good luck baby but you're gonna be sorry
Good luck, good luck baby getting on without me
Good luck, good luck baby but you're gonna be sorry
Oh it's so hard
All I got to say is
Good luck, good luck baby getting on without me
Good luck, good luck baby but you're gonna be sorry
Good luck, good luck baby getting on without me
Good luck, good luck baby but you're gonna be sorry
Oh it's so hard...Embed
