Play The Fool LyricsIt took a while before I figure it out
The way the girls talk, it's all over school
I stuck around through all of my doubts
But then you went and broke all the rules
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Well I'm a man and a man's got his pride
The way the boys talk, it's all over school
I got inside you and you took me for a ride
You was a machine and I was the tool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Yeah play the fool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
Ooo, you know I play the fool
I play the fool, I play the fool, play the foolEmbed
