Open My Eyes LyricsToo many people
Coming and a-goin'
In and out of my life
In the night, in the day
I've got to make it on my own
Somebody asked me
How do you do it
Tell them that I'm justified
Of the truth to myself
You know I feel so low
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Complicate the matter
Playing on the weakness
Taking all of my time
I'll go down with the ship
To the bottom like a stone
Falling off the ladder
Holy water hell hound
Folding like a jack knife
But the truth to myself
You know it cuts through the bone
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Yeah, (somebody, somebody, somebody open my eyes)
(Somebody, somebody, somebody open my eyes)
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyesEmbed
