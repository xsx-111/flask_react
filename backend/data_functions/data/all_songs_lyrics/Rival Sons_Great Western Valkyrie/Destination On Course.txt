Destination On Course LyricsSail your ships for openings
Ride the waves that cover me
Moving through uncharted space
Slow exist state of grace
Far away from home
Return before too long
Leave your troubles out the door
You have been lost what your looking for
Eyes that move across the sky
The signal fades
There's no reply
Suddenly refine
You turn the hands of time
Only to unveil
Your hands have slipped from the rail
Slide through the night
Suffer through the rain
Destination on course
