Rich And The Poor Lyrics(Verse)
They walked hand in hand to a future unknown
He carried the water and blankets he brought
So far past the curfew and they were alone
Her teeth bound by braces, and his teeth were not
(Chorus)
The rich and the poor, that's how people get paid
She said I'm gonna show you how babies are made
Oh ohohohohoooooh
Oh ohohohohoooooh
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Verse)
So into the darkness, the rushes and leaves
They walked to the lake side, the moon hanging high
She showed him such sweet things he could not believe
He would not forget for the rest of his life
(Chorus)
The rich and the poor, that's how people get paid
She said I'm gonna show you how babies are made
Oh ohohohohoooooh
Oh ohohohohoooooh
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Bridge)
What's a boy to do when he wants what he can't understand?
She's a big girl and he knows he's in capable hands
She took his hand and showed him what people ignored
She took his hand and showed him what bodies are for
(Chorus)
The rich and the poor, that's how people get paid
She said I'm gonna show you how babies are made
Oh, the rich and the poor, the people get paid
Said I'm gonna show you how babies are made
Oh ohohohohoooooh
Oh ohohohohoooooh
La la la la la la la la la la
Until we both knowEmbed
