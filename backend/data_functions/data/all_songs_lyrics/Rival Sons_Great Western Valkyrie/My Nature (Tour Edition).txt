My Nature (Tour Edition) LyricsDaydreamin'
On a whim when I get the time
I just wanna show you
How good it is to have you
Put your body next to mine
Daydreamin'
When I'm working on a deadline
Looking at the spreadsheet
Thinkin' 'bout the bedsheets baby
Just another man tryin' to make a dime
Woman, this is my nature
Right now I just need some release
Oh yeah, I need you to nurture
I got to know that you still believe
Do you still believe?
Daydreamin'
About all the times that we used to have
We used to lay in bed all day
Now we sit and watch our kids play
Girl you helped make me who I am
Yes you did
Woman, this is my nature
Right now I just need some release
Oh yeah, I need you to nurture
I got to know that you still believe
Yeah
And that day's gonna come
I swear it's gonna happen while we're still young
Together we're gonna climb that hill
Oh yes we will
You got the patience babe, I got the will
Oh, this is my nature
Right now I just need some release
Oh yeah, I need you to nurture
I got to know that you still believe
Oh yeah, this is my nature
Right now I need relief
Oh yes, I need you to nurture
I got to know that you still believeEmbed
