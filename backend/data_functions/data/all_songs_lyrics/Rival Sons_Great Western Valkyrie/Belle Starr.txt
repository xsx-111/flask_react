Belle Starr LyricsSide saddle, black velvet
Every young cowboy's dream
A pistol for each hand
Remember the outlaw queen
Belle Starr, cut down so viciously
Saviour, come for the man on the run
Woman, the Great Western Valkyrie
Belle Starr, shot in the back with her own gun
Shed not for her bitter tears
Nor give the heart vain regret
The casket that lies here
The gem inside sparkles yet
Belle Starr, cut down so viciously
Saviour, home for the man on the run
Woman, the Great Western Valkyrie
Belle Starr
Belle Starr, shot in the back with her own gun
Cut down so viciously, shot in the back with her own gun
Played out so viciously, Belle StarrEmbed
