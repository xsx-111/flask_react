Secret LyricsWait for the cover of the night
Go out where nobody else can see
And if you still wanna go
Don't go out there by yourself
Wait in the bushes for me
I'm gonna tell you a secret
I'm gonna tell you a secret
And I know you're gonna keep it
Go past the tulips and the stones
Out where the water is dark and deep
And if you don't get too cold
And if you think is something you can do?
Wait in that deep water for me
I'm gonna tell you a secret
I'm gonna tell you a secret
Let me tell you a secret
And I know you're gonna keep it
Let me tell you a secret
And I knowâ€¦


Go past the graveyard
All on your own
And if you bring your sister that's fine
Bring me a jar full of shine
Wait in the bushes for me
I'm gonna tell you a secret
And I know you're gonna keep it
I'm gonna tell you a secret
And I know you're gonna keep it
Let me tell you a secret
And I know you're gonna keep it
I'm gonna tell you a secret
