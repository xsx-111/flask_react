Good Things LyricsGood things will happen
Bad things will happen, too
Sometimes it's someone down the road
Sometimes it's somebody next to you
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
37 people on the train sank into below
Supposed to get to Greenville right about 5:45
There was a boy with a bomb in his jacket that didn't explode
So everybody made it home and went to bed that night
Good things will happen
Bad things will happen, too
Sometimes it's someone down the road
Sometimes it's somebody next to you
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
My papa got a job at the mill when he was just 19
He had my mama and my sister and he knew he had to make us a home
And after 43 years retirement was more than just a dream
They laid him off last week and told him he was on his own
Good things will happen
Bad things will happen, too
Sometimes it's someone down the road
Sometimes it's somebody next to you
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Good things will happen
Bad things will happen, too
Sometimes it's someone down the road
Sometimes it's somebody next to you
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Nobody knows for sure what happened that day
You went off into the woods and said you had to be alone
When you came home that night you know you had nothing to say
And there were cuts on your body and your eyes looked just like stone
Good things will happen
Bad things will happen, too
Sometimes it's someone down the road
Sometimes it's somebody next to you
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Enjoy it right now
Because you never know
When it's gonna end
Good things will happen
Bad things
Good things will happen
Bad things will happen, tooEmbed
