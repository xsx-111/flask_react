Life Is Sweet Lyrics
Days like this are sweet
I'm talking in my sleep
I think you're going soft
I know it's stiff for me
And Saturdays are short
I'm walking with my dog
A lie's a canyon size
Break up this all
There is nothing bound and left

Longer that I love
Break up all
There is nothing wrong with me

I'm driving in the sun
It's a hell of a way down south
Bring me back my love
I'm standing in your home
And Saturdays are short
I'm walking with my dog
A lie's a canyon size
Break up this all
There is nothing on the knife
Longer that I love
Break up all
There is nothing wrong with me

And days like this are sweet
I'm walking in my sleep
It's a place where I belong
I banged a million drums
Someday I'll go back home
You'll pick it up and go
I like it in my head

And caught up in your love
And caught up in your love
And caught up in your love
And caught up in your...1Embed
