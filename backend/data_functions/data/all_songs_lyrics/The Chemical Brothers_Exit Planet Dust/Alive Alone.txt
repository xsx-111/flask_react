Alive Alone Lyrics
No way of knowing if she's ever coming back
No way of knowing if I care or not
No way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
No way of knowing if I'll carry on

And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those

And she shines
Still she shines for me
She shines for me

No way of knowing if she's ever coming back
No way of knowing if I care or not
No way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
No way of knowing if I'll carry on

And she shines
Still she shines for me
She shines for me
And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
And I'm alive, and I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
I'm alive, I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those
I'm alive, I'm alone
And I never wanted to be either of those

And she shines
Still she shines for me
She shines for me

And she shines
Still she shines for me
She shines for meEmbed
