When The Generals Talk Lyrics
Up there, up there, up there on the platform
He is speaking to the people
The people are responding
With clapping and a cheering
But the meaning of the message
Not revealed to those assembled
They're taken for a ride
Taken in his stride

When the Generals talk
You better listen to him
When the Generals talk
You better do what he say
When the Generals talk
You better listen to him
When the Generals talk
You better do what he say

There's a rumour in the ranking
Someone's talking insurrection
General has a purge
He wants to win election
With the certain satisfaction
That the people are appeased
Long live the revolution
The General's very pleased
When the Generals talk
You better listen to him
When the Generals talk
You better do what he say
When the Generals talk
You better listen to him
When the Generals talk
You better do what he say

Sitting on the fence both ears to the ground
The fat cats still push the thin cats around
Sitting on the fence both ears to the ground
The fat cats still push the thin cats around
Sitting on the fence both ears to the ground
The fat cats still push the thin cats

Introducing the new general, introducing the new general
Introducing the new general
Introducing the new general school of political diplomacy
If you disagree you get annihilated
Only trouble is we haven't got many generals in Australia
Well, General Motors (haha)
General Credit Corporation (haha)
General Insurance (hahaha)
They're the worst generals of all you know!
When the Generals talk
You better listen to him
When the Generals talk
You better do what he say
When the Generals talk
You better listen to him
When the Generals talk
You better do what he say
When the Generals talk
You better listen to him
When the Generals talk
You better do what he say

When the Generals talk
When the Generals talk
When the Generals talk
You better listen to himEmbed
