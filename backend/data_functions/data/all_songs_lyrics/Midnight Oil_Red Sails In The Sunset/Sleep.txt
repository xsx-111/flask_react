Sleep LyricsSo you've got the blues
The evening wore out your shoes
To a shuffling beat
It's a colourful crowd
Spraycan information
Cover the lonely station
Checkpoint for the state of the nation
On the missionbeat beat
The radio drug
Wayward destinations
Secondhand sensation
In the back of the cell
The plug and the cord
Shoulder dislocation
Bruised in isolation
In the eye of the storm
Writing on walls
Cross my heart confusion
Looking for a new solution
It's the heat of the land
Swallowing sweat
Say those dreams can shake me
Dawn come down and save me
Take this heart
Break this heart
Wrap it up and let me sleep
