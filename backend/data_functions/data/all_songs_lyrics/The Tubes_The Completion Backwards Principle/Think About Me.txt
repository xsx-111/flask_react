Think About Me LyricsPassing in the street, two total strangers meet
Keep short and sweet, no obligations
You belong to me, temporarily
You're a memory, I got to face it
Won't you remember to think about me
Will you think about me
Got no time to rest, can't even catch my breath
Now that the moment's past, there us just tomorrow
No time to look back, to the love affair we had
We knew it wouldn't last, I got to go now
Won't you remember to think about me
Will you think about me
I know you'll never call, or write me little notes
Or take your shirts to clean, you'll forget about me
Think aboout me
We will hit or miss, get the feelings when we kiss
Lovers leap like this, it's now or never
Maybe we'll meet again
Or maybe we'll just pretend that show it's always been
Love's not forever
Won't you remember to think about me
Will you think about meEmbed
