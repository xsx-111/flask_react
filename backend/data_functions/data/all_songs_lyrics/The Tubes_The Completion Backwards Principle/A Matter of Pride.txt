A Matter of Pride LyricsHey baby
You don’t care
You don’t share
You won’t make believe
You won’t tell me things
I got to know
I got to know
I want it now
Don’t you understand
When you love somebody
You must look into her eyes
When you love somebody
You have pride
You say you love me but you know it’s a lie
I have to trust you it’s a matter of pride
Hey baby
I just can’t take it
You make me mad
Tell me how you really feel
I want to know bad
When you love somebody
You must look into her eyes
When you love somebody
You have pride
Call me baby, call me on the telephone
Tell me baby, tell me that you want me home
Give me a minute, I’ll be there right away
Tell me baby, are those the right words to say
I got to find out if this love is really real
Don’t kid me baby, I got to know how you feel
I want to wind up in the right place with you
I gotta find out if it’s for me you do what you do
You say you love me but you know it’s a lie
I have to trust you it’s a matter of pride
When you love somebody
You must look into her eyes
It’s a matter of pride
Love somebodyEmbed
