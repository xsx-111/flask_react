Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman LyricsIt was a normal date with my girlfriend Sue
Blond hair, blue eyes, and five-foot-two
The night was cold, the stars were bright
From over her shoulder came a strange light
We parked the car down at Three-Mile Point
The top was down, we were really going
I heard her cry, the reactor flared
She grew and grew, I freaked and stared
Attack of the fifty-foot woman
Our love was at an end
All she did to get her kicks
Was step on all the men
I had to run just to save my skin
She scooped me up, I could not win
“My God,” I screamed, to my distress
Got a fifty foot woman in a five-foot dress
Attack of the fifty-foot woman
Our love was at an end
All she did to get her kicks
Was step on all the men
Attack of the fifty-foot woman
Our love was at an end
All she did to get her kicks
Was step on all the men
Look out here she comes
The biggest pair on earth
So scared I gotta go with her
The National Guard couldn’t shoot her down
Before she left she really trashed our town
She left me there, though I tried and tried
A fifty foot woman’s never satisfied
Attack of the fifty-foot woman
Our love was at an end
All she did to get her kicks
Was step on all the menEmbed
