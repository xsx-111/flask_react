Power Tools LyricsPower to lie, power to buy
I got my edges sharp
I'm gonna find a mark
Nobody better ask me why
I only know I'm gonna try

Power tools
I can't lose
In my head
Power!
It's all part of the plan, of the ambitious man
I'll do whatever I can, just so you'll understand
First I'll even up the score
Then, I'll leave them wanting more

Power tools
I can't lose
In my head
Power!
Standing by the window seems so real to me
Buy yourself some power to make in the street
Some people buy powder, some people buy booze
Some people use a chainsaw. Which tool is right for you?
Power tools
I can't lose
In my head
Power!
Change the storyline, just to schedule my time
I got things to use, gonna cut me a groove
Making it high and wide, planning on brand new style

Power tools
I can't lose
In my head
Power!Embed
