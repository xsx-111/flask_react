Amnesia LyricsIt seems we stood and talked
Like this before
Why can't I remember
Did we share something more
I must have loved you
Once upon a time
Amnesia has come
And clouded my mind
Was there a fire burning
Or were there tears
Did I ever whisper
Words of love in your ear
I can't go on
Not knowing my own name
I only have
This curse of love to blame
What have I done to deserve this
Can't find my love if I can?t find myself
I'm imprisoned by amnesia
And I can't break the spell
The love of days gone past
Is haunting me
Your face looks so familiar
Who can you be
This is the price
That I have to pay
That's why I cry
Cry out for yesterday
What have I done to deserve this
Can't find my love if I can't find myself
I?m imprisoned by amnesia
And I can?t break the spell
It seems we stood and talked
Like this before
Why can't I remember
Did we share something more
I must have loved you
Once upon a time
Amnesia has come
And clouded my mind
What have I done to deserve this
Can't find my love if I can't find myself
I'm imprisoned by amnesia
And I can't break the spellEmbed
