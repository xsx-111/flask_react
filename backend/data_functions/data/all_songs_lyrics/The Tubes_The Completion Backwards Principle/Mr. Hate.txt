Mr. Hate Lyrics
I must admit, I was a bit confused
I saw my picture in the mornin' news
You say my sister's dead; my mom is, too
You said I killed 'em, but it's just not true
Nothin's real; nothin's certain
But when I read your words, it just starts hurtin'

Everybody's tryin' to convict me
For taking Benzedrine and LSD
But that's all ancient history
And it's just between God and me
I hate rock 'n' roll, don't smoke pot
Maybe a drunk, but a user I'm not!

This is a warning from my own hands
Never corner a frightened man!
I might kill somebody tryin' to escape-
You better listen to Mr. Hate!

I can't believe the things my school friends said
Sometimes I think I wish that they were dead
I get so mad that I just see red
Then something blows apart inside my head
It's all erroneous information-
I've gotta make a little clarification
This is a warning from my own hands
Never corner a frightened man!
I might kill somebody tryin' to escape-
You better listen to Mr. Hate!


"I'm not gonna wash your dishes, anymore...
I'm not gonna fry your burgers! I don't need it
You never understood me, anyway
You'll never catch me...I won't give up...
YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!"

This is a warning from my own hands
Never corner a frightened man!
I might kill somebody tryin' to escape-
You better listen to Mr. Hate!

You better listen to Mr. Hate!
You better listen to Mr. Hate!
You better listen to Mr. Hate!
You better listen to Mr. Hate!Embed
