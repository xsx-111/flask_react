Living in Another World Lyrics
Better parted
I see people crying
Truth gets harder
There's no sense in lying
Help me find a way from this maze
I can't help myself

When I see tenderness before you left (forget)
That even breaking up was never meant (forget)
But only angels look before they tread (forget)
Living in another world to you
Living in another world to you
Living in another world to you

Better parted
I see people hiding
Speech gets harder
There's no sense in writing
Help me find a way from this maze
I can't help myself

When I see tenderness before you left (forget)
That even breaking up was never meant (forget)
But only angels look before they tread (forget)
Living in another world to you
Living in another world to you
Living in another world to you

Help me find a way from this maze
I'm living in another world to you
And I can't help myself

Did I see tenderness where you saw Hell? (forget)
Did I see angels in the hand I held? (forget)
God only knows what kind of tale you'd tell (forget)
Living in another world to you
Living in another world to you
Living in another world to you1Embed
