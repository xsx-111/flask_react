April 5th Lyrics
Here she comes
Silent in her sound
Here she comes
Fresh upon the ground
Come gentle spring
Come at winter's end
Gone is the pallor from a promise that's nature's gift

Waiting for the colour of spring
Let me breathe
Let me breathe
The colour of spring

Here she comes
Laughter in her kiss
Here she comes
Shame upon her lips
Come wanton spring
Come for birth you live
Youth takes its bow before the summer the seasons bring

Waiting for the colour of spring
Let me, let me
Let me breathe
Let me breathe
Let me breathe you
Let me breathe
Let me breathe you
Let me breathe
Let me breathe you
Let me breathe you
Let me breathe you
Let me breathe, let me, let me
Let me breathe you
Let me, let me
Let me breathe youEmbed
