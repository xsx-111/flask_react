Happiness Is Easy Lyrics
Makes you feel much older
Sublime the blind parade
It wrecks me how they justify their acts
Of war, they assemble, they pray

Take good care of what the priests say
'After death it's so much fun'
Little sheep, don't let your feet stray

Happiness is easy
(Joy be written on the Earth)
(And the sky above)
(Jesus, star that shines so bright)
(Gather us in love)

Guilt upon their shoulders
How well the cause evades
Infecting your religions, claiming pacts
It's easy to shoulder the blame

Happiness is easy
(Little ships of Galilee)
Happiness is easy
(Standing on the sea)
Happiness is easy
(Jesus tried to love us all)
Happiness is easy
(Be a friend to me)
Try to teach my children
To recognise excuse before it acts
From love and conviction to pray

Take good care of what the priests say:
"After death it's so much fun"
Little sheep, don't let your feet stray

Happiness is easy
(Little ships of Galilee)
(Standing on the sea)
(Jesus tried to love us all)
(Be a friend to me)
(Little ships of Galilee)
(Standing on the sea)
(Jesus tried to love us all)
(Be a friend to me)
(Joy be written upon the Earth)
(And the sky above)
(Jesus, star that shines so bright)
(Gather us in love)
(Gather us in love)1Embed
