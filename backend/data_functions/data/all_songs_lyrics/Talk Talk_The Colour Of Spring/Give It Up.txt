Give It Up Lyrics
From the place that I stand
To the land that is openly free
Watching rivers run black
By the trees that are vacant to greed

Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance and the joke's just started
Gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up
Or tell me why I'm so wrong, where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out?

How can I learn
If I don't understand what I see
If I'm giving this mess
Take a walk through a nightmare so real

Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance and the joke's just started
Gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up
Tell me why I'm so wrong, where does luck come from
When you've never been without?

Give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up
Gotta give it up
Tell me why I'm so wrong, where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out?
Or tell me why I'm so wrong, where does luck come from
When you've never been without?

You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do thatEmbed
