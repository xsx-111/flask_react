New Angels of Promise Lyrics
New Angels of Promise
We despair
We are the dead dreams
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes

Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time

New Angels of Promise
We despise
Don't fall apart now
We are the silent ones
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the tabular lovers
We listen to the storm
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time

New Angels of Promise
We despair
We are the dead dreams
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes

Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd
It's always time
It's always time
It's always time
It's always timeEmbed
