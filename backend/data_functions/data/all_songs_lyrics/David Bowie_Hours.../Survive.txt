Survive Lyrics
Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you, I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

Give me wings, give me space
Give me money for a change of face
These noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said time is on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive
Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love you

I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll surviveEmbed
