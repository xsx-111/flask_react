No One Calls LyricsNobody calls
Fall into pieces
Don't be afraid
Life isn't easy
Sunshine to rain
Counting the windows
But nobody calls
Nobody calls
Sunshine to rain
Smile for the camera
But nobody phones
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Not at all
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Not at all
Not at all2Embed
