Never Get Enough Lyrics
I heard a song today on the tip of your tongue
And when I hear you play that particular song
I go and you stay
As I lay wide awake thinkin', "What the hell have I done?"
Enchanted by the way you dance at the kick of my drum
I'll go and you stay
There must be another way

No, I'll never get enough of you
With your love non-stop, it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
'Cause I'll never get enough of you
With your love non-stop, it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, you

Gave you the runaround
Baby, what the hell did I do?
Oh, I'm bewildered by the sound
Only if it's comin' from you
Okay, you paid
I've been unsatisfied lately when I think about us
I've swallowed so much pride to win a little bit of your trust
You go and I'll stay
There must be a better way
No, I'll never get enough of you
With your love non-stop, it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
'Cause I'll never get enough of you
With your love non-stop, it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through

And the way you got me on the way up
I can't see down
It's unreal now, it's unreal now
I can't see down
And the way you got me on the way up
I can't see down
It's unreal now, it's unreal now
I can't see down

'Cause I'll never get enough of you
With your love non-stop, it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
No, I'll never get enough of you
With your love non-stop, it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through, through2Embed
