Midnight Lyrics
Mm, a long and lonely journey
To my hideaway
And I know they'll try to turn me
With the things that they say
But no one knows where I'll go
When I walk away
So come now, hurry, hurry
Don't miss this train
Open up and let me get to you
Take you to another side
Come to my world (After midnight)
Mm, we're getting lost in another time
Your hand in mine
In my own world
On my own time
Maybe that's why

(I don't mind)
People think I'm crazy, lately I'm
(I'll be fine)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
(Oh, oh, oh)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
(Oh, oh, oh)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
Oh, if you could see what I've seen
You would dare to dream
Honey, if you care to join me
Come meet the team
Oh, and you all could be my army
There's no other way
So come now, hurry, hurry
Don't miss this train

(I don't mind)
People think I'm crazy, lately I'm
(I'll be fine)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
(Oh, oh, oh)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
(Oh, oh, oh)
You'll never know
The places I go
When I'm alone

Mm, if only for a moment
Only for a while, mm
'Cause I've been lost to the unknown
Hope to be alright
Oh, oh
(I don't mind)
People think I'm crazy, lately I'm
(I'll be fine)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight (Oh)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
(I don't mind)
People think I'm crazy, lately I'm
(I'll be fine)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight (Oh)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
You'll never know
The places I go
When I'm alone4Embed
