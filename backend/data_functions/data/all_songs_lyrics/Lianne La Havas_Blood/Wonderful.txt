Wonderful Lyrics
Did the world get a little bit colder?
No wiser, just a little bit older
So slow we were bound to fall over, oh (Hm, hm)
Did the heart grow a little bit harder?
Too much, too late, too far, too gone
(Hm, hm, hm, hm)

But wasn't it kind of wonderful?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful?

You can trip, flick a switch negative
Break the circuit between us
But electricity lingers
In our fingers
Oh, you can burn every fuse and refuse
Turn your positive minus
Electricity lingers
In our fingers

From here, there's nothing but horizon
Near dawn, I'm searching for the sunrise
Remember when you put the stars into my eyes? Oh
Wasn't it kind of wonderful?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful?

You can trip, flick a switch negative
Break the circuit between us
But electricity lingers
In our fingers
Oh, you can burn every fuse and refuse
Turn your positive minus
Electricity lingers
In our fingers

Oh, wasn't it kind of wonderful?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful?
Oh, wasn't it kind of wonderful?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby?
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful? Oh5Embed
