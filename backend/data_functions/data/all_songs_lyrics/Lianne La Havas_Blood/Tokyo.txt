Tokyo Lyrics
I am neon
Cold neon
Not a mystery
All I've ever known is
How to be alone
It comes naturally

Oh baby, can I hold you?
Such a cold, cold night
I thought I wouldn't need to
I've got my neon lights
I'm longing just to feel you
To know that it's alright
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm out of sight
I'm out of my mind
Alone in Tokyo
You're out of my reach
Wrong place, wrong time
Alone in Tokyo

Here I go again
To and fro again
Overnight delivery
Grew a thicker skin
Now it's wearing thin
You can see right into me, oh
Oh baby, can I hold you?
It's a cold, cold night
I thought I wouldn't need to
I've got my neon lights
If only just to feel you
To know that it's alright
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm out of sight
I'm out of my mind
Alone in Tokyo
You're out of my reach
Wrong place, wrong time
Alone in Tokyo
I'm out of sight
Going out of my mind
Alone in Tokyo
You're out of my reach
Wrong place, wrong time
Alone in Tokyo

Oh, oh, oh
(I'm out of sight, I'm out of my mind)
Oh, oh
(You're out of my reach, wrong place, wrong time)4Embed
