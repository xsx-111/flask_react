Grow Lyrics
I resisted the charms of evil's arms
As she stood by my bedside speaking in tongues
And the lovers who cried won't be denied
As they fight for their right to grow, to grow

Please don't turn us down
Don't turn us down
(Turn, turn, turn, turn)

Turn up the love
Turn up and watch us sing
As we grow
The future we don't know, know
Unless we do it together, together

I requested to know what I did wrong
'Cause I sure didn't mean to string you along
But the blood in my body and my heartbeat, it said
'Is to feel a crime, a crime?'

Please don't turn us down
Won't be turned down
(Turn, turn, turn, turn)
Turn up the love
Turn up and watch us sing
As we grow
The future we don't know, know
Unless we're together, together
Turn up the love
Turn up and watch us sing
As we grow
The future we don't know, know
Unless we do it together, together

Turn up for this love
Got nothing to hide if you're getting that feeling
Turn up for this love
Take a piece of the sky if you understand
Turn up for this love
Everybody can see that you're getting that feeling
Turn up for this love
Turn turn turn turn!

Turn up the love
Turn up and watch us sing
As we grow
The future we don't know, know
Unless we're together, together
Turn up and love
Turn up and watch it sing
As we grow
The future we don't know, know
Unless we're together, together3Embed
