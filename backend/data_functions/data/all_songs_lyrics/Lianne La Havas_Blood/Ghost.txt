Ghost Lyrics
Whenever I called you
I couldn't say
It was only yesterday
But yesterday's so far away
What's the ETA?
Don't tell me you need me
I am estranged
And I'm over-aged
The trouble it may be
There's still a part of me
That has to know
What you have to say

On and on we go
Always with the ghosts of us in tow
Stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
'Round and 'round we go
Oh, 'round and 'round again
Looking for a life beyond the end
Lost somewhere between a foe and friend
'Round and 'round again

I should have told you
Yes, I'm to blame
Oh, I took the blame
Turned it into this serenade
Oh, the mess I've made
And I should have warned you
What was in store
But I was so so sure
I wasn't haunted anymore
Not forevermore
On and on we go
Always with the ghosts of us in tow
Stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
'Round and 'round we go
Oh, 'round and 'round again
Looking for a life beyond the end
Lost somewhere between a foe and friend
'Round and 'round again

On and on we go
Always with the ghosts of us in tow
Stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
'Round and 'round we go
'Round and 'round we go5Embed
