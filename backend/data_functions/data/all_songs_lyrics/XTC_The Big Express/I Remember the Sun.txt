I Remember the Sun LyricsHot as golden sand in fields
We whiled away the hours
I'm thinking of the days we had
Enormous super powers
Yes, I'm sleeping, my mind's on the blink
I thought a page, like it's written in ink
When I remember distant days
I remember many things
But most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Squinting at the sun through eyes
Screwed up by a fireball
Tarmac on the road is soft
Chaff burns in a smoke wall
Yes, I'm weeping, a teardrop attack
I give emotion at the drop of a hat
When I remember days at school
I remember many things
But most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Sun that worked on overtime
Fueled our bodies, kindled fire in our minds
Burning scars soon disappear
Like heat that hangs like water on the road
But most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
Most of all, I remember the sun
I remember the sun, I rememberEmbed
