Red Brick Dream Lyrics
Red brick dream, windows scream
As the rusting North Star shines above
And drops its iron beams
Crashing down upon the roofs of Swindon Town

I heard the engine's dying breath
Castles and kings all starved to death
I dropped the Coronation cup
Please don't wake them up from red brick dream

Red brick dream, buttons gleam
By the light of the furnace pouring
Molten memories
Splashing down upon the roofs of Swindon Town

The men of muscle piston rods
Who forged the horses of the Gods
They made the town a set of chains
Sleeping it remains in red brick dreamEmbed
