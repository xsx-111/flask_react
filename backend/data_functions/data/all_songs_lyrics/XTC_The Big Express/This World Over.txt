This World Over LyricsAh well, that's this world over
Ah well, next one begins
Will you smile like any mother
As you bathe your brand new twins?
Will you sing about the missiles
As you dry odd numbered limbs?

Ah well, that's this world over
Ah well, next one begins
Ah well, that's this world over
You sadly grin
Will you tell them about that far off and mythical land
About their leader with the famous face?
Will you tell them that the reason nothing ever grows
In the garden anymore
Because he wanted to win the craziest race
That's this world over
Will you smile like any father
With your children on a Sunday hike?
When you get to a sea of rubble
And they ask “What was London like?”
You tell them:

Will you tell them about that far off and mythical land
And how a child to the virgin came?
Will you tell them that the reason why we murdered
Everything upon the surface of the world
So we can stand right up and say we did it in his name?
That's this world over
Or so it seems
That's this world over
The end of dreams
That's this world over, over, over and outEmbed
