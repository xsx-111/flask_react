Free Alterations LyricsOh yeah, oh yeah! Yeah, yeah!
Woo, woo, woo, woo yeah
There's gonna be free alterations
Oh yeah, oh yeah
There's gonna be free alterations
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Let me suit you in a suit of love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
If it's too long (if it's too long)
We must shrink it (we can shrink it)
If it's too small (if it's too small)
We will stretch it out (we can stretch it out)
So let me suit you in a suit of love (in a suit of love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Somebody's dead daughter, somebody's dead baby son
Stop shootin' over there
All my people, stand up and be free
We need to care
'Cause it's certain now, you need free alterations
We don't want you to see
It's gonna be free alterations
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Somebody's dead daughter, somebody's dead baby son
Stop shootin' over there
If it's too large, we can shrink it
Too small, we can stretch it
If it's too large, we can shrink it
Too small, we can stretch it
Let me suit you in a suit of love
Somebody's dead daughter, somebody's dead baby son
(Someone!) Stop shootin' over there
Somebody's dead daughter, somebody's dead baby son
You need free alterations
(Oh yeah) It's gonna be free alterations
Oh-oh-oh yeah, oh yeah
(Free alterations)
You don't wanna tell a mayday the engineered way
(Free alterations) Genetically advocated
(Free alterations) Unlike Danny Depressed, who was overdressed
Yet whose life was a mess, was a mess
Coining  he on a Sunday gonna be the best
For the rest of the day
All my people, stand up and be free (you need free alterations)
Somebody's dead daughter, somebody's dead baby son
(There's gonna be free alterations, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Don't you know that?
There's gonna be free alterations, oh yeah, oh yeah
Let me suit you in a suit of love, oh yeah, suit of love...Embed
