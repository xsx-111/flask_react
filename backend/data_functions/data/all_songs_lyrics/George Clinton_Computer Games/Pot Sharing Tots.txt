Pot Sharing Tots Lyrics(Baby sounds)
If we were just babies
Sharing a cradle
I'd share a suck on my thumb with you
We wouldn't freak out, like the grown-ups do
If I were one, and you were two
I would do a striptease for you
If we were just tots, sharing a pot
I'd share a do(?) of my do with you
You'd be pink, and I'd be blue
If I should get wet, you'd get wet, too
If I shared my space with you
(Baby sounds)
You in your carriage
Me in my buggy
Strolling down the avenue
One day when they(?) shop(?) for tiny tots
I suck my pacifier in a little sandbox
While you suck your thumb there, too
Til they're through
(Baby sounds)
I would crawl before you walk
You would walk before I'd run
And I'd run away with you
(Baby sounds)Embed
