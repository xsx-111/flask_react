One Fun At A Time LyricsI guess you might say I like to play
One on one with you
If you want to play just say
One on One with me
Listen to what I say
(Woo hoo hoo)
Clap your hands
Come along
One fun at a time
That's all I'm saying
One fun at a time
That's all I'm playing
There all so many funny thangs to do
I'll be around
As long as fun is
One fun at a time
That's all I'm saying
One fun at a time
That's all I'm playing
There all so many funny thangs to do
I'll be around
As long as fun is
You -ewwwwwwwwww(yeah,yeah)
Everyday girl
Everyday girl
Any day now
You can find me
Laughing with a smile
Get behind me
If you're looking down
Or wear a silly frown
My life ain't been the same since we played together
One fun at a time
That's all I'm playing
One fun at a time
That's all I'm saying
There all so many funny thangs to do
In tinkle town
Let's play together
Clap your hands !
If you want to play
Please stay
One on one with me too gurl!
(There are so many funny things to do
I'll be around)(yaaahoooooo!)
(If you're looking down
Or wear a silly frown
Play together)
Any day now
You will find me
Laughing with a smile
Get behind me
When you're looking down
Or wear a silly frown
My life ain't been the same since we been together
ONE FUN AT A TIME!
Clap yo' hands!
When you're looking down
Or wear a silly frown
Any day now
You will find me laughing with a smile
Get behind me
When you're looking down
Or wear a silly frown
My life ain't been the same since we've been together
One fun at a time
That's all we're here for
One fun at a time
It gives us full of joy
There are so many funny thangs to do
Let's play around(round and round)
Let's play together
One Fun at a time

One fun at a time
That's all in singing
There are so many funny things to do
Let's play around
