Oh we keep turnin ya on, keep turnin ya on

Hey hey, OWWWWWWWWWW!
A 1430, WNJL, on radio

Don't touch that radio {*3X*}
Don't touch that knoooob-AH!!
W-B-L-S
Don't touch that radio {*2X*}
Don't touch that knoooob-AH!!

Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive you nuts
Don't touch that radio {*2X*}
Don't touch that knoooob-AH!!

Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive you nuts
Don't touch that radio {*2X*}
Don't touch that knoooob-AH!!

They drive you up the wall
We drive you on the flo'
They drive you up the wall
We drive you on the flo'
Don't touch that radio {*3X*}
Don't touch that dialllllllll!

Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive you nuts
They drive you up the wall
We drive you on the flo'
They drive you up the wall
We drive you on the flo'
Don't touch that radio {*3X*}
Don't touch that knoooob! {*3X*}
Hah hah hahhh
Living radio, where sounds are seen
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Ooooh, sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
Certain things rearrange
And the world, puts on, a new face
Oooh-oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh-oha-ohh-ohh-ohh

Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive you nuts
Don't touch that radio {*2X*}
Don't touch that knoooob-AH!!
They drive you up the wall (don't touch that knob)
We drive you on the flo'
They drive you up the wall (don't touch that knob)
We drive you on the flo'
They drive you up the wall (don't touch the knob)
We'll drive you on the flo'
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
92, J-D-U, we keep turnin you on, keep turnin you on
We, keep you turnin you on

Here's my chance, to disc my way...
Out of my constrictions
Uh-huh, AHH-HAH~!
Feet don't fail me now
Can I get it on the good foot, GOOD GOD!
More bounce, to the ounce
Get on the danceflo' baby, heyyy!
Give it up, more bounce, to the ounce

Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive you nuts
We gonna drive you nuts {*2X*}

Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive you nuts
Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive y'all nuts
W-E-F-U-N-K, we FUNK
Where we get on your good note
Baby love, my baby love!
I miss you, oooh long to kiss you love!
Baby baby baby!
You need...
Unless you wanna get on your knees, throw down {*4X*}

They drive you up the wall
We drive you on the flo'
That radio
Ah don't touch that radio {*2X*}
Ah don't touch that KNOB!!!
Don't touch them knobs

Like Planet Rock, we just don't stop
We're gonna drive you nuts
Ah don't touch that radio
Don't, touch that knob (oops)
SHUT UP~!

Do doo doo doo doo, DOG!!1Embed
