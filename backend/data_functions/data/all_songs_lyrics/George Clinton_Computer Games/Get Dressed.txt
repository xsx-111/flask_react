Get Dressed LyricsWhooo-wee! Yee-hah~!
We're the opening act
We can't come back
You gets no more
We gets no encore

GET DRESSED! Time to go
Don't wanna close the show
Close the do', I'm dressin!
I'm dressin! Undress
Gimme the flo'
I got somethin to show
Close your eyes, he's undressin!
We're the opening act
We can't come back
You gets no more
We gets no encore
High {?} through the door but I can't undress
{*knock knock knock*}
What the hell's going on in here?
You're under arrest, get dressed
Say what?
It's time to put the show on the road
(Time to put the show on the road!)
I'm dressin!
Well alright now
Meanwhile we find our opening act
Back in the dressing room
Discussing their room on the show when someone says
GET DRESSED! I want y'all
And then the drummer says uhh
A good show, starts in the dressing room
And work its way to the stage
Will someone give this young lady a backstage pass
While I work my way to the stage?
GET DRESSED! Time to go
Gotta start doin the show
Close the do' I'M DRESSIN!
Yeah I'm dressed to get down
Are y'all gonna throw down tonight?!
Yeah, well alright then!
We got to get the show on the road
It's time to get the show on the road
We're the opening act
We can't come back
You gets no more
We gets no encore
Got to get it while you can get it
Ay well alright y'all
GET DRESSED! Are y'all ready to throw down?
What goes around funks around
We're the opening act
We can't come back
You gets no more
We gets no encore... GET DRESSED!
A good show starts in the dressing room y'all
And work its way to the stage
Show me the stage, HOWWW!
And as sure as land don't shrink and money don't grow
You gets no mo', you gets no enco'
GET DRESSED!
