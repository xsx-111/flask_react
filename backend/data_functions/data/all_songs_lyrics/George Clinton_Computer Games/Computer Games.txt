Computer Games LyricsGame of sound
Hello, i'm the computer game Dracula
I like to suck necks
I am out in my brain because i can now insane
And i'm up to my jugular with derays
But i'm a winner
I'm motherfunkenstein, and my son is crazy
I didn't teach him to suck no necks
Rockets and bombs blasting at my feet
Of course i can keep a beat
I'm your funky dancing computer game
And of course, i'm insane
May i invade your space?
How much money will you spend?
Do you ever really lend?
