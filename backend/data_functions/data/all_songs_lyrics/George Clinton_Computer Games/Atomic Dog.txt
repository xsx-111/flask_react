Atomic Dog Lyrics
Yeah, this is a story of a famous dog
For the dog that chases its tail will be dizzy
These are clapping dogs, rhythmic dogs
Harmonic dogs, house dogs, street dogs
Dog of the world unite - dancin' dogs
Yeah, countin' dogs, funky dogs
Nasty dogs (Dog)
Atomic dog
Atomic dog

Life on all fours
When you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah

(Life on all fours)
Un-tied dog in a telematic society
(When you're out there walking the streets)
Ain't your average huckleberry hound
(May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya)
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Darn the dog in me
Life on all fours
When you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya
Roof
Roof
Roof

Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
(Dog, dog, dog)
Do the dogcatcher
Baby, do the dogcatcher, oh
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Just walkin' the dog!
Oh, atomic dog

Futuristic bow-wow
Leader of the pack
Wild dog

Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Dog in me, dog is in me
Talking dogs, dog's in me
Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do you wanna do the dogcatcher?
Well, baby, why don't you do it again for me
Dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher

House-trained dogs
Wild dogs
Say it again
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?7Embed
