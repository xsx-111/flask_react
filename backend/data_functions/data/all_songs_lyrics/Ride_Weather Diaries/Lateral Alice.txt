Lateral Alice LyricsI had a dream that we went walking
David Foster Wallace and I
In great detail we were talking
The Pale King smiled as he kissed the sky
Waiting for the storm to pass
Waiting around with Lateral Alice
Waking up in another town
This is what I remember
I had a dream we were surfing
Robert Anton Wilson and I
Off some California beach
Clearing the decks
After getting hight
Waiting for the storm to pass
Standing around picking holes in the grass
Waking up in another town
This is what I remember
Waiting for the storm to pass
Waiting around with idle eyes
Waking up in another town
This is what I remember
Someone said "Smile" and I turned around
He pulled the trigger and I hit the ground
Waking up in another town
This is what I rememberEmbed
