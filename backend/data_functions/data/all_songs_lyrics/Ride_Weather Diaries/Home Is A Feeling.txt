Home Is A Feeling LyricsHome is a feeling, warm like the sun
Inside everyone needs a safe place to run
Run to the morning, faster than the sun
Someone is there waiting, yes, she's the one
Washed by the warm tide, dried by the sunrise
It's time to open your eyes to a feeling, feeling
To a feeling
Home in the morning, first light of dawn
I love that feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling
Feeling
