Lannoy Point LyricsIf seeing is believing
Believing is not seeing
All these feelings
I can't repair
Your way of seeing
All melts into air
A Face of reason equals treason
A treason against all reason
All this dealing
I can't repair
My way of being
All melts into air
I'm wiser for the time
I row against the tide
I drop onto my knees
All turned back a century
We'll be wiser when we fall
Like the dinosaurs before
When we've swept ourselves away
A better sense can start again
A better sense can start again
A better sense can start again
I'm wiser for the time
I roll against the tide
I drop to my knees
All to that good century
We'll be wiser when we fall
Like the dinosaurs before
When we've swept ourselves away
A better sense can start again
(Believing my feelings)
A better sense can start again
(Believing all my feelings)
A better sense can start again
(Believing all my feelings)
A better sense can start again
(Believing all my feelings)
A better sense can start again
A better sense can start again3Embed
