Weather Diaries Lyrics
So it rained that day
The day I gave it all away
And I never thought it would
When the morning looked so good

It seems you never know
Which direction life will blow
You never know what someone's thinking
Until they're just about to go

I'm unsettled by the weather
It's getting stranger
Should it be this good right now?
Are we in some kind of danger?
Is this atmosphere just me-
Or is the sky too blue?
It's too perfect
Something's got to give
I'm going under, Where are you?

And it rained today
Conspiracy or one more anomaly?
When I was younger it was simple
We didn't need to question everything
It seems you never know
Which direction life will blow
You never know what someone's thinking
Until they're just about to go

I'm unsettled by the weather
It's getting stranger
Should it be this good right now?
Are we in some kind of danger?
Is this atmosphere just me?
Or is the sky too blue?
It's too perfect
Something's got to give
I'm going under
Where are you?
