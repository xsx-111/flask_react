White Sands LyricsThe breath between twenty years
That same breath tonight
We'll always betray ourselves
Always hold back time
The breath between better days
We came the long way round
Awakening to be ourselves
We died at least once to save our ground
Always forever change
I wish some things could stay the same
I've been thinking of back in time
I never knew what was mine-
Illusions, Illusions
The waves are rocking the winds to rest
Lost in our landscapes
When we're at our best
Breathe in and inspire me
Make these our finest hours
Time waits for no man
What's left behind is oursEmbed
