Rocket Silver Symphony LyricsSun is up and the day goes right for me
I'm moving up in a way that's rightfully
Ringing out yeah, your day calls out to me
I'm moving up, can't contain the light I see
All around me the air sings infinity
Chin is up and the scene is on to me
Coffee cup and I'm sailing out to sea
I'm moving up in a way that seems to be
Fired from my mind
Like a silver symphony
Out of my mind, rocket silver symphony
All around me the air sings a melody
Chin is up, so the scene belongs to me
Something's up in a way that is rightfully
Rocket silver, so clean and clear to see
Here it come's like a silver symphony
Fired from my mind
Like a silver symphony
Out of my mind, rocket silver symphony
Fired from my mind
Like a silver symphonyEmbed
