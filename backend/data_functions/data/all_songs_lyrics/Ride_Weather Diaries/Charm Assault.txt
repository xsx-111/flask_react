Charm Assault Lyrics
Focused raw reptilian ambition
From the dark side where it's all a game
As the pieces move into position
Did you feel a flicker in your brain?

Charm assault
Get out of my brain
You can't leave but
The truth will always remain
Your charm assault
Has scarred the world
It looks so ugly
As your lies begin to unfurl

Acid sweating hunchback apparition
Privilege abused at every turn
Serious as a heart attack he's standing
He sets fire to your world and lets it burn

Charm assault
Get out of my brain
You can't leave but
The truth will always remain
Your charm assault
Has scarred the world
It looks so ugly
As your lies begin to unfurl
Charm assault
Get out of my brain
You can't leave but
The truth will always remain
Your charm assault
Has scarred the world
It looks so ugly
As your lies begin to unfurl

Charm assault
Get out of my brain
You can't leave but
The truth will always remain
Your charm assault
Has scarred the world
It looks so ugly
As your lies begin to unfurlEmbed
