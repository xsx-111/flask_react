All I Want Lyrics
There is a ill wind blowing
Maybe you feel it too
Strange people are on the rise
One day they're gonna come for you
(All I want)
(All I want is)
(All I want)
(All I want is)
While you were sleeping on it
Your future was torn from under you
It's not a pretty picture
This is 1932

(All I want is)
(All I want is)
All I want is to leave this time (All I want is)
Believe me (All I want is)
All I want is to leave this time
I can't feel how you want me to feel
I can't know what you want me to know
All I want is, all I want is
I can't be what you want me to be
I can't go where you want me to go
All I want is, all I want is
(All I want is)
All I want is to leave this time (All I want is)
Believe me (All I want is)
All I want is to leave this time (All I want is)
All I want is to leave this time (All I want is)
Believe me (All I want)
All I want is to leave this time
I can't feel how you want me to feel
I can't know what you want me to know
All I want is, all I want is
I can't be what you want me to be
I can't go where you want me to go
All I want is, all I want isEmbed
