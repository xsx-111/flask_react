Cali LyricsAnother Summer is on the way, Cali
Another lover, the only one, Cali
Formed you, I found you, pulled you, too far to catch a wave
Saw you, kissed you on the beach
And I was saved
You look good with blue sky behind
Silhouetted in the bright sunshine
Burned onto my retina screen
The greatest thing I've ever seen
Another Summer passed like a day, Cali
Speeding, spaced and tangled up in you, Cali
Suddenly suntanned like cinnamon
She weaves the waves, Cali
I'm spellbound, stoned and dethroned
And feeling brave
You look good with blue sky behind
Silhouetted in the bright sunshine
Burned onto my retina screen
The greatest thing I've ever seen
Blue ocean, white water views
Walking back from the beach with you
4th street steps and my life was made
Sometimes I wish that we had stayed
Another Summer is on the way, Cali
Another lover, the only one, Cali
Formed you, I found you, pulled you, too far to catch a wave
Saw you, kissed you on the beach
And I was saved
C-A-L-I, Summer is goneEmbed
