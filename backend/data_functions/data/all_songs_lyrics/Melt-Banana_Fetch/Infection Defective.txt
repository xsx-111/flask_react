Infection Defective Lyrics
Me infect
It's the edge of the time
Me infect
It's the edge of the time
Define the tone

Me insist
To see last one of the signs
Me insist
To see last one of the signs
I hear the sounds

Five defects
On sale next to the fool
Five defects
I've got nothing to buy
Enough to live

It can't be a chain
It can leak a name
Black-out
Twisting the sin
I'm in a maze
Fall-back
It can't be a shame
It can't be a pride
White-out
Hiding the key
Cat's in the cage
Get back
Easy codes missplaced
Instead
Death-rate displeased
Enclosed
My alarm's down
Then fail-closed

It can't be a chain
It can leak a name
Black-out
Twisting the sin
I'm in a maze
Fall-back
It can't be a shame
It can't be a pride
White-out
Hiding the key
Cat's in the cage
Get backEmbed
