Lie Lied Lies Lyrics
It's a lie like a sweet
Eat it up like a pig
He's in peace
He likes to be like a king
It's a lie, it's so sweet
Like a pit he's in there
It's a grave, it's a grave
He likes to hide in a cage

Easy task
He wants to act like a god
Easy fakes
He made up sold out still
Lack of brain, he can't think like a slag
Twenty hands kill his lies shouting
"Vanish!"
Easy naps
He can take like a dead
Easy words
He can speak nothing much
Lack of books
He can pick no line left
Twenty eyes kill his lies shouting
"punish!"
It's a lie like a sweet
He eats up for his bugs
He's a lie
He eats lies to grow up
Say
I can try like a fictive play
So what?
He can play in the wonder land
So what's next?
Next lie to eat
So what's next key
To press to shut down?

It's a lie like a sweet
Eat it up like a pig
He's in peace
He likes to be like a king
It's a lie, it's so sweet
He eats up for his bugs
He's a lie
He eats lies to grow up
Say, I can fake in my fictive play
So what?
He can play in the wonder land
So what's next? Next lie to eat
So what's next key to press
To delete him now?
Press to lie
So I can make my cheap game
