Then Red Eyed Lyrics
No switchback
No switchback
It's a broken failed interlock
No step out
No step out
I pick up my third interlock
No switchback
No switchback
It's a broken failed interlock
No break out, no way out
I look up straight crows to see
A stated line, a static wave
Feedbacks cause clash as I see
Scattering gift looks like trash
Why do I keep it still
Clearly wasting, voiceless
Cureless, It's a tiny risk
Chill out, it's near
I take it back
Look out, it's here
I take it down
I call up the fragments
Killed and dead
I rebuild the meaningless lonely bloodEmbed
