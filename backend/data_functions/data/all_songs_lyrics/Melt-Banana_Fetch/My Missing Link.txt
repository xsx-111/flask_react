My Missing Link Lyrics
Fill up the sky, fill up the land
Thousands playbacks repeat again
Trick on the past
Clock on the wall counts no time lag
Happened to me
It's just like unknown cipher
From a plotter
Squeezed tight and fallen apart
I pick up your endless tape to find
A lead
I rewind it back again
I call and chase the misplaced friend
In the missing link
To recall the shape thrown out
Somewhere in the link

I kill off the slags
And fill up my brain
Fifty footprints follow me
Stuck into rain
Prick in my hand shows me
Next trap shining black
Where to find that peaceful factor?
Like a flower
Just dead and faded out
I pick up your ending tape
To make a wish
I turn it back again
I call to save the misplaced friend
In the missing link
To recall the shape thrown out
In the compressed chain
I see just a bit of seeds
I swear just a bit of sleep
I doubt
It's all in my sweet nightmares
I found some face not mine

Fill up the sky, fill up the land
Thousands playbacks repeat again
Kill off the slags, fill up my brain
Fifty footprints follow me
Where to find the fatal coil
For my cipher, for my shelter
Won't you let me out
Let me be sure that you find me
Out in the missing link

I call and chase the misplaced friend
In the missing link
To recall the shape thrown out
In the compressed chain
I see just a bit of seeds
I swear just a bit of sleep
I doubt
It's all in my sweet nightmares
I heard some voice, that's mineEmbed
