Zero Lyrics
Every piece of small lies I pick up
Every piece of cracked facts I eat up
Barely I escape from the fairy tale closed down
Looking up the sphere I'm still not sure
Shiny shadow shows me signals
I wipe them out
Tiny window's slowly
Shut down
I break it out
There's no means to
Get back
What's been changed
And lost inside of me
I heard something
A cracking sound in my head

Every piece of the sweet past I bury
Every piece of the flat words I sell out
Simply I stare at a tricky scene set up for me
Nothing could be sure but I stand here still
Lazy shadow shows me samples
I wipe them out
Hazy channels show me shackles
I break them out
It's too late
There's no way to find out what I need to see
Outside of me
I heard something
A breaking sound in my mind
Every piece of small lies I pick up
Every piece of cracked facts
I throw out
Every piece of land
It's in twilight
It is my land
It is my realEmbed
