Lefty Dog (Run, Caper, Run) Lyrics
Tricky face
Risky trap
Tiny lead
Step on a lucky head
Killer
Kiss the dead cancelled
Check out
Pick a canned kickup
Don't you let the sin hit back

I don't care, I say goodbye
I see a lefty dog
Running through the bloody land
It can't stop or die
I see a lefty dog aiming to no quiet land
No logic to heel

I may be wrong, I may be dead
But I still hear the buzz in my ears
Tickets
Sent with no exit
Watch out
It's got no set back
Don't you let the kid hit back
I don't care, I say goodbye
I see a lefty dog
Running through the bloody land
It can't stop or die
I see a lefty dog aiming to no quiet land
No logic to heel

I may be wrong, I may be dead
But I still hear the buzz in my hands
I don't wanna see double faced craps
I don't wanna hear fussy tamed noise
I don't wanna care fickle lame brats
I'm sick of chasing for my tail
Here's my fury hate, fury hate
Which one to sell on net?
Stingy hail, stingy hail
Which one to sell on net?
I'm still here, I'm still lost
On this fucking dear planet

So I send out my lefty dog
Running through the bloody land
It can't stop or die
I see a lefty dog aiming to no quiet land
No logic to heel
I may be wrong, I may be dead
But I still hear the buzz in my earsEmbed
