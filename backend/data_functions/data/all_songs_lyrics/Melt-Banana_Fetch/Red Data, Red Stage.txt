Red Data, Red Stage Lyrics
No less than slave
It's stuffy in here
Quite less than fate
I need some fair air

Set heaven in panic
No matter what he says
Hidden like a doubt
No sign can be seen
Lost and found dead
My radar's still on tracking

A shady's kid mislead
And plainly killed shut up
His genotype's lost in the rain
His lonely blood fell out
How far it's been carried on?
Last switch here on my side
So far it's been moving on
No one ever let me see

Nothing same
It's sticky out there
No less than tame
I call up the fair fear
So I say "outcast"
Seal off a casket
I don't miscast
I pick up the last one
Now what the hell shut up
What the hell kick out
Lonely blood's lost in the box
It suddenly wakes up
How long it's been carried on?
Next key's here in the guage
So far it's still moving on
My nerve's been set on edge
With a lie scale
Full of blockage
I need the next grade

Set hell in peace
No matter what he says
It's just like a heaven now
No prayer wanna get out
Then lost and found is closed down
But I'm still checking the sign out
Gimme a break!
Won't you just let me off now?

Lonely blood fell out
It calls me so loud
My genotype's lost in the sky
Fly away, fly away!
How far it's been carried on?
Last switch's dead in your hand
How come no one tell me why?
My nerve's been set on edge
With a lie scale
Full of blockage
I'm about to leaveEmbed
