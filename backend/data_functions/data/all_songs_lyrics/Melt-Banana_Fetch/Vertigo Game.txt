Vertigo Game Lyrics
Can you see bats chase stars
Next to a starship lost
And then the mermaid's dead
Next to one legged peace
It's all right? Maybe not?
Head messed up!
I see my eyes are flying
Head messed up!
I feel my brain is melting
Head messed up!
We are all surely spinning around

Now I see
A trap inside
Next to a flag in blood
And then
Facts no truth
Next to smile in fear
It's all lie? Maybe yes?
Head messed up!
I see my hands are weeping
Head messed up!
I bet my mind is fading
Head messed up!
We are all surely spinning around
I've forgotten how to stop
Head messed up!
I keep my eyes open wise
Head messed up!
I keep my ears clear and nice
Head messed up!
We are all painfully spinning around
Head mixed up!
Confused as things go by

Even the moon splits out
Even the stars fall down
Even the sun melts down
We laugh out!
Keep spinning around
To see what is right
Keep spinning around
As if your head's burst
Just keep spinning around
Let's keep spinning
With the time
At the end
We'll all be dead, someday!Embed
