The Hive Lyrics
I spy like a keen bean
A blood-red shade's ahead
My eyes spark in the dead phase
About diffuse so fast
Just break it down
Just break it down
Don't freak me out
Nowhere to be safe
I'm here, searching for germs
What a waste
What a shame
Don't make me craze
I shut down the door

No other name
I can pick up
For what I need
For what I need
No other place
I can set up to be
It could be the last case
Other blame I just kill you off
For what I hate
For what I hate
No matter what happens here
I can only escape with my hive
I cry like a stray cat
A flat shade stands up dead
My spy plane in the dark
It's about to catch a rat
I break it down, I break it down
To dig the faith
Nowhere to hide out
I'm here waiting for moon
Let me siege
Let me breathe
Don't make me craze
I shoot down the shade

No other name
I can dig out for what I see, for what I see
No other blade
I can pick out to thrash
It could be the last one
Other fame
I just kill off for what I hate, for what I hate
No matter what happens here
I just keep my hive safe
To save you
I fly like I backflip
My sight is so twisted
I fly like I'm spellbound
My hive in my pocket
I spy like a pale sting
No blood left to spit
My eyes flash like a black light
To shine on your evil scar
Just break it down
Just break it down
Don't freak me out
Nowhere to be sure
I'm here searching for moon
Let me siege
And let me breathe
Don't make me craze
I shoot down the end1Embed
