So Many Millions LyricsI cannot get over legitimately
The reality of my surroundings
Do not point to the sky
So why should I even try
(When there's nuthin' out there to be)
I cannot grow up to be the president
Where only drug dealers own Mercedes Benz
If you tell me otherwise
It will only look like lies
(When there's nothing out there for me)
Your education will do me no good
In my neighborhood
All that I see is scrapin' and scrounging
In my neighborhood
If you can show me how to do good
In my neighborhood
Maybe I discontinue my lounging in my neighborhood
So many millions feel this strong
All these people can't be wrong
You should surely know this was a long time coming
You should know the effects were numbing
You should know that yesterday
You may have had a chance to stop things before they start
You may have had a chance but it's too late because it's fallen apart
Sex education will do me no good
In my neighborhood
Everybody's hoin' for something and it's understood
In my neighborhood
That drug education can do me no good
In my neighborhood
Well then maybe I'll discontinue my loungin' in my neighborhood
So many millions feel this strong
All these people can't be wrong
You beat me, mistreat me and you beat me
Rip my heart out please and then you get angry when I die
It's a pile of shit in your sugar shack
And I'm gonna step on in when I'm visiting
So I can drag it more all across the floor
It's a pile of shit in the White House
And I'm gonna step on in when I'm visiting
So I can drag it more all across the flagEmbed
