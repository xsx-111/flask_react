Babyhead LyricsI don't wanna see any flying fish during this one.  If I do, you ain't gettin' enough sex.  And that's the bottom line, suckers.  So remember that, fellas.  'Cause I know who you are.  And you know who you are
Nougat baby floatin' down
On a cotton candy cloud
Floating by a chocolate baby
Thinkin' bout his creamy center
Don't bite alright don't bite alright
The nougat gets a taste
Ask if it's appropriate
Slippin' through wetness
Nougat wants that goo
Chocolate's paralyzed and can't move
The goo just rushin'
Enjoy chocolate sweet treat
Chocolate needs relief
Chocolate lost his goo you see
Chocolate jumps on the nougat
Tastin' and bitin' on the pillows
Still not satisfied
Enjoy chocolate sweet treat
Lick it quick, lick it slick
Wigglin' insanity
Givin' up the goo to the bones groove
Givin' up the goo to the bones groove
Chocolate...lick...suck...
Sorry, mom, I just had to do it!Embed
