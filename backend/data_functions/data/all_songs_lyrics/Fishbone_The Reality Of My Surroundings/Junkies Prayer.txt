Junkies Prayer LyricsMy pusher who art in the krack house
Hallowed be thy bitches and hoe's
As for I am sprung my rock will be done
In my crib as well as in public
Give us this day our daily krack
As we smoke ourselves into a manic frenzy
Forgive us for we have no control or self-respect
Grim Reaper has cashed my life savings check
Thy rocketh and they pipeth restoreth me 4 I and I fear no man
Yea though I walk through the valleys of Harlem, Bronx, Manhattan
Even Nickerson Gardens, Compton, Watts, Ingelwood
Fucked up in Beverly Hills and all those other places
I fear no evil, hence forth my rock m-m-m-m-motivateth me !
I shall move my ass thine myself given you cash
Lick your butt and balls for thine have the power to bend over
On my knees with my hands against the wall, for I'll be a sucker
Forever and ever and ever hey man
The rest are the reality of its surroundingsEmbed
