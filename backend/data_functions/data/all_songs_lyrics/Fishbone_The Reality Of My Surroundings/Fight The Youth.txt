Fight The Youth LyricsWe will save you now...

And now another story of stolen faith and tragic glory
They claim to be your friends but all the while they taunt you with lies
They tell you what to think and how to face the world around you
You never question what you know inside is lax and untrue

But take a look around (look around)
We're not running anymore (anymore)
We're in the positive (yeah)
But we're ready for the war
For the war!

Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds
Ignite the truth
Restore sight to these blind
Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds, yeah
(And if they suffer it's no fault but their own)

And every time I see the hatred that engulfs these children
It makes me wonder if the quest for peace will one day subside
I'm not afraid to wage the hopeless battles I must fight
For I could never lose, I know my cause shines in the light
Take a look around (look around)
We're not hiding anymore (anymore)
Your weapon's cowardice (yeah)
And we won't take it anymore
Anymore!

Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds
Ignite the truth
Restore sight to these blind
Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds, yeah
(And if they suffer it's no fault but their own)


But take a look around (look around)
We're not running anymore (anymore)
We're in the positive (yeah)
But we're ready for the war
For the war!

Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds
Ignite the truth
Restore sight to these blind
Fight the youth
The youth with poisoned minds, yeah
(And if they suffer it's no fault but their own)
Hey!

And all the feelings of a generation fed with anger
Make all the choices for a future where all nightmares come true
I choose to fight for youth, to fight for truth, to fight for justice
I choose to heal the wounds of sacrifice made by the children
