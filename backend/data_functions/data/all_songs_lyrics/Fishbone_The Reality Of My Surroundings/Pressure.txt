Pressure LyricsFear is the curse and today's word is Pressure
Too long to count the worry and the strife
Speed Racer, takin' in that pressure
Pressure is the fear, Pressure is the tear
Twist that torcher, torch that Pressure burnin'
Verbal arm twisting, Pressure ear pinching
No remorse, no glory
I sit in the jail cell and I think about that Pressure
Thrive no jive, on this mess y'all
Female sittin' on my face, no Lord!
Pressure me, huh but nonetheless
This Pressure mess, Pressure mess is the best
Pressure is runnin', runnin' out of time
Boy u better git your ass home quick
You shorly lie when you get high
On this Pressure, Pressure kick
Pressure!? Pressure!
Pressure!
Pressure!
Pressure!
Pressure when I sit down!
Pressure when I git up!
When I sleep at night
Nightmares make me fight
Pressure whin uhm vexed
Pressure whin I c mie x
Prayin' 4 a breather, but whenz it comin' next?
Oh this world, oh this Pressure!
Pressure hardened on me there's no help yeh!
It's the pear, It's the fear...Pressure!
Cheatin' out the fat man!
Pressure joke's only for the Pressure folks...
Fat man, livin' in a skinny land
Pressure is runnin', runnin' out of time
Boy u better git your asshole stitched (a fabricated cover-up)
You surely lie when you get high
On this Pressure! Pressure kick!
When your hair's turnin' gray
Pressure tellin' you to take the gray away
Its' the fear of physical processes
It's the tear of scalp diggin' hair transplant bloodmessesEmbed
