Behavior Control Technician LyricsChildren runaway from the torturistic ways
Children still resist from the powers that persist
Will you shut up and sit still
I think you should obey
Having very few rights we cannot communicate
Train my brain to work the way you want me to
Don't question authority see
Be a little zombie that agrees with you
You are strapped with a double standard clamp
In a battle you won't win
And when it's over we're gonna dance your memory awayEmbed
