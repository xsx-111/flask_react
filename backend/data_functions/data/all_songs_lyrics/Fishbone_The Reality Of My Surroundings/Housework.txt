Housework LyricsI feel like I go to work everyday
But where I work I don't get paid
Work in school and learnin' the supposed rule
But in the street I make my own rules
Mama, she just wanted me to do my homework
But when I get home Mama left me a note
Do the housework
So when I'm done with my chores
I go outside and learn some more
Wash 'em clothes, sweep that roof
Cut that lawn, washing the dishes
So what are you trying to say?
Out in the street I got friends just like me
Pops is gone and mom's workin' 5 and 6 days a week
Me and my partners tryin' things just to see what it means
A drink here and a smoke there, what was dirty now is clean
Mama tryin' but she got to survive
So now I got to get a 9 to 5
Do the housework...
