Those Days Are Gone LyricsWhen you're alone
Can't find your way out of the maze
Life is ablaze
And you're right there in the flames
Is this pain?
Are we sane?
And who has established these claims?
While we all try to refrain
I had a dream once there was a wall inside my head
You all had put it there
We lived a life once we felt together as one
And now those days are gone
We fled that place there was a beast kept there
He was mighty and strong and his name was jealousy
We all laughed we felt we would rise above with our unity, our unity
But later on that day he came back to say
That I have a friend and his name is envy
We toppled many lives, we're like a mighty hurricane
We bring destruction, and we cause descension
I had a dream once there was a wall inside my head
I had a dream once there was a cost upon my soul
And now those days are gone...Embed
