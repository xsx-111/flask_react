Summer Freeze Lyrics
Once I was alive
It took me by surprise
Then I realized
I was paralyzed

Summer's freezing me
I was told to stay awake
Until I found my saving grace in you
Summer's freezing me
In the light I tried to hide
From the cold I gave to you
Summer's freezing me
Now I'm gone, so nothing is lost
And we can wait
Till summer freezes you

Once I was alive
It took me by surprise
Then I realized
I was paralyzed

Summer's freezing here
Please come back next year
Summer's freezing here
Please come back next yearEmbed
