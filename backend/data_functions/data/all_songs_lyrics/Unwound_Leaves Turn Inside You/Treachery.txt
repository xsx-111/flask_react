Treachery Lyrics
Richard will mend his coat today and wear it to his play
He might forget the lines he read, but this is what he said
"My meaningless is shining on the lies I told today."

T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
Just breathe
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
Just breathe
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
Just breathe
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery

Now you want to know why his coat was ripped to shreds?
His girl found an address book and this is what it said
"Meet me at the entrance, and don't forget your play"

T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
Just breathe
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
Just breathe
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
Just breathe
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-treachery
Just breathe
The trouble with the truth is double
The trouble with the truth is double
The trouble with the truth is double
The trouble with the truth is double
The trouble with the truth is double
The trouble with the truth is double
The trouble with the truth is double
The trouble with the truth is doubleEmbed
