Scarlette Lyrics
Scarlette, did you know that you're the one?
The one that raised the fucking sun
I missed the train to wait for you
Stood all night to make things right

Cross my heart and hope to die
Don't recall the reason why

Scarlette, please don't talk that way
I can't stand to hear you say:
"Think of me when I'm not here
Don't doubt me if I'm insincere.'

Cross my heart and hope to die
Don't recall the reason why

My head don't hurt no more
After you slammed it in the door
You nearly murdered me!
Left me lying on the floor
You know that I know that you know that I know
You know that I know that you know that I know

This is a lunatic project
This is a lunatic project

Scarlette, was it meaningless?
Scarlette, was I prey?
Did you like the way I looked at you
When you walked away?

Cross my heart and hope to die
Don't recall the reason why1Embed
