Look a Ghost Lyrics
You knew her from before
She hid behind the door
You never noticed that
The hallways turned to black
The stairway is a chance
To fall and break your hands
She just might push you down
So never turn around

She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for you
She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for you

Watch out, she's fading fast
You just might lose your chance
Find out by accident
The reason she is back
So now you're scared of her
Cause she might not return
Mistook you for someone
One look and now she's gone
She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for you
She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for you

Look, a ghost came through the door
From a thousand years before
Look, a ghost came through the door
From a thousand years before
Look, a ghost came through the door
From a thousand years before
Look, a ghost came through the door
From a thousand years before

She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for you
She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for you
She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for you
She never had a chance
She never had a chance
So now she's coming back for youEmbed
