Off This Century Lyrics

The future was invented
Back when you thought you were human
Now it's only getting better every day that we forget

Everything is a commercial
We advertise our memories
We leave our shit on silver platters
And then buy whatever is left
Empty life
Where you can be fine

It's every bastard for himself
The last century hasn't ended yet
Bring us the head of the king
The last century hasn't ended yet
It's every bastard for himself
The last century hasn't ended yet
Bring us the head of the king
The last century hasn't ended yet

The future was invented
And you might be the next
Life is like Monopoly
You are not old, you are obsolete
And you thought the last ten years was bad
