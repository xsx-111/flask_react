Terminus Lyrics
Break me, I'm not broke
Take me, I'm not took
Cake me, I'm not cooked
Fake me, I'm not fucked
Wake me, I'm awake
Shake me, I'm a jerk
Wash me, I'm a lake
Make me, I'm a crook

In light of my seven weeks of
Melting pleasure, melting pleasure

Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone

Kill me, I'm not dead
Will me, I'm not read
Drain me, I'm not bled
Brain me, not a head
Fill me, I'm a tank
Blame me, I'm a blank
Wash me, I'm so clean
Love me, I'm so mean
In light of my seven weeks of
Melting pleasure, melting pleasure

Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm a gun, six shots and I'll be gone
Hold me, I'm the one, tomorrow I'll be gone
