October All Over Lyrics
Only in October, now it's nearly over
Maybe in November if you can remember

When it rains, it feels like shame
Remind yourself after work
To find a new city to blame
Lock yourself in the house
Sometimes you'll laugh so hard you'll cry

Only in October, now it's nearly over
Maybe in November if you can remember

Broken teeth for months, it seems
Like you, like hell
Weekend comes and now you feel
Like your afterlife
Sometimes you'll laugh so hard you'll cry2Embed
