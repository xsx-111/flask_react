Demons Sing Love Songs Lyrics
When I left my island, I was wrong
Met a phantom, memorized a song
Nothing happens now that I belong

Love's a demon, love's a demon
Love's a demon, love
Love's a demon, love's a demon
Love's a demon, love

Sometimes I think I'm stranded in hotels
Hanging from the tallest tree in town

Love's a demon, love's a demon
Love's a demon, love
Love's a demon, love's a demon
Love's a demon, love

I'm the monster standing by your heart
A life-size figure ashamed to be alive

Love's a demon, love's a demon
Love's a demon, love
Love's a demon, love's a demon
Love's a demon, loveEmbed
