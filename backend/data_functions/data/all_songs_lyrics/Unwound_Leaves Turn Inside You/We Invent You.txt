We Invent You Lyrics
Save your grace (save)
I'm coming soon
Not now

I'm on your surface now
Nothing will be the same
Concentrate on this phrase (concentrate)
"Beyond this world, I live"
Say it to yourself now
Ignore the disclaimer (concentrate)
Collect your belongings
Follow me in reverse (concentrate)

Save your grace (save your grace)
I'm inventing you (I'm inventing you)
Savior's gaze (save your grace)
I'm going soon (I'm coming to)2Embed
