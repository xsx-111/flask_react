December Lyrics
I guess I had my chance
I'm told it was my obligation
At dusk, I held the ground
And prayed for morning to come quickly
That night I held your hand
Together we had bits and pieces
On that December night
You cried and cried and cried, but

We held our lives
By the whims that govern conversations
We held our lives
By the whims that govern conversations
Wait! Hold on!
I'm not finished... Fine!
Never again!
Will he ruin mine

December night
I'm told I had my obligations
December night
I tried and tried and tried, but
We held our lives
By the whims that govern conversations
We held our lives
By the whims that govern conversations
Wait! Hold on!
I'm not finished... Fine!
Never again!
Will he ruin mine
Wait! Hold on!
I'm not finished... Fine!
Never again!
Will he ruin mine

(When we were on we were on
When we were off we were way off)

We held our lives
By the whims that govern conversations
We held our lives
By the whims that govern conversations
We held our lives
By the whims that govern conversations
We held our lives
We held our lives1Embed
