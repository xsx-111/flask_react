Praying Man LyricsKick me while I'm down - why don't you?
Stick me in the ground - I'll rise again
I am a praying man, yea
I'm a praying man, oh
I'm a praying man
Sha la la la
Take me to your farm - why don't you?
Take me out in the morning, to your warm creek
Dip me in the water - baptize me
Will you dip me in the water? Will you baptize me?
I am a praying man, yea
I'm a praying man, yea yea
I'm a praying man
Sha la la laEmbed
