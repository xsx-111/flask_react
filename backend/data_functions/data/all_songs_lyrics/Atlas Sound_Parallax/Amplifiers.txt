Amplifiers LyricsOpen the amps up, let them breathe
You and me in the scene
Open the big camera box now
Bleed the lens (and oh how)
It reminds me of the kid
Always lit, always did
Exactly what I said
Even if I didn't know
Even if I didn't know
Even if I didn't know
Even if I didn't go
Even if I didn't go
Straight
Straight
Straight
Open the doors, let the light in
Let it blend winter wind
And if your winter wind chills me
Then we will know to bend it backwards
You say you know my friend
That one kid I mistook for my future
Would you know
Where to go, and where to find him?
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay...Embed
