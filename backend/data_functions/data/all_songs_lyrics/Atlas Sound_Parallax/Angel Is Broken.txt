Angel Is Broken LyricsThe messenger is old and grey
And when he sets up, Decay
And everything looks the same
Nothing is ever rearranged
Everywhere I look
My angel is broken
The older you get, you'll see
You'll be a lot like me
Arrangements are made complete
And now you are on your feet
Everywhere I look
My angel is brokenEmbed
