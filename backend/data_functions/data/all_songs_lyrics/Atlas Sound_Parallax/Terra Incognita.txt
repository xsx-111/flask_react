Terra Incognita LyricsI kept guards and caravans close to me
In case one day I'd need some company
I never looked out towards the wind
I never saw the families gathering around
Holy ghost
Tripled host, I saw
Carry me home
On the backs of beasts that drone
Holy sky
Opened up so wide
Carry me home
Scared me to the bone
Celestial crops carry me home
These ancient technologies strengthen my bones
I know a place called love
No one bothered me there, no I was all alone
Will you join me?
Could you possibly be
The one I sought?
The one I fought for?
A place I'd be
Able to see clearly
The beginning and end
I want to beginEmbed
