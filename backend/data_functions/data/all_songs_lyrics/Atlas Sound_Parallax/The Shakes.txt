The Shakes LyricsFound money and fame
But I found them really late
So in my mansion I'd sit
Waiting for it all to end
My material, my friends
My material, my friends
I made lots of friends
I made lots and lots of friends
And on me did they depend
And on me did they depend
See the horror on my face
I can finally leave this place
Over blue star moonbeam trace
I can't remember my address...Embed
