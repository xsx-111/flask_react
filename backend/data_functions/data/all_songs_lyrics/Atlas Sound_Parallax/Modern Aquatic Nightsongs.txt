Modern Aquatic Nightsongs LyricsIs your love worth the nausea it could bring?
Is your love worth those you left hurting?
Is your love like a thousand bells ringing?
Is your love bright like a shining golden ring?
Run to the one that holds you down
And feel your feet on the ground
And hope the ground opens up
And swallows you and your love
To the ground you will seek
Only love, only peace
Will it find you today?
Will it find a way?
Is your love like a sunset chandelier?
Is your love like a song only you hear?
Is your love tight - that old familiar fear
That your love might one day disappear
Run to the one that holds you down
And feel your feet on the ground
And hope the ground opens up
And swallows you and your love
Is it (does it feel) wrong is it (like a bridge) right
Does it (when your heart) makes your head
(When your heart is open)
And my heart is a cold cold cold cold
(I'm so cold I enter void
I've seen such weird light
Calling me towards the bring end bright cold
Bright so brittle cold cold cold...)1Embed
