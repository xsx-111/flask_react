Doldrums LyricsTaking in the doldrums
How could we foresee
Terrible addictions
Houses that were out of reach
For me, for me
Hey you got a story
Would you trade with mine?
Stubborn paths to glory
Always two inches behind
Behind
Hey there is a story
No one likes to tell
Yeah, it is the story
Of a little boy
Who went to hell
If you have no reason
To come here again
I may never see you
Remember your friend
Your friend1Embed
