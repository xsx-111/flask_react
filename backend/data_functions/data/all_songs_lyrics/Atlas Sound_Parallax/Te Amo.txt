Te Amo LyricsTe amo
Pretend you know the way out of the trap
And we will go to sleep
And we'll have the same dream
You can come around
When you're down
You're always down
Always down
When you're down
You're always down
You're always down
Te amo
I'll pretend you were the only one
And we will go to sleep
And we'll have such strange dreams
You can come around
When you're down
You're always down
You're always downEmbed
