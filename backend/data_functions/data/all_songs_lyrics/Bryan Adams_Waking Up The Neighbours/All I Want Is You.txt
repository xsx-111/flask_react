All I Want Is You LyricsI don't want diamonds, I don't want gold
Don't need no fashion baby, don't wanna be cool
Don't wanna hustle just to get thru
When it all comes down babe... Yeah!
All I want is you
Listen!
Don't wanna argue, don't wanna fight
Don't want no politics baby all thru the night
I told ya before - gonna tell ya once more
For the last time baby, open up your door
All I want is you, all I want is you
Not any girl will do
Not any old girl, Yeah!
All I want is you, Hey baby!
If ya don't need love ya gotta be nuts
The heaviest metal always rusts
Just you and me babe hangin' tough
It's gotta be, it's gotta be it's gotta be love or bust
I don't need a doctor, don't need a nurse
Don't need no prescription babe
Only make me feel worse
I don't need a license, don't need insurance
Don't need a ticket where we're goin' babe
You got my assurance, Yeah!
I told ya before - gonna tell ya once more
For the last time baby open up your doorEmbed
