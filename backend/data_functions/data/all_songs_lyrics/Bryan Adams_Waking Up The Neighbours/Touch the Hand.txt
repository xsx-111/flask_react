Touch the Hand LyricsStand up - if ya wanna fight
I'm tellin' all the women
Stand up for your rights
If ya wanna wear the trousers
You wanna act like a man
I'd love to trade ya places
Love to be your thang
I'd do all the shopping
Select your favourite suit
Press all the laundry
Polish all your boots
And if you brought me flowers
I'd meet you at the door
Have your dinner ready
Your slippers on the floor
And when day turns to night and you feel alright
And I turn out the lights
Touch the hand of the man who'll make ya woman
Touch the hand of the man who'll make it right
Touch the hand of the man who'll make ya woman
Cause when day turns to night and you feel alright
And I turn out the lights
Stand up - its alright
Love to play the woman
Love to play your wife
Light your favorite cigarette
Pour your favorite drink
Wear your best apron
Wash the dishes in the sink
Get your shaving lotion
Turn the shower on
Warm up your bathrobe
Keep my baby warm
Read ya bedtime stories
While you take a nap
Turn on the TV
Put out the light
But when day turns to night and you feel alright
And I turn out the lights...Embed
