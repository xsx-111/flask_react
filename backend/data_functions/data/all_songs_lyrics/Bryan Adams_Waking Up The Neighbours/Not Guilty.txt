Not Guilty LyricsWho are you to say that I am wrong?
Who are you to say I'm crazy?
Ain't a crime of passion comin' on strong
I'm only trying to treat ya like a lady
Yeah - And I can't Help myself baby
Do I have to prove my innocence?
Don't need a lawyer with a fat degree
'cause if lovin' you is against the law
You better lock me up and throw away the key - Yeah
I'm gonna take it to the jury
I'm gonna nail it to the wall
I'm gonna fight - I'm gonna prove it
So let the hammer fall - Yeah
I'm not guilty - Baby I'm not
I can't stop this feeling' I got
I'm not guilty - Cross my heart
Not my fault if I'm fallin' apart
'cause I'm alright Jack justa watchin' my back - Yeah
I'm not guilty - I'm not guilty
Won't serve no sentence - Won't do no time
Won't ya listen to my plea
Yeah the verdict is I'm doin' fine
'cause the love police are lookin' out for me
Oh I'm gonna get a witness
Oh I'm gonna write it on the wall
'cause it's a dirty old business
So let the hammer fall
I'm not guilty - Baby I'm not
I can't stop this feeling' I got
I'm not guilty - Cross my heart
Don't blame me if I'm fallin' apart
'cause I'm alright Jack justa watchin' my back - Yeah
I'm not guilty - Not me!
She'll break your heart - She'll take your mind
She'll steal your soul
She's everything - She's a schoolboy's dream
She's rock 'n' roll
She's a knockout combination
It's a sticky situation
Yeah - C'mon kid
Treat her like a lady - Oh!
I'm gonna take it to the jury
I'm gonna nail it to the wall
I'm gonna fight - I'm gonna prove it
So let the hammer fall - Yeah
I'm not guilty - Baby I'm not
I can't stop this feeling' I got
I'm not guilty - Cross my heart
Not my fault if I'm fallin' apart
'cause I'm alright Jack justa watchin' my back - Yeah
Yeah! - I'm not guilty
Hey babe I'm not guilty - No way
You know I'm not guilty - Not me baby
I'm not guilty for lovin' you
It's the way you do the things you doEmbed
