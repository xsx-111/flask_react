Is Your Mama Gonna Miss Ya? LyricsI might as well been blind
Thought I owned this world and all its time
Made up my mind not to love again
Live my life a single man
Lady luck she came my way
Turned my night into day
She went huff and blew my little house down
She went puff - Yeah she spun me around
She played rough - Yeah she took me to town
All I did was fool around
And my whole world came tumblin' down
Is your mama gonna miss ya now you're gone?
Is your mama gonna miss her little rollin' stone?
Is mama gonna cry now she's alone?
'Cause mama's little girl ain't goin' home!
Yeah - She's goin' with me
I couldn't be found - Couldn't be heard
You couldn't trap this free bird
I loved to fly - Should've heard me sing
You came along and flapped your wings
Had my eyes on the road foot on the floor
Tell me "Hey who's that knockin' at my door?"
She went huff and blew my little house down
She went puff - Yeah she spun me around
She played rough - Yeah she took me to town
All I did was fool around
And my whole world came crumblin' down
Is your mama gonna miss ya now you're gone?
Is your mama gonna miss her little rollin' stone?
Is mama gonna cry now she's alone?
'Cause mama's little girl ain't goin' home!
Yeah mama - She's goin' with me
C'mon huff a little baby
I want you to puff a little baby
Yeah lets blow this little house down
Yeah - I said stop and she said go
Looks so good I can't say no
Now we've gone and lost control
Oh yeah - Your mama gonna miss you baby
Oh, Yeah!
Now is your mama gonna miss ya now you're gone?
Mama gonna miss her little rollin' stone?
Is mama gonna cry now she's alone?
'cause mama's little girl ain't, she ain't goin' homeEmbed
