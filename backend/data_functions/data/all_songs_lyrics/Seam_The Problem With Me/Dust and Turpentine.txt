Dust and Turpentine LyricsI've got some clay birds for you
Take out the nightlight, take it out
Take it out on me, I don't mind
Who really cares, tell me, who really cares?
I know it's not you
Who told you that? I think they lied
Those things I brought her didn't work
I didn't think they would
And it broke the next day
It fell apart and she left me anyways
There's something I don't like about it
It's not dust and it's not turpentine
It's a curtain wall from you
It tells me what to do
Tells me what to do
Don't you tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to doEmbed
