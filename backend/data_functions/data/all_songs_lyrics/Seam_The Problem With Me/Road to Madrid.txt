Road to Madrid LyricsTake picture of me, I am sleeping
At the base of my neck, I've been aching
I've been taken away, I've been taken away
From everything that's me
From everything that's me
Take a picture of him, he's dying
His face in a fist, and he's facing lights
I took a pen out, put the cap back on
What will I write?
I've been taken away, I've been taken away
I've been taken away, I've been taken away
By a shark-skinned man with a raccoon tan
His skin peeling back, as we drove by
Into the dust of a city that was calling us...
"Hello"Embed
