The Wild Cat LyricsSomeone told me to speak
I shut my mouth and I looked around
For someone else to gloat
For someone to make a sound
It wouldn't pass through my lips
That didn't pass for a smile
Maybe I lack some style
Giving these words to laugh
I carry that on my back like something I don't need
Into a town so brown, it's making me see
I've got nothing to hide from you
I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing to hide from you
I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing to hide from you
I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing to hide from you
I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing to hide from you
I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing for youEmbed
