Autopilot LyricsI feel old here
I'm turning hard inside
And my lips sound strange
Or is it just that I've gone insane?
I feel old here
Like a watch that ticks
My throat's shrinking
Somebody's laughing
And the song sounds wrong
Or is it just my ears playing tricks on me?
And these heads look strange
And they're out of time
I'd better go outside
Just walk away1Embed
