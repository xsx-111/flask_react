Bunch LyricsI am pointed, like a sea snake
But I don't mind, and I won't forget
I don't mind, and I won't forget
From the chips in my nails, I feel fuzzy and hot like a sun
Swallowed whole in a storm far away in the sky behind you
I am with you
I can see you
I am with you
I could kill you
From the chips in my nails, I feel fuzzy and hot like a sun
Swallowed whole in a storm far away in the sky behind you
I am with you
I am with you
I am with you
I am with youEmbed
