Sweet Pea LyricsI turn red, I turn back in defeat
Take an arrowhead through my neck
And it’s time to turn away
To where I walk, where I stand
Where it cuts, where it binds
Where it stings, where I hide
Don’t tell me you really know, I know
Don’t tell me you really care, I know
Until the sky clears
And the saints fall from the sky
Dropping like rocks
And I
I know I know I know I know I know I knowEmbed
