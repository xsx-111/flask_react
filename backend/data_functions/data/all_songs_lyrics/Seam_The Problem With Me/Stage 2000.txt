Stage 2000 LyricsStep into my shoes for a while
But you might find that they don't fit
Or that you can't walk in a straight line
That's most of it, that's the hardest part of it
Take me over in a plane
Take me someplace I've never been to
Take me over in a dream
Show me something I haven't seen
Step into my room for a while
It's the same old floors and the same old walls
Somebody's waiting with a map of all the stars
Every long player and every stack of pictures
Everything for you and from me
Take me over in a plane
Take me someplace I've never been to
Take me over in a dream
Show me something I haven't seenEmbed
