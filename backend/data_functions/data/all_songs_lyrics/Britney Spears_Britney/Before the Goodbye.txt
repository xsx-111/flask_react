Before the Goodbye Lyrics
Laying here in your arms, and you hold me tight, tight
Trying not to watch the clock tick, ticking as the time goes by
And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishing I could make you stay, stay with me for a while

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear
Love, I will always be around

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

Kinda hard for me to let you know
Still don't let my feelings show how much I will miss in you
All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak, without you, baby, I'm not me

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear
Love, I will always be around
You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye3Embed
