Anticipating Lyrics
Top down, on the strip
Looking in the mirror and I'm checking out my lipstick
Girlfriends up in the back
We're out for an all night
Feeling so crazy cool
Vibe so right, don't know if they're ready for it
Valet, baby, here's the keys
We're about to step inside

Skip on the drinks, head to the floor
Making my way, that's for sure
My body's taken over, and I want some more
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah

I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you (Rock with you)
You're feeling this right, let's do this tonight

Step up, baby, don't be shy
I know you're feeling me, 'cause you're giving me the eye
And I don't wanna play around
Baby, watch me move
Check this, let's make a scene
Don't leave me waiting longer
Why you wanna make me long for ya?
Move it, baby, over here
So we can set it off
We can get down to the DJ's sound
Feeling so good, baby, all around
Feeling kind of naughty, come and get me now
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah

I'll be anticipating (Anticipating)
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you
You're feeling this right
Let's do this tonight
I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing (They're playing)
I wanna rock with you (Rock with you)
You're feeling this right
Let's do this tonight

Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Oh, oh, yeah
I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you
You're feeling this right
Let's do this tonight (Gonna feel you, baby)
I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you
You're feeling this right
Let's do this tonight

Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need4Embed
