Let Me Be Lyrics
You try to read me, you try to figure out
You try to breathe me, but you can't blow me out
You try to feel me, but I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling, you won't have to pick me up

Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around, but I won't turn around

Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust in my instincts, trust that I know what's right
These are the reasons that keep you up at night (At night)
Tell me, "Go slow, this is my flow"
'Cause you don't know, know what I know
Let me tell you how it feels
Baby, it's time that you've seen me for real
Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around (won't turn around)
But I won't turn around

Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust that I know, this is my show
Letting you know, gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know, this is my show
Letting you know, gotta go the way I go

Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy (It ain't my philosophy)
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities (No insecurities)
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
(Think that I can't stand on my own)
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be?2Embed
