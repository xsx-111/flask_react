When I Found You Lyrics
I believe we all have one true love
Somewhere in this world, I do
When it seemed all my dreams were falling through
That's when I found you
I believe for every heart that whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere shining through
It was sink or swim when the tide came in
I found myself when I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah

I believe (I believe) for every door (Every door)
That's closing
For every heartbreak there's hope for something new
From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise
It still flickered in your eyes
I found myself when I found you

I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah
How life unfolds, no one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone, all alone
More than you could ever know
You show deeper love, sweeter love, when I found you

I found the closest thing to Heaven
I found the deepest love I knew
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah2Embed
