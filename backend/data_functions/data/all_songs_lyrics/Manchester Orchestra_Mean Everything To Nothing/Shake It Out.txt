Shake It Out Lyrics
Shake it out, shake it out
God, I need another and another
And another and another, I can feel it now
I felt the Lord in my father's house
And I can see, I can see
Standing, we were seventeen, make it clean
Are you the living ghost of what I need?
Are you gonna get the best of me?
We will see

'Cause I'm done being done
With the funerals, at least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?

Shake it out, shake it out
Tired of another and another
Wasn't really what I wanted
So we bled it out
Over the floor of my neighbor's house
And I could see, I could see
God, I've never seen a thing so complete
I am the living ghost of what you need
I am everything eternally, God, just speak
'Cause I'm done being done
With the funerals, at least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?
So speak to me

Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out
You gotta take it out, take it down
I gotta come around, I need it now more than I ever have
Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out
You gotta break it down, break it out
You've gotta come around, I feel it now more than I ever have

I felt the Lord begin
To peel off all my skin
And I felt the weight within
Reveal a bigger mess
That you can't fix

I swear, I swear I'll go
Lead me into my home
Don't stop, don't ever go
I swear you'll never know
You'll never know
Oh god, you gotta shake it out, shake it out
You gotta break it down, break it out1Embed
