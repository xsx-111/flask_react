In My Teeth Lyrics
I felt a black man in my teeth
What a way
Jesus is coming, he acts my age
And he always looks the same
I said a good seed was on your grave
Wasn't a mistake anyway
Well Jesus is coming, better act our age
And clean everything

And make it seem
Like we never really needed it anyway
Yeah, we never really needed it anyway, okay
Okay

John spoke a theory straight into my brain
Goddamn, did you mean to do that to me?
Well Jesus don't come 'round unless we pray
Each day for 500 days
And I don't know what you want anymore
No, I don't know what you want anymore

So we can see
That you never really needed it anyway
No, you never really needed it anyway
So we can see
That the bottom is going to bury us anyway
So I'm doing what I gotta to stay awake
Yeah, I'm doing what I gotta to stay awake, okay
What happens when I don't know what happens?
What happens when I don't know what happens?
So stop and go and stop and go till you can't go
Not anymore
So stop and go and stop and go till you can't go

Make it seem
Like we never really needed it anyway
Yeah, we never really needed it anyway
So we can see
That the bottom's going to bury us anyway
Yeah, you're doing what you gotta to stay awake
Yeah, I'm doing what I gotta to stay awake, okayEmbed
