100 Dollars Lyrics
Several women's magazines
Stacked up on top of a picture of me
When I tried to call no one answered

It's not even that I'm all angry
Just want to know why you would do this thing
You said there's an understanding

And I offered you a small dog in the kitchen
I just wanted you to feel at home

And that's why I am fine, I am fine, I am fine, I am fine
I just need 100 dollars
I am fine, I am fine, I am fine, I am fine
I just need 100 dollars
From you and you and you and you and you
Oo-hooEmbed
