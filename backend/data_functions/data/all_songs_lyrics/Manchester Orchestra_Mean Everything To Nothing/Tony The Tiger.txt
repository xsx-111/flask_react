Tony The Tiger Lyrics
I was alone
So I set a fire and I wasted it all on you
You were a sea I cannot remember
And I knew it'd be over soon
If I was a tree I know you couldn't take it
On a Sunday afternoon
And we were a bridge on top of gaudy water
With something left inside you

What is the price to be a bargain beggar
So lonely but always free
What did you mean when you said it's destructive
And you sank yourself right into me
I know you think you know
But you probably don't
And I know you think you know
But you probably don't know

Didn't think that you would actually do it
Didn't think that you would actually do it

And you slept the entire drive home
It was you my sister and I
And you slept the entire drive home
It was you my sister and I
Didn't think that you would actually do it
Didn't think that you would actually do it
Didn't think that you would actually do it
Didn't think that you would actually do it1Embed
