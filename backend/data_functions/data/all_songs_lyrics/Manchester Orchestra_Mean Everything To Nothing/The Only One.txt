The Only One Lyrics
I am the only one that thinks I'm going crazy
And I don't know what to do
And I am the only son of a pastor I know
Who does the things I do

But if it was you, I don't think that it would matter
Oh, and if it was true, then I just wouldn't matter

I was amazed at the color and shapes that you drew
A paper part for two
I am the only son of a bastard I know
That knows the bastard too

Because it was you, I called it a different story
But if I was you, I'd make this a simpler story

I bet you did what you did when you did it
To do it again by the time you were done with it
I bet you did what you did when you did
Just to tell every friend that you have that the Lord did it
I finally knew that I simply couldn't matter
You finally knew that you simply couldn't matter
I guess that it's true, you never knew
The passive power of the truth would cut me loose
If I could write another phrase, we might be better off this way
But there's no use
Oh, there's no use2Embed
