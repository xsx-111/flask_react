The River LyricsI fought the spirit with a sword in my side
Cheat, wanted a way out, crack my rib, wait to die
I think I know you the best when I sleep
I think I know everything
Me and my brothers, we have tongues sharp as knives
I found a way out, make a noise, close your eyes
I think I talk to you best when I sing
I sing about almost everything
Oh, God I need it
So let me sing again
Take me to the river
And let me see again
Oh my God
Let me see again
Oh my God
Let me see again
Let me see again
Grace taught a debtor
Daily I'm strained to be
God how I feel it
Fetter pride to your feet
I'm going to leave you the first chance I get
I'm going to leave you the first chance I get
I'm going to leave you the first chance I bet
I'm going to leave you the first chance I get
And oh God, I need it
Well I was wrong again
Take me to the river
And make me clean again
Oh my God
Make me clean again
Oh my God
Let me see againEmbed
