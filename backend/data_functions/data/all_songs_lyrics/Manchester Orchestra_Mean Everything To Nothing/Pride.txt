Pride Lyrics
Finally I felt the calming breeze
Stepping out to watch the final scene
After all it's you, my pride, and me
I can't speak whatever I can speak
You see

Now I found the way to meet the means
Faker face to make the kingdom clean
After all it's me, and the king, and the beast
Whatever whatever I can't speak
A thing

How can I explain my wounded feet?
Cut them off in second mark it seems
Cut me off before I start to see
But I can cry as long as my deceit
You see?
Me
See
Me
Me
Me
Sound, I'm a dead neck, what a habit, so I'll dig it up and bury it in
Ground, what a broke head, I think I'm dyin', I need another one to incubate the
Sound, what a broke head, what a habit, I need another and another one
The Ground, what a dead head, I think I'm dyin', I think I'm dyin' for another one
The Sound, what a broke neck, what a lion, I need another and another one
The Sound, what a cheap trick, what a habit, what a habit when I need it yeah
The Sound, what a dead neck, what a lion, I need another and another one
The Sound, what a cheap trick, what a habit, I think I'm dyin' for
The Sound, what a dead neck, what a habit, I think I'll dig up and bury it in
Ground, what a broke head, I think I'm dyin', I think I'm dyin'Embed
