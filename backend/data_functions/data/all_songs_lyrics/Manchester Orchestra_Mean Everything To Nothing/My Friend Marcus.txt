My Friend Marcus Lyrics
My friend Marcus, he sleeps in my basement
And his father touched more than spirit
Now he can hardly sleep, sleep

I don't give a good shit if you're lonesome
I think that you should go home son
Find a father and your meaning

Now I can see
You mean everything to nothing
Now I believe
You mean everything
Now I can see
You mean everything to nothing
Now I believe
You mean every-

My friend Marcus, he works on a train set
And I still can't move on my broke track
He's helping me find my meaning

And now I can see
You mean everything to nothing
Now I believe
You mean everything
Its funny how many don't know
How many of us don't have homes
OoooohEmbed
