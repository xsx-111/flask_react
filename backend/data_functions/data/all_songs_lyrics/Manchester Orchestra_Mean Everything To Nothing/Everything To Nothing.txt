Everything To Nothing Lyrics
Definitely not the things that I'm seeing
Did I think I'd see so instantly
I found a note in my grandfather's coat
When I read it out loud I got cold
He said "I'm not complaining
Yeah I was just saying
I'm a man, I'm a lost one you see
Come down with me to a place
We'll get clean and we'll meet with Him eventually"
You mean everything

I don't know much
But a crutch is a crutch
If it's holding you from moving on
I don't know what to do
Not anymore, not anymore
I don't know what to do
Not anymore, not anymore

And you, well you mean everything
You mean everything to nothing
You mean everything to nothing
You mean everything to nobody but me
You mean everything to nothing
You mean everything to nobody but meEmbed
