Jimmy He Whispers LyricsGod knows you're on my mind
You can't try to tell him otherwise
God knows it's only time
Before I break the chain in my eyes
The fear keeps you hiding at night
From the creatures playing ball outside
Well chances are slim that we are right
But I'd never think it any otherwise
So we'll find the answers in time
When the bodies pile up sky high
And I'll sail the ship towards the sky
But I'll end all alone on the other side
If you could pull that rope just a little higher
We would dangle alone like a firefly
So Jimmy I've heard the voice of God
And he whispered "Fear is logical"
And he said "It's magic, wonderful"
And he swears to him it's wonderful
And the lake you speak of is magical
So I skip stones on it practical
And I make sure that we're both wonderful
You're a brother and that's alright
You're a brother and that's alright
You're a brother and that's alright
We're brothers it makes it right
'Cause his blood is so red in spite
Of the way that our sharp teeth bite
Oh the way that our sharp teeth bite
In each other during the night
With the creatures that play outside
'Cause Jimmy I've heard the voice of God
And he whispered "Fear is logical"
And the words that we heard aren't repeatable
With a thought that could kill comprehendible
And we're brothers and that's alright
Yeah we're brothers and that's alright
Yeah we're brothers and that's alright
Yeah we're brothers until we die1Embed
