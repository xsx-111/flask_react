Blood Lyrics
Don't look now
You're becoming
Your parents

Pops loved the ladies an'
Mom kept the babies an'
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right

Sing it

Pops loved the ladies an'
Mom kept the babies an'
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Yo, I saw a dream float slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
Where jackals of every trade
Wear their boogie faces for motives
She's walking beneath the rain
We're connected by flesh extensors
I'm hopping through every puddle
My little walkers can enter
Now showers created viscous
And grippers slipping repeated and
Baby boy's in the puddle
And mother settles for panic and
Distance has been created
I'm reaching up from the storm grate
I'm sinking to where the CHUDs dwell
And screaming maternal saviour
She woke in domicile weeping to flash on little man huddled
The imprint of where paternal unit used to sleep uncomfortable
I stuttered with choppy image
Unraveling as she listened
Replaying to her the trouble funk waking me with a sentence
Mom, I saw a dream float slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
Where Teddy Ruxpin clutch daggers
In closet with monster motives
You couldn't stop water choking me
Hazard and faded magic
And I slipped beneath the city far below the big erratic where
Pops loved the ladies an'
Mom kept the babies an'
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Pops loved the ladies an'
Mom kept the babies an'
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right

When I say "he", I mean "I" (Thinly veiled)
When I say "you", I mean "we" (Will prevail)
When I say "she", I mean "God" (Give us strength)

Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right

I saw a dream float slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
Where emotion causes no motions
A metal door opens
On mom's smile, dad's style
The dance maneuvers of a little child
Look to the sidelines, for I shine upon my time
The vision declines through sharp wines in bloodlines
Upon the heathen who remains cold, though the sun shines
The other, speak not of it
The moon'll drag the ocean's tide
The wind'll blow and then my heart'll split
Back hunched, eyes low
Thorn mutilates her side slow
The darkest thoughts were using a rope
Where did the child go?
A kiss is floating through the air but never landing
Will you accept all these excuses in exchange for understanding?
I saw a dream float slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
Where our love resembles loathing
And the beast wear human clothing
And the thought of hope itself consists of suicidal fabric
I slip beyond myself into the realms of bad magic
Pops loved the ladies an'
Mom kept the babies an'
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Pops loved the ladies an'
Mom kept the babies an'
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do rightEmbed
