It's all good news now
Because we left the taps running for a hundred years
So drink into the drink, plastic cup drink
Drink with the purple, the people

Because we left the taps running for a hundred years
So drink into the drink, plastic cup drink
Drink with the purple, the people
The plastic eating people
Still connected to the moment it began16Embed
