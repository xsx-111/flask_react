To Binge Lyrics
Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as thunder comes a-rolling down
Someone to rely on as the lightning comes a-staring in again

I'll wait to be forgiven, maybe I never will
My star has left me to take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling, well, the cause of it's a lesson learned
"Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again," she saidâ€”it's true

Waiting in my room, and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance and I'm listening to the whispers
And oh, it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling
And you're falling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again

I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry but you're feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again
Cau-au-au-aught again
(Cau-au-au-aught again)
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy (Cau-au-au-aught again)
Rolling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again27Embed
