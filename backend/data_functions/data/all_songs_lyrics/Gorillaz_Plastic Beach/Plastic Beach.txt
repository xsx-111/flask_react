Plastic Beach Lyrics
To the dark, dark seas
Comes the only whale
Watching ships go by
It's the day we try

It doesn't know
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio

Did they haul you out
On a really hot day?
When the call got made
You had gone away
From us

It doesn't know
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio
Casio, Casio, Casio and green, green glow
Casio, Casio, Casio, green, green glow
Casio, Casio, Casio and green, green glow
Casio, Casio, Casio

It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio

Plastico, plastico, plastico where the green, green grows
Plastico, plastico, plastico
Plastico, plastico, plastico where the green, green grows
Plastico, plastico, plastico25Embed
