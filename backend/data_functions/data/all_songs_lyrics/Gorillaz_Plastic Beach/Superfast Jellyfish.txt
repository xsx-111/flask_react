Superfast Jellyfish Lyrics
This morning, you've got time for a hot home cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwaved minutes
Are you kidding?!

Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
(Look, it comes with a toy! I like that)
(I wanna number four, number six, and throw in a plastic donut)
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
Rappers of many bite sizes
(Man, are you freaking blind
That's a rock)
All mixed in the pot full
Momma's homemade from scratch, but (not quite)
Toasted over flames they be tasting (quite right)

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
"Don't waste time" with your net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go many know others but
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hour sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast
A whole line of breakfasts you've got time for

Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, whatever blue
The night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
"Don't waste time" with your net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go, many know others but
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hours sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh, that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast
Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, whatever blue
The night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
(Don't waste time)
Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
(The sea has gone silent)
(What!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish30Embed
