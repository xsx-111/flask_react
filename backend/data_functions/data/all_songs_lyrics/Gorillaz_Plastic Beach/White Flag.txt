White Flag Lyrics
Ayy, look, yo, no castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
And Mummy ain't said "Honey, I shrunk the kids" yet
I ain't Jesus, but I'm walking on water
There's no bombs here, there's no war, 'cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws, blud?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms it poured
And up the road, you'd never guess who I saw

Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A
Look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym (Yeah)
Honey, I'm home this is where I wanna live (Yeah)
Just found it like Nemo on the D-low
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though
On the other side of the fence, bye to the ends
Look, no feds, no stress, no rent
No superficial shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold
And the speech goes like, "Hi, little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby?"
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swagger on a hundred degrees, no eighty
Look, if heaven had a VIP
Uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea
But I don't know who they are
And I'm damn sure they don't know me, but I come in peace
Cool! White flag! White flag!
Uh-huh, no war! No guns! No corps!
Just life, just love, no hype, just fun
No ties, just me and my mind
Just me and my wife, but tell me if I'm dreamin'
'Cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
And I don't wanna be left sleepin'
From all the diseases that I breathe in
Look, respect the island, no stealin'
And don't bring religion here, no three kings
Integrated, and we ain't leavin'!
We come on a peace t'ing
White Flag? White Flag!10Embed
