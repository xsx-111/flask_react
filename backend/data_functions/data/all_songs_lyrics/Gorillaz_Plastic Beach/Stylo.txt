Stylo Lyrics
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the

Oh, Stylo (juice)
Go for blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (it's the giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles, it's a death throw)
Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)
If it's love, it's electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself (juice)
Out of depression, rise above
All recession, if I know your heart
Electric is the love
There's only one way (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Let it play a little while longer (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
It's got a way of passing through man and woman (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
In another world, in another world, in a universe, oh! (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Right now, here's what we've got to do

If it's love, it's electric (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
It'll be flowing on the streets (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Night after night (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard (Overload, overload, overload
Comin' on to the)
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout...
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burns firm and easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Right now!36Embed
