Some Kind of Nature Lyrics
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Some kind of metal
Made up from glue
Some kind of plastic
I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates
Until they grow old

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load
Well, me, I like plastics
And digital foils
To wrap up the sound
And protect the girls
From the spiritual poison
You spill at night
Like phony clothes but
I really like mine

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Come forth within us
Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
It's gonna come and find us
All we are is dust
Some kind of metal, some kind of metal
Made up from glue, made up from glue
Some kind of plastic, some kind of plastic
I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates
Until they grow old
Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Come forth within us
Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
It's gonna come and find us
All we are is dust13Embed
