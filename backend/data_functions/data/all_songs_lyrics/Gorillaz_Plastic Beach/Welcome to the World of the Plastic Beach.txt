Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach Lyrics
Gorillaz and the Boss Dogg
Planet of the apes

(Just like that) The revolution will be televised
(Just like that) An' the pollution from the ocean, now with devotion
(Just like that) Push peace and keep it in motion
(Just like that, just like that)
(Just like that) Kids, gather 'round, yeah, I need your focus
(Just like that) I know it seems like the world is so hopeless
(Just like that) It's like Wonderland
(Just like that, just like that)
(Just like that) Now fascinate me, picture and animate me, 'cause I'm rollin'
(Just like that) Deep holin', click clackin', crack-a-lackin', full packin' (Hey!), mo' stackin'
(Just like that) Actin' a fool when I teach
(Just like that) Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
(Just like that) Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
(Just like that) Mirror mirror on the wall, Boss Dogg, give it to 'em
(Just like that) Get involved, turn it up, speed it up
Slow it up, underground where (Just like that) the under us undercut
Shipped up, shipped out, swimmin' with the sharks put my gills up
(Just like that) Turn the wheels up real tough
(Just like that) Drinkin' lemonade in the shade
Getting blazed with a gang of pilgrims
(Just like that) Yeah, this my path
Belly floppin' lockin' while I'm rockin' in the bubble bath
(Just like that) And I'm just like math
Fozo's added up that get you more cash
(Just like that) So quick, so fast
All the kids say they love it when I make 'em laugh
(Just like that, yeah) Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
(Just like that) Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
(Just like that) Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
(Just like that) Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
