On Melancholy Hill Lyrics
Up on Melancholy Hill, there's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream
Where you can't get what you want, but you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine when you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarines, 'round the world we'll go
Does anybody know, love
If we're looking out on the day of another dream?
If you can't get what you want, then you come with me
Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits the manatee, love
Just looking out for the day when you're close to me
When you're close to me
When you're close to me130Embed
