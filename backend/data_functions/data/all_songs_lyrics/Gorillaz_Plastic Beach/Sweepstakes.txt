Sweepstakes Lyrics
Pay day, you're a winner...
Pay day, you're a winner
Keep cool form a line
Scared money, broke money
Bold money, mo' money
So sunny, cloud breaker
Sound maker, wave runner
Wild wonder, funky drummer
You can get it how you wanna
There's math and there's dealers and players and me
They say that they winners, okay, well, let's see
You pay or you play
The rules of the trade
The math of the days
The times and the age
Whatcha want? How you like?
Aim high, man, why not?
Sun, moon, and starryarrs
Each and all of y'alls
Mathematics and dealers and players and me
They say that they winners, okay, well, let's see...

Sweepstakes! Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! You're a winner

Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! (Sweepstakes!) You're a winner (You're a winner)

"Who's the winner?" said the dealer
Every player: "Yeah, me!"
