Man With A Gun LyricsA pretty girl, a pretty girl
Can walk anywhere
All doors open for her
Like a breath of fresh air
Her beauty, it precedes her
Wrapped in her beauty
Everywhere, she is welcome
First class on the plane
Closed door of the club
All faces turn, all faces turn
And they come alive
With a desire to protect her
Nothing can interfere
With a dream of dreams so near
And when she caught my eye
We were those for whom
The rules do not apply
Chorus:
Pretty girl young man old man
Man with a gun
Two people in love (Two people in love)
The rules do not apply
To people in love
Pretty girl young man old man
Man with a gun
Two people in love (Two people in love)
The rules do not apply
To people in love
On a wire, a high wire
She likes to balance on a knife
She says on the wire
That is living, oh
You can forget the rest
On the wire, that is living
Each step must be in place
So don't look down
One false move is all it takes
We'd rather risk it all;
Roll the dice and let them fall
They say we can't survive
But a life like this keeps me alive
Doesn't matter where we are
I still say the rules do not apply
