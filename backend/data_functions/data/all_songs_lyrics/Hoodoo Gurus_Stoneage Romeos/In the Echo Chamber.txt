In the Echo Chamber LyricsAs I was out walking
Home alone one night
I saw this man approaching
He wore a coat of white
He said, "You don't know me
But you'll very soon find out"
Then the world was darkness
As a cloth clamped around my mouth
I said, "Where am I?" Oh
"Where am I?" Oh
"I don't know
How can I escape?"
Slowly I recovered
My head was aching bad
I was laying on the carpet
Inside this madman's lab
Then a voice was speaking
From behind a glass-walled booth
It said, "Welcome stranger
We've got serious work to do"
Where am I? Oh
Where am I? Oh
Someone say more
What's his fiendish plan?
He told me then, he said "You are my guinea pig
I'm an unsound engineer
I'm going to see how much a man can dig
A thousand voices in his ever-decreasing human ear"
In the echo chamber
I almost went insane
Even my own heartbeat
Caused my eardrum pain
It was like a Phil Spector nightmare
The echo machine ran wild
It was louder, getting louder
I thought that I would die
Where am I?
Where am I?
Said, "Oh, I swear you'll never get out of here
Though how you try and try for 24 years"
That's why I am where I am now
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
I'm gonna tear it down before I go
Ah, c'mon, Michelangelo, you know
Ah-ohEmbed
