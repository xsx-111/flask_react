My Girl Lyrics
Once a girl took my love until I couldn't give anymore
Then I tried to pretend not to see what I couldn't ignore

Oh, my girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't love me at all anymore

I took her to the dance and then I didn't see her all night
Then a friend said he saw her with some other boy just outside
When I went out she was alone
She said, "I would like to go home"
I asked her, "Who were you with?"
She said, "No-one"
I could tell that she lied
And a voice said inside

My girl don't love me at all (My girl)
My girl don't love me at all (My girl)
My girl don't love me at all anymore
Not at all

My girl don't love me at all (My girl)
My girl don't love me at all (My girl)
My girl don't love me at all anymore
Not at all

My girl don't love me at all (My girl)
My girl don't love me at all
My girl don't

My girl don't love me
She don't love me
My girl don't love meEmbed
