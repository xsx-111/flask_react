Be My Guru LyricsI know what's going down before it even happens
I'm the smart boy in town, be it here or Manhattan
I'm a guru, I'm a Hoodoo Guru
I'm a guru, I'm a Hoodoo Guru
I'm yours, will you be mine too?
Be my guru
We make no bones at all, we're making a dint
And in no time at all, your hearts we will win
It's a gift we offer you, our music
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Be polite, accept it, don't refuse it
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
I'm yours, will you be mine too?
Will you be mine too?
Will you be mine too?
We will grow our hair, yeah-yeah-yeah
We got nice clothes to wear, yeah-yeah-yeah
(Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeahEmbed
