I Want You Back LyricsI can still recall the time
She said she was always mine
And she left, as people do
And forget what we've been through
It's not that she's gone away
Yeah, it's the things I hear that she has got to say
About me and about my friends
When we've, we got no defence
That's her, I'll never believe her again
She might have deceived all my friends
I know they will see in the end
What it all means when she says, yeah
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I want you back
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I want you back
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I-I-I want you
She says, she says
She says, she says
Yeah, yeah
But what's worse, she thinks it's true
But that's just her, she always was a little bit confused
And she's not worth the time I had to lose
That's her, I'll never believe her again
She might have deceived my friends
I know they'll see what it means when she says, yeah
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I want you back
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I want you back
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I-I-I want you
She says, she says
She says, she says
She says, she says (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I want you back
She says, she says (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I want you and only you (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
She says, she says
She says, she saysEmbed
