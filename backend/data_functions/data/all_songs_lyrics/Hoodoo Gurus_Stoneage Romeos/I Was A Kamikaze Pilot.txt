I Was A Kamikaze Pilot LyricsHey
I was a, was a kamikaze pilot
They gave me a plane, I couldn't fly it
Taught how to take off, I don't know how to land
They say it doesn't matter and I just cannot understand
I was a kamikaze pilot
They gave me a plane, I couldn't fly it home
Left my happy homeland in a Zero
Got engine trouble so I couldn't be a hero
Do you think I care?
Now I'll keep my two feet on the ground
'Cause when you're in the clouds
Everybody always tryna shoot you down
I was a kamikaze pilot
They gave me a plane, I couldn't fly it home
I couldn't fly it home
Oh, gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
H-Hey
On an island there ain't too much to do
Look after number one because I think
I can see Lee Marvin chasin' after you
Shake me, wake me, tell me when it's over
I've been waiting 40 years, can't wait any longer, no
No-no, no-no, no, nothing new
I was a kamikaze pilot
They gave me a plane, I couldn't fly it home
And I couldn't fly it home
Oh, I couldn't fly it home
I was a, was a kamikaze
Oh-oh-oh
I was (I was a)
I was a (I was a)
I was (I was a)
Uh-huh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Cherry blossoms falling down
Cherry blossoms falling down
Cherry blossoms falling down
Cherry blossoms falling down
Oh-oh
Yeah, right
