Arthur Lyrics
Oh!

Arthur played the bass
He had an angel's face
He jived with the Hoodoos, man
No-one could take his place
No, no, no
Oh, oh
Whoa-oh

He needed extra cash
So he drove his brother's cab
The day we heard the news, you know
It really hit us bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It was the day that Arthur died
Was the day that Arthur died

A black gelato van (Black gelato van)
Finished for the day (For the day)
It met with Arthur's taxi head-on
Down St. Kilda-way
By the Prince of Wales, hey
That was the way that Arthur died
Upon the day that Arthur died
I cried
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Arthur played the bass
He had an angel's face, well
He jived with the Hoodoo Gurus and you know
No ones ever gonna take his ever-loving place
No, no, not me, not anyone here
Since the day that Arthur died
Ever since the day that Arthur died
Ever since the day that Arthur diedEmbed
