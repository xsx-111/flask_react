Tojo Lyrics
Tracy, Tracy was angry
A bad mood, a bad mood
I told her that it's an ill wind
Blows no good, blows no good

Then she told me
"Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin"
"Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin"

I said, "Tracy, won't you listen? This is Christmas, honey"
Don't you go, uh uh, don't you go
She said, "David, believe me, I wouldn't miss this for the world"
I've got to blow, I've got to blow

She said again
"Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin"
"Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin"
Now she's gone, gone, gone
Just like the wind
I just sigh, I just sigh
But I'm dreaming that I'm gleaming
In her eye, in her eye

But I'll always hear
("Tojo never made it")
"Tojo never made it to Darwin"
I will hear it, I hear
"Tojo never made it
Tojo never made it to Darwin"

Tojo never made it to Darwin
She said Tojo never made it to Darwin
Never made it to Darwin
That year Santa never cameEmbed
