Leilani Lyrics
Somewhere on a South Pacific island
Sits a young man staring at the surf
His native girlfriend died a death quite violent
A tribal sacrifice made to the Earth

(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh)

She was brown, her hair was black, her eyes were blue
A chief's daughter, Leilani was her name
She and her young man made a handsome two
But lava tore them both apart again

(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
He'd say, "Leilani, don't go to the volcano" (Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
He'd say, "Please don't go to the volcano" (Whoa-oh)

They were saving for a little hut
He collected sea shells every day
And every night he'd share a cigarette
But the ancient, angry Gods got in the way
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
He'd say, "Leilani, don't go to the volcano" (Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
He would plead, "Please don't go, I'll miss you so" (Whoa-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Katoomba (Hey!), Macumba (Ho!)

Katoomba (Hey!), Macumbah (Ho!)
Oomgawa
Katoomba (Hey!), Macumbah (Ho!)
Oomgawa!
Hey! (Ho) Ho! Hey! (Hey-ey)
Hey! (Ho) Ho! Hey! (Hey-ey)
Ah-ah
Leilani coola-boola-Ulladulla-huacatay
(Aba-laba-laba Hut! Aba-laba-laba Hut!)
Leilani never-get-a-hut-o'-terracotta-tile
(Aba-laba-laba Hut! Aba-laba-laba Hut!)
Oomgawa!
Hey! (Ho) Ho! Hey! (Hey-ey)
Hey! (Ho) Ho! Hey! (Hey-ey)
Hey! (Ho) Ho! Hey! (Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
(Huh)
Still, the young man sits there on the beach
He's staring misty-eyed out into space
He's thinking about his girlfriend, the late deceased
At least her death had purpose, his life is a waste

(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh) And his life is a waste
"Please don't go, I love you, I love you"  (Whoa-oh)
"I love you so, whoa-oh" (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
She to him was to be wed (Whoa-oh)
She chose a mountain God instead
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh) Instead
"Now listen, Leilani, I can't stand this (Whoa-oh)
Carrying on around (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Better come on down from that mound
You know that ain't no sacred ground (Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Listen, please!"
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh) Oh-oh-oh-no
She's gone, gone, gone, gone (Whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)Embed
