Dig It Up Lyrics
My girlfriend lives in the ground
My friends ask why she's not around
She won't come home
I'm so alone
Ah, you'll never know
You can't bury love
You've gotta dig it up
Yeah, you've gotta live it up

I take her flowers each day
I place them over her grave
I want her back
Because I look so bad, so bad in black
Like a maniac
You can't bury love
You've gotta dig it up
Yeah, you've gotta live it up, whoa

Please, darling, come home to me
Well, I'll make you so happy, you will see
I'll paint your room
In pink and blue
Ha, I'll even choose the colour scheme for you
You can't take away my love
I'll never give it up
Yeah, I'm gonna dig it up
Right here
In the here and now
Gotta go underground
That's where my love is found
Whoa-oh, hope I'm in
Oh, no
You can't make me
Don't, d-don't, don't
Don't tell me, I don't want to know

My girlfriend lives in the ground
My friends, you ask me, "Why is she six feet down?"
I can't tell you why, 'cause if I even try
I'd fall down flat on my face
And I'd cry
You can't take away my love
I'm gonna dig it up, yeah
I'm gonna live it up, oh
I'm gonna dig it up, dig it up
I'm never gonna stop
Life's like a cup
You've gotta fill it upEmbed
