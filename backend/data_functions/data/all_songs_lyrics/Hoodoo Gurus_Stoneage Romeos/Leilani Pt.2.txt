Leilani Pt.2 Lyrics
Many years have passed since Leilani died
But his broken heart cannot be denied
He doesn't think of other girls
He just sits and mourns for her
She was the only thing in the world he called his
Now in the world she is

Swimming by himself
He found a pretty rock
Well, suddenly he felt
That stone begin to talk
(Lei-la, lei-lei)
(La-lei-lei, la-lei-lei)
(La-lei-lei, la-lei-lei)
It was his long-lost love
That he held in his hand
The pebble's colour was
Identical to her tan
Now she's a rock
From a volcanic pool
Before she was hot
But now she is cool
Now she is here, now she is there
Now she's getting carried away
Hey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
Down by the lagoon
You'll see him with his stone
They sit beneath the moon
And then he takes her home
He kisses her goodnight (Whoa-oh)
And puts her in a shoe-box (Whoa-oh)
That's what life is like (Whoa-oh)
When your marriage is on the rocks
Now she's a rock
From a volcanic pool
Before she was hot
But now she is cool
Now she is here, now she is there
Now she's getting carried away
Hey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey-ey
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love is a red, red rock
My love
(My love) Is a red, red rock
(My love) Is a red, red rock
(My love) Is a red, red rock
My loveEmbed
