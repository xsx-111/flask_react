Death Ship LyricsI am the captain of a ghostly crew
Sail the seven seas with nothin' to do
The girl that I thought was untrue
Really loved me, boo-hoo-hoo
Near hidden reefs, we appear in the gloom
Luring mariners to their doom
As we're condemned, we condemn others too
Who would love me? Who? Who?
Would you?
I'm on the Death Ship, I sail the sea alone
Death Ship, I can call no port home
Lost, lost souls cry to Hell in the wind
"Let us in, let us in"
Death Ship, I sail the sea alone
Death Ship, I can call no port home
Lost, lost souls cry to Hell in the wind
"Let us in, let us in"
Yeah, let us in
I need somebody who will die for me
To free me of this misery
I need someone to cry for me
Really love me, really
Really love me, really
Really love me, really
Really love me
Really love me
Love meEmbed
