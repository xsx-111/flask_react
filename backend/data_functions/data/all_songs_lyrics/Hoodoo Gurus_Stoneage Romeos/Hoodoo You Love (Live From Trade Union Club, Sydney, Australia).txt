Hoodoo You Love (Live From Trade Union Club, Sydney, Australia) Lyrics
Hoodoo you love?
Hoodoo you love?
Hoodoo you love?

Well, I
I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra-snake for a necktie
Got a brand new house by the roadside
Built from a rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made from a human skull
Said, "A-come on, baby, take a walk with me
And tell me, Hoodoo you love?"

Hoodoo you love?
Hoodoo you love?

Well, I reached out and grabbed the other hand
And tell me, "Ooh, Dave, I understand"

Hoodoo you love?
Hoodoo you love?
Hoodoo you love?
'Cause I
The night was black, the night was blue
Around the corner, an ice-wagon flew
I thought I heard a bump, somebody screamed
Should have heard just-a what, what I seen

Tell me, Hoodoo you love?
Hoodoo you love?
Tell me, Hoodoo you love?

I got a graveyard hand, a tombstone mind
I'm young enough I ain't afraid of dying

Hoodoo you love?
Tell them, Hoodoo you love?
Hoodoo you love?

'Cause I love youEmbed
