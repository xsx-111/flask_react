She Gives Me Religion LyricsDown the mystic avenue I walk again
Remembering the days gone by
And I'm knocking with my heart
And all the girls walk by
In all their summer fashions
And the churchbells chime
On a summer Sunday afternoon
She gives me religion
She gives me religion
And the angel of imagination
Opened up my gate
She said "come right in
I saw you knocking with your heart."
And the angel of imagination
She lit your fiery vision bright
Let your flame burn into the night
I saw you knocking with your heart
She gives me religion
She gives me religion
It's all right
And all the girls walk by
In all their summer fashions
And the churchbells chime
On a summer Sunday afternoon
It's all right
She gives me religion
I said she gives me religion
And I'm knocking and I'm knocking with my heart
And I'm knocking, knocking with my heart
And I'm knocking with my heartEmbed
