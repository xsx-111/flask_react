Celtic Ray LyricsWhen Lewellen comes around
And he goes through market town
You'll be on the Celtic Ray
Are you ready?
When McManus comes around
On his early morning round
Cryin' "Heron 'a' lay"
You'll be on the Celtic Ray
Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, and Wales
I can hear those ancient voices calling
"Children, children"
When the coalbrick man comes round
On a cold November day
You'll be on the Celtic Ray
Are you ready?
Ireland, Scotland, Cornwall and Wales
I can hear those ancient voices calling
"Children, children, children"
Listen Jimmy, I wanna go home
Listen Jimmy I wanna go home
I've been away from the Ray too long
Listen Jimmy, I wanna go home
Listen Jimmy, I wanna go home
I've been away from the Ray too long
I've been away from the Ray too long
In the early mornin', we'll go walkin' where
The light comes shining through
On the Celtic Ray
Are you ready?Embed
