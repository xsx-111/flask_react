One Dead Moon LyricsHey girl
Don't act surprised
You knew you'd see me here
It's a long, long time for you and me
Somewhere
Along the way
The light just left your eyes
And I'd hate to figure what becomes of me
Hope you're happy with that drone you found
And he's sayin' all those things that you want him to
Well girl I know you and you need those lies
'Cause the truth, it takes too much of you
Just one day
Before I walk away
Honey you're one dead moon
And I don't expect
That old silver light
To come back soon
Look at me
Well there's no denyin'
You were the silver light of a big bright moon
And I know
That when you tried to change me
You were so damn sure it was the only thing to do
But you ain't as clever as you think you are
And the fact is I miss your body more than I miss you
Can't be worried bout no wounded pride
'Cause for just this once I gotta tell the truth
Just one day
Before I walk away
Honey you're one dead moon
And I don't expect
That old silver light
To come back soon
To come back soon
Just one day
Before I walk away
Honey you're one dead moon yeah yeah yeah
And I don't expect
That old silver light
To come back soonEmbed
