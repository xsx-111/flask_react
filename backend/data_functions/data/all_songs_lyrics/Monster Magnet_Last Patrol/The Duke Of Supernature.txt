The Duke Of Supernature LyricsCome on
Checking out the office girls on a Friday afternoon
Well she's got the shape I need for the mine to break too soon
It's all dead moons and chicken bones and child don't you fear
You'll be singing in a higher purpose now your super nature's clear
Yeah
It all comes near
Well I swear I did you baby
Back in 49 in vain
When the devil lost the big war
But he figured out a way
Now I watch and make the world come
And in dollars due thus die
And I praise the day the Duke of Supernature's coming back
Is coming back
Is coming back
My old pal Icarus rode too close to the sun
And folks tend to get upset when they see how the job gets done
Now close your eyes, and pay no mind to the circles round your head
The answer to those questions is right here in my own bed
Yeah, oh
In my own bed
Hit it!
Hey!
Well I swear I did you baby
Back in 49 in vain
When the master lost the big one
And he figured out a way
Now I watch and make the world come
And in dollars due thus die
And I praise the day the duke of Supernature's coming back
Is coming back now
YeahEmbed
