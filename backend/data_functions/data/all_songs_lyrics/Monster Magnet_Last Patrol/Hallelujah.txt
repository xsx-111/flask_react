Hallelujah LyricsBrothers, never discount a Tuesday
You'd better spring for a good hotel
You got to keep the talent starry eyed
If you wanna keep ringin' those bells
It ain't no theory, it's the law, boy
And while the dabblers keep douchin' around
Old Eisenhower's got his candle lit
A couple hours a'fore he rolls into town
I roll right into town
I roll right into town
I roll right into town
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
If you spend too much time chewin' bubblegum
You're apt to spoil the old appetite
Well I just reach in the hole of my enthusiastic soul
And show 'em why they call me the creep
How's about a little camp fire, ladies?
What say we sing a few songs?
We got music and mirth and we got peace on this earth
And I'm certain we all can get along
We all can get along, we all can get along, we all can get along
Cynthia and Jerry has a message they're sayin'
All of you squares go home
I say goddamn, I'm the luckiest man
Come on and all sing along
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
