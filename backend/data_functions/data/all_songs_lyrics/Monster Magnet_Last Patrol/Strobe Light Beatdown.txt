Strobe Light Beatdown LyricsBaby, I'm the only one
Who reckons you're kind of fun
Goddamn is all I have to say
I love to hear you when you beg that way
Baby, the strobe light's on
Show some imagination and wear some pearls
My, my, my, my, my you're a healthy girl
Your mother's got a real big mouth
She slobbers when she goes down south
Goddamn is all I have to say
I love to hear it when she talks that way
Your mother's got a real fine mouth
Use your imagination and wear some pearls
My, my, my, my, my what a healthy girl
Let's see what the mirror has to say
I think we got a winner
Bark your appreciation when your ship comes in
Baby, baby, baby there's no such thing as sin
I can see the black holes in your pretty eyes
There's no room in your banged out little heart left for surprise
No room in your banged out little head left for surpriseEmbed
