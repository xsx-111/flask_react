Paradise LyricsSure is cold here and I ain't a-lyin'
Stairs lead nowhere and the time is dead
If I had someone just to listen
I'd tell them stories of paradise
When I was young I crossed an ocean
Crossed an ocean, oh so far away
Cosmic circus, instant passions
I found a way for me to make it pay
Well let me guess now, my little monkey
You love your salt and your cigarettes
And with your eyes shut you see Valhalla
You've lost some fight but you ain't done yet
Now come a little bit closer
Well ain't that nice
You and me girl, between the raindrops
Little pieces of paradise
Baby, I'm dyin' so let's do some cryin'
Let's cherish some sins in the cave
Under the rainbow where no one will ever know
We'll make such a beautiful place
Oh such a beautiful place
Such a beautiful
Sure is hot here
Like a jungle
Hot enough now for life to grow
But it's just too much
Can't take the hassle
There ain't no air and it's time to go
We've got the scars to prove us
Well ain't that nice
All our laughin' and all our cryin'
Little memories of paradiseEmbed
