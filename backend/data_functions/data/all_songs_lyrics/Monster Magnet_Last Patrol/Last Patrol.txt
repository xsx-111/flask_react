Last Patrol LyricsOh mama, don't you know
This is my last crusade
That's right, I'm cashin' out
Your boy has got it made
I've got a ten foot blond
She's waiting on the moon
That girl is living sin
I'm gonna be there soon
I'm on the last
I'm on the last patrol
Well let the games begin
Let's let the circus burn
'Cause I'm a wise old dog
And you have much to learn
It's a cosmic joke
Those suckers never knew
Before I melt this ball
I think I'll burn them too
I'm
I'm on the last patrol
I'm
I'm on the last patrol
Baby, can you save my heart
And take this gig into the stars
Melt the ghosts inside my head
The same ones who told me rock was dead
No more will those dogs pervert
The life I've lead in motion blur
I'll fry the fools who'll never learn
And leave them in my after-burn
Let's let the circus burnEmbed
