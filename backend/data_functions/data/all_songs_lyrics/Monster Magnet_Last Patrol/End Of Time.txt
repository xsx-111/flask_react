End Of Time LyricsSomeone tell those slobs that they got it wrong
They screwed us good and gave the whole circus away
Venus warm my bed 'cause I'm coming home, now
I'm crashing the ship and just walking away
Somebody told me once that you were deeper than darkness
A shining face on a body that could send me to war
Naked flesh in the heart of a nuclear sunrise, baby
Drain that lizard's tank until there ain't anymore
Throw my burned out head in a lake of fire
I'll satisfy my soul on the other side
Pump me till I'm gone and I can't get back
I'll smoke you fuckers out at the end of time
I saw this girl, once... her hair was on fire
Her eyes like stars
She's never left my mind
A planet bird singing her phoenix song
Electric children's voices at the end of time
Somebody told me once that you were deeper than darkness
A shining face on a body that could send me to war
Naked flesh in the heart of a nuclear sunrise, baby
Drain that lizard's tank until there ain't anymore
Throw my burned out head in a lake of fire
I'll satisfy my soul on the other side
Pump me till I'm gone and I can't get back
I'll smoke you fuckers out at the end of time
Wash my tired brain in an acid bath
Fuck me till I'm dead and I can't get back
I'll satisfy my soul on the other side
And smoke my baby out at the end of timeEmbed
