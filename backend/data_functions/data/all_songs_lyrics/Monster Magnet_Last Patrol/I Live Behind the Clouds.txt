I Live Behind the Clouds LyricsI've got a feeling that no one cares
'Bout all that confetti I throw in the air
Nothing's important yet everything is
If there ain't no photo I just don't exist
And the winds blow
And the sky looks cool
So I make my home in the clouds
I see the oceans, the mountains, the plains
The rats and the suckers, the strong and the lame
Sometimes I dream about flying on down
Falling in love and life on the ground
And the winds blow
And the sun comes up
And I stay behind the clouds
Yes I live behind the clouds
Raise Surya to burn off the soil
Make it safe for my eyes
I'd pay good money just to get proved wrong
For once in my goddamned life
Pull me in, drag me down
Into your ocean of love
My wings are ragged and my soul is gone
So tired of floating above
Sing to me baby your sweet refrain
I fear I'm coming apart in this rain
That's all I need if that's all I hear
Some beautiful music as I disappear
And the winds blow
And the sun goes down
And I stay behind the clouds
Yes I stay behind the clouds
Yeah I live behind the cloudsEmbed
