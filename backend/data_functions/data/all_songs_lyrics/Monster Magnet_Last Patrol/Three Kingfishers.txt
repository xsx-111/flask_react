Three Kingfishers LyricsTwelve kingfisher birds you shall have
Dive and swim in the ripples of your laugh
Oh, I dreamed you were a jewel
Sitting on a golden crown on
My head
My head
My head
Look at the tiny oceans in my hands
Waves of liquid colors touch the sands
Twelve kingfisher birds you shall have
Dive and swim in the ripples of your laugh
Oh, I dreamed you were a jewel
Sitting on a golden crown on
My head
My head
My head
Oh, I dreamed you were a jewel
Sitting on a golden crown on
My head
My head
My headEmbed
