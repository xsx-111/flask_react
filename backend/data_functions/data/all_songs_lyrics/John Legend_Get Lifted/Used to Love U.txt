Used to Love U Lyrics
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa

Maybe it's me, maybe I bore you
No, no it's my fault 'cause I can't afford you
Maybe Baby, Puffy, or Jay Z
Would all be better for you
'Cause all I could do was love you

Baby when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeaaahh)
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeah, yeah, uh, uh)

Maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, my loss
But you are above 'cause
All I could do was love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeaaahh)
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeah, yeah, uh, uh)

Oh! I used to (Do you remember when I used to)
Love you (used to... Love you)
Oh! But I don't - not you (baby no not anymore... I don't love you)
Love you (ooooh, used to ... love you)
Oh! I used to love you
(Ohhh used to love you)
You're gonna miss me now... ohhh

Baby, when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
But I'm not gonna play the fool
No, I can't live this life
And I can't justify
And I can't make up my life
I don't love you
Not like I used to do
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeaaahh)
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeah, yeah, uh, uh)
Not like I used to
Oh! I used to (Do you remember when I used to)
Love you
(used to... Love you)
Oh! But I don't - not you
(baby no not anymore... I don't love you)
Oh! I used to love you
Love you (ooooh, used to ... love you)
Oh! But I don't - not you
(baby no not any more... I don't love you)
Oh! I used to love you
You're gonna miss me now...cause I (Ohhh used to love you)
Oh! But I don't - not you
(baby no not anymore... I don't love you)
You're gonna miss me now...cause I
Oh! But I don't - not you
(baby no not any more... I don't love you)3Embed
