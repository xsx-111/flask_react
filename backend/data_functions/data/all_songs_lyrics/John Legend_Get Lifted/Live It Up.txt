Live It Up Lyrics

Ha-ha ha-ha ooh...

You know we've been struggling for such a long time
Working here and there just to get by
It's finally time for me to get mine
No more robbing Peter so we can pay Paul (oh no)
Or going to Mama's house to make a phone call (no no)
No we don't have to struggle at all

'Cause now every day is feeling like Friday (Friday)
I'm getting paid and doing it my way (my way)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate

Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high, don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up
No more putting it in the layaway (away)
'Cause boo, I got the money today (today)
Come on and go to the mall and let's play (play)
Let's go raise a toast to the days ahead (ahead)
You can't take it with you when you're dead (dead)
You might as well enjoy it now instead (instead)

Oh now, it's about to be a long evening (yeah yeah)
We'll party through the rest of the weekend (come on)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate

Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high, don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up

We can fly so high in the moonlit sky
'Cause there's no more cloudy days
It's so beautiful, when you feel the flow
We can dance the night away
Do you remember when times were hard? Oh so hard
Through it all, we've come so far
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
So we gotta live it up
So we can just celebrate there's no more pain
Raise your glass and feel no shame
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
Oh so we gotta live it up

Oh live it up, we can go crazy
Live it up, you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high, don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up

Oh it's time to celebrate baby
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
Said we don't have to worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
So does it feel good to you?
I know it feels good to you, yeah
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
Hmm, we don't have worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more, yeah
(Ha-ha ha-ha ooh)
It's time to celebrate baby
Yeah we gotta live it upEmbed
