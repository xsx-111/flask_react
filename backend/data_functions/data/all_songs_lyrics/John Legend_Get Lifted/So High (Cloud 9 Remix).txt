So High (Cloud 9 Remix) LyricsFeels like we can kiss the sky
Baby baby we can get so high
So high yeah, so high yeah

You so conscious and self aware
I'm next to you, I hold your back
And you express pure ecstasy
It's more than just the sex to me
Cause mentally you take me there
(take me there, take me there, take me there)
Yo, I pretended to be unaffected
You intended to be respected
I commend your focus, you did fear to be rejected
So you approached me while other men remained intimidated
Glad you did cause once you came
You got much more than anticipated
And its true
I got the mind of a genius
And every time we kiss
We feel the magnetic field we got between us
I think it's something to witness your vulnerability
The definition of a real man he can acknowledge how he feels for me
I'm fascinated with your manhood exploration
Your transparent language, how you articulate the situation
And I can see it in your stare, in your air
I love the texture of your hair
Statuesque black and beautiful like classical architecture
Yeah
Baby since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
And you proved my fantasies what love could really be
Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the cloud we're floating away
Ooh this feels so crazy, oh, this love is blazing
Baby we're so high, walking on cloud 9
You got me up so high
So high
My shoes are scraping the sky
So high
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky
Maybe later we can go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are
We'll go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away
Ooh this feels so crazy, oh this love is blazing
Baby we're so high, walking on cloud 9
You got me up so high
So high
My shoes are scraping the sky
So high
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky
Oooh, yeah
Ooooo-ooh oh
Oooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're soo high, walking on cloud 9
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
Ooooh yeeaah
Mmmhaaaah ay
Yeah...
This is how love suppose to be
This is how, this is how love suppose to be
Let's go to the moon baby,oooh
Let's go to the moon baby, yeah
Let's go, go, let's go to the moon baby
So highEmbed
