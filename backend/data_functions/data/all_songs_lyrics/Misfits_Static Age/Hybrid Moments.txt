Hybrid Moments Lyrics
If you're gonna scream, scream with me
Moments like this never last
When new creatures rape your face
Hybrids opened up the door

Ooh, baby, when you cry your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars

In hybrid moments, give me a moment
Give me a moment, give me a moment

Ooh, baby, when you cry your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars

In hybrid moments, in hybrid moments
In hybrid moments, in hybrid moments
Give me a moment, give me a moment10Embed
