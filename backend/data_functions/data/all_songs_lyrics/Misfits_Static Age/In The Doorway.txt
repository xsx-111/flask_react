In The Doorway Lyrics
The light in the doorway
Shining so bright
In the doorway
I clench your hips for the flesh
You tore my prose
In the doorway
Animal lie
Like the doorway
As you hide
Hear it then
Will you let me in?

Let me in
Oh!

In the doorway
We were so young
In the doorway
Release the black dogs on our breasts
We'll never rest
We'll never rest
We'll never forget
I ain't never gonna let you rest
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
