Teenagers from Mars Lyrics
We land in barren fields
On the Arizona plains
The insemination of little girls
In the middle of wet dreams

We are the angel mutants
The streets for us seduction
Our cause unjust and ancient
In this "B" film born invasion

Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care

Well, we've seen your 3D movies
In violent abduction
We blast your mindless structure
Inferior connection

We take your weak resistance
Throw it in your face
We need no introduction
For mass annihilation
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care

We need no introduction
No visas or carte blanche
Inhuman reproduction
We're here for what we want

We want, we need it, we'll take it
We want, we need it, we'll take it
We want, we need it, we'll take it
We want, we need it, we'll take it, baby

Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care

Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
We don't care (We don't care)
And we don't care, we don't care
We don't care, but we don't care
And we don't care1Embed
