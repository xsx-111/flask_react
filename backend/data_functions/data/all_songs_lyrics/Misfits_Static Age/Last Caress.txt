Last Caress Lyrics
I got somethin' to say, I killed a baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead
Well, I got somethin' to say, I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me as long as she's spread

Sweet lovely death, I am waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress

Go!

Sweet lovely death, I am waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress

Well, I got somethin' to say, I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead

Sweet lovely death, I am waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death
One last caress
One last caress, sweet death
One last caress, sweet death
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
