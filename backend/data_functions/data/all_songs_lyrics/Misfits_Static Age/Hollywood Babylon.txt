Hollywood Babylon Lyrics
Who came along for the ride?
Hey, you can't come inside
Do the citizens kneel for sex?
It's heaven cumming on her chest

Hollywood Babylon
Hollywood Babylon

Flesh ancient monster design
Unlit pornographic sign
Where did they come from tonight?
Who came along for the ride?

Hollywood Babylon
Hollywood Babylon

Who came along for the ride?
Hey you, you can't come inside
When do the citizens kneel for sex?
It's heaven cumming on her chest
Hollywood Babylon
Hollywood Babylon
Hollywood Babylon
