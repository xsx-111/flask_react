We Are 138 Lyrics
We are 138, We are 138, We are 138
We are 138, We are 138, We are 138
We are 138, We are 138
In the eyes of the cyborg

Do you think we're robot clean
Does this face look almost mean
Is it time to be an android, not a man

The pleasantries are gone
We're stripped of all we were
In the eyes of cyborg

We are 138, We are 138, We are 138
We are 138, We are 138, We are 138

8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 81Embed
