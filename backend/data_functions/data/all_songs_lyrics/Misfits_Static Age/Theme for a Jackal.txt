Theme for a Jackal Lyrics
Drive drunk on a corner
Wet waste of a girl
Theme for a jackal

They play you your death song
You'd probably listen
Stand idly by as they rape your children
Like you do now
In fact, you showed them how

All thoughts are in place
All deeds are tended
Play, theme for a jackal, play
Die, sweet prince
Meat tastes like mince
The jackal's eaten enough for today
Die, sweet prince
Meat tastes like shit
Enough to make that jackal spit

Spit, jackal, spit
Spit and choke on the lives you've taken
You can't shake 'em loose
All morsels gone, they're too small
Acceptable from a source so tall
Her little sister on the front lawn
Bitch, bitch, she is
Cut her from the inside out
Your dead daughter in the river
Entrance gained by her liver
Play, theme for a jackal, play

They play you your death song
You'd probably listen
Stand idly by as he rapes your children
Like you do now
In fact, you showed him how
Play, theme for a jackal, play
Play, theme for a jackal, playEmbed
