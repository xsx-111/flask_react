Bullet Lyrics
President's bullet ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedy's shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny, ride
Johnny's wife is floundering
Johnny's wife is scared
Run, Jackie, run
Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck
President's bullet ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedys shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny, ride
Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck

A-ride Jackie-O
Jonathan F. Kennedy will rise and be shot down
Dirt's gonna be your desert
My cum will be your life source
And the only way to get it
Is to suck
Or fuck
Or be poor and devoid, and masturbate me
Masturbate me, then slurp it from your palms
Like a dry desert soakin' up the rain, soakin' up the sun
Like a dry desert soakin' up the rain, soakin' up the sun3Embed
