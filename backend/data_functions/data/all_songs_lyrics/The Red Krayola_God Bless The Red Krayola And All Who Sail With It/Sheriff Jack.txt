Sheriff Jack LyricsSheriff Jack's asleep on his back
Got his head inside a sack
Over you
Sheriff Jack won't speak in the hall
He only sits to watch the wall
That hangs his picture
Suzy, she could save some time if she loved him
She doesn't feel right about the hangings every night
So she won't give him her hand
Can see all that too
But cannot see you
You are in the forest too
But down in the valley
Death stalks his every step
The coffin's got him in its grip
He's dead on his feet
Suzy, she could save some time if she loved him
She doesn't feel right about the hangings every night
So she won't give him her handEmbed
