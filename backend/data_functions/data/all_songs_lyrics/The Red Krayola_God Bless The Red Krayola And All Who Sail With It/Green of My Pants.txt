Green of My Pants LyricsIn leather weather, leather trees are gone
Does the oriole remember the moss and vulture
Imagine that to run for cheese
Angels over Bethlehem suspended in the sky are wearing halos
When I go to the Dolman on Sunday
The aisles are leading me to the screen
Balcony behind my back
Exits outside my eyes
Sometimes I catch the matinee
And I see the feature twice by staying in thereEmbed
