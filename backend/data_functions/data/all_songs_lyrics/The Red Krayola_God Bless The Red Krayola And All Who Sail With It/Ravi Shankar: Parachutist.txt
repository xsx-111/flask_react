Ravi Shankar: Parachutist LyricsSeven horses for seven kings
Are never enough in the fields
Where the targets are built
That sport may remain
And sky is black as night
Divulge the presence of parachutes
Now we've got brown shoes
And roads now lead them here
What will become of them now
That spotlights shine now and then
And show parachutes
There was a flying constellation
Ravi saw it far below
In the air, he drew a picture
What he saw I do not know
Through the air I saw him gliding
Abover him stood the silk
Parachute of my memory
Where he landed no one knows
For I am too lame
And feeling as if she pleases
Pleases meEmbed
