Leejol LyricsDid they ever sew that
Another seam that changes dress
And though the ball is over
Good mothers will before and after
Have another, will ya
I'll see you two to the door
And what a wide world this would
Good mothers will before and after
Homework in the oven
Johnny's in the shower
Little bitty hog, didn't have a flashlight
Right up in the med
And now we're singing
