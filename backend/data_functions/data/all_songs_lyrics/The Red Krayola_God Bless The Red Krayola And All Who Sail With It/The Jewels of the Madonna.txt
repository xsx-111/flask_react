The Jewels of the Madonna LyricsNeevr let it be said that this is swill
I'm glad you like it
Oh, you have a car now?
Yes, yes I do
Or fifty dollars worth of half dollars
God moves in mysterious ways
Cast your bread upon the waters
The lord will provide his thief
His stake is straight from Heaven
My body was numb and my mind paralyzed with fear
For a while I shined shoes downtown and sold the papers
Suddenly from Heaven, the jewels have appeared on the groundEmbed
