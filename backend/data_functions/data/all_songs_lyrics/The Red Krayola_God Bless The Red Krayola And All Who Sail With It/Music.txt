Music LyricsOh, we're gonna have music
Music
Hear a loud uproar
That's it, that's it
Oh, we're gonna have music
Sing a song
Come on along
Leave a little sunshine
For what in the pie makes you smile
Won't, won't, won't
Won't you sing a little bit
And wink or squint
I can tell
Make your rhyme again some time
Plew, plew, plew
You sound a lot like youEmbed
