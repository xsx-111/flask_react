Victory Garden LyricsLast night in your window sitting
I saw you
Oh Adolf, I know the serious virgin
Does adore you
Won't you come back home tonight?
Can't you see everything's going to be all right?
Oh Adolf, don't you say you've said goodbye
Don't say you've said goodbye now
Don't say you've said goodbye
Your suit of chrome it once
Shined so bright
She told me you were
Out of sight
The serious virgin
She waits for you tonight
Oh, don't say you've said goodbye now
Don't say you've said goodbye
Adolf, don't say you've said goodbyeEmbed
