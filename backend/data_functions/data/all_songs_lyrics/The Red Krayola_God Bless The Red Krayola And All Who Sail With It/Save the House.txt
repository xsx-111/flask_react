Save the House LyricsIt's champagne vanilla
(Clear the house for later)
The sky is now clear
(Do what you can for them)
I can see the house
(In the house)
And it's clear that the house will never be here
(Save the house)
Please save the house
(Save the house)
Sherwood Forest trees
(Clear the house for later)
Cannot block from me
(Do what you can for them)
The vision of my
(Save the house)
House still shining to me through the trees
(Save the house)
Please save my house
(Save the house)
Clear glass tower
Your long blonde hair
Please save the house
In high meadow
That is where my house will never be
Enhanced at my love
(Save the house for later)
The Notting Hill glove
(Do what you can for them)
Did point out to me
(Save the house)
That we could never, ever
(Save the house)
Won't you please save my house
(Save my house)
Now pull down the shades
(Clear the house for later)
On white everglades
(Do what you can for them)
And we can now rest in the house of glass
(In the house of)
That we'll never see
(Save the house)
Won't you please save my house
(Save my house)
Clear glass tower
Your long blonde hair
Please save the house
In high meadow
That is where my house will never beEmbed
