Say Hello to Jamie Jones LyricsLeave well enough alone
But try to keep in touch
Don't wander far from home
I'd ask of you this much
Say hello to Jamie Jones
Fire engine red decor
And wrought iron subtleties
Said girls who come to the fore
Are not for you so please
Say hello to Jamie Jones
If he has lost his way
Assist him I implore
Will you know what to say
It's better all the more
Say hello to Jamie Jones
12:10 the voices ring
And Disney's friends parade
They don't want anything
It's not a masquerade
Say hello to Jamie JonesEmbed
