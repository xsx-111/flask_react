Sherlock Holmes LyricsSherlock Holmes is on the case
The soiled glove on your hand gave him a clue
Give it to me and act as if nothing had happened
Fat fat why, tell that what in the world
Can I do?
Flowers growing in the garden
Footprints on the path, show him the way
Give it to me and take this bag of spare ribs
Fat fat why, tell that what in the world
Can I do?
