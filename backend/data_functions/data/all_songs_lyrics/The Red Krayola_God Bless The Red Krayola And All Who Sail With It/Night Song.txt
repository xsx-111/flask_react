Night Song LyricsNight song
After all, the day is away
Sun and darknes
Finding a fuss and the things we have done
I, myself, and who else and what else to do
But listen, and hear it all
I've taken what we wanted
And the moon stays with the music
Sun and darkness
Finding a fuss and the things we have done
What else to do but to listen and hear it all
NIght song
After all, the day's awayEmbed
