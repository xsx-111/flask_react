Chasing It Down Lyrics
"Commonplace things seem to have great significance."
Hi

Turn around your life or we'll change without your consent
Without your okay, it happened again
I woke up today and everything changed
All my friends and all my family
Suddenly don't understand me
Understand I'm not the man they think I am

Try chasin' it down
Try chasin' it down
Try chasin' it down
It don't wanna be found
It don't wanna be found
It don't wanna be found

Favorite table, favorite waitress, favorite place
It's up in flames, it's up for sale
It doesn't matter anyhow
Like anything that tasted sweet
It only tastes that way about a week
Before at best gone bittersweet
Try chasin' it down
Try chasin' it down
Try chasin' it down
It don't wanna be found
It don't wanna be found
It don't wanna be found

Abigail, oh, baby girl
You had a name that said itself
But funny how the name can change
About the time you find you're sick of sayin' it
Sayin' it, sayin' it, sayin' it
We had a thing so lovely
Took every last part of me
But funny, once you're into it
The all-encompassing thing's just a part of it
Part of it, part of it, part of it
Try to get back there
Try to get back there
Try to get back there
Try to get back there
It's a one shot deal
One shot deal
It's a one shot deal
Turn around your life or we'll change
Without your consent, without your okay
All my friends and all my family
Suddenly don't understand me
Understand I'm not the man they think I am

Oh, where'd it go?
Oh, where'd it go?
Oh, where'd it go?
Oh

Oh, try chasin' it down (Oh, where'd it go?)
Try chasin' it down (Oh, where'd it go?)
Try chasin' it down (Oh)
It don't wanna be found (Oh, where'd it go?)
It don't wanna be found (Oh, where'd it go?)
It don't wanna be found (Oh)

Try to get back there
Try to get back there
Try to get back there
Try to get back there
There
