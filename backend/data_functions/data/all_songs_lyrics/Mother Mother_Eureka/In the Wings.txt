In the Wings Lyrics
Ooooooh, ooh ooh ooh

Mama said I was allowed to love myself
Instead, I found a crown, to counterfeit
Put it on my head, strut around
Putting on the ritz
I put it in a book I write, inside my mind
A quintessential classic in my mind

I am waiting in the wings
Me and my thespian, we're ready to get in
I've got people in my skin
Crawling around, I could be any one of them

Off to dinner with a girl; ugly girl
She asked me where I work; city girl
I'm the prince of thieves, come to bed
I steal the imagery
And put it in a mood I set up in my head
Of violence and sex up in my head

I am waiting in the wings
Me and my Fred Astaire, we're dying to get in there
I've got people in my skin
Crawling around, I could be any one of them
Ahhh, ahhh
Ahhh, ahhh
I'd like to thank the academy
Ma and Pa for never feeding me
All the drugs for creativity
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me

I am waiting in the wings
Me and my thespian, we're ready to get in
I've got people in my skin
Crawling around, I could be any one of them
I am waiting in the wings
Me and my Fred Astaire, we're dying to get in there
I've got people in my skin
Crawling around, I could be any one of them

We're all waiting in the wings
We're all waiting in the wings
I got people in my skin2Embed
