Carve a Name LyricsWhat could make you think it'd be okay
For you to come around and carve a name
What could make you think it'd be alright
Showing up and packing such a knife
Oh what'd you really think was gonna happen to me
In your surgery
Everything in and out of style
But cutting stuff has been around a while
Mutilate, try it on a wrist
Cause everyone's a sadomasochist
Laugh it up as you cut, there's no pain
You carved your name into my heart again
To carve your name into my heart seems strange
Seems so strange
That's a lot of letters on a heart
Mama didn't name her very smart
At least she got a pretty little script
Mama put the pressure on her penmanship
It really is all insane
You carved your name into my heart again
To carve your name into my heart seems strange
You carved your name into my heart again
It feels the same as good old yesterday
And I don't want anybody to hold me while I'm suffering (suffering)
And I don't want anybody to show me while I'm fumbling
And I don't want anybody to console me or pretend to make ammends
You carved your name
To carve your name into my heart, seems strange
You carved your name into my heart again
It feels the same, it feels the same
It feels the same as yesterday3Embed
