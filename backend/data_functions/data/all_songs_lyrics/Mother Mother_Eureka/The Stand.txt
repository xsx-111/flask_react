The Stand Lyrics
Hey (hey, hey)
Tell me your weakness
Oh, I keep it a secret
Oh, come on, just one vice
Okay, it's vodka on ice
But then there's women on bikes (Oh?)
Or just the women who straddle
Oh, now you are a handful
I forgot about handfuls

Tell me your fears
Okay, it's everyone here
You mean just all of the people?
Yeah, and all of their peers
And all of their pets
And their chandeliers (Ohhh)
And their cigarettes (Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
I haven't smoked in years! (Ohhh)

I can hardly stand the sight (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the sound (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the taste (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the smell of it all
Talk about space
Well, it's a beautiful place!
But it's so damn cold!
Sure, for the human race
But for the planets and the stars (Ohhh)
And everything else and Mars (Ohhh)
It's like paradise
Spread out with a butter knife

I can hardly stand the sight (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the sound (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the taste (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the smell of it all
I can hardly stand the sight (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the sound (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the taste (Of it all)
I can hardly stand the smell of it all

I can hardly stand, I can hardly stand! (Ahhh)
Everyone's f-d and they don't even know
Everyone's f-d and they don't even know
Everyone's f-d (Yeaaah)
Everyone's f-d
Everyone's f-d (Oh yeaaah)
Everyone's f-d and they don't even know
Everyone's f-d and they don't even know
They don't even know (Ah)
They don't even know (Ah, yeaaah)
I can hardly stand the sight of it all
I can hardly stand the sound of it all
I can hardly stand the taste of it all
I can hardly stand the smell of it all

I can hardly stand, I can hardly stand! (Ahhh)
Everyone's f-d and they don't even know
Everyone's fucked and they don't even know
