Simply Simple Lyrics
Take me lightly
I am not the way I ought to be
I'm just the way I got to be
Take me slowly
Or else you may come by injury
I'll hurt you emotionally

Rock me, baby
Until my eyes are closed and I'm asleep
And then it's safe for you to leave
Call me lazy
For I have yet to let my soul free
It's still very much in my reach, oh

I just want it to unfold
Simply simple
Oh, I'll do everything I'm told
Keep it simple

You want babies
Well here I am, so why not aren't you pleased
With a big baby like me?
(Mamma's little baby, you're mamma's little baby)
And I'll throw a fit
(Yeah, you're mamma's little baby, just another baby)
And you will trip to pick up after it
Domesticated bliss, ain't it? Oh no
I just want it to unfold
Simply simple
Oh, I'll do everything I'm told
Keep it simple

(Ohhhhh) Simply simple
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Simply simple
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I just want it to unfold
I'll do everything I'm told
(Oh) I just want it to unfold
(Oh) Simply simple

(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
