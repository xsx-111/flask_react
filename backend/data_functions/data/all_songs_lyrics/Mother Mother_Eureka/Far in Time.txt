Far in Time Lyrics
Buh, buh, buh, buh
Buh, buh, buh, buh
Buh

He don't walk along with anybody
He just walking with himself
And she don't stop to talk to anybody
She just talking to her own self
And you don't right a wrong for anybody
You just put it on your shelf
'Cause I don't get along with anybody
I just get on by myself, myself

We are so far in time
To be all apart

I could talk a lot of hot talk
At a pot luck with my peers
But the walls at home make up the right tone
Quiet, tender, sincere
A little ant hill go down the landfill
In a symbol of the age
Where the dying art be the sum of the parts
And apart is where we stay
I say
We are so far in time
To be all apart, to be all untied
From each other, each other
Oh yeah, we are so far in time

He be living by himself
She's alone up in her head
Are they alive or are they dead?
Just by themselves
All by themselves
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't walk along with anybody
And I don't stop to talk to anybody
And I don't right a wrong for anybody
Not for anybody, not for anybody, not for anybody
But myself
Yeah

We are
We are
We are
We are
We are
We are so far in time
To be all apart, to be all untied
From each other, each other
Oh yeah, we are so far in time (time, time)
Far in time (time, time)2Embed
