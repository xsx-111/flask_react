Born in a Flash Lyrics
Photograph, lookin' down at me
I'm lookin' at the past
Something about my family in high contrast
Something about my infancy in white and black
Something about my memories

In a photograph, a portrait of the past

Born in a flash
Oh-woah

Polaroid, 1954, it was a
Polaroid, '55 through '56
We're all destroyed, Daddy was an anarchist
We can't afford somebody catching wind of this here

Polaroid, a portrait of before

Born in a flash
Born in a flash
A little piece of the past
Born in a flash
Oh-woah
Ohhh, ah-ah-ahh ah-ah
Ahh-ahh, ah-ah-ah-ah

In a photograph, a portrait of the past

Born in a flash
Born in a flash
Born in a flash
Born in a fla-Embed
