Original Spin Lyrics
It's just the world, that's all it is
Toppling through outer space on a trip
It's just the world, big and round, now isn't it?
Some kind of tropical fish in a tropical storm
We dig a blade in the rib cage of an ice age
And we twist until it's warm
You know it's just the world (It was only Rome)
Trying to be something with an original spin

An unoriginal sin (I've sinned before)
Just with a bottle of gin, oh no
Wo, and the girl next door

I think it's spinnin' for mine, you think it's spinnin' for yours
It's spinnin' for sure, but if it's spinnin' for neither
Than really, can either of us be sure
Just what it's spinnin' for?

Oh yeah, it's just the world trying to be somethin'
Another Byzantine, or Palestinian
But with original spin, my friend
And an original sin (Oh look, I'm sinning again)
Another bottle of gin, a-ha
And my baby cakes
I think it's spinnin' for mine, you think it's spinnin' for yours
It's spinnin' for sure, but if it's spinnin' for neither
Than really can either of us be sure just what it's spinnin' for?

Oh yeah, it's just the world (Oh yeah)
A little place in outer space on a trip
It's just the world, where you're swimming or sinking
Makin' a bed, layin' in it, never to stop and think
"It might be spinnin' for Providence" Really it ain't
No, really it ain't, I know it's nice to say

I think it's spinnin' for mine, you think it's spinnin' for yours
It's spinnin' for sure, I think it's spinnin' for fun, fun, fu-fu-fun
It must be fun to make ol' Mother Earth shake

It's just the world, it's just the world
It's just the world, it's just the world3Embed
