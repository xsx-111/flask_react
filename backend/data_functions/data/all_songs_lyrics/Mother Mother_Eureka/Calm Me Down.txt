Calm Me Down Lyrics
Calm me down, calm me down
I'm inside out and upside down
Hold my head in your hands
To calm me down, get it out

Get it out, oh-oh, get it out
Use your teeth and your mouth
Cut in deep to pull it out
Oh no, I'm aroused now, I'm aroused

You better calm me down, oh, calm me down
Use your teeth and your mouth

Use your body
Use it to put me to sleep
Your body, oh
Soothe my soul
So beautiful

All my life, oh-oh, all my life
I hurt myself and cut myself
Put myself through living hell
All so I could feel what I felt
When you took me in
Absolved my sins
With your flesh and skin
Use your skin
Use your body
Use it to put me to sleep
Your body, oh
Soothe my soul
So beautiful

Calm me down
Baby
Your teeth, your mouth, and me
Happily married, baby
Calm me right down

Use your body
Use it to put me to sleep
Your body, oh
Use your body
Use it to put me to sleep
Your body, oh
Soothe my soul
So beautiful

(Ohhh, ohhh)
I wanna be a good man
Don't wanna be no has-been
I wanna be a real friend
Don't wanna break when I bend
I wanna be a sweet son
Don't wanna fight with my mom
I wanna be no seeker
I wanna scream eureka, ahh
I wanna scream eureka, ahh
I wanna scream eureka, ahhh4Embed
