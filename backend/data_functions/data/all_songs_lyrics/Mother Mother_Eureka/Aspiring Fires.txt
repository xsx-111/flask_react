Aspiring Fires Lyrics
Baby, so you think you know crazy?
I think you know what you know
But what you know you don't know for sure

Baby, you wanna see me crazy?
Well I'll show you what that's like
And then I'll wave goodbye as you run for your life

A little advice for aspiring fires:
You'll get put out if you don't get a little wild
Try again, try again, get it right
You don't got the due diligence to lose your mind
You're not getting it right, aye-yai-yai

Maybe, you're watching too much TV, hoo
Because crazy in the box
Is everything that crazy's not

A little advice for aspiring fires:
You'll get put out if you don't get a little wild
Try again, try again, get it right
You don't got the due diligence to lose your mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind again
I'll advise a friend
Not to try it if they ain't crazy


A little advice for aspiring fires:
You'll get put out if you don't get a little wild
Try again, try again, get it right
You don't got the due diligence to lose your mind
You're not getting it right, aye-yai-yai

Baby, (A little advice for aspiring fires:) (Baby!)
You wanna see me crazy? (You'll get put out if you don't get a little) (Crazy!)
Baby, (Try again, try again, get it right) (Babe!)
You wanna see me crazy? (You don't got the due diligence to lose your mind)
Oh-oh (You're not getting it right, aye-yai-yai)

Well I'll show you what that's like
And then I'll wave goodbye as you run for your lifeEmbed
