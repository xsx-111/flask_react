Getaway Lyrics
In a dream, on a wave
I could tunnel underground or I could float away
From it all, on a holiday, bon voyage
I want to get away from what I know

Ooh-ooh-oo-oo-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oo-oo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I could shoot into the sun (Shoot, ahh-ahh)
I could be the bullets of a gatling gun (Ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Disappear, another Dillinger on the run
I want to get away from everything and everyone

We gotta get away from it all
We gotta get away from everything we've come to know
We gotta get gone, like on a holiday but for longer
Away from all the silly things that haunt us

Ooh-ooh-oo-oo-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oo-oo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Ahh-ahh-ah-ah-ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh yeah)
I could explode
Oh, what I'd give to be a supernova
Oh. if I could be blown to bits, I would, yeah

We gotta get away from it all
We gotta get away from everything we've come to know
We gotta get gone, like on a holiday but for longer
Away from all the silly things that haunt us

And if you run from it, darling
Baby, would you think about taking me?

We gotta get away from it all
We gotta get away from it all
We gotta get away from it all
We gotta get away from it all2Embed
