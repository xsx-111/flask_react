Oleander Lyrics
You stood beside
Me when I
Was out of my mind
I broke the glass
And you were there
To sweep it aside

And if you leave me
Rest assured, it would kill me

I make a mess
And you'll be there
To help me undress
I'll be unclean
I'll be obscene
You'll be the rest

And if you leave me
Rest assured, it would kill me

Like an oleander
Light, white leaves
Of an oleander
White, like me
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ahhh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

I'm (I'm) like a child
In a sty
I play with fire
I burn you right out
I burned your bible
You tried to cry (Cry)
Put on a smile

And if you leave me
Rest assured, it would kill me
Rest assured, if you leave

Like an oleander
Light, white leaves
Of an oleander
White, like me
Oh, the oleander
Light, white leaves
Of an oleander
White, like me
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, aaahhh...
Mmmm...3Embed
