Since I Had You Lyrics
This is the story of two lovers who should have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance, they met at the neighbourhood dance
And got that old feeling all over again
He said, "How much have you missed me since I had you?"

How much? (Too much, many too much)
How much? (Too much, many too much)
Ooh I really wondered, girl
Wondered if you remember baby
How good you made it to me darling
Such a thrill, but it's been so hard since I had you baby
Ah sugar, come on, give me a break
'Cause it's been so hard since I had you baby

My eyes must look serious
'Cause when I look at you, I get delirious
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby

Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had your sugar
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had you baby
Big Daddy Rucker is sho 'nuff gettin' down
Ahhh, this is a mellow dance
Oh, baby its been such a long time
Remember when I used to do this to you?
Come on, let this be the last dance

Since I had you girl, I haven't wanted no other lover
Since I had you honey, there hasn't been no other woman, nah nah baby
Since I had you baby, there hasn't been no other woman, ahh
Since I taste your loving, I haven't seen no other woman, I wanna love you
Since I had you baby, there hasn't been no other woman
You might believe it, but since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman, aow1Embed
