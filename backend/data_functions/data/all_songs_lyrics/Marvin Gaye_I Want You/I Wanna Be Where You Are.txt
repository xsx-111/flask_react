I Wanna Be Where You Are LyricsI wanna be where you are
I got to be where you are
I want to be where you are
I got to be where you are
Good night, y'all
Good night, little Frankie, Nona
Night, little Marvin
I love you all
I'll always love you, Janis
I want to be where you are
Ah, I've got to be where you are, baby
Oh, my children, I'll always be where you areEmbed
