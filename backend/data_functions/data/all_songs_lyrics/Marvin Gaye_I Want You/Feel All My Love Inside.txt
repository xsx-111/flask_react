Feel All My Love Inside Lyrics
Do you have another J?
Yeah I want the wine, baby
Let's get naked

Now we're making love
Now we're making love
Now we're making love
Where'd you get such sweet sugar?

I'll be loving you day and night
In and out, wrong or right
'Cause I want you, baby, for my wife
Oh girl, you're so divine
You're everything I've ever wanted
You're everything that's on my mind
Is it real?

That we're making love
That we're making love
That we're making love
Oh, my
My, my, my, my
Keep right on kissing me
When I'm kissing you
I know you know
What this is leading to
You know real soon, baby

I'll be stroking you in and out, up and down, all around
I love to hear you make those sounds
I'm gonna be loving you in and out, up and down, all around
'Cause I love to hear you make those sounds
I'ma be stroking you in and out, up and down, all around
I love to hear you, baby, make those sounds, oh-oh, ooh
I'm taking you here and there and all around the world (Oh, baby)
I love you hear you, girl, make those sounds

Oh, angel, ooh
Oh, you're great baby
Best in the world
Oh, I need someone
Ooh, angel, be my prayer girl
Ooh-ooh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, sugar
My love so fine
Lay with me
Lay with me, babyEmbed
