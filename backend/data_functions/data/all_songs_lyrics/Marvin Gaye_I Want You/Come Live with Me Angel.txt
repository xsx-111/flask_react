Come Live with Me Angel Lyrics
Come live with me, angel
Come live with me in comfort

(I want to be your lover)
I want to understand your moods, baby
(I want to be your lover)
I really, really
(I want to be your lover)
When you want some solitude, sugar
(I want to be your lover)
You can have it, ooh yeah baby
(I want to be your lover)
Darling, please walk around nude (three times a day)
So I can get you baby
I want to intrude at least (three times a day)
In all the ways baby, whoo
You can have your way if you decide to stay
So


Ooh, this is where all your fantasies end
Let me explore all your treasures
I'll turn you on to all of those freakish pleasures
Good experienced company
Like me who knows all the ways
Is what you need baby
Just you and me locked up for days
After we eat breakfast in bed
Turn on the music for our head

Oh, Angel, come on Go with me
Please, come on go with me
I said please
Sweet little thing
It's no mystery
How much I want you
I want you baby
I want you
I want you, can't you see?
I'll give you everything
Sweet, little sexy thing
I want you to live with me
Come on Sweet thing
Come on live with me, girl
Come on baby5Embed
