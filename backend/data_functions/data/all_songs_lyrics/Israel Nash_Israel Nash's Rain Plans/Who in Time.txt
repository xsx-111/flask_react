Who in Time Lyrics
Blue fires on the highway
I could use some company
But what I saw the night before
Would throw  to the sea

Nothing here's what it seems
Who in time do you need?

Gather 'round the 
I think that 
Soon the moon split in two
Well, Father John is on the run

Nothing here's what it seems
Who in time do you need?
Nothing here's what it seems
Who in time do you need?


Nothing here's what it seems
Who in time do you need?
Who in time do you need?
Who in time do you need?
Who in time do you need?
Who in time do you need?
Who in time do you need?Embed
