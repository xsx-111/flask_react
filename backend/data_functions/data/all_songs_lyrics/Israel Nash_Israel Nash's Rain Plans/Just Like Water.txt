Just Like Water Lyrics
Hold me under, pull me down
Doubts of wonder you need around
These same fires will always last
It's just like water rollin' off my back

I keep having this old dream
From the city down in the country
All these spirits haunted by the past
It's just like water rollin' off my back
It's just like water rollin' off my back


My hands are heavy, so hold them up
When they fall down, well, the battle's lost
Blood will follow on these footsteps
It's just like water rollin' off my back
It's just like water rollin' off my back
