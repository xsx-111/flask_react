Through the Door Lyrics
Follow me to  country
Stick to the wires and the phones
I'll be around when the sun goes down
See the potter wheel spinning around

Bring your lovin' through the door
Bring your lovin' through the door
Bring your lovin' through the door
I could use a little more

Cast the stones, but aim to break my bones
They don't come around no more
I'll be alone, just north of San Antone
Where I'm runnin' out of miles

Bring your lovin' through the door
Bring your lovin' through the door
Bring your lovin' through the door
I could use a little more

Bring your lovin' through the door
Bring your lovin' through the door
Bring your lovin' through the door
(Bring your lovin' through the door)
Oh, bring it through the doorEmbed
