Myer Canyon LyricsNo day left
I'm a man alone
Find me broke down
Corn and stone
I took to the mountain
On my own
In four days
I'll be home

You are like the water
You drown like the sea
You are like the water
Driftin' away, away
Away from me
I took the tanker
Past the river bend
N' I moved too fast
And it threw me in

You are like the water
You drown like the sea
You are like the water
Driftin' away, away
Away from me
