Rexanimarum Lyrics
I was headin' to the show
Goin' uptown, to the Apollo
And catch me a glimpse of ol' Jimmy Brown
Someone told me that he had just died
I lowered my head and I started to cry
Stood up on 125th Street and I said
"Well, sing it loud, *I'm Black and Proud*"

Oh my baby, let's settle in
Take your worries and put fire to them
Pour me out just like sour wine
I've got the money if you got the time

I was talking to Truck Stop Betty
She was wringin' her hands and they was awfully sweaty
She said her mother died in Brooklyn just yesterday
Well, I said, "Betty, just hold your horses
Soon they're gonna be changing courses
We can live out on a Montana range
And it's a great place to raise the kids

Oh my baby, let's settle in
Take your worries and put fire to them
Pour me out just like sour wine
I've got the money so you'll be alright

Oh my baby, settle right on in
Take your worries and put fire to them
Pour me out just like sour wine
I've got the money if you've got the time

Oh my baby, settle right on in
Take your worries and put fire to them
Pour me out just like sour wine
I've got the money so you'll be alright
You're gonna be just fine
