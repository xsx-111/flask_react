Rain Plans Lyrics
I got rain plans
Written in these storms
When I throw it
Tell me where to go

Hold on there's a woman in my bed
And I want her to stay there
Hold on there’s a woman in my head
And I want her to stay there

I got rain plans
Tell us where we've been
I got new hands
To pawn us west again

Hold on there's a woman in my bed
And I want her to stay there
Hold on there’s a woman in my head
And I want her to stay there
