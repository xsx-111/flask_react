Mansions LyricsDon't you touch me
Don't attempt to flee
The way I see it
I don't owe you no time

You can hold us under
You need a leg to stand
You built your mansion on a rock
Just to find it sinking in the sand
When the gunman
He falls asleep
The lamb surrenders
And you move your feet

You can call us under
You need a leg to stand
You built your mansion on a rock
Just to find it sinking in the sand

By the pressure out under
Is it safe to land?
All the  makes me wonder
Through these lands
Through these landsEmbed
