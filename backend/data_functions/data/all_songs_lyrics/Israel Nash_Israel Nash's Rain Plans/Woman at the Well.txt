Woman at the Well Lyrics
Sweet little Laura, I'm up to no good
I'll keep my eyes steady like you said I should
Here in the valley I'm going to settle down
In the morning I might go east, in the evening I'm western bound

Find me floating down the river of gold
Find me floating down the river of gold
May these lands always see you home

Breathe in the fire and take the floodlights down
While the woman dressed in white, she pours water out
Sweet southern lady, I'm fading fast
Let's head to the cedar canyon and 

Find me floating down the river of gold
Find me floating down the river of gold
May these lands always see you home

Find me floating (down), find me floating down
Find me floating (down), find me floating down
Find me floating (down), find me floating down
Find me floating (down), find me floating downEmbed
