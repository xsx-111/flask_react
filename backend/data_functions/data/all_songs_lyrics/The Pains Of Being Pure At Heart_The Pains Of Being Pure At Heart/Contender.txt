Contender LyricsLook what you've done
Look what you've done
What do you have now?
Things that never come
I'm laying here in a dead end room
Is it time to come down?
At the back of a crowded scene
You saw the boys in white sing "I'm a pretender"
But you never were
You never were a contender
I heard your same old tune
Singing city sins like you were the first one
Gave up books for film
Gave up film for time
Now that you've got none
At the back of a crowded scene
You saw the boys in white sing "I'm a pretender"
At the back of a crowded scene
You saw the boys in white sing "I'm a pretender"
But you never were
You never were a contender
A contender
You never were a contender
You never were a contenderEmbed
