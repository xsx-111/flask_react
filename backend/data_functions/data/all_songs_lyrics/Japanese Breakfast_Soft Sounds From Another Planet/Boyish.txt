Boyish Lyrics
Your boyish reassurance is not reassuring
And I need it
And all of my devotion turns violent
If you go to her, don't expect to come home to me
To me

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off in general
So here we are, we're just two losers
I want you and you want something more beautiful

Lack of inhibition works wonders in revealing every demon
And all this confrontation, this suffering
What do you want from me?
If you don't like how I look, then leave

I can't get you off my mind
You can't get yours off the hostess
Watched her lips reserving tables
As my ugly mouth kept running

Love me
Love me7Embed
