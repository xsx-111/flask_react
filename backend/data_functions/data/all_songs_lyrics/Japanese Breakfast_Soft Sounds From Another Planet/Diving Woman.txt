Diving Woman Lyrics
I wanna be a woman of regimen
A bride in her home state
A diving woman of Jeju-do

I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it

The men have gone and left again
And no one's shocked or blames them
Another day is shot, my friend
I'm picking up the pieces
That's the third dead dog I've seen on this highway
These treads are wearing thin
When I get back there, baby
I'm gonna make it a home

You'll have it all
You'll have it all
We'll have it all
We'll have it all
I'll have it4Embed
