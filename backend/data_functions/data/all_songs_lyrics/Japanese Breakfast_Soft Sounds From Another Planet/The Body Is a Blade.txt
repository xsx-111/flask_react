The Body Is a Blade Lyrics
Try not to get so righteous
About what's fair for everyone
Find what's left in you
Channel something good

Try your best to slowly withdraw
From the darkest impulses of your heart
Try your best to feel and receive
Your body is a blade that cuts a path from day to day

Calling it off, our hoax of trying
What's this place if you're not here?
Emptied the house and staged it for buying
Wave goodbye to all your things


Try your best to slowly withdraw
Try your best to slowly withdraw
Your body is a blade that moves while your brain is writhing
Knuckled under pain, you mourn but your blood is flowing
