12 Steps Lyrics
I said something cruel, I can't say I quite regret it
Twelve steps into the smoking bar, I found you
Clothes engulfed in a bonfire, I begged you to my room
Begging still, all these years

Oh, looking back
How did I keep moving?
Didn't know that half of me was missing
It's easy to leave, easy to leave

So tell me, "I can't blame you, we let love run its course
And it's a little bit lonelier
I don't blame you, it's just our love ran its course
And that's a little bit hard"

Oh, looking back
Wasn't a thing to keep me
From running around in the wreckage that burned all season
It was easy to leave when you'd finally seen me

Now tell me, "I can't blame you, it's just that love ran its course
And it's a little bit lonelier
I don't blame you, we let love run its course
And it's a little bit hard
I can't blame you, he's the one that you wanted
Singing scenes from a restaurant
I can't blame you, it's just our love ran its course
And it's a love that's long gone"Embed
