Road Head Lyrics
You gave road head on a turnpike exit
Going home, going home
Last ditch desperate, like a makeshift siphon
Pump and run, pump and run
Pump and run, pump and run

Run, run
Run, run
Run

"Dream on, baby," were his last words to me
"Dream on, baby"
So dreaming baby took that corkscrewed highway
Lightless miles of big rigs
Lightless miles, miles and miles
