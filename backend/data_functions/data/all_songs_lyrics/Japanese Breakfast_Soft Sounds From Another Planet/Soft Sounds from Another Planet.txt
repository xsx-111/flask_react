Soft Sounds from Another Planet Lyrics
I wish I could keep you from abusing yourself for no reason at all
Counting backwards, things you endured
Pitting them up against happier lives

That's not the way to hurt me
That's not the way to hurt me
I'll show you the way to hurt me

In search of a soft sound from another planet
In search of a quiet place to lay this to rest
Striving for goodness while the cruel men win
There's no part of me left that can feel or hear it

They'll never let you hurt me
They'll never let you hurt me
I'll never let you hurt me
(Hurt me)4Embed
