Till Death Lyrics
All our celebrities keep dying
While the cruel men continue to win
You'd reassure me in a way you only can
Get these days to go by like the swaying of a ship

Your shape in the dark
Out of state, licensed to me
Public pool, Miller moon
Don't turn away, I'm still awake

Steering on hostile waves of panic
Like fighting a wheel that pulls to the right
I don't deserve you, but I'm giving it my best
Extol your sacrifice with fine caviars and aspics

Your voice in the night
Sing me to sleep, soothe this insomnia
Haunted dreams, stages of grief
Repressed memories
Anger and bargaining

Your embrace healing my wounds
Teach me to breathe, teach me to move
PTSD, anxiety, genetic disease
