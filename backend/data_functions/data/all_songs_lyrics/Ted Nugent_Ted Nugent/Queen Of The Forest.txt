Queen Of The Forest LyricsDo you remember her name
She's standing for a long long time
She's got the magic wand
To make it rain or sunshine
She's got the power to turn out the light
She's got he power over day and the night, oh yeah
You mess up when she's angry
Cause she can level your town
When she throws a temper-tantrum
It's like the sky is falling down
She's got the power to turn out the light
She's got the power over day and the night, oh yeah
She's the queen of the forest
Queen of the forest
Queen of the forest
She's the queen of the forest
She takes care of the creatures
She supplies all of their needs
With her they have a much better chance now
To stay happy and free
She got the power to turn out the light
She got the power over day and the night, oh yeah
She's the queen of the forest
Queen of the forest
Queen of the forest
The queen of the forest
She's the queen of the forest
Queen of the forestEmbed
