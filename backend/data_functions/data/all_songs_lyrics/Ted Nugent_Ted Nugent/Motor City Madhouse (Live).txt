Motor City Madhouse (Live) Lyrics
Woh, welcome to my town
High energy is all around tonight
Woh, you best beware
There's vi'lence in the air tonight. Huh
Well, Detroit city, she's the place to be
This mad dog town's gonna set you free

Oh, when do we mount the stage?
Gonna cause a mad dog rage
Ha ha ha ha ha
Woh, when you see my name
Gonna set this town a flame
That's right
Well, Detroit city's just the place to be
Murder town's gonna set you free tonight
Oh, no, ow!

Woh, those fortified motor cars
High energy, and it's all ours
Ha ha ha ha ha
Dig this
Woh, such a heavy place for the boys and girls
It's the murder capital of the world
Yeow!
Well, Detroit city, she's the place to be
Mad dog town gonna set you free
I say
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse

It's such a madhouse, I can hardly get next to myself

Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouse
Motor City madhouseEmbed
