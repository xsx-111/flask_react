You Make Me Feel Right At Home LyricsCruisin' down the highway of life so long
You barely remember my name
Something you do brings me back to life
I can barely feel the pain
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
Another night, another town ahead
I'm on that road again
That something you do brings me back to life
It's so good to have a friend
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
Because of that I'll never leave you alone
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
Because of that I'll never leave you alone
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
Because of that I'll never leave you alone

You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
Cruisin' down the highway of life so long
You barely remember my name
Something you do brings me back to life
It's so good to have a friend
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
Because of that I'll never leave you alone
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at home
You make me feel right at homeEmbed
