Stranglehold Lyrics
Here I come again now baby
Like a dog in heat
You tell it's me by the clamor now, baby
I like to tear up the street

Now I've been smoking for so long
You know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold baby
You best get out of the way


Road I cruise is a bitch now baby
You know you can't turn me 'round
If a house gets in my way baby
You know I'll burn it down

You ran that night that you left me
You put me in my place
Got you in a stranglehold now baby
Then I crushed your face


Sometimes you gonna get higher
Sometimes you gotta start low
Some people think they gonna die someday
I got news you never got to go

Come on, come on up;
Come on come on up;
Come on come on up;
Come on come on up;
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Come on, come on, come on, come on up
Come on come on come on come on baby
Come on come on come on

The road I cruise is a bitch now
You know you can't turn me 'round
If a house gets in my way
You know I'll burn it down

You ran that night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold baby
And then I crushed your face2Embed
