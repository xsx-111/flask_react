Hey Baby LyricsHey baby, tell me why you hangin 'round
Ain't got time for kissin I'm too busy messin in this town
All you pretty women, you're so far an' in between
I don't need no fancy types I need the ones that's clean
Hey baby, jump into the back of my Ford
I'm gonna give you a ride baby, you never could afford
Hey baby
Hey baby
So
Follow me down the miles baby I'll show you the real love game
Yes I will
Hey baby, jump into the back of my car
I'm gonna hug and kiss you baby I'm gonna stir your heart
All you pretty women, you're so far an' in between
I don't need no fancy types I need the ones that's clean
Hey baby, I don't want you hangin 'round
I ain't got time for kissin I'm too busy steppin in this town
Hey baby
Hey baby
So
Follow me down the miles baby I'll show you the real love game
You know what I'm talkin about baby
Here we go
Hey baby, tell me why you hangin 'round
Ain't got time for nothin steady I'm too busy runnin 'round
All you pretty women, you're so far an' in between
I don't need no fancy types I need the ones that's clean
Hey baby, jump into the back of my car
I'm gonna give you love babe that's gonna stir your heart
Hey baby
Ooooooooh
Hey baby
I wantcha to
Follow me down the miles baby
I'll show you the real love game
Love game
