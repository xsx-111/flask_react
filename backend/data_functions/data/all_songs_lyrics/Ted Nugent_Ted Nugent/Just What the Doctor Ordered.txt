Just What the Doctor Ordered LyricsI got my guitar when I was ten years old
Found a love in rock an' roll
Now I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown
I'm gonna give my body and soul
It's so crazy
But you know that I like it
I've found a cure for my body and soul
I've got me an overdose of rock and roll
I jammed everyday
I jammed every night
I practiced till I knew all the licks
Now I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown
I don't know the meaning of quit
It's so crazy
Yes you know, but I like it
It crushes my head, my brain is on the border
But this is what the doctor ordered
Yes, it is
I jammed everyday
I jammed every night
I practiced till I knew all the licks
Now I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown
I don't know the meaning of quit
It's so crazy
But I like it
It crushes my head, my brain is on the border
But this is what the doctor orderedEmbed
