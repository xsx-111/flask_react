Set Me Free (Reprise) LyricsSet me free
Let me help you see
Come on, just let me show you what we could be
Baby I got the key
Baby I got the key
Baby I got the key
Set me free
Let me help you see
Come on, just let me show you what we could be
Baby I got the key
Baby I got the key
Oh honey
Your eyes
It's a day's work
Just to look into them
"Think it's gonna end pretty soon"Embed
