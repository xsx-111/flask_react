Hypnotized LyricsHer sweet kiss it elevates my soul
Honey I ain’t blind
It’s lit up all around my soul
Left me hypnotised
It’s sweeter than I knew, Lord
Sweetest thing that I’ve known or saw
Jesus, sweeter than the life you lived
Lord, hypnotize my soul
Well, babe turn on
Well, babe turn on
Her sweet touch it dances through my blood
Sets my heart on fire
It’s lit up all around my soul
Takes me higher and higher
It’s got everything and so much more
Never known a love like it before
Jesus, sweeter than the life you lived
Lord, hypnotize my soul
Well, babe turn on
Well, babe turn it on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh, girl turn on
Well, babe turn it on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh…
I don’t know just where I am goin’ to
But I know I’m goin’ there with you
Well, babe turn it on
Well, babe turn on
Well, babe turn on
Well, babe turn on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh, girl turn on
Oh, girl turn it on
Oh, girl turn it on
Oh…Embed
