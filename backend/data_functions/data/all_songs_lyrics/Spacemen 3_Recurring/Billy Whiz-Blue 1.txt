Billy Whiz/Blue 1 LyricsMet up with Mary Anne
She introduced me to Billy Whizz
Said he had a lot to do
But I don’t recon that he got it done
Lord I fucked with Mary Anne
I think I whispered in her ear
I can see for miles and miles
I don’t even open my eyes
I don’t even open my eyes
Met up with Mary Anne
She introduced me to Billy Whizz
Said he had a lot of fun
But after a while it all turned blue
Lord I floated for a while
Frozen hand and frozen tongue
I can see for miles and miles
I don’t even open my eyes
I don’t even open my eyes
Gonna wake up in the mornin’
I cry alone
I cry alone
I’m on fire
I’m on fire
I’m on fireEmbed
