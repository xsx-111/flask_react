I Love You LyricsI stand accused
You know that’s true
I’ve been abused
But what could I do?
Ah, but what could I do?
‘Cos honey I love you
Oh honey I love you
Oh honey I love you
Oh honey I love you
But what could I do?
I got somethin’ to tell you
Oh little girl
I’ve been searchin’
I’ve been searchin’ all around the world
I got somethin’ to tell you
Pretty honey child
I’ve been searchin’, girl
Searchin’ far and wide
And now I’ve got you girl
Sittin’ by my side
Sittin’ here laughin’ and smilin’
I’m so glad I tried
‘Cos honey I love you
‘Cos honey I love you
‘Cos honey I love you
‘Cos honey I love you
Oh, what could I do?
You know bars cannot hold me
And brute force cannot control me now
I wanna show you that I love you girl
More than anything in the whole wide world
But what could I do?
‘Cos honey I love you
Oh honey I love you
Oh honey I love you
Oh honey I love you
What else could I do?
Yes my friend, my good friend
Well set me free
Yes my friend, my good friend
Well set me free again
Well set me free
Free
Oh set me free
Free
Oh set me free
Free
Oh set me free
Free, free, free
Oh set me free
I’ve been sittin’ here thinkin’
Listenin’ to my radio
Well I’ve been sittin’ here thinkin’
Listenin’ to my radio
Well I’ve been sittin’ here all week
Now I’ve gotta get up and go
Let’s go!Embed
