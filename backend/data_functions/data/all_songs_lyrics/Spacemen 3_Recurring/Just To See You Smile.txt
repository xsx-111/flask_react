Just To See You Smile LyricsJust to see you smile
Just to see you smile
Again
Honey, oh, I’d like to walk you home, babe
Walk you home, babe
I’d like to walk you home
Don’t ever change, babe
Don’t ever change
Just to see you smile
Just to see you smile
Again
I’ll love you ‘till the end of time
‘Till the end of time
I’ll always love you
Just to see you smile
Just to see you smile
Again
Honey, oh you know I love you, babe
You know I love you babe
You know I love you
You know I do, babe
You know I do
Oh, just to see you smile
Just to see you smile
Again
Honey, don’t ever change babe
Just to see you smile
Just to see you smile
