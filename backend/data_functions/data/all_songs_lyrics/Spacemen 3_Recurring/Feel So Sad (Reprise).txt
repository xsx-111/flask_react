Feel So Sad (Reprise) LyricsSweet Lord, I know
I hate this lonely life so
Lord, I know
It goes so slow
I feel so alone, sweet Lord
Sweet Lord, it’s a sin
To live this life sufferin’
Lord, I pray
I long for a change
But it still remains, sweet Lord
Sweet Lord, is this my fate?
To live my life in this state
Lord, I know
Time goes slow
I feel so alone, sweet Lord
Sweet Lord, I pray
Take this bitterness away
I feel so sad
Feel so sad
Feel so sad
I feel so sad, sweet LordEmbed
