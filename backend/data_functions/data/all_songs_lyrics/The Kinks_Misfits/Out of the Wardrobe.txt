Out of the Wardrobe Lyrics
Has anybody here seen a chick called Dick
He looks real burly but he's really hip
He's six feet tall and his arms are all brown and hairy

Well, he married Betty Lou back in '65 when you had to be butch to survive
But lately he's been looking at his wife with mixed emotions
You see, he's not a commonplace closet queen
He shouldn't be hidden, he should be seen
'Cos when he puts on that dress
He looks like a princess

The day he came out of the wardrobe
Betty Lou got quite a surprise
She didn't know whether she should get angry or not bat an eye
She really couldn't call up her mama
Mama would positively die
Should she go or stay or should she try to get a trial separation

You see, he's not a faggot as you might suppose
He just feels restricted in conventional clothes
'Cos when he puts on that dress, he feels like a princess
He's not a dandy, he's only living out a fantasy
He's not a pansy, he's only beeing what he wants to be
Now his life is rearranged and he's grateful for the change
He's out of the wardrobe and now he's got no regrets

Betty Lou didn't know what to do at first
But she's learning how to cope at last
She's got the best of both worlds
And she's really in a state of elation
She says it helps their relationship
She says a change is as good as a rest
And their friends are finally coming 'round to their way of thinking
She wears the trousers and smokes the pipe
And he washes up and she helps him wipe
'Cos when he puts on that dress
He looks like a princess

He's out of the wardrobe and he's feeling all right
He's out of the wardrobe and he's feeling satisfied
Now it's farewell to the past
The secret's out at last
He's out of the wardrobe and now he's got no regretsEmbed
