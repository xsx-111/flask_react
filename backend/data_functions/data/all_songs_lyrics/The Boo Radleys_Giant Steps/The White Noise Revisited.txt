The White Noise Revisited LyricsHey! what's that noise?
Do you remember?
Kill yourself at work for what seems nothing at all
Then you go home and you cry and you feel so
Very small, so you listen to the beatles and relax and close your eyes
And you feel it running thru you
Feel the hate well up inside
Hey! what's that noise?
Do you remember?
Fashioned by the blade of a world that doesn't care
Feeling so removed, drifting thru stealing air then...
Pause and think about it, try to move and shift the
Scream and feel alive
Hey! what's that noise?
Do you remember?Embed
