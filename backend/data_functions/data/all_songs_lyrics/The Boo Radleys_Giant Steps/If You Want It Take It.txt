If You Want It Take It LyricsCall the cops and make it loud
Nowhere to hide away
Nothing to bribe them with
I've got nothing against not being
Proud, to me it's alright
Grab what's going and make it
Mine, no sense in hanging
Round waiting for hand-me downs
I don't worry about being proud
As long as I'm alright
If you want it, make it yours
There's nothing bright about being
Undecided
If you want it, take it all
There's nothing cool about having
To go withoutEmbed
