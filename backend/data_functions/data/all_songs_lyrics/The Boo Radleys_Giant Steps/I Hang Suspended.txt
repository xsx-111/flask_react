I Hang Suspended Lyrics(...700 hertz)
Ain't that just you
You know the facts, but you
Haven't got a clue
About me or my life, why don't
You try and take the time
Till then what am I supposed
To do? but then that's just
Like you to leave me
I hang suspended on your
Words, yeah you leave me
I hang suspended on your words
Don't you care? I don't read
Minds and I did I'd be
Elsewhere, tell me what's on
Your mind so I can rectify in
Time, or else I won't know
What I'm to do, but then that's
Just like you to leave me
I hang suspended on your wordsEmbed
