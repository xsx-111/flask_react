Leaves and Sand LyricsGreet the world with tired
But something just ain't right
Head of dust and leaves and sand
Creeping past your window
I can see the face of love and pain
Behind your smile
Always the same
Rub my eyes try and use my mind
Dull jewel inactive fire
Come to terms with things at hand
Creeping past my window
Swore you smelt self-loathing
Feeling shame you raised your smileEmbed
