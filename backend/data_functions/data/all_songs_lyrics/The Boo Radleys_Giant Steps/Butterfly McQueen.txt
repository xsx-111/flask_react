Butterfly McQueen LyricsI've finally broke your cool!
Leave my things just where they are
I didn't think it would go this far
Makes no sense no sense at all
That's why this bird must fly away
Finally broke the rule!
Butterfly you made me say
I'd never leave but I can't stay
I'd never hurt you willingly
But it's time this bird must fly away
Bird must fly today
Butterfly away
(butterfly speaks)
What am I supposed to do now that
Love's gone away, take my life, take
My air, release me from this
Body, I'll go anywhere!
I feel you rising Butterfly McQueenEmbed
