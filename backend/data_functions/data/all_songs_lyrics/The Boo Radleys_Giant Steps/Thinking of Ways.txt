Thinking of Ways LyricsJust drop me here I can find my way clear back to my house, I'm finding
It hard trying to stay on my feet on
My own i'm thinking of ways I can
Get out of things just like always
With a head full of beer I will try
And tell someone tonight
I gotta get away step on the gas
Go giles! (go, go)
... later
I'll just have one more then I'll have
To be going, someone's waiting
I'll just have one more, it can't do
Any harm anymore, I'm thinking
Of ways I can get out of things
Just like always with a head full of beer
I will try and tell someone tonightEmbed
