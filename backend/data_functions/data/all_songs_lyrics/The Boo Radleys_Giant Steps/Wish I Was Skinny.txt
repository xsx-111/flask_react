Wish I Was Skinny LyricsWishin' I was skinny
Wishin' that the whole world knew my name
Wishin' I was thrillin'
That I would never be to blame
Wishin' I was kissin'
A girl with lips smooth as pearl
Wishin' I was pretty
Wish that I could wrap the world round my finger
Wishin' I had money
Wishin' for the time to spend it all
Wishin' I was pretty
Wish that I could twist the world round my finger
But I would always love you
I guess that would never changeEmbed
