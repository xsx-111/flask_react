Lazarus LyricsI must be losing my mind
I keep on trying to find a way out
But it's ok you don't lock the door anymore
I, you know I never go out
And you know that I start to forget things
But it's ok they weren't essential anyway
I, and when I start to look back
I feel like I've spent my whole life just kicking round
And not getting in the way
And now, and maybe now I should change
Because I'm starting to lose all my faith
While those around me are beaten down each dayEmbed
