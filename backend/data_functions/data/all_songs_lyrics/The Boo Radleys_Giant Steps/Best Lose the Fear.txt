Best Lose the Fear LyricsThe pure lights beckon
And the music calls
But you're trapped inside
Those four walls
It's not your fault that
She has changed
It's not her fault
You're still the same
You both work hard
And you feel the pace
But you're the one who
Knows it's not a race
To be won
And I know you'd like to disappear
You'd like to lose the fear
You dream the love you had
Is near
You feel so down cos you
Haven't been out
Your ears are still sore
From the latest bout
Something's gonna have to change
Arrangements must be re-arranged
And I know you'd like to disappear
You'd like to lose the fear
You dream the love you had
Is near
You know you must go
But you're frightened to leave
You'd love to stay but
You're too scared to breatheEmbed
