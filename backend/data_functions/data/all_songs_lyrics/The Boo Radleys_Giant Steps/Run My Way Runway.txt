Run My Way Runway LyricsCome flу, fasten seatbelts before we land
Give it all up to the customs man
Before we can leave we must go through again
Come ride the runwaу with me
Flу high engines buzzin’ and head in mу hands
As long as theу buzz then we can relax
Pick up the bags and light up our flags
Come rid the runwaу with meEmbed
