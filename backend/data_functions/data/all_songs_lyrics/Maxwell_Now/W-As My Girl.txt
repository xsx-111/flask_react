W/As My Girl LyricsTurn the lights down low, something you gotta see, yeah
Gotta let you know all that's here in me
Say you wanna go so we can both break free, lady, lady
You won't open up wide
How can you not open up wide?
How could you do that to me, child?
When you know, know I love you, girl
Turn the lights down low, tell me what you could see, yeah
Tell me what you know 'bout everything you and me
Baby if you wanna go, I got a place we can be, lady, lady
How could you not wanna, wanna, wanna open, open wide?
How could you make me ride?
How could you, how could you do that to me, why?
When you know that I love you, girl
Love you girl
Turn the lights down low
Gotta see, yeah
Gotta let you know1Embed
