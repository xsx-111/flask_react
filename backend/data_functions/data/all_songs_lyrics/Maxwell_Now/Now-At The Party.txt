Now/At The Party Lyrics
Now I know, Now I found
Now I feel just like this
So united
Now I feel somethin' special
I can't even describe it to ya

Let's try not to let the negative erupt, keep it rockin'
Keep it rockin' babe, you don't stop babe
When i'd much rather watch my people movin' it up, at the party
Yeah, party

Now we cool, Now we fine, Now we good
Everything is dyn-o-mite
Now in fact ya'll
We gon' be alright tonight, yeah

Let's try not to let the negative erupt, keep it rockin'
When i'd much rather watch my people movin' it up, at the party
Party, at the party
Keep it rockin' babe, you don't stop babe
At the party
Party
At the party
Party
I'd much rather watch my people movin' it up, at the party, Party
At the party
You don't stop, yeah, yeahEmbed
