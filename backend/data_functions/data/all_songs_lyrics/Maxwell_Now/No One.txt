No One Lyrics
If I had to do it over, If I had to do it again
I would've known too and this would have never began
If I made you claustrophobic, picture if I gave you an inch
You'll never know this, but there's no one quite like, no one quite like you

I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
I can do better, but there's no one quite like you
I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
I can do better, but there's no one quite like you
(guitar plays)

If I made you love me again (If I made you love me again)
If I made you want it again (If I made you want it again)
If I gave it you probably wouldn't want it, babe
It's alright cause there's no one quite like you

I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
I can do better, but there's no one quite like you
I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
I can do better, but there's no one quite like you
I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
I can do better, but there's no one quite like youEmbed
