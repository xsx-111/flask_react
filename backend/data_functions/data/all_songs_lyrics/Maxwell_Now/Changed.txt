Changed Lyrics
Back when I was 4 or 3
Clouds came rushing round into my sunshine
Clouds got a hold of me they brought me way, way down
Clouds so my baby believed but you were not around

So, now, what you trying to be
What you trying to, trying to do to me
You got me catching feelings with an urgency
Now that I've changed my mind

Sorry, I wasn't sure of your love
Ooh, sorry so once afraid that you would figure out the crutch
Then make a move and come and go and go and leave me
Like the others left me, when things got deep
Before you make me go girl, promise you won't do that to me, baby

Now, what you trying to be
What you trying to, trying to do to me
You got me catching feelings in the third degree
Now that I've changed my mind
Everything was just fine
When you wanted to ruin my life
Now it's plain and easy for me to see
Now that I've changed my mind, oh
Now that I don't want to settle the score game
I ain't never felt so free
Now that I don't want to hurt no more
There's plenty more left for me

'Cuz everything was just fine
You wanted to ruin my life
And it's plain for me to see
Now that I've changed my mind
So, now what you trying to be
What you trying to be, trying to do to me
Oh, feelings in the third degree
Now that I've changed my mind
Now what you trying to be
Trying to do to me
Feelings with an urgency
Now that I've changed my mind
So, now what you trying to be
Trying to do to me
Feelings in the third degree
Now that I've changed my mind
Now that I've changed my mindEmbed
