For Lovers Only LyricsThis ain't for the ones
That just love for fun
That just love and run
That just hold the gun
This is for those that bleed
That want but have no need
This ain't for the war
This is only
For lovers only
Lovers only, yeah
Strictly for the lovers only
Who are lost and lonely
Ever since the way you looked at me
Love is not a want, love is now a need
This is if you want to hold me
Or for lovers only
Not for the easy
This ain't about that style
This about a take it day by day
This about a wait that's worth it baby
Ever since the way you look at me
Ever since the way
Love is not a want, love is now a need
Now a need
Not just 'cuz I got nobody
Not just 'cuz I got nobody
This is only
For lovers only
Lovers only, yeah
This is for the lovers only
Who are lost and lonely
Ever since the day you look at me
Ever since the way
Love is not a want, love is now a need
Now a need
This is for the lovers only
For lovers only
For lovers only
Lovers only
Lovers onlyEmbed
