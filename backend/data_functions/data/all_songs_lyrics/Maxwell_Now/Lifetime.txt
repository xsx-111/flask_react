Lifetime Lyrics
I was reborn when I was broken
I wouldn't believe, I wouldn't believe, no
Been through a storm, no use in hoping
That you would come rescue me
Somehow your love set me free

And I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime

There was a time when love wasn't chosen
Now I'm just open for more
Now I'm just reaching out for something better
That I had before, girl
There ain't a bottom line in your world

Ooh, and I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can just try and try
I can move to the light
Oh, if I take it one day at a time
Oh, spread my love out and fly, oh, I
(I can move to the light)
Ooh, I can just make you understand
That love is not a fairy tale in a melody
If you want it you can have it, girl
Maybe you will see, maybe you will see
Lifetime, lifetime

Ooh, and I, I can let my life pass me by
I can just try and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can just, alright now
Lifetime, lifetime
I can let my life pass me by
Work it on
Lifetime, lifetime
I can let my life pass me by
There's no way, there's no way
I won't leave you, I won't leave
Lifetime, lifetime
I can let my life pass me by
Oh, you're so mine, baby
Lifetime, lifetime1Embed
