Temporary Nite Lyrics
Earthquake in the makin'
I'm gonna love you
When you persist with all that shakin'
What you expect me to do
It's more than just the bacon
It's somethin' about you insides too
You know I've been waitin'
Waitin' on the wall for you

So if ever you should question
If I'll spend the night with you
You and me what we gonna do
A temporary night for two
Don't change a lonely afternoon

I been misbehavin'
I been thinkin' nasty thoughts about you
I'm sorry baby
I never said I was an angel
Who could be with a fine as, fine as you
Move that body go ahead and cast that corporal spell
And if they ask me baby I promise not to tell
If I'll spend the night with you
You and me what we gonna do
A temporary night for two
Don't change a lonely afternoon

It's your style, your soul and
Those personalities
Temporary night
It's not the typical, no bull baby
Want you as a wife
Want you all my life, yeah
2x
If I'll spend the night with you
You and me what we gonna do
A temporary night for two
Don't change a lonely afternoonEmbed
