Silently LyricsYeah, look at you

Look at you, you look fine, how do you do?
Been a while since alone in your room
Been around, but haven't found no one like you
Don't you know girl there's no one like you

And you hear me
Hear my emotions creep slowly
Hear with your heart, baby
Don't speak
Now with your soul tell me
Silently

Tell me, you know each thought without a word
You see me through
Sorry now that I ever doubted you
I don't know what I can do, to make you come true
Think that you should know
There's no one like you

And how you are
Your mind and heart
Nine times the soul
Nine times the soul
There's no one like you
And you hear me, baby
My emotions creep slowly, slowly
Hear with your heart, baby
Don't speak
Now with your soul tell me
Silently
Tell me
Silently
Ah baby, me

Love the way you
With your mind and my body soul
If you ain't told, you got to know
I'm willin' to show you if you want to know

Know me
Hear my emotions, scream slowly
Hear with your heart, baby
Don't speak
Hear intertwine screamin'
Silently
Screamin' silently
Don't you scream
You're my divine
Don't you scream
Slowly
Touch you, hear what you want baby
Don't speak
Say with your heart
Silently
Tell me
Silently
