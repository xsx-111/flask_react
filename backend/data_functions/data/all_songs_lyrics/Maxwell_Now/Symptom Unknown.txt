Symptom Unknown Lyrics
There's an ocean drained of all it's been
Took a bath, but I just can't get clean
Wonder when you'll show
If not, everything is in between

You and I were supposed to grow old
Guess it was a symptom unknown

There's a power that knows just how you feel
We were prone to feel a love not real, oh yeah
Wonder when you'll show
If not, I'm gonna feel what I feel

You and I were supposed to grow old
It was your symptom unknown
Blame it on things untold
You and I were supposed to grow old
Guess it was a symptom unknown
Guess it was them things that you hold
Guess it was the way you were cold
I guess it was, yeah
There's a child that used to smile
There's a man that used to feel as if whole, oh why?
What am I supposed to do without you close?
Who am I supposed to try to toast?
No, what am I supposed to do? Ooh
If you don't show me, if you don't show me1Embed
