Get to Know Ya Lyrics
They be trying to bring you flowers
You prefer your roses blue
Others was trying to get in your trousers
I was just trying to get in you
I was just trying to get with you, honest
That's why them boys be scared of you
You never let them get past pajamas
Oh, when you find the time
How can I get to know ya?

Yo' name, number, game
Tell me anything
I gotta get to know ya
Yo' way, the words you'd probably say
When you want, I'll be here baby
Longing to know ya

I know that, you'll never see me
I know that, I'm not your style
I know that, you don't need me
But you do, you drive my dreams wild
Lady I got to know ya
Name, number, game
Oh, I gotta get to know ya
Yo' way, the words you'd probably say
When you want, I'm right here baby
Longing to know ya
Feel me, uhh yeah
Know you
Ha ha, know ya, ooh
I gotta get to know ya
Lady, I gotta know, know, know
Yo' name
Tell me anything
I gotta get to know ya
Tell me anything
Longing to know ya
Know you
Ha ha know ya, ooh
Longing to know ya
Know you
Ha ha, know ya, ooh
I gotta get to know ya
Know you
Ha ha, know ya, ooh
