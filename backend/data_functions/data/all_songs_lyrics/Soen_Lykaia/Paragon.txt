Paragon Lyrics
Step into this somber storm
Endless walk
Seeking home
Winds of yearning, clouds of harm
Aching haze
Soon be gone

What if I
Let you go?
I hear a silent voice
Time is a river
Echoing words meant to hurt

Blow the candles, kiss the thorns
Dry the tears
Soon be gone
Fields of time, sorrow shows
All your fears
Soon be gone

What if I
Let you go?
I hear a silent voice
Time is a river
Echoing words meant to hurt2Embed
