Opal Lyrics
In your heart lies a devotion for starting pyres
To drown your brother within the mire
You pledged allegiance to gold

In your art, your words laid out in a vacuous manner
The mind is there but the soul is absent
With smoke and mirrors you reign

Time will show
Throwing your own
Into the fire
Vengeance comes
One day we'll form a

Tidal wave
Come rushing all over and
Come tear down this wall of lies until nothing remains
Turn away, beware don't be led astray
By vultures that turn our temple to a house of trade

Sleeper kin
A popinjay with a gaudy plumage
Proclaiming lies like a gutless coward
Until your senses are numb

Tidal wave
Come rushing all over and
Come tear down this wall of lies until nothing remains
Turn away, beware don't be led astray
By vultures that turn our temple to a house of trade

And I know
Yes I know
That all this little things
Are coming back to haunt you
They'll tear you down in the end
Colliding with your dreams
And burning all you stand for


Turn away, don't be led astray
From false perceptions
No more lies, no more disguise
No false pretenders
Stand your ground
Don't wander away
Don't fall apart
Ask yourself, in trouble
Am I my brother's keeper?Embed
