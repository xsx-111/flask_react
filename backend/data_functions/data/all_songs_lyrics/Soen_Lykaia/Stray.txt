Stray Lyrics
Since we were born
We grew up apart
And I know those years were hard
But our dreams will come true
And I'll always stand by you

For all the countless hours you have fought
For all the times you've lost your cause

When tears are in your eyes
Don't hold it inside
'Cause you don't need to hide
I'll be by your side
I'll do what I must
I hope that you trust in me

I know you remember you were taken away
How they didn't let you stay
And I still owe you 'till this day
It should have been me in your place

For all the times in hardship on your own
All the nights you met them all alone
For all the broken promises you've had
All the times without a helping hand
Tears are in your eyes
Don't hold it inside
'Cause you don't need to hide no more
I'll be by your side
I'll do what I must
And I hope that you trust in me

Tears are in your eyes
Don't hold it inside
'Cause you don't need to hide anymore
I'll be by your side
I'll do what I must
And I hope that you trust me this timeEmbed
