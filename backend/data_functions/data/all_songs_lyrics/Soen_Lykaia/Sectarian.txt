Sectarian Lyrics
Eradicate all life
The ones I touch the earth will swallow
I bless them with demise
This burning field my ghost will hallow
Run away and leave it all
Run away and leave it all

Leave the trail for a moment
Change the course for a while
And give in to the presence
Conceding a severed utopia

Let me rest in your cradle
Suffocate by your hand
Be embraced by the rotten
Immoral perverted vile

Let the skies rain
On the weak and the fallen
Let them reach faith
And be saved by your glory
Tonight the wait will end
Signs left a trace
And you'll return unharmed
Free of all the pain
Keep me close to the marrow
Part my skin from the bone
Any thoughts of rebellion
Are captured and hooked up to a chain

When my spirit is broken
And my will disconnects
A mirage of existence
Will carry this life into the next

Let the skies rain
On the weak and the fallen
Let them reach faith
And be saved by your glory
Tonight the wait will end
Signs left a trace
And you'll return unharmed
Free of all the pain

Hollow, shadow
Guide me out of the shame
Faceless, tyrant
Let the fear be my fate
Let the fear be my fateEmbed
