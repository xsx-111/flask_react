Sister Lyrics
Stones are sinking in the lake of desperation
Hope and strength wither away like leaves in winter
Tongue is numb from all the pills and bitter liquids
Memories do hurt and always will erase my comfort

Sister can you hear me
Sister can you see me
Feel my light, hear my sigh

We are so fragile in the end
A pile of petals
Waiting to be scattered away
By the wind of destiny

Sister can you hear me
Sister can you see me
Feel my light, hear my sigh
(Hear my sigh)

Promise me you're giving it a try
Promise me you're strong enough to fight
Sister, you're falling through the sky
Sister, I need a reason why
Heal my life, hear my cries
Heal my life, hear my criesEmbed
