Ritalin Lyrics
All the pockets in my favorite coat
Have developed holes
I'm losing change in the lining
Conversation seems impossible
If I may be so bold
As to coax you out of hiding

This body's getting warmer
It feels much better than mine
This body's getting warmer
It feels much better than mine

Way up popping Ritalin with my friends
I wait up, I'm a visitor to them
I can't see straight, see anything
I can't see straight, see anything
And likely I'm hard to adore

Am I the reason that you bite your tongue
Or do you marvel at how clever I've become?

This body's getting warmer
It feels much better than mine
This body's getting warmer
It feels much better than mine
Way up popping Ritalin with my friends
I wait up, I'm a visitor to them
I can't see straight, see anything
I can't see straight, see anything
And likely I'm hard to adore

I waited up all night
She's an actress
I waited up all night
She's an actress

Way up popping Ritalin with my friends
I wait up, I'm a visitor to them
I can't see straight, see anything
I can't see straight, see anything
And likely I'm hard to adore
Way up popping Ritalin with my friends
I wait up, I'm a visitor to them
I can't see straight, see anything
I can't see straight, see anything
And likely I'm hard to adoreEmbed
