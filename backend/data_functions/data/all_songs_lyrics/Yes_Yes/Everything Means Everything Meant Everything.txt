Everything Means Everything Meant Everything Lyrics
We trace our names on dirty glass
But our initials wouldn't last
Collect my things off the floor
All you gave me was indifference

Every time she changes her lipstick
Every time she changes her lipstick

She said that
It meant everything
She said that
Everything means everything
Means everything meant everything
To me

I hope my funeral is short and sweet
Without the frill or pageantry
Collect my things off the floor
All you gave me was indifference

Every time she changes her lipstick
Every time she changes her lipstick
She said that
It meant everything
She said that
Everything means everything
Means everything meant everything
To me

Every time she changes her lipstick
Every time she changes her lipstick
Changes her lipstick
Changes her lipstickEmbed
