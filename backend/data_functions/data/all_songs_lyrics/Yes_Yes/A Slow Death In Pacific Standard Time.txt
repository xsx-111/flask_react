A Slow Death In Pacific Standard Time Lyrics
You know that I hate your friends
They make you insecure
Like the time that you were locked out of your house
And no one showed to let you in
To let you know you mean something to them
You mean something to them
You mean something to them

And I watch from afar
You're the knife in my side
But I don't mind, I kinda like it

Desperate, uptight and lately unkind
Desperate, desperate
For taking the longest way to get out of my mind

I know that you hate my friends
They make you so insecure, I'm sure

That we watch from afar
You're the knife in my side
But I don't mind, I kinda like it
Desperate, uptight and lately unkind
Desperate, desperate
For taking the longest way to get out of my mind

(Well, well, well, well)
Somehow it starts
With hi and ends with
"I'm sorry this didn't go as I planned"

Desperate, uptight and lately unkind
Desperate, desperateEmbed
