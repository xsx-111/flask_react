Change Ur Mind Lyrics
For our own sake, we oughta settle down
Making mistakes without anyone's help
The ice too thin to hold our weight
It cracks, it breaks, we sink the same

You said that you'd be home by nine
But I want you by my side
I try, I fantasize that you never
Disappoint me

You should change your mind
That's what it's for (That's what it's for)
You should change your mind
Just wanna leave, just wanna talk

If I'm a letter, then you're a postcard
From some exotic place, somewhere very far
The ice too thin to hold our weight
It cracks, it breaks, we sink the same

You said that you'd be home by nine
But I want you by my side
I try, I fantasize that you never
Disappoint me
You should change your mind
That's what it's for (That's what it's for)
You should change your mind
Just wanna leave, just wanna talk
You should change your mind
That's what it's for (That's what it's for)
You should change your mind
Just wanna leave, just wanna talk

We walked, what felt like miles only was three blocks
You said you couldn't feel your hands
I try, I realize that I'm always disappointing

You should change your mind
That's what it's for (That's what it's for)
You should change your mind
Just wanna leave, just wanna talk
You should change your mind (Oh, oh)
You should change your mind (Oh, oh)Embed
