Saturday Night Lyrics
I put my Nikes in the corner
Picture on my passport
I'm in your favorite sweater
Disappointment always on my shoulders
I heard that you're honest
And I wish I was better

Because you're all that I want
And every word that you mock
Sounds so pretty to me
You should die with me
And we can stay

In on a Saturday night
Watching My So-Called Life
Call the cops, let 'em in
You're Echo, I'm the Bunnymen
In on a Saturday night

I tried to balance
I couldn't stand to apologize
For bleeding in your bedroom closet
And I won't be idle, somewhat shaky
When I hear your voice cut through rope
Because you're all that I want
And every word that you mock
Sounds so pretty to me
You should die with me
And we can stay

In on a Saturday night
Watching My So-Called Life
Call the cops, let 'em in
You're Echo, I'm the Bunnymen
In on a Saturday night

(Hello?)
I think I'm in love
I'm fairly certain
I'm all of the above
(Yeah, I'm complex
I'm not sure if I'm being honest)
You never called back
(I don't remember that)
I cried, I cried, I cried
But you never called back
(I don't remember that)
I cried, I cried, I cried
In on a Saturday night
Watching My So-Called Life
Call the cops, let 'em in
You're Echo, I'm the Bunnymen
In on a Saturday night

You never called back
(I don't remember that)
I cried, I cried, I cried
But you never called back
(I don't remember that)
I cried, I cried, I cried2Embed
