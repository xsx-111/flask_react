Smarter Ways of Saying It Lyrics
I think of you and knock my head on the door
Every second I'm without you is another I endure
With every dying breath let the blood fill my chest
I ask you to hold my hand
As we fall asleep and I forget your face
Hope there's something after this, something to replace
Every memory of us
'Cause it hurts to think about
And I don't want your pain
I don't want your pain
I fell out of loveEmbed
