Halloween Lyrics
I currently am without you
And I couldn't leave if I had to
And I just remembered it was Halloween
So I guess I'm going as a guy who's paying parking tickets
On his laptop on the living room floor
In the same clothes I wore yesterday
I don't think that I'm gonna change

How do we know how late
Is too late to still be awake
Don't you know I hate it?
You underestimated ordinary words

I hear the rain on my skylight
From my bed where I spend most of my time
And I just remembered it was Halloween
So I guess I'm going as a guy who knows just what you'll say
You don't think that I'm gonna change

How do we know how late
Is too late to still be awake
Don't you know I hate it?
You underestimated ordinary words
How do we know how late
Is too late to still be awake
Don't you know I hate it?
You underestimated ordinary words
All this time worth wasting
Let's get back to basics
All this time worth wasting
Let's get back to basics

How do we know how late
Is too late to still be awake
Don't you know I hate it?
You underestimated ordinary words

Ordinary words (All this time worth wasting)
Ordinary words (Let's get back to basics)
Ordinary words (All this time worth wasting)
Ordinary words (Let's get back to basics)1Embed
