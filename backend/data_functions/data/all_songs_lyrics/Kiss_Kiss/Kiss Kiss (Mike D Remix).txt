Kiss Kiss (Mike D Remix) Lyrics
Hey, she want that lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey
That kiss kiss, kiss kiss
In her mind she fantasize 'bout getting with me
They hating on me, hating on me
They wanna diss diss, diss this
Because she mine and so fine, thick as can be
Hey, she want that lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey
That kiss kiss, kiss kiss
In her mind she fantasize 'bout getting with me
They hating on me, hating on me
They wanna diss this, diss this
Because she mine and so fine, thick as can be

I'm a country boy from Tappahannock (Ah-woo)
V.A. is where I reside, so shawty understand it (Ah-woo)
And I know I just turned 18 and I get a little mannish (Ah-woo)
And you see this bandana hanging
That means I'm like a bandit, like, like a bandit, bandit (Ah, woo!)

I got paper, girl (Woo!)
The Lamborghini (Woo!)
With the spider seats (Woo!)
You never seen it (Ah, woo!)
So get it, shawty
We parking lot pimping in my donk
And I know what you want
Hey, she want that lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey
That kiss kiss, kiss kiss
In her mind she fantasize 'bout getting with me
They hating on me, hating on me
They wanna diss diss, diss this
Because she mine and so fine, thick as can be
Hey, she want that lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey
That kiss kiss, kiss kiss
In her mind she fantasize 'bout getting with me
They hating on me, hating on me
They wanna diss this, diss this
Because she mine and so fine, woah, thick as can be

I'm the epitome of this demonstration, I got the remedy
You feeling me, so why is you hating on my anatomy?
It's bird-like, yeah, you heard right
Girl, I'm the king, so that means I'm fly (Ah, woo!)

If you with it, girl (Woo!)
Get it popping (Woo!)
Roll with me (Woo!)
Ain't no stopping (Ah, woo!)
So get it, shawty
We parking lot pimping in my donk
And I know what you want
Hey, she want that lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey
That kiss kiss, kiss kiss (Hey)
In her mind she fantasize 'bout (Hey), getting with me
