A Glow Lyrics
Come into the den, come into the den
You've got a glow
Climb into my arms with blood on your clothes
You've got a glow
And you're no one's but mine
And nobody knows the land where he's lying
No heat in his bones
No heart that was mine
No hand that I'd hold

And you've got a glow, you've got a glow
(And there's no escaping, the thing that is making its home in your radio)
You're light in a lie
You're lithe and you're strong
And you've wanted to do that, my love, for so long
My live and dead men
Come into the den
You've got a glowEmbed
