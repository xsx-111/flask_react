Black Sheep Boy Lyrics
Here I am back home again
I'm here to rest
All they ask is where I've been
Knowing I've been West

I'm the family's unowned boy
Golden curls of envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shine in the Black Sheep Boy

If you love me you'll let me live in peace
Please understand
That the Black Sheep can wear the golden fleece
And hold a winning hand
