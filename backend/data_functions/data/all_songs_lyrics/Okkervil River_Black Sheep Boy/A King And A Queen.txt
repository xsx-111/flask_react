A King And A Queen Lyrics
If you want to see and be seen, then be seen
Your dress is dark red and your opening eyes are bright green
Make a scene, but don't lie on the bed
Laid out like you're dead, because honey, you're murdering me

Be a little sheep learning who'll shear and who'll feed
The hands come and they leave. Be hands holding a knife
Be a being on two feet, with his heart trembling
Butchering for a king he believes in though he's never seen

Be the princess in that stone tower, crying for that handsome butcher's plight
(And, as some princess might, she still calls him a knight)
But the best thing for you would be queen, so be queen
You're all that I need. Though I know that it never can be
I'd be pleased to post your decrees
To fall at your knees
To name all your streets and to sit down and weep when you're carried back through them
And set down to sleep, and to lie by your side for sublime centuries
(Until we crumble to dust when we're crushed by a single sunbeam)Embed
