Black Sheep Boy #4 Lyrics
Bleeding black sheep boy
Mirror in pieces
Turn the receiver
Trace the police station
Line to my number
And number my reasons
For this paranoia
For these accusations

Each night the numbers
Paired off like lovers
Collided together
So I can't remember
My name or my nation
Baying black sheep boy

Go back beyond the pasture
You cracked out of my head
Get in your battered Mustang
And the back seat will be your bed
Burning black sheep boy
Dark denim phantom
Face full of flames
The ears full of cheers that have fanned them
I'd slice off the horns that sprung right from those temples
I was chased from my bedroom
I was chased from my candles
By fear of the numbers
Paired off like lovers
Collided together
So I can't remember
My face or my station
Pacing black sheep boy

The floor just won't support you
You hovered through the room
Get in your battered Mustang
And the backseat will be your tomb
And I rode into Baltimore
And I found a hotel room
Where I tried to escape you
But the phone line wouldn't go through
And inside the mirror
Well I saw you stamping
Staring out
I'd recognize your eyes
You fell for any of the lines that come flying out
Nothing I've heard from you sounds sane or safe
Words falling down from the ceiling
Where the mirror is stealing
The light to reveal us both tonight
And we're both kneeling in the
Black pool of your shadow
You've cracked out of my head
Go back beyond the pasture
Where I'll smash your mirror
Till you're deadEmbed
