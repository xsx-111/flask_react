Willow Tree LyricsAnd if I was some little swallow
Had little wings
And I could fly
Drop out of sight
Of my own true lover
And there I'd sit
'Til the day I die
And if I was some little sparrow
Had little wings
And I could fly
Flap out of sight
Of my own true lover
And there'd I'd sing
'Til the day I die
I would 'light in the arms
Of some weeping willow
Sleep for weeks
Months and years
Wouldn't need nothing
But some weeping willow
And what I'd drink
Would be my tearsEmbed
