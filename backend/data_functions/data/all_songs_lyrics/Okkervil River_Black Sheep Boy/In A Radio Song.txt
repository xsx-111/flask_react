In A Radio Song Lyrics
Black, black sheep boy
Blue-eyed charmer
Head hanging with horns
From your father

Oh
In a cold little mirror you were grown
By a black little wind you were blown
Alone, alone, alone

Cold smile on your lips
You shake and shiver
Some animal sips where the river flows
From a black little crack in a stone
To a crackle in a radio song
Sing along, sing along, sing along

Warm light when your eyes
Fill with laughter
Some animal lies in the pasture
Holes in its throat where the
Blood was drawn
In its mouth where the tongue
Was torn by your claws
Your claws, your claws
I rose from a dream
We were running
From every being
That was hunting
But we let them get ahead of us
We let them lie in wait for us
We're fucked, we're fucked, we're fucked

I rose from a dream
I had just destroyed everything
With one crushing blow
And I woke up and watched it go
And I woke up and wagged my tongue
So long, so long, so long3Embed
