Black Lyrics
I'm coming into your town. Night is falling to the ground
But I can still see where you loved yourself
Before he tore it all down. April 12th
With nobody else around; you were outside the house (where's your mother?)

When he put you in the car, when he took you down the road
And I can still see where it was open, the door he slammed closed
It was open, the door he slammed closed. It was open, long ago
But don't lose me now, don't lose me now. Though I know that I'm not useful anyhow
Just let me stick around while I tell you, like before
You should say his name the way that he said yours
But you don't want to say his name anymore. Oh, Cynda Moore

Baby daughter on the road, you're wrapped up warm in daddy's coat
And I can still see the cigarette's heat. I can't believe all that you're telling me
What is cutting like the smoke through your teeth as you're telling me "forget it"

But if I could tear his throat, spill his blood between my jaws
And erase his name for good, don't you know that I would?
Don't you realize I wouldn't pause
That I would cut him down with my claws if I could have somehow never let that happen?
Or I'd call, some black midnight, fuck up his new life where they don't know what he did
Tell his brand-new wife and his second kid
And I tell you, like before, you should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
You want no part of his life anymore. Oh, Cynda Moore
Don't lose me now, let me help you out. Though I know that I can't help you anyhow
When I watch you I'm proud
When I tell you twice before that you should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
You want no part of his life anymore. Oh, Cynda Moore. And it'll never be the way it was before
But I wish that you would let me through that door. Let me through that door, baby1Embed
