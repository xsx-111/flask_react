Get Big Lyrics
Once we get to the end of this song
Then it will begin again
So you said in our bed
I was watching light slip through blinds to find your skin
"So take your medicine and I won't ask where you've been
Live your lost weekend, I know you've wanted it. Get big, little kid
And I can't say why each day doesn't quite fit the space we saved for it"
But if that space now demands that you throw up both your hands and call it quits
"Take your midnight trip. I know you've dreamed of it
Walk your sunset strip, because I think you've needed it to get big, little kid

But just remember that our love only got this good
Because of the younger days that you'd like to outstrip
So drink your cup down to the dregs and leave that club on shaking legs
With another guy, but remember: I'm not him

Take your medicine and I won't ask where you've been
Live your lost weekend, I know you've wanted it
Get big, little kid
And once we get to the end of this song, then another will beginEmbed
