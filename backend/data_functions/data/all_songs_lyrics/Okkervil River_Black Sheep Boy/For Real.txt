For Real LyricsSome nights I thirst for real blood
For real knives, for real cries
And then the flash of steel from real guns
In real life really fills my mind
I really miss what really did exist
When I held your throat so tight
And I miss the bus as it swerved from us
And came crashing to its side
Some nights the blood from real cuts
Feels real nice when it's really mine
And if you want it to be real
Come over for one night
And we can really, really climb
Cause blue bridge lights
Might really burn most bright
While we watch that dark lake rise
And if you really want to see
What really matters most to me
Just take a real short drive
Itâ€™s just a drive into the dark stretch
Long stretch of night
Really stretch this shaking mind
And this room, unlit, unheated
And the ceiling striped
And the dark black blinds
I want to know this time
If you're really finally mine
I need to know that you're not lying
And so I want to see you tried
And I don't want to hear you say
It shouldn't really be this way
Because I like this way just fine
'Cause there's nothing quite like
The blinding light
That curtains cast aside
And no attempt is made to explain away
Things that really, really, really, really, really are behind
You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't hide1Embed
