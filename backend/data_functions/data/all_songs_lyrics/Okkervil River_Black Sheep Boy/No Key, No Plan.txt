No Key, No Plan Lyrics
When I'm hosed and they're closing in, maybe only then
Really, I'll try to get right with myself
So I'll grope down that ladder again, until I'm tumbling
But really, I just want to slide, I want to crash-land
While my friend, my associate, he's a regal man
He bindles and he twists and ties, gives the reckoning
And then it's back on the road again with maybe thirteen grand
Moralize all you might like, I don't believe in it

You've never earned your soul. I know
But I'm going to try, though, I'm going to try

I'm a rich young sophisticate, I've got girls and friends
I'm doing what I really like and getting paid for it
There is no key, there's no plan; I discovered that
And, truly, I don't think you'll find a happier man

You've never earned your soul. I know
But I'm going to try, though, I'm going to try
You float up high and it isn't a sin
And there isn't a hell where we'll be sent
There's only now, and there isn't then. So just breathe it inEmbed
