Moonshiner LyricsI've been a moonshiner
Ever since that I've been born
I've drunk up my money
And stilled up all my corn
I'll go to some dark hollow
Set up my moonshine still
I'll make you one gallon
For a five dollar bill
I'll go to some dark hollow
And get you some booze
If the revenues don't get me
No money will I lose
It's come on all you moonshiners
And stand you in a row
You look so sad and lonesome
You're lonesome, yes I know
I love them pretty women
And wish they all were mine
Their breath smells so sweetly
Like good old moonshineEmbed
