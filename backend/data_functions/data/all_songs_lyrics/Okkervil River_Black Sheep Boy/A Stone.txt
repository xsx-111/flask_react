A Stone Lyrics
Hot breath, rough skin
Warm laughs and smiling
The loveliest words whispered and meant
You like all these things
But, though you like all these things
You love a stone. You love a stone
Because it's smooth
And it's cold
And you'd love most to be told
That it's all your own

You love white veins, you love hard grey
The heaviest weight, the clumsiest shape
The earthiest smell, the hollowest tone
You love a stone

And I'm found too fast, called too fond of flames
And then I'm phoning my friends
And then I'm shouldering the blame
While you're picking pebbles out of the drain, miles ago
You're out singing songs, and I'm down shouting names
At the flickerless screen, going fucking insane
Am I losing my cool, overstating my case?
Well, baby, what can I say?
You know I never claimed that I was a stone
And you love a stone

You love a stone, because it's dark, and it's old
And if it could start being alive you'd stop living alone

And I think I believe that, if stones could dream
They'd dream of being laid side-by-side, piece-by-piece
And turned into a castle for some towering queen
They're unable to know
And when that queen's daughter came of age
I think she'd be lovely and stubborn and brave
And suitors would journey from kingdoms away
Just to make themselves known
And I think that I know the bitter dismay
Of a lover who brought fresh bouquets every day
When she turned him away to remember some knave
Who once gave just one rose, one day, years ago1Embed
