Chauffeur Blues LyricsWanna see my chauffeur
Wanna see my chauffeur
I want him to drive me
I want him to drive me downtown
For he drives so easy
Can't turn my chauffer down
But I don't want him
To be ridin' these girls
But I don't want him
To be ridin' these girls all around
I'm gonna steal me a pistol, shoot my chauffeur down
Going to let my chauffeur
Drive me around the world
Then he will be my lover boy, I will be his girl
Going to let my chauffeur
Drive me around theEmbed
