Bringing Me Down LyricsYou're bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around, love
Staying out all night
Get outta sight
Don't hang around
You're bringing me down
Well, the things you're doing
Or playing your games
Well, you better get wise now
Or things gonna change
'Cause you're bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around, love
Staying out all night
Get outta sight
Don't hang around
You're bringing me down
Well, you used to tell me
My love was your flame
But I had you last evening
No, it wasn't the same
'Cause you're bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around, love
Staying out all night
Get outta sight
Don't hang around
You're bringing me down
You're bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around, love
Staying out all night
Get outta sight
Don't hang around
You're bringing me down
Well, your love used to echo
From my feet to my brain
Ah, but now it just whispers
Well I think you're to blame
'Cause you're bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around love
Staying out all night
Get outta sight
Don't hang around
You're bringing me down
Yeah, you're bringing me down (down, down, down)
Yeah, you're bringing me down (down, down, down)
Ah, you're bringing me down (down, down, down)
Yeah, you're bringing me downEmbed
