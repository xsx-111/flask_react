Run Around Lyrics
One time run around
Don't look back, turn from me and go your way
You left me here without anything to love I tell you
I've had enough of your hands running 'round my brain
And I've had enough of the way that you cause me pain

So slow down, run around your other side (Run around)
Walk with me instead tonight (Walk with me)
We could be near like we used to be before, ah girl
I need more of the times that you turned me round
And there's no time to turn away love I've found

So couldn't we forget about today
Start again from where we were
We used to dance out to space without a care
And our laughter come ringing and singing
We rolled round the music
Blinded by colors come crashing from flowers
That sway as you stay here by me

Slow down, run around
Your love is soft (Run around)
Walk with me instead tonight (Walk with me)
We could be near like we used to be before, ah girl
I need more of the times that you turned me round
And there's no time to turn away love I've found
Run around
One time run around
Don't look back, turn from me and go your way
You left me here without anything to love I tell you
I've had enough of your hands running round my brain
And I've had enough of the way that you cause me pain
Well run aroundEmbed
