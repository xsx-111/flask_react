Blues from an Airplane Lyrics
Do you know how sad it is to be a man alone?
I feel so solitary being in my home
Without you
I don't know what to do and
I don't know where you are

I can see my life is meant to fall apart some day
Just to be a simple man who sadly goes his way
Got no girl
So I got no world and
I got no words that I'll say

Hey hey hey hey hey
Come make me happy like I've never known before
Say say say say say
Have you ever known a heart who needed you more?

Where are you? What's that sound around my heart I feel?
Something new, I'm sure the love you've given must be real
I know now
And I'm sure of how
I can be the man I feel
I can be the man I feelEmbed
