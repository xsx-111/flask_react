And I Like It LyricsThis is my life
I'm satisfied
So watch it
Don't try to keep me tied
So why not
Let me be satisfied
This is my life
This is my Way
This is my time
This is my dream
You know I like it
This is my Way
It suits me fine
So watch it doing
Or I leave you behind
So why not
Fit your life in with mine
This is my way
This is my time
This is my dream
This is my life
You know I like it
I like it
Now tell me what you see
Is it the same thing you want me to be
I've seen it all happen so long before
Please believe when I say it's a bore
I need more
I need more
I need more more
This is my time
I'm doing my best
So watch it
Ain't gonna be like the rest, no
So why not
Get away from the mass
This is my time
This is my Dream
This is my way
This is my life
You know I like it
I like it
You know it's mineEmbed
