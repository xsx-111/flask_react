Come Up the Years Lyrics
I oughta get going
I shouldn't stay here and love you
More than I do
'Cause you're so much younger than I am
Come up the years, come up the years
And love me, love me, love me

A younger girl keeps hanging around
One of the loveliest I've ever found
Blowing my mind, stealing my heart
Somebody help me 'fore I fall apart

I oughta get going
I shouldn't stay here and love you
More than I do
'Cause you're so much younger than I am
Come up the years, come up the years
And love me, love me, love me

The things she's doing keep turning me on
And I've been happy to go right along
I know it's time that I said goodbye
I know I can't leave no matter how hard I try
I oughta get going
I shouldn't stay here and love you
More than I do
'Cause you're so much younger than I am
Come up the years, come up the years
And love me, love me, love me

I oughta get going (Love me)
Come up the years, come up the years (Love me)
I oughta get going (Won't you love me?)
Come up the years, come up the years2Embed
