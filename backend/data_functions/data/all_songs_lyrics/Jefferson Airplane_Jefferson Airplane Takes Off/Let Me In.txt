Let Me In LyricsOh, let me in
I want to be there
You shut your door
Now it ain't there
Without a word to me
Without a look at me
You turned me down without a care
Oh, let me in
Hear what I'm talking about
I gotta get in
But you keep putting me out
Without a call to me
Without a love for me
You don't even know if there is
One gram of doubt
Oh, let me in baby
You're driving me crazy
Your playing games in my mind
Oh, let me in honey
Don't tell me it's so funny
I didn't know that you could
Be that unkind
Oh, let me in
You know I want only you
I don't want to be told
By you what to do
Without a care for me
Without a love for me
Who's gonna talk for me
Who's gonna speak for me
You walked away for something
Richer and new
Thanks for nothingEmbed
