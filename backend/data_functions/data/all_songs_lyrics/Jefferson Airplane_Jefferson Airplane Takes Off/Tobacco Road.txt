Tobacco Road LyricsI was born in a dump
My momma died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shaft
All I owned was a'hangin' on my back
Lord knows how much I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
Cause it's home
The only life I ever known
And the Lord knows I loathe
Tobacco Road
I'm gonna leave and get me a job
With the help and the grace of God
I'm gonna save my money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road
Bring Dynamite, big old crane
Blow it up, tear it down, start all over again
Build me a town be very proud to show
Keep the name of Tobacco Road
Cause it's home
The only life I ever known
And the Lord knows I loathe
Tobacco Road
I'm gonna leave and get me a job
With the help and the grace of God
I'm gonna save some money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road
Bring Dynamite, big old crane
Blow it up, tear it down, start all over again
Build me a town be proud to show
Keep the name of Tobacco Road
Cause it's home
The only life I ever known
And the Lord knows I loathe
Tobacco Road
