Black Girls LyricsI dig the black girls
Oh so much more than the white girls
I was so pleased to learn they were faster
Can you guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, ooh what I'm after?
Along comes a little faggot white boy
He's look, look, looking for some kind of joy
They come around so queer and quiet
But inside, rebel and riot
Say, I dig the white boys
Oh so much more than the black boys
I was so pleased to learn they're not smarter
Go on, give, give, give, give it to me harder
Harder
Harder, just say
Harder!
You know I love the Lord of hosts
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
I was so pleased to learn that he's inside me
In my time of trouble he will hide me
I dig the black girls
I dig the black girls
I dig the black girls
I dig the black girls1Embed
