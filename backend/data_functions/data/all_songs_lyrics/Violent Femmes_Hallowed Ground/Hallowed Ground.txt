Hallowed Ground LyricsThe prophet is a fool
The spiritual man is mad
For the multitude of thine iniquity
And the great hatred...
Everyone's trying to decide
Where to go when there's no place to hide
I follow the bombs as they're coming down
This must have been Hallowed Ground
No matter what they decide to have done
Burn up the clouds, block out the sun
My hope is in one they can't bring down
My soul is in Hallowed Ground
I see the fear, It's on the rise
Let's catch the enemy by surprise
Bury your treasure where it can't be found
Bury it deep in Hallowed Ground1Embed
