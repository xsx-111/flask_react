Sweet Misery Blues LyricsYeah, I saw you coming down the street
I could tell by your look that you didn't wanna meet
So this time
I went away, but next time
I'm just gonna have to say
"Could I buy you a dress or something?
Could I buy you some jewelry or something?
Would you go out with me or something?
Would you sleep with me or something?"
You better watch out
If your train's moving too fast
You better look out
If you're living in the past because
That's why you'll never lose
These sweet misery blues
That's why you'll never lose
These sweet misery blues
Yeah I'm gonna corner you in an elevator
And you won't be able to put me off till later
I'll put on my charm, I'll tingle your spine
I'll take off my charm and then you'll wanna die
"Could I buy you a dress or something?
Could I buy you some jewelry or something?
Would you go out with me or somethin?
Would you sleep with me or something?"
You better watch out
Cause you can't get rid of me
You better look out
Now, babe, don't you see?
That's why you'll never lose
These sweet misery blues
That's why you'll never lose
These sweet misery bluesEmbed
