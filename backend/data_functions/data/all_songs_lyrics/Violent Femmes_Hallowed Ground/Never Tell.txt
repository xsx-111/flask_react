Never Tell LyricsHey, sister, have you heard?
Some people stand like trees without a word
And what that means is that some people don't
Talk
Oh, please, pardon me, mister
You know I just didn't hear you
That first time that you said that
But now that
You repeated it for me, I'll be sure to do what I can
You know I'm going to do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
Now, do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
But no more, you understand?
Oh, please, pardon me, father
You know, I just didn't hear you
That, that, that, that first time that you said that
But now, but now, but now, but now, but now you repeated it
You repeated it, you repeated it, you repeated it
I'll be sure to do, do, do what I can
Do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
Yeah, do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
But no more, you understand?
It's of utmost importance
We're dealing with volatile substance
It's of utmost importance
We're dealing with volatile substance
It's of utmost importance
We're dealing with volatile substance
I've had so much on my mind
I was so glad when I died
Listen to me, baby
Can you keep a secret for me?
Make sure no one finds out
'Cause then the lights will go out
And I will find you out
And I will cut you up
Mm-hmm
Don't ask me why because I-I said, I said, I said
I'm gonna do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
Gotta do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
Now, do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
I do what I can, do what I can
Do-do-do-do-do what I can
But I'll have none of that
Y-you understand?!
Don't you know nothin'?
You never tell on someone
Don't you know nothin'?
You never tell on someone
Don't you know nothin'?
You never tell on someone
Don't you know nothin'?
You ain't never going to tell on someone!
What are you going to do? You gonna turn
You gonna turn rat fink?
What do you wanna do? Do you wanna see
Do you wanna see what it's like to sink?
Sink down, sink down, sink down
Down, down to the bottom of the river
Sink down, sink, sink down, down
Down, down, to the bottom of the river
Sink, down, sink, sink down, down
Down, down to bottom of the river
Sink down, sink, sink down, down
Down, down to the bottom of the river
Don't you know no one?
You never tell on someone
Don't you know no one?
You never tell on someone
Don't you know no one?
You never tell on someone
Don't you know no one?
You ain't never gonna tell on someone
Ah, ah, oh
I'll tell you what it's like
I'll tell you what it's like, oh
I stood right up in the heart of Hell
I never tell
I stood right up in the heart of Hell
I never tell
I stood right up in the heart of Hell
I never tell
I stood right up in the heart of Hell
I'm never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell
I'm n-n-n-n-never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell
Nothing, nothing, never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell
I'm n-n-n-n-never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell
Nothing, nothing, never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell
Ah...1Embed
