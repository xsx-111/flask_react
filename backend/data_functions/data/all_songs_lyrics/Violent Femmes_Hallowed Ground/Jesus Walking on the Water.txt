Jesus Walking on the Water Lyrics
Oh my, oh my, oh my
What if it was true?
And oh my, oh my, oh my
Tell me, is it true?
Did he, did he, did he
Die upon that cross?
And did he, did he, did he
Come back across?

Jesus walking on the water
Sweet Jesus walking in the sky
Sinking sand, took my hand
Raised me up and he brought me up
I can hold my, my, my head high

Will I, will I, will I
Be true to my birth?
And will I, will I, will I
Give what I'm worth?
Oh yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
I come when you call
And yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
Jesus, my all-in-all
