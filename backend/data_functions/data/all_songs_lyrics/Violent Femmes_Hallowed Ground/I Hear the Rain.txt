I Hear the Rain Lyrics
I hear the rain, I hear the rain
I hear the rain, got to kill the pain
I hear the rain, I hear the rain
I hear the rain, got to kill the pain

Bury me out in the lone prairie
Prarie water washin' over me
Bury me out on the lone prairie
Friendly calls of the coyote


Bury me out in the lone city
Sewer water, color of my tea
Bury me out in the lone city
Sewer water wash my daughter down to the sea


She used to sit and watch the rain
Now I think I'll go insane
She used to sit and watch the rain
Now I think I'll go insane
She used to sit and watch the rain
Now I think I'll go insane
She used to sit and watch the rain
Now I think I'll go insane


I hear the rain, I hear the rain
I hear the rainEmbed
