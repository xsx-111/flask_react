Brave New World Lyrics
Halt! Who goes there?

Er - a friend

Be on your way. This is my territory

Your territory? What do you mean?

Wait a minute - it's you! The man from Maybury Hill!

Good heavens! The Artilleryman! I thought you surely burned!

I thought you surely drowned!

Have you seen any Martians?

Everywhere. We're done for all right...
We can't just give up!

Course we can't. It's now we've got to start fighting - but not against them 'cos we can't win. Now we've got to fight for survival, and I reckon we can make it. I've got a plan...

We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right?
So we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground!
You should see it down there - hundreds of miles of drains - sweet and clean now after the rain!
Dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch!
And what's so bad about living underground eh? It's not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion!

Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show?
But maybe from the madness something beautiful will grow

In a brave new world
With just a handful of men
We'll start-
We'll start all over again!
All over again!
All over again!
All over again!
We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks right under their noses - right under their feet!
Everything we need - banks, prisons and schools... We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and men like you'll teach the kids
Not poems and rubbish - science
So we can get everything working
We'll build villages and towns and... and... we'll play each other at cricket!
Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh? Learn how to make 'em ourselves and then wallop!
Our turn to do some wiping out! Whoosh with our Heat Ray - Whoosh!
And them running and dying, beaten at their own game
Man on top again!

Now our domination of the Earth is fading fast
And out of the confusion the chance has come at last
To build a better future from the ashes of the past
In a brave new world

Give me a handful of men
We'll start all over again

Look - Man is born in freedom but he soon becomes a slave
In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave
The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved
In a brave new world
With just a handful of men
We'll start all over again

I'm not trying to tell you what to be
Oh no, oh no, not me
But if mankind is to survive
The people left alive
They're gonna have to build this world anew!
And it's going to have to start with me and you
Yes!
Instrumental (6:08 - 6:55)
I'm not trying to tell you what to be
Oh no, oh no, not me
But if mankind is to survive
The people left alive
They're gonna have to build this world anew
Yes, and we will have to be the chosen few!

Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies!
And imagine the destruction of all that you despise
Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise
In a brave new world

With just a handful of men
We'll start all over again
Instrumental (7:43 - 8:36)

Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well
And bid the ageing empire of man a last farewell
It may not sound like Heaven but at least it isn't Hell
It's a brave new world

With just a handful of men
We'll start-
We'll start all over again!
All over again!
All over again!
All over again!

I've got a plan!
Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again - a second chance
We'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays
Nothing can stop men like us
I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look

In the cellar was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long, that had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers...

It's doing the workin' and the thinkin' that wears a feller out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink eh? Nothing but champagne, now I'm the boss!

We drank and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games!
Later, he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night. Red Weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly - and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer...

Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
Maybe from the madness something beautiful will grow...Embed
