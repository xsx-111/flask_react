Crack Hitler LyricsSink the eight ball
Buy the lady a drink
And nobody knows my name
Bodies float above
From the bottom of the river
Like bubbles in fine champagne
He's the one, no doubt
Walking on the tight rope
He's the one, no doubt
Got a gash on my head
And a grin on my face
And a shadow called danger
Hidin' in the sheets
And on the streets
In the hearts of every stranger
Here he comes, look out
We're depending on you
Here he comes, look out
Sweat on the brow
And a tap on the phone
And lives are on the line
Pick up the briefcase
On a high speed chase
Breathin' by the roll of the dice
Reachin' up to the top
Teach the world a lesson
Reachin' up to the top
In regards to my usage of the drug
It modified my personality
To the extent that I was highly irritable
"I was like a crack Hitler."
Keep up the fight
And in the wink of an eye
Never give up
Ooh...ahh...
Look outEmbed
