Land of Sunshine LyricsYou have a winning way, so keep it
Your future, your future, your future
You are an angel heading for a land of sunshine
And fortune is smiling upon you
Prepare for a series of comfortable miracles
From fasting to feasting, to feasting
And life to you is a dashing, bold adventure
So sing and rejoice, and sing and rejoice
And look for the dream that keeps coming back
Your future, your future, your future
So pat yourself on the back and give yourself a handshake
'Cause everything is not yet lost
Does life seem worthwhile to you?
Does life seem worthwhile to you?
Here's how to order
Yes, mm-hmm, now for the next question
Does emotional music have quite an effect on you?
Do you feel sometimes that age is against you?
Sing and rejoice and sing and rejoice
Yes, mm-hmm, that's interesting, but tell me
Do you often sing or whistle just for fun?
Do you feel sometimes that age is against you?
I-I can help-I can help you-I can help you help yourself!
Does life seem worthwhile to you?
Does life seem worthwhile to you?
