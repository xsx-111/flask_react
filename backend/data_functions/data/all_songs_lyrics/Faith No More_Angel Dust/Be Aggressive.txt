Be Aggressive Lyrics
I started this
It's all for me
What's yours is yours and mine is mine
That's plain to see
So give it up
I've got to have

I swallow, I swallow
I swallow, I swallow

Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e

What someone else
Would leave behind
And spit it out, let go to waste
I claim is mine
You're my flavor of the week

I swallow, I swallow
I swallow, I swallow
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e

Aggressive (aggressive, aggressive)
Aggressive (aggressive, aggressive)

Tall and reckless
Ugly seed
Reach down my throat
You filthy bird
That's all I need
This empty pit
I've got to feed
To prove I'm fit
A healthy man I've got to be
Malnutrition, my submission
You're the master
And I take it on my knees
Ejaculation
Tribulation

I swallow, I swallow
I swallow, I swallow
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
Go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, win1Embed
