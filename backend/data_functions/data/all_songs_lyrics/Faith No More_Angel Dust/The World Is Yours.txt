The World Is Yours LyricsAim, Fire!

Keep your distance
You're in your league
Complain sparingly in your lies
I've got better things to do
This will hurt someone
Why waltz without
Shit in hand
Complain, defend your lies
Comfort me, and bring me something sharp
This will hurt someone, someone else
This will hurt someone else
------
Calm down, Think Carefully
Seen it all before
Mind your own fucking business
Seen it all before
What I would give for your "I've seen it all before"
You'll never blink again
Seen it all before
Feces on top of more feces
This bullet in your chest, the world is yours
Each word, you suck it through a straw
It's so predictable, it's policy
This will hurt someone, someone else....
Each word, you suck it through a straw
It's so predictable, It's policy1Embed
