Jizzlobber LyricsThey will sum it all up in a sentence
A verdict made by those who know
I'm ready to make a commitment
I'm willing to make love to concrete
Smiles / bruises
Smiles / bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress
And they are making me itch
My time is spilt milk
My skin is a layer of soot
I'm spending my days scrubbing
I'm trying so hard to act like nothing happened
(No one left to blame, no one left to blame, no one left to blame)
I'm trying so hard to find that fresh, clean smell
(No one left to blame, no one left to blame, no one left to blame)
Smiles / bruises
Smiles / bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress
And they are making me itch
My time is spilt milk
Cruel world sleeps above me
Mounting and teasing
I am what I've done
I am what I've done
I'm sorry
Sorry
Sorry
