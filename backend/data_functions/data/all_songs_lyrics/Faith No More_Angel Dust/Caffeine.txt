Caffeine LyricsPour shame all over us harden into a crust (cement)
Forget the glamour and mumble a jackhammer (under your breath)
Hide your face in the curtains
Better unsaid, so close
And it rolls off the tongue, almost
The world expects the pose, perfectly natural (loosen up)
Smearing wet concrete and swearing you'll never be (caught)
At your weakest, etched in stone
And we're frozen here, peeking
Almost, sweet talk, caffeine
Make contact
Up to my neck
I confess in quicksand
"But it's so easy for you
There's always one thing
Do you have something to tell me?
Say something
Anything"
I'm warning you
I'm warning you
I'm fucking you
I'm warning you
"Relax, it's just a phase
You'll grow out of it"
Believe anything anyone ever tells you
It's not funny any more
It's the thing you hate the most
The thing you hate the most
The thing you hate almost1Embed
