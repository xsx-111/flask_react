Malpractice LyricsThe crowd roars
It's deep and so unhealthy
The rest you know
I'll feel the hands that felt me
Cold hands
Your hands
Cover my mouth
While I'm staring into bright lights
APPLAUSE 
The crowd roars
The gurgling and the groping
The rest you know
Ten lovers violating
Cured
Discharged
Reach back inside
Knuckle white
Ruffle white
The crowd roars
They ruined and repaired me
The rest you know
The hands removed the bad thing
