Living in the Real World Lyrics
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, UH)
(ONE TWO A-ONE TWO THREE FOUR!!!)

Every day you've go to wake up
Disappear behind your makeup
Take away your calendar watch
And you can't keep track until your heart attack

Hey, I'm living in a magazine, page to page in my submarine
Hey now, Cindy, you can't get to me
Need an elevator? Hey, I'll see you later

Cause I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
No more, no more, yeah

I can be whatever I want to
I talk to me, I even agree
Every day's a holiday
You can look through the glass and take a photograph
You will never ever walk on the moon, leave your body and float through the room
You could never conquer me
Cause I'm not here and you're not there, yeah

And I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
No more, no more, yeah
Didn't I ever tell you I was gone?
Didn't I ever tell you I was gone? Bye bye

I can do anything at all
I'm invisible and I'm twenty feet tall
Pull the plug on your digital clock
And it all goes dark and the bodies stop

Hey, I'm living in a magazine, page to page in my teenage dream
Hey, now, Mary, you can't follow me
Without a satellite - I'm on a power flight

Cause I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
No more, no more
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no moreEmbed
