Sound-A-Sleep Lyrics
You close your eyes and you will see
Micro-flashing neon lights
Open your eyes and you will see
It still looks like the same thing
Lie and wait for sleep and listen
To your heart beat too fast for sleep
Close your eyes and you will see
The sound asleep

I want to go, I want to go
I want to go down to go to sleep
Your frame of reference
Is my swimming pool

My, my swimming pool
Still looks like the China Sea
Pool to sea and finally
The sound asleep

Feel the muscles in your face
Twitch, relax, remembering
Everything that went down and will go down
I want to go down to sleep
Insomnia, no sleep disease
Petties parking, feed me please
Lie and wait for sleep and listen
To your heart beat too fast for sleepEmbed
