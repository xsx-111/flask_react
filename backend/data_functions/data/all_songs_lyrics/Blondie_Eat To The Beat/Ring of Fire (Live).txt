Ring of Fire (Live) LyricsLove is a burning thing
It makes a fire ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into, a ring of fire
Taste, my love sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Ohh, the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
The flame swept higher
And it burns, burns, burns
That ring of fire, that ring of fireEmbed
