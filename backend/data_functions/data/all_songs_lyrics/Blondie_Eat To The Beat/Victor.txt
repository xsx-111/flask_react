Victor Lyrics
A-a-ah
A-a-ah
A-a-ah, a-a-ah
A-a-ah, a-a-ah

Oh, I don't want you to go
Oh, please don't leave me alone, oh

A-a-ah
A-a-ah
A-a-ah, a-a-ah
A-a-ah, a-a-ah

Oh, I don't want you to go
Oh, please don't leave me alone, oh

Dear Annett, soon I'll be with you
Before they know, before the show
I'm not a whore, I dance no more
I'll be with you across the border
Dearest Anastasia
I'm leaving soon, I'm sorry too
But, burn this letter, burn my picture
They won't know I've crossed the border
Love, Victor
A-a-ah, a-a-ah (A-ah)
A-a-ah, a-a-ah

Oh, I don't want you to go
Oh, don't leave me alone

Oh
Ah
A-a-a-ah, a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-ah, a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-ah, a-a-a-ahEmbed
