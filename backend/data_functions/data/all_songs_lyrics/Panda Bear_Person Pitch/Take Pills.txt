Take Pills LyricsSurely there's no substitute for company
My mom's ripping off her hands
One flake at a time
All her children left the house and left her all alone
But like she'd tell me it gets better
Just wait and you'll see
Wait and you'll see
Take one day at a time
Everything else you can leave behind
Only one thing at a time
Anything more really hurts your mind
I don't want for us to take pills anymore
Not that it's bad
I don't want for us to take pills, take pills, take pills
Because we're stronger and we don't need them
Stronger if we don't need them3Embed
