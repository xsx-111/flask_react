Comfy in Nautica Lyrics
Try to tell me how to do it
Only because I'm new to it

Coolness is having courage
Courage to do what's right
Try to remember always
Just to have a good time

Try to show me that you know me
Do you know what coolness really is?

Winning is what you want to
Winning what you're scared to go for
You try to remember always
Always to have a good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Try and have a softer inside
Shut up boy and be a soldier

Coolness is having courage
Courage to do what's right
Try to remember always
Just to have a good time
Winning is what you want to
Winning what you're scared to go for
You try to remember always
Always to have a good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
Good time
