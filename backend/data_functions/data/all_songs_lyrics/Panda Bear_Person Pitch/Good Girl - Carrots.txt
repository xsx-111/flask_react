Good Girl / Carrots LyricsSection 1: Good Girl
Isn't there anyone else in this place
Isn't there anyone else in this place
Who can tell me right now
Don't be afraid?
Who can tell me right now
Don't be afraid?
There's no one else here who can hang out like I do
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this goodâ€”
As I feel the tour drop out
I can feel the creeps creep in
As I feel the tour drop out
I can feel the creeps creep in
I've got a big baby that makes my sides burst
And tempura makes it bleed
I've got a big baby that makes my sides burst
And tempura makes it bleed
No question I'm stressed
With only this good girl doing her best
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Just this good girl
Section 2: Carrots
That old good boy Mitch just wanted to tell some jokes
Well, now I'm just trying to play some notes
Do you know what I say?
Do you know what I mean?
Have you heard through these words just how I'm seen?
There's a reason that I work so hard at this stuff
When all I want to do is take it easy
It's not a ticket for you to pick at other people
Who don't know what's up like you're so sure you do
You kind of make me want to shut your mouth
Just to keep out all of those unfriendly feelings
Just because you've got a lot of wax and all those first editions
I want you to know sticks and stones may break my bones
But words will never hurt me
All I need to know I knew so early
It's so lame that you could take my feelings
And make yourself feel like you're better than anyone else who hasn't heard
Listen in between your notes
There's something been going on while you were busy taking notes
And look in between your moments
There's something good happening
It's good to sometimes slow it down
What's the point in pouring it all out when you guys just wear it on your coat?
I believe that for this piece of time we can really crank us up a lot
Get your head out from those mags and websites who try to shape your style
Take a risk just for yourself and wade into the deep end of the ocean1Embed
