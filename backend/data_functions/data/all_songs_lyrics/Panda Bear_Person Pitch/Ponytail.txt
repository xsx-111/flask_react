Ponytail LyricsWhen my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I get so hungry
And I wish it never never would
Never would
Never would
Never would
Never would
Never would stop growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I can't feel so full
And I wish it never never would
Never would
Never would
Never would
Never would
Never would stop growing
When my soul starts knowing
When my soul starts knowing
When my soul starts knowing
I am as I'd want to be
And I know I never never will
Never will
Never will
Never will
Never will
Never will stop caringEmbed
