Cherry Tree Lyrics
Over your shoulder
Please don't mind me
If my eyes have fallen
Onto your magazine
I've been watching and wondering
Why your face is changing
With every line you read

All those lines and circles, to me, a mystery
Eve pull down the apple and give taste to me
If she would be wonderful
But my pride is in the way
I cannot read to save my life
I'm so ashamed to say

I live in silence
Afraid to speak
Of my life of darkness
Because i cannot read

All those lines and circles, to me, a mystery
Eve pull down the apple and give taste to me
If she could it would be wonderful
Then i wouldn't need someone else's eyes
To see what's in front of me
No one guiding me
It makes me humble
To be so green
At what every kid can do
When he learns a to z
But all those lines and circles
Just frighten me and i fear that i'll be trampled
If you don't reach for me
Before i run i'll have to take a fall
And when I pick myself up, so slowly
I'll devour every one of those
Books in the tower of knowledgeEmbed
