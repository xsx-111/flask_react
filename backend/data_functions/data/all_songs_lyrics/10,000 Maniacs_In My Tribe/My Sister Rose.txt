My Sister Rose Lyrics
Big ,big plans are being made
For my sisters wedding day
We'll have a ball at the sons of roma hall
Family, friends come one and all
First the best man makes a toast
To rocky and my sister rose
"a life of years free of tears
Bottoms up and lots of luck!"

Polka, tango everyone
Cha-cha, mambo rose and rock alone
Frankie rizzo and his combo play on

Single girls all hear the call
Form a crowd at the back wall
And when the bouquet flies each one tries
To be the best catch and next years bride
Uncle sam and uncle joe take their places in the row
They're standing by side to side
For dollar dances with the bride

Polka, tango everyone
Cha-cha, mambo, rose and rock alone
"He's a banker, she'll be well off now"
Sister rose take your mother's place
Trade your home and your maiden name
For a list of vows and a veil of lace
Made a wife of you today

Now they cut the five tier cake
"that colucci, he can bake"
A frosted tower of sugar and flour
For the couple of the hour

Polka, tango everyone
Cha-cha, mambo rose and rock alone
She was born to wear that gown

Sister rose take your mother's place
Trade your home and your maiden name
For a list of vows and a veil of lace
Made a wife of you today
But you're my sister rose the sameEmbed
