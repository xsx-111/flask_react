A Campfire Song Lyrics
A lie to say, "o, my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig
500 men with axes and they all dig for me"
A lie to say, "o, my river where many fish do swim
Half of the catch is mine when you haul your nets in"

Never will he believe that his greed is a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer will cheat him
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold
A lie to say, "o, my mine gave a diamond as big as a fist"
But with every gem in his pocket, the jewels he has missed
A lie to say, "o, my garden is growing taller by the day"
He only eats the best and tosses the rest away
Never will he be believe that his greed is a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer can cheat him
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold
Six deep in the grave
His oldest pain and fear in life
There'll not be time
His oldest pain and fear in life
There'll not be time
Hey hey
Â 
Nor can he buy.
Something is out of reach
Something he wanted
Something is out of reach
He's being taunted
Something is out of reach
That he can' beg or stealA lie to say "o, my forest has trees that block the sun
And when i cut them down i don't answer to anyone"
No, no, never will he believe that his greed is a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer can cheat him
He'll take his gold where he's lying cold
Six deep in the graveEmbed
