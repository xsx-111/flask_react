Oomingmak LyricsSoon I see it wasn’t even he who lives for me
Onnena-banana-pila need a day for me
Feel the sun feed on me
Early morning millionaire
Haunting me it fills my face
Can I make a magic thing?
I’ve gone against the greater good so here’s what I still do
On-onnenapila Austratila teacup
Feel the sun feed on me
Early morning millionaire
Hiding faces, laundry day
The sun is here I need a padlock
Ruby is no more
Ruby is no one
Ruby, your fears now
Ruin my life no more
How can she stop
How can she stop
Ruby fears no one
Ruby’s glad now
What’s the next thing we get done? We learn how to dance
Leastly, post a letter and eat salad lettuce
Hold the sun, feel my wings
Early morning millionaire
Really slow, feel my face
Nearly make a human now
Love is just the little bits of everything I do
Hook me on a Chivas Always-tila teacup
Hold the sun, feel my wings
Early morning millionaire
Really dumb but holy power
Imagine sounds, sleepy sounds
I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (love summer gone ah gone)
I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (nearly wobbly nearly wobbly wobble oh)
I feel the balance in the solace of the sun and the earth
I feel the balance in the solace of the earth
I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (nearly wobbly nearly wobbly wobble oh)
I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (hope summer gone ah gone)
I feel the balance in the solace of the sun and earth1Embed
