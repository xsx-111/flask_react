Fluffy Tufts LyricsI don't need my love, please call oh
Any day now all the suffering that I knew
Will follow freedom on to you
Any day now all the suffering that I knew
Will follow through my heart to you
Do call (I’ll keep my heart oh)
Nothing at all
Oh (nothing)
Do call
Nothing at all
Oh (Oh)
Any day now all the suffering that I knew
Will follow through my heart to you
Do call
Welcome all
Oh (Oh)
(Bah-dah …)
Do call
Baby come crawl
Baby call (Oh)
Do call
Baby come crawl
Oh (Oh)
(Bah-dah …)
Do call
Baby come crawl
Oh (Oh)
I don't need my love, please call oh
Any day now all the suffering that I knew
Will follow through my heart to you
Do call
Do call
Do call
Do call
Do call
Do callEmbed
