Feet-like Fins LyricsSo down, down, down down down
Never before, never better
Don’t say so, never at all
Down, down, oh no
Down, down, oh down down down
Down, oh, down
Down so long, forever and ever
Down, down to me
Down, down
Down, down is
Down, for you and me
Down, down is our love
Far down is our lover
Down, down, down there
...
‘Cause you’re a
Bad guy girl
Gargamelle
Tellurian
Can you tell
The need I see
When I doubt
The cure he had
Don’t you know that
Jesus knows
Who’s he inside
Bats are his guide
Know that they want
Easy girls
That’s what she’s called
I will send them
Flecks of love
Let Florrie know
Let go … my god
…
Don’t tell us how you are lost to
What he does without your love
How he felt, never before
Never love
That’s true
He’s the better and the weaker one
Oh, so lost
He’ll be yours soon after thisEmbed
