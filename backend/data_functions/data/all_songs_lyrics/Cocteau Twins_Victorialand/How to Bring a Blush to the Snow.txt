How to Bring a Blush to the Snow LyricsNo no no no no
(I did everything)
(I want a banana)
But it’s driving me bonkers
(I did everything)
(I want a banana)
Every beddie time he cries
(I want a banana)
(I want a banana)
They mostly never soothe them
(Oh wonderful food-ah)
(Oh wonderful food-ah)
I did everything
I did everything
No no no no no
(I did everything)
(I want a banana)
But it’s driving me bonkers
(I did everything)
(I want a banana)
Every beddie time he cries
(I want a banana)
(I want a banana)
They mostly never soothe them
(Oh wonderful food-ah)
(Oh wonderful food-ah)
I did everything
(The fold-over, proper cheeks, I got …)
I did everything
(… Be firm, I said “It’s very fattening!”)
(oh)

Siss, I miss your commentary

They mostly never soothe them

(You ate a banana)
Oh wonderful food-ah

Someone hurry, hurry
(Oh wonderful food-ah)
Siss, I miss your commentary
(Oh wonderful food-ah)
Any time he cries
(You ate a banana)

They mostly never soothe them

Oh wonderful food-ah
(The fold-over, proper cheeks, I got …)
Oh wonderful food-ah
