Lazy Calm LyricsTry to talk to us
You’re like a candle gone to earth
(In this fallen world)
I can feel your speech just like
A secret to be borne
(For the mortal world)
All your life you gave me strength
That told me of your love
(In this fallen world)
Don’t you know the rest of us
Will follow some fine day
(Leave this mortal world)
Oh I heard you’re leaving please don’t leave me here
Oh how can I have anything to mourn?
Oh bella vita’s everything you lived …
Oh bella vita makes no sense at all
Are you us all?
Try to speak with me
My thoughts will be your feelings
(And your voice will be my carol)
(In the mortal world)
(Need your living ghost)
Dolorosa sees my soul
Will call me after you
(And your voice will be my carol)
(In the mortal world)
(I need your living ghost)
Don’t you know the strength your heart
Can pull out from my own
(And I grieve you on my own)
(Leave this mortal world)
(Another living ghost)
Oh I heard you’re leaving please don’t leave me here
Oh how can I have anything to mourn?
Oh bella vita’s everything you lived …
Oh bella vita makes no sense at all
Are you us all?4Embed
