Throughout the Dark Months of April and May LyricsWhy can't we change?
Oh
I'm above June flu
Oh
Secretive day
Oh
Glad it might rain soon
Oh
Feasted in rain
Glorious weeds
Oh
Secretive time
Oh
I've had my May ghosts
Oh
Buried in rain
Oh
Festive in May
Feeling lost since you’ve gone
Are you there mom?
Close to nervous and now
I'm all wet nah
(Ready freddy to be found)
No da ours
You da small
Baby smell ah
Concertina
Aunt brought
Mom and dadda
Testy pa
You said me
Gone-y moo-la
(Frosty’s barely to be had)
Concertina
Aunt brought
Mom and dadda
Testy pa
You said me
Gone-y moo-la
Oh
Could we ascend?
Oh
Firewood stops stigma
Oh
Singular scent
Oh
Tree sap ascends now
Oh
Doctissima (doctissima)
Oh
This is ditissima tissimaEmbed
