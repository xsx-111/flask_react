Here They Come LyricsHere they come
And they fly with the power of the Sun
Here they come
And they're going to touch everyone
Far, far have they come
Here they come
And the fire on their wings doesn't burn
Here they come
And they know everything we must learn
Round, round we must turn
Watch out, you sinners
Don't you know that your time has come?
Watch out, you winners
Now it's the same for everyone
Here they come
And the stars in their eyes seem to glow
Here they come
And the fear in our hearts starts to go
Now, now, now we all knowEmbed
