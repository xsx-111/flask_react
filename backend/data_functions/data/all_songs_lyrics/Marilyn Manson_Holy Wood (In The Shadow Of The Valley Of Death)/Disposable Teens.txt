Disposable Teens Lyrics
And I'm a black rainbow, and I'm an ape of god
I've got a face that's made for violence upon
And I'm a teen distortion, survived abortion
A rebel from the waist down

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I wanna thank you mom, I wanna thank you dad
For bringing this fucking world to a bitter end
I never really hated the one true God
But the God of the people I hated

You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great, big hit
You say you want a revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit

We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable
You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great, big hit
You say you want a revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

The more that you fear us, the bigger we get
The more that you fear us, the bigger we get
And don't be surprised, don't be surprised
Don't be surprised when we destroy all of it

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great, big hit
You say you want a revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit
Yeah yeah yeah
You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great, big hit
You say you want a revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit
Yeah yeah yeah
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable3Embed
