Coma Black Lyrics

"A loved one laid his head in her lap
Red roses fell to the floor
And the world stood still"

My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I didn't know what love was on that day
Heart's a tiny blood clot, I picked at it
It never heals, it never goes away

Burned all the good things in the Eden eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
Burned all the good things in the Eden eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die

This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

I would have told her then, she was the only thing
That I could love, in this dying world
But the simple word of love itself
Already died and went away
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

Burned all the good things in the Eden eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
Burned all the good things in the Eden eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die

This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

Her heart's a bloodstained egg, we didn't handle with care
It's broken and bleeding, and we could never repair
Her heart's a bloodstained egg, we didn't handle with care
It's broken and bleeding, and we could never repair
And we can never repair6Embed
