GodEatGod Lyrics
Dear God, do you wanna tear your knuckles down
And hold yourself?
Dear God, can you climb off that tree?
Meat in the shape of a 'T'
Dear God, the paper says
You were the King in the black limousine
Dear John and all the King's men
Can't put your head together again

Before the bullets, before the flies
Before authorities take out my eyes
The only smiling are you dolls that I made
But you are plastic, so are your brains

Dear God, your sky is as blue
As a gunshot wound
Dear God, if you were alive
You know we'd kill you

Before the bullets, before the flies
Before authorities take out my eyes
The only smiling are you dolls that I made
But you are plastic, so are your brains4Embed
