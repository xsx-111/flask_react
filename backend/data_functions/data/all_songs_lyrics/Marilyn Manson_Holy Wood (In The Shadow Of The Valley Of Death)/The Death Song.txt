The Death Song Lyrics
We're on a bullet and we're headed straight into God
Even he'd like to end it, too
We take a pill, get a face, buy our ticket
And we hope that heaven's true

I saw a cop beat a priest on the TV
And they know they killed our heroes, too

We sing the death song, kids
'Cause we got no future
And we wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
(Let's sing the death song, kids)

We light a candle on an Earth we made into hell
And pretend that we're in heaven
Each time we do, we get the blind man's ticket
And we know that nothing's true

I saw a priest kill a cop on the TV
And I know now they're our heroes, too
We sing the death song, kids
'Cause we got no future
And we wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you

We sing the death song, kids
We sing the death song, kids

We sing the death song, kids
We sing the death song, kids
We write our prayers on a little bomb
Kiss it on the face and send it to God

We sing the death song, kids
'Cause we got no future
And we wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you

We were the world
Now we got no future
We wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
We were the world
We got no future
We wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
We wanna be just like you
(Let's sing the death song, kids)4Embed
