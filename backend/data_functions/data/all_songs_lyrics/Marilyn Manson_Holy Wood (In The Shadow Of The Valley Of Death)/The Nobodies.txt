The Nobodies Lyrics
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt
Today I'm dirty, I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are

Yesterday I was dirty, wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt
Yesterday I was dirty, wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are

Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day

2005 Against All Gods Mix:
I don't know love, I never cared to and I'm not sure if I ever will
I'm a student of hate. I know now that god is a medium
Whatever I expected to save me from this life is no longer the one I can hate
It is the people that made me; it is the people I wanted so much to be
I may only find love in their destruction

We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies (Na na-na na na, na na-na na na)
We're dead, they'll know just who we are (Na na-na na na, na na-na na)
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies (Na na-na na na, na na-na na na)
We're dead, they'll know just who we are
We're the nobodies, wanna be somebodies
We're dead, they'll know just who we are17Embed
