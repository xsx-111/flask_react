The Fight Song Lyrics
Nothing suffocates you more than
The passing of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask
You make your children breathe in to survive

But I'm not a slave to a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit
And when we were good you just closed your eyes
So when we are bad we'll scar your minds

Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight

You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
Celebrated victim of your fame
They'll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
And say that death was on sale today

And when we were good you just closed your eyes
So when we are bad we'll scar your minds
But I'm not a slave to a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of millions' just a statistic

But I'm not a slave to a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit
But I'm not a slave to a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit

Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight15Embed
