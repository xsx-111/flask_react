Burning Flag Lyrics
They wanna sell it out, buy it up, dumb it down
A good God is hard to find
Join the crowd that wants to see me dead
Right now, I feel I belong for the first time

Multiply your death, divide by sex
Add up the violence, and what do you get?

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

You can point your gun at me and hope it will go away
If God was alive, he would hate you, anyway

My right wing is flapping, the left one is grey
Let's hear it for the kids, but nothing they say
They gyrate and G-rate on Election Day
We got our ABC's and our F-U-C-K
F-U-C-K, F-U-C-K
Multiply your death, divide by sex
Add up the violence and what do you get?

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

Point your gun at me and hope it will go away
If God was alive, he would hate you, anyway

We are all just stars and we're waiting
We are all just scarred and we're hating
We are all just stars on your burning flag

Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag
Stars on your burning flag4Embed
