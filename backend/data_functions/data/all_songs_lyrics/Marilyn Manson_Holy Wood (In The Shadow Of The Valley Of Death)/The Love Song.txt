The Love Song Lyrics
"Got a crush on a pretty pistol
Should I tell her that I feel this way?
Father told us to be faithful"
"Got a crush on a pretty pistol
Should I tell her that I feel this way?
Got love songs in my head, killing us away"

"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?" (Fuck yeah!)

Got love songs in my head
Killing us away
Got love songs in my head
Killing us away

"She tells me I'm a pretty bullet
Gonna be a star someday
Mother says that we should look away"
"She tells me I'm a pretty bullet
An imitation Christ
Got love songs in my head, killing us away!"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?" (Fuck yeah!)

I got love songs in my head
Killing us away
Got love songs in my head
Killing us away
Got love songs in my head
Killing us away!

"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?"
"Do you love your guns?" (Yeah!)
"God?" (Yeah!)
"The government?" (Fuck yeah!)7Embed
