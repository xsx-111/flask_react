The Fall of Adam Lyrics
The Abraham Lincoln town cars arrive
To dispose of our king and queen
They orchestrated dramatic new scene
For Celebritarian needs
When one world ends, something else begins
But without a scream
Just a whisper, because we just
Start it over again

Do you love your guns, your God and your government?
Let me hear you! (Hey!)
Do you love your guns and your God and your government?
Let me hear you, goddamn it! (Hey!)
Do you love your guns and your God and your government?
Let me hear you! (Hey!)
Your mother and your father and your baby?
Goddamn it, let me hear you! (Hey!)
Do you love your guns?
I want your mothers and your fathers to hear you say it! (Hey!)
Every single one of you motherfuckers
Let me hear it from you! (Hey!)
Do you love your guns and your God and your government?
(Hey!)
I wanna hear it from everybody
I wanna hear you say you want a gun
Let me hear it! (Hey!)Embed
