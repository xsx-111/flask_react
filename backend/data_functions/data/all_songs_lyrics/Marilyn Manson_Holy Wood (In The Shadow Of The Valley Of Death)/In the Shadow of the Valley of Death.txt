In the Shadow of the Valley of Death Lyrics
We have no future, heaven wasn't made for me
We burn ourselves to hell as fast as it can be
And I wish that I could be the king
Then I'd know that I am not alone

Maggots put on shirts, sell each others shit
Sometimes I feel so worthless, sometimes I feel discarded
I wish that I was good enough
Then I'd know that I am not alone

Death, it is policeman, death, it is the priest
Death is the stereo, death is TV
Death is the Tarot, death is an angel
Death is our god, killing us all

She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
I'm just the ashes
She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
I'm just the ashes
She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string...5Embed
