Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis) Lyrics
Am I sorry your sky went black?
Put your knives in babies' backs
Am I sorry you killed the Kennedy's and Huxley, too?
But I'm sorry Shakespeare was your scapegoat
And your apple's sticking into my throat
Sorry your Sunday smiles are rusty nails
And your crucifixion commercials failed

But I'm just a pitiful anonymous (Yeah!)

I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song

Am I sorry just to be alive
Putting my face in the beehive?
Am I sorry for Booth and Oswald, pinks and cocaine, too?
Sorry you never check the bag in my head for a bomb
And my halo was a needle hole
Sorry I saw a priest being beaten
And I made a wish
But I'm just a pitiful anonymous

I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song
I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song

We all just sing their song
We all just sing their song

"Valley of Death, we are free
Your father's your prison, you see"
"Valley of Death, we are free
Your father's your prison, you see"

I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song
You're just a copy of an imitation
You're just a copy of an imitation
The president is dead, let us pray5Embed
