Cruci-Fiction in Space Lyrics
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
If Christ was in Texas
The hammer, the sickle, the only son
This is your creation
The atom of Eden was a bomb
If Jack was a Baptist
We'd drink wine from his head

This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man and the gun

I am a revolution
Pull my knuckles down, if I could
I am a revelation
And I'm nailed to the Holy Wood

This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man and the gun
We are dead, and tomorrow's canceled
Because of things we did yesterday
We are dead, and tomorrow's canceled
They crucify us in our space
In our space, in our space
In our space, in our space
In our space, in our space
In our space, in our space

This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gunEmbed
