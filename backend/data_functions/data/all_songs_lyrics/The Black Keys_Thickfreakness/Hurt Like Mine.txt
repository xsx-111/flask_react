Hurt Like Mine Lyrics
How you hurt me, oh how you cause me pain
Well hurt like mine you could, you could never never understand
Never understand

I remember the tears were in my eyes
River town is burning, the clouds they roll on by, roll on by

She said I am alright if you're hanging on
Be your shoulder, lay your troubles on
Your troubles onEmbed
