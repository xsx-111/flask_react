If You See Me LyricsIf you see me coming open up your door
If you see me coming open up your door
I'll give you more loving than any man before
When I hit your door, better treat me right
When I hit your door, better treat me right
Oh, I need you baby, got no time to
I'll do for you, I'm gonna do for you
If you do for me, I'm gonna do for you
I'll be your man if you ask me to1Embed
