Midnight In Her Eyes Lyrics
Midnight is in her eyes
Tear drops like a child
You never thought about going wrong
Now you wonder where your man has gone
Midnight is in her eyes

Lately you are feeling low
Heartache on the floor
Your manic ways got the best of you
But your heart is going to see you through
Lately, you're feeling low

I see her everywhere
Long amber hair
Calling out my name
I am calling just the same

Midnight is in her eyes
Tear drops like a child
You never thought about going wrong
Now you wonder where your man has gone
Midnight is in her eyes
Is in her eyes
Is in her eyes
Is in her eyes1Embed
