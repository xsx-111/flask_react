I Cry Alone LyricsMy girl, my girl had a hold on me
So tight, tight that I could not see
Girl, had a hold on me, she held so tight that I could not see
My girl, my girl had a hold on me
One day, one day I let her go
It hurt, hurt so you'll never know
The day I had to let her go, it hurt so bad that you cannot know
One day, one day I let her go
At night, at night I cry alone
I weep, I weep 'till the early morn
At night, I cry alone, I weep all night, till the early morning
At night, at night I cry aloneEmbed
