Thickfreakness Lyrics
Well now here I am, I am not here now, no, no, darlin'
And I'll care for you - hey that's all I want to do
Hold me, love me, in your heart

And I will hold you near and I'll whisper in your ear
Now I'll take your hand, I will make you understand
Hold me, love me in your heart3Embed
