Set You Free Lyrics
You hold on
To love that's gone
Run a mile
To see him smile
But you don't know
He's door to door
Playing you
For the fool

Let him go
Walk out your door
And come to me
I'm going to set you free

Now you know
There you go
Back to him
He gonna do you in
Tear you down
And run you around
Treat you wrong
And then he's gone
Let him go
To walk out your door
Please, come to me
I'm going to set you free

You hold on
To love that is gone
Run a mile
To see him smile
But you don't know
He is door to door
Playing you
For the fool

Let him go
Walk out the door
And come to me
I'm gonna set you free

I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free2Embed
