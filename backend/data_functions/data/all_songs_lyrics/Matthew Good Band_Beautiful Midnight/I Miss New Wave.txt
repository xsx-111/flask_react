I Miss New Wave LyricsGonna fly to Hawaii
Get laid in a lawn chair
Drown in a bathtub
Fill it with cheap beer
I miss new wave
And movies about losing
Or just the parts where it's okay
See, baby, I got something right
When the world is screaming
I miss new wave
And real intent
Real, real
Gonna drive to L.A
Get laid at the Rose Bowl
Drown in a hot tub
Fill it with models
I miss new wave
And hearing the scratches on my long plays
Or just the parts that sound okay
See, baby, I got something right
When the world is screaming
I miss new wave
And real intent
Real, real
Gonna die in Coquitlam
Get laid by a golf course
That I never went to
Well, it's not a real sport
And I miss new wave
And watching you walk away
So go on, it's okay
See, baby, I got something right
See, baby, I got something right
See, baby, I got one thing right1Embed
