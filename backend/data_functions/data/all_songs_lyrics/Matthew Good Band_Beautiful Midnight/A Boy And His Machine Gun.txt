A Boy And His Machine Gun LyricsDon't move, stay right where you are
Talking can only give you away
And there's so nothing to say
The voices say hello
Imprisoned, they're invisible
But we look a lot alike
This is boring, all we talk about is you
Come on give me a reason
A boy and his machine gun
When you're finished struggling
Are you free tonight?
Did they stick you in here
Cause you weren't working right?
Don't move stay just like you are
You look sane motionless like that
So very flat
It's amazing what velocity can do
When human beings are in season
A boy and his machine gun
If you're quiet we might see some
When you're finished struggling
Are you free tonight?
Did they stick you in here cause you weren't working right?
There's a tv in every room
And it's free even pay-per-view
Which you'll need if no one's going to visit you
Animal
I know who you're waiting for
No one's coming though
So fuck you and your principals
And fuck whatever made me
Perhaps you think I'm evil
Perhaps you think I'm crazyEmbed
