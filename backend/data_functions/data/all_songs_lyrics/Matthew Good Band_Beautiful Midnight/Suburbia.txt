Suburbia LyricsYou will come back within yourself
You can be art when we melt
And I will know what you were for
I say we're leaving
There ain't nothing here at all
Another day, a week, the mall
And baby if I was in demand
You would be mine
You would be mine
Someday this place is gonna burn
Is your whole life in there, waiting?
Someday your head is gonna turn
And you'll realize I'm missing
Do you realize?
You will come back, convince yourself
You can stay alive and wait for me
And I will know what this was for
And I'll say we're leaving
There ain't nothing here at all
Another month, a year, that's all
So you can tell them I'm coming, and
Hell's coming with me
Hell's coming with me
Someday this place is gonna burn
Is your whole life in there, waiting?
Someday their heads are gonna turn
And they'll realize
They'll realize
They'll realize
You're missingEmbed
