Load Me Up LyricsPicture yourself
Sleeping on a plane
There's something ticking in the overhead
And inside your brains
There's bodies in the water
And bodies in your basement
If Heaven's for clean people
It's vacant
Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you, you know?
Hey, are you, are you being careful
Hey, are you, are you, are you lukewarm?
Hey, yeah you are
I'm frantic
So load me up
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out
Picture yourself
Swimming in an ocean
A million miles from nowhere
And the nearest phone
There's bodies in the water
Floating all around you
And all of them are talking
And they're comedians
Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you, you know?
Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you special?
Hey, are you, are you, are you, are you deformed?
Hey, yeah you are
I'm frantic
So load me up
It seems so practised
Me fucking this up
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out
Picture yourself
At the MGM Grand
Murphy's fighting Occam
You're in the stands, and
There's somebody in the water
In the middle of the ocean
A million miles from nowhere
And they're alone
I'm there alone
So, so deformed
So, so deformed
So, so deformed
I'm frantic
So load me up
It's seems so practised
Just take me and take me and take me
All the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out
Whatever puts me all the way out1Embed
