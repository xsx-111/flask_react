Born to Kill LyricsThere's a big beat
You're spinning in my TV
A magician
The antidote
So I'm with him
Floating loaded
Enough to be released
Floating loaded
Enough to be released
It's more than the less you say you do
It's more than the shot that gets you through
Born to buy into something
Born to kill
There's a big beat
You're sleeping in my memory
Like Satan
Lonely
So I'm with him
Floating loaded
Enough to be released
Floating loaded
Enough to be released
Floating loaded
Enough to be released
It's more than the less you say you do
It's more than the shot that gets you through
Born to buy into something
Born to kill
It's more than the less you say you do
It's more than the shot that gets you through
Born to buy into something
Born to killEmbed
