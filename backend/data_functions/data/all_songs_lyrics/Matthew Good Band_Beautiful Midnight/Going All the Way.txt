Going All the Way LyricsWell this is it
So where its all
Monomaniacs
Baby, you know It's all we're good for
Drugs for the kids
If the kids are flat
All dressed up to match
Those shit eating grins look effortless
And if theres nothing left to die for
And all this, our beauty
Is just decay
And if theres nothing left to die for
Then you and me
Let's go out going all the way
Well this is it
So where its at
Megalomaniacs
Baby, you know its all we're good for
Those missile men
With their master plans
Don't get paid to understand
Makes you wonder where we got these shit eating grins from
And if theres nothing left to die for
And all this, our beauty
Is just decay
And if theres nothing left to die for
Then you and me
Let's go out going all the way
Dreams of the sea
Caught way inland
Caught way inland
Cut his losses
We'll cut our losses
We'll cut our losses
We'll cut our loss
Cut our loss down
Cut our loss down
Cut our loss down
Cut our loss down
And if theres nothing left to die for
And all this, our beauty
Is just decay
And if theres nothing left to die for
Then you and me
Let's go out going all the way
Then you and me
Let's go out going all the way
Going all the way
Going all the wayEmbed
