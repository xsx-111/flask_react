Hello Time Bomb LyricsI found me a reason
So check me tomorrow
We'll see if I'm leaking
Push and push and push 'till it hurts
The Devil's on roller-skates
The Devil's on roller-skates
Down at the roller rink
Picking up chicks for me
Ones that push and push and push 'till it hurts
Push and push 'till it hurts
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Life's for the living
So check me tomorrow
We'll see if I'm kidding
Push and push and push 'till it hurts
Did it on Ritalin
I got me some good grades
Now I work me the night shift, where I
Pull and pull and pull 'till it hurts
Pull and pull 'till it hurts
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Hello, time bomb, I'm ready to go off
Hello, time bomb, I'm ready to go off
Hahahaha
If life's for the livid
Check me tomorrow
We'll see if I'm emperor
The devil's on sugar smacks
Down at the Radio Shack
Turning shit into solid gold
Solid gold
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Hello, time bomb, I'm ready to go off
Hello, time bomb, I'm ready to go
Ready to go offEmbed
