Running For Home LyricsThey beam things into your head
The ghosts of your pleasure in contempt
When we were liars things were seamless
When we were wired the world was like a secret
I close my eyes now and I scream
I turn the light on and there's nothing left redeeming
I saw your face before it changed
The gun, it makes you look nicer in a bad way
So low for how high
It's too late tonight
And I'm sure you're right
So low for how high
And after this there's just the circus
And every morning your carnie heart stops working
It gets tight in there sometimes
Looking for those defects, talking like it's a reflex
I close my mouth now and I scream
I open the door and there's nothing left redeeming
I saw your face before in rough
You should wait around a while
Cause your body is bound to turn up
So low for how high
It's too late tonight
And I'm sure you're right
So low for how high
So low for how highEmbed
