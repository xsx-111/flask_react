Giant LyricsK-I-C-K-A-S-S
That's the way we spell "success"
Shake me, I'm waiting
In your new ark they're saying
I'm the creature in your sick thing
Everybody sees a giant
When the bad Moon in your heart sings
And your wind-up gears start grinding
Your teeth feel you smiling
The better, happier you
A better, happier you
When you blow out like a dead star
It reminds me how uniform your beautiful is
We carry on like it's easy
Like you're all out and I'm your man
Baby, I'm your man
Hit me, I'm bleeding
In your lounger, on your grooming
It's the future, it's whoring
The better, happier you
A better, happier you
When you blow out like a dead star
It reminds me how uniform your beautiful is
We carry on like it's easy
Like you're all out, and I'm your man
Baby, I'm your man
When you blow out like a dead star
It reminds me how uniform your beautiful is
We carry on like we're easy
Like we're all out, and I'm your man
Baby, I'm your man
When you blow out like a dead star
It reminds me how uniform your beautiful is
We carry on like it's easy
Like you're all out and I'm your man
Baby, I'm your man
