Failing The Rorschach Test LyricsHey Alice
I'm caving in, I'm caving in
I know it's not allowed
But sometimes I fantasize
I'm peeling off my skin
Enough to fill it up again
Hey rabbit
Into the pavement
I'm caving in
Mother told me to be something
So I'm afraid
Enough to stay wide awake
Hey rabbit
I came to win, I came to win
I know it's not allowed but sometimes
You might find
It's feels like nothing is
And it's everything you've been
Hey Alice
Into the pavement
I'm caving in
Mother told me to be something
So I'm afraid
Enough to stay wide awake
This ain't real baby
I've got a better excuse for myself
I'm always hereEmbed
