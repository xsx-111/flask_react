Billy Not Really Lyrics
Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean, oh, why me
Don't see why I need all these hands, can't stand by these
Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean, oh, why me
Don't see why I need all these hands, can't stand by these

All my palm lines running, stretching
'Cross my palm like blind cross etching
Palm mummified chimera filming
Bronze my palm now, all brown palm now
Visits some medium, won't come near me
Treats me like a meteor, she scares me

My bony, now, now, Billy, not really
My bony, now, now, Billy, not really

Yo, oi, yo, ouh, aww, Billy, Billy, not really, yo, raw
Yo, oi, yo, ouh, aww, Billy, Billy, not really, yo, oi, yo, amnesia
Yo, oi, yo, ouh, aww, Billy, Billy, not really, yo, raw
Yo, oi, yo, ouh, aww, Billy, Billy, not really, yo, oi, yo, amnesia

Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean, oh, why me
Don't see why I need all these hands, can't stand by these
Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean, oh, why me
Don't see why I need all these hands, can't stand by these
Every movement after sudden movement, déjà vu abductee
Sucky sucky, sticky psyche touching so many sensory
Dripping, dripping, dripping, splashing, splashing happening
Already, now, now, Billy, not really

Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean, oh, why me
Don't see why I need all these hands, can't stand by these

My bony, now, now, Billy, not really
My bony, now, now, Billy, not really

Amnesia
Yo, oi, yo, ouh, aww, Billy, Billy, not really, yo, raw
Yo, oi, yo, ouh, aww, Billy, Billy, not really, yo, oi, yo, amnesia
I man tsunami feral, get barreled in other worlds
No hand in sea of pearls, buried in frozen Jheri curls
I man Herzog shooting solitaire (-taire)
No hands, savoir nova shaka glare Zulu somnambulist lair
Flick of my wrist ouh, shit, ouh, awhoo shit
Phantom lix crude lix, I man island exclusive
Flick of my wrist ouh, shit, ouh, awhoo shit
Flick of my wrist awe shit, aww, I'm not shit
She tune in telly through your shriveled button pressed jaundice yellow
She's your experience, you're her experiment
Her vox limbo fine print in obese sharpie so sorry falsetto
You're her experiment, she's your experience30Embed
