Black Quarterback Lyrics
I'm so black quarterback, throw off this app by his badge
Blare my organ for juice, pipes spike blonde kinks on my boots
Approach me licking his fur, whining, "I demand a word"
Swine must be all the way hatched, hella yolk raining down his chest
Clucking so fucking hard, glance heartbeat through his vest
So I'm like, "Go ahead, blood," but my mind's on my wrist
Five minutes pass, I'm-a have to make you my piss
Gimp just kept shaking so I had to braid him like this
Comfort over freedom, pave a path of leisure, have it all
Freedom over comfort, give you back so much leisure, feel small
Xeroxed man dressed in gauze, spider silk, and menopause
Mustache showered with applause, squished out packets like taco sauce
Gather crowd, laugh it off, Mr. Zogged by your boss

I'm so black quarterback, air it out, albino
Black quarterback in all black, he's so white, no
I'm so black quarterback in all black, albino

Heady baby, Eddie's crazy, cadabra, abrogate need
To blut, bank on absolutely, to blut, bank on absolutely

Bad ass Betty, maiden bb, in over our heads and sinking
Autobahning Wonder Stevie, faster comrade winking
Black quarterback
Black quarterback in all black

Dangling out the- waning in the- (Black quarterback)
Kicked under the- vague it on the-
Me versus the- losing to the-  (Black quarterback in all black)
Cackling like the-  crackling through the-
Cool despite the- abusing the-
Lunar as the- space between the-
Fucked beyond the- Eddie as the head that wears us out-

I'm so black quarterback, air it out, albino
Black quarterback in all black, he's so white, no
I'm so black quarterback in all black, albino
Black quarterback in all black, he's so white, no
I'm so black quarterback

Heady baby, Eddie's crazy, cadabra, abrogate need
To blut, bank on absolutely, to blut, bank on absolutely

You call this speeding, turn the door off, we're leaving
Meet you in our next fetus, Romulus and Remus
Black quarterback
Black quarterback in all black
Black quarterback
Black quarterback in all black24Embed
