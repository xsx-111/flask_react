Sun of Nothing LyricsEverywhere I look they are there
What is everyone doing?
Going to a home?
Everywhere I look they are there
What is everyone doing?
Going to a home?
To a place that makes us feel warm
A place that grants us a smile
Seems like a very simple idea, but not hardly figured out
(Looking everywhere)
I just see faces
Faces staring blank as they go on with the routine
I just see faces
Faces staring blank as they go on with the routine
This routine
Nothing new
It's time to go through with this
This routine
Nothing new
It's time to go through with this
This routine
Nothing new
It's time to go through with this
A spaceman
That's what they say I am
Nothing but a spaceman
A spaceman
That's what they say I am
Nothing but a spaceman
Always pushing it all away
Trying to get to that one place I call home
The journey begins
Forcing a new life with the unexplained
A creeping rush that surrounds me
Floating away
Floating away, floating away, floating away
Always pushing it all away
Trying to get to that one place I call home
My own planet
I allowed this wish
Unexpected
Not knowing why
Not knowing why
Wonder why I question it now
I'm my own planet
Not many can experience this sensation
Loneliness is creeping out, or in, however you think of it
But it sure is surrounding me
Maybe all the complaining is an occurance of boredom
I suppose it's too late
I am floating
I am floating
I am floating
I am floating
I did love, I did laugh, I did live
(Now I'm my own planet)
A spaceman
They say I am?
A spaceman
They say I am?
A spaceman
They say I am?
A spaceman
They say I am?
Planets everywhere
My own destiny?
I'm floating towards the sun
The sun of nothing
Floating towards the sun
The sun of nothing
I have become the sun of nothing
Nothing is here
Memories are not clear
Floating towards the sun
The sun of nothing
Floating towards the sun
The sun of nothing
Floating, floating, floating, floating
Further away
I can't believe that's what it has come to
I never really had it all that bad
I just looked around and never thought about the blank stares
Blank stares
They were looking into something much worse than what I thought I was
Selfishness is a very sticky quality of this species
Looking around, I don't see any faces
Yes, I am lonely
It's to be expected
I'll sleep now
