Foam Born (A) The Backtrack Lyrics
I will just keep waiting
You'll just keep waiting
In the cold
The supplement
We lost some friends
We drove the bends
So small

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

A conscious decision to persuade ourselves
Amongst the common human
The drive to complete ourselves
Has become a blurry vision
Always wanting more
Bettering ourselves through selfish minds
It has started to overflow
A current that creates this undertow
Swimming beneath it all2Embed
