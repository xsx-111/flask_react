Foam Born (B) The Decade of Statues Lyrics
I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting
I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting
I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting
I will just keep waiting

Obsession
Obsessive
Obsessed
Abscessed
Obsession
Obsessive
Obsessed
Abscessed

Rip out my fucking eyes
I can't watch you grow into this
I can't watch the young turn to all of this

Their eyes left wide
Night goggles instead of sleep
Night goggles instead of sleep
Live life
You have all helped me be free from this
The few times
Relaxation steps in, bringing me a peaceful place
Live life
You have all helped me be free from this
The few times
Relaxation steps in, bringing me a peaceful place

It's a must these days
For the colors are fading
It's a must these days
For the colors are fading
It's a must these days
For the colors are fading
It's a must these days
For the colors are fading

Enclosed in a space of soothing sounds
Walking in my own movie
The fly-by, with no remembrance
Constant rushing
The waves have pushed me to where I need to be
Walking in my own movie
The fly-by, with no remembrance
Constant rushing
The waves have pushed me to where I need to be
Sunlight drenched on my skin
Only the sounds of what my mind wants to hear
Block out the rush hour
Block out the tired herds
Only the sounds of what my mind wants to hear
Block out the rush hour
Block out the tired herds

On the shaded side
It's starting to affect the process of your reading eyes
An aggressive need for hostile voice is creeping away

This block happens every year
(And like I said before, the color keeps fading)
This block happens every year
(I couldn't trade this for anything in the world)
This block happens every year
(And all of you are the reason)
This block happens every year
(You're the reason)

It's been a while since we've written each other
And hopefully this will comfort you
'Cause like most of my kind
I won't take it all for granted
For granted
I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting

It's a must these days
For the colors are fading
It's a must these days
For the colors are fading
It's a must these days
For the colors are fading7Embed
