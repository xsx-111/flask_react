Informal Gluttony Lyrics
(Build, rebuild)
Cannot close our eyes

Construction paper traffic
Corner office destruction
The cityscape burns brighter by the hour
Clock tower
Bring us
Bring us all
Bring us all
Bring us all down
Marching like ants to the foundation of the higher form
Trash
Capped and smothered
Trash bag
Trash hat
Wrinkle-free clients of doom
Trash bag
Trash hat
Wrinkle-free clients of doom

Feed me fear
(Informal)
Feed me fear
(Gluttony)
Feed me fear
(Informal)
Feed me fear
Construction paper lawns
Force-fed attention grabber
When will you learn?
First come, first serve
The all-you-can-eat trumpet
Playing the tunes of our death
The all-you-can-eat trumpet
Playing the tunes of our death

Breathe
(Now blow! Now blow!)
Breathe
(Now blow! Now blow! Now blow!)

Let it be heard
Let it be
Let it be heard
The preacher's talent is going through the airwaves
I need to be led in the right direction

The little kids taught me well
But I wonder why they don't listen anymore
Eat and watch; eat, eat, eat what they feed
Corner office tubes give me the best view in the hut
Feed me fear
