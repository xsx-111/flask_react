White Walls LyricsThe monsters are made
And we have proven that we'll be one of them
The whores take the stage
The whores take the stage
Flash our skills
Gotta draw 'em in
Gotta keep 'em on their toes
On their toes
Don't show them who you truly are
Who would want honesty?
Who would want a group of people that one can relate with?
Don't show them who you truly are
Who would want honesty?
Who would want a group of people that one can relate with?
They have to look up
Simple peasants
Who the fuck thinks we can all be on some similar plane?
We need worship (We need worship)
We need worship (We need worship)
We need devotion
Becoming gods from the image that is thrown
Thrown out in their everyday lives to comfort
We need devotion
Becoming gods from the image that is thrown
Thrown out in their everyday lives to comfort
It's not a musical journey anymore
They chose Camilla and we stood by her the entire time
Monotonous expression, a forced replica of a tired sound
Puppets for a greed-driven carnival
The same charade as the passing years
Force me out there
Don't give them a chance
Don't give them a chance
They want to be fed
Fed a simple replication of past greatness
Step back
(Evaluate, recognize)
We just need to throw some new ideas and it will eventually
Get out of this closed off circle
We are part of
We are part of
Get out of this closed off circle
Get out of this closed off circle
It's all the same
This is all we have
When we die
It's what's left of us
When we die
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this
White wall
White wall
