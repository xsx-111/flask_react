Ants of the Sky LyricsNow
My teeth taste funny today
They seem more jagged than normal
I’ve been told, I’ve been told, I’ve been told
That I have been grinding like gears during my dream hours
I wonder if it’s just my thoughts fusing into one frequent dream
One which parts with the night
The night
I saw them dragging the other day
Other day
Scraping their knees
Seems the high horse is taking them all home
I can’t leave myself out
Seems the high horse is taking them all home
I can’t leave myself out, self out
Why should we sleep today?
Why should we awake tomorrow?
We can just pop back a few
And drift through
This pre-programmed flight
We can just pop back a few
And drift through
This pre-programmed flight
Across all oceans (a windy, noisy trek)
Across all oceans (a windy, noisy trek)
Across all oceans (a windy, noisy trek)
Across all oceans (a windy, noisy trek)
This seems to be what I’ve needed
We were brought up to grow into one
We were brought up to grow into one
I’m going to fly up soon, and seek other lands
The soothing air of flight
A bird’s eye view
Into what I’ve always imagined life could be
Will it be sought after?
It might just be useless
Writings and ideas, that laziness will corrupt in the end
Bones of dust need hardening
I think the prescription
I think the prescription is found
Sleep on
Sleep on, fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on, fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on, fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on, fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
My teeth grin oddly
Today (today)
They seem to gleam more than
Normal (normal)
Maybe it will be noticed
The walking dead
