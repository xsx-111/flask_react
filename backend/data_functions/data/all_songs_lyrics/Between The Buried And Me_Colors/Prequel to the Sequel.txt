Prequel to the Sequel Lyrics
The headless lover of three
An unspeakable affair

The lady on the hill
Creates a glorious departure from her everyday
Her everyday life
Constant swelling of the ankles
A pleasant cry for help
A pleasant cry for help
A pleasant cry for help
She began to unfold her story
A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder

A perfect crime, that soon lived on
A different life it had to develop
Gripped by every limb it could hold
The lifeless ideas, it grew onto its own
A much needed surrender
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed a lifeless neck

From a monster to a beauty in quick months
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom
It decided it should take advantage
Advantage of this idea
Of this idea
(The average traveler hints at this every single day of their lives)

A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body
A spectacle none-the-less
Walking proud through life, letting its branches guide the way
A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine

It must be human, for its qualities seem to outdo even the grandest occupant of the town

This started to catch the attention of the un-branched
It had never experienced an affection of this kind
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life
This started to catch the attention of the un-branched
It had never experienced an affection of this kind
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life

Years went by as it finally found its true love
The love of others, of others
Three to be exact
Letting them into every secret
Feeding from every branch
Every part used for their lives
(This went on with no negative scents 'til the 5th year came around)

It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal
The breeze didn’t flow like it used to
The heart seemed to pound slower and slower
What caused this?
What caused this?
It soon was noticed
That these three had torn
Every branch, every single stem

Torn to its last life
How hadn’t it noticed a drastic change in the surroundings
It didn’t think anything could go this wrong
(Comfort) comfort, comfort, comfort
(Comfort) comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort

It thought life was constant happiness
If constant happiness was all that was given out
It thought life was constant happiness
If constant happiness was all that was given out (given out)
(It left its entire existence up to these three lovers)
Comfort, comfort
Comfort, comfort
Comfort, comfort
Comfort, comfort

Hints and all
They did as they pleased
And now it’s starting to wilt away
(They will see this LOST PERFECTION. It will come back around
Will the newborn live to tell this story? Rewind.)Embed
