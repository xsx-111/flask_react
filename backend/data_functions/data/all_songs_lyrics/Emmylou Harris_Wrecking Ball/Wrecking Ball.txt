Wrecking Ball LyricsMy life's an open book, you read it on the radio
We've got nowhere to hide, we got nowhere to go
But if you still decide you want to take a ride
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
I see your smokey eyes right across the bar
I've seen that look before shining from star to star
Though I can't take that chance
If you've got time for one dance
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
The restless line of cars goes stretching down the road
But I won't telephone 'cause you might say hello
What is it makes me feel this way?
What is it makes me want to say?
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonightEmbed
