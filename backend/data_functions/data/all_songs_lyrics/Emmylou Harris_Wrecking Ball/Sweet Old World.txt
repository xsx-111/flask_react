Sweet Old World Lyrics
See what you lost when you left this world
This sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world
This sweet old world

The breath from your own lips
The touch of fingertips
A sweet and tender kiss
The sound of a midnight train
Wearing someone's ring
Someone calling your name
Somebody so warm cradled in your arms
Didn't you think you were worth anything?

See what you lost when you left this world
This sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world
This sweet old world

Millions of us in love
Promises made good
Your own flesh and blood
Looking for some truth
Dancing with no shoes
The beat, the rhythm, and the blues
The pounding of your heart strong
Together with another one
Didn't you think anyone loved you?
See what you lost when you left this world
This sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world
This sweet old worldEmbed
