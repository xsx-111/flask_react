Deeper Well LyricsThe sun burned hot, it burned my eyes
Burned so hot I thought I'd died
Thought I'd died and gone to hell
Looking for the water from a deeper well
I went to the river, but the river was dry
I fell to my knees and I looked to the sky
I looked to the sky and the spring rain fell
I saw the water from a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper well
I was ready for love, I was ready for the money
Ready for the blood and ready for the honey
Ready for the winning, ready for the bell
Looking for the water from a deeper well
I found some love and I found some money
Found that blood would drip from the honey
Found I had a thirst that I could not quell
Looking for the water from a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper well
Well, I did it for kicks and I did it for hate
I did it for lust and I did it for faith
I did it for need and I did it for love
Addiction stayed on tight like a glove
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night
And the three of us were a terrible sight
Nipple to the bottle to the gun to the cell
To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper well
I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage
I shook those walls and I rattled that cage
I took my trouble down a dead-end trail
Reaching out a hand for a holier grail
Hey there, mama, did you carry that load?
Did you tell your baby about the bend in the road?
About the rebel yell, about the one that fell
Looking for the water from a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper well
Well, looking for the water from a deeper wellEmbed
