Waltz Across Texas Tonight LyricsThe wind can blow cold, it moans and it cries
When it carries the sound of a thousand goodbyes
But if you listen tonight on that high, lonely plain
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
You've been on a road that just don't seem to end
Where that broken old heart of yours won't ever mend
You've crossed over bridges and bridges they burn
So many rivers and so much to learn
So many bridges and so much to learn
But the moon is so full, the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady, my touch is light
Look in my eyes, hold on real tight
And I'll waltz you, my darling, across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you, my darling, across Texas tonight
We both have known hard luck and love that's gone wrong
When the ghosts take the shadows and the night takes too long
We folded our cards when the hand wasn't strong
But that wheel will keep spinning long after we're gone
Yeah, that wheel will keep spinning long after we're gone
And the moon is so full, the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady, my touch is light
Look in my eyes, hold on real tight
I'll waltz you, my darling, across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you, my darling, across Texas tonight
Look in my eyes, hold on real tight
And I'll waltz you, my darling, across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you, my darling, across Texas tonightEmbed
