Someone Like the Moon LyricsShe likes to watch the moon
As it travels through the sky
'Cause she's heard that it's romantic
Though she really can't see why
Someone should have helped her through the day
Someone like the moon
So she drinks a cup of coffee
And telephones a friend
And she asks if she can make it
So this night will never end
Someone should have helped her through the day
Someone like the moon
But the light comes
And the day bleeds through the sky
And the sun
The sun makes it hard to get through
And the radio only plays love songs so she cries
Though she knows it's such a bad thing to do
In the evening it gets better
And she thinks how it's not right
That someone so stupid
Can so easily screw up your life
Someone should have helped her through the day
Someone like the moon
But the light came
And the day bled through the sky
And the sun, the sun made it hard to get through
And the radio only played love songs so she cried
Though she knew it's such a bad thing to do
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Someone should have helped her through the day
Someone like the moonEmbed
