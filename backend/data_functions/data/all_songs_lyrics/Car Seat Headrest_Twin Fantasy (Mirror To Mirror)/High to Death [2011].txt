High to Death  LyricsI fell over
I fell onto the ground
I wish I was sober
I can't get up off the ground-round-round-round-round-round-round-round-round
When I closed my eyes
And I thought I was blind
It's the middle of the night
And I'll never be alright again
And this wallpaper
Keeps going round the room
Keeps going round the room
And I follow it around the room
And I follow it around the room
And I follow it around the room
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I still love you
But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
(You and Jane canâ€™t keep me in the paper anymore)
And I sat there on the steps
Considering death
There were only seconds left of the night
And I said hell is the sun
Burning forever at the center of things
A ball on fire at the center of things
A ball on fire at the center of things
A brain on fire at the center of things
A brain on fire at the center of things
And the sea isn't green
And I love this dream
But how exactly can we
Escape from behind the wall4Embed
