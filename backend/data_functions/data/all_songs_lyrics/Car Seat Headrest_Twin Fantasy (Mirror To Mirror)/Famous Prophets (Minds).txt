Famous Prophets (Minds) LyricsApologies to future mes and yous
But I can't help feeling like we're through
The ripping of the tape hurts my ears
In my years, I have never seen anyone quit quite like you do
Twin bruises on my shins
From where I kicked the back of the seat in
They meant what I went through for you
But now they're fading, now they're gone
These teenage hands will never touch yours again
But I remember you
You had a body
You had hands and arms and legs and et cetera
Stuck in a body, stuck in a mind
Stuck in one body, stuck in one mind
For the rest of your life
This is the rest of your life
Why did God throw you down upon my head
(Wouldn't it be nice if we could go inside there?)
Making shock yellow light emit from my nostrils
(Wouldn't it be nice if we could stay inside there?)
And smoke pour from my ears and my hair stand up on end
(Wouldn't it be nice if we could kiss each other?)
I was fried alive and now I'm target for next time
(Wouldn't it be nice if we could fuck each other?)
Leviathan was powerful and inevitable
(Leviathan was powerful and inevitable)
I fell in love with my fate as it crushed me to death
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back, we gotta go back
We gotta go back
Nacham!
Nacham!
Don't get too impressed
You might lose your breath
Don't predict your death
'Cause I like you the best
Don't you fall apart
You might lose my heart
You know I love your art
For three transgressions of Wurtz
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
For three transgressions of Will
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
For three transgressions of Wurtz
(The ocean washed over your grave)
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
(The ocean washed open your grave)
For three transgressions of Will
(The ocean washed over your grave)
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
(The ocean washed open your grave)
For three transgressions of Wurtz
(The ocean washed over your grave)
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
(The ocean washed open your grave)
For three transgressions of Will
(The ocean washed over your grave)
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
(The ocean washed open your grave)
For three transgressions of Wurtz
(The ocean washed over your grave)
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
(The ocean washed open your grave)
For sending me an invitation
For selling yourself pardons
For three transgressions of Will
(The ocean washed over your grave)
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
(The ocean washed open your grave)
For falling in love too hard
You'll never set foot in this town again
For three transgressions of Wurtz
(The ocean washed over your grave)
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
(The ocean washed open your grave)
Why did you tell me to come in the first place?
Why did you tell me to come in the first place?
Why did you tell me to come in the first place?
(The ocean washed over your grave)
Why did you tell me to come in the first place?
(The ocean washed open your grave)
Why did you tell me, why did you tell me, why did you?
Why did? Why did? Why, why did ya?

He said, "Go out and stand on the mountain
Before the Lord
For the Lord is about to pass by."
Now there was a great wind
So strong that it was splitting mountains
And breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord
But the Lord was not in the wind
And after the wind an earthquake
But the Lord was not in the earthquake;
And after the earthquake a fire
But the Lord was not in the fire;
And after the fire, a sound of sheer silence5Embed
