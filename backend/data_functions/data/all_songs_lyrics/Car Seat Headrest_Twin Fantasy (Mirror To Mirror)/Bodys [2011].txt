Bodys  Lyrics
That's not what I meant to say at all
I mean, I'm sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you
But that's not what I wanted to say at all
I mean, I'm sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you

"Is it the Chorus yet?"
"No, it's just the building of the verse
So when the chorus does come it'll be more rewarding."

I would speak to you in song
But you can't sing (as far as I'm aware)
Though everyone can sing (as you are well aware)
I keep so quiet it's hard to tell I'm alive
Everybody is swinging their hips
Everybody is giving the waitress tips
Everybody's dancing all of the dances
Everybody's dancing every dance now

Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them
I have enough trouble controlling my own limbs
Stealing alcohol from our parents and grandparents
There's no devil on one shoulder and angel on the other
They're just two normal people
(These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with)

But if you keep giving me your empty hands
Man, I am tempted to say
Let's piss up another rope, boys
This one has grown old and bitter
Well, so what? So what?
We're young
We're thin (most of us)
We're alive (most of us)

Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart at any second?
(We won't have a hard time, you can get what you want
You can see if you're right, you're gonna get what you want
You’re a tall glass of water, I haven't bothered you with ice
I haven't watched you watch, season 5 of The Wire)
I am terrified your body could fall apart at any second
(We can go to bed hungry, we can stay up all night
We can stay under the covers and play with flashlights
I care about the kids, I care about you
I might not sing it for me, but I'll sing it for you)
You got those are some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them
(I got news for you, this is how I feel
Let's keep up the experience, they're just messing with you
We can be two brothers, we can just act nice
There's something you'll keep me singing I can't understand)
We can get real horny and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet, won't be making no sounds
I'll try my best not touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my place
(We can get real messy and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet, won't be making no sounds
I'll try my best not to touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my)
Stop
And I know that I don't talk a lot
But I know that you don't care a lot
As long as we move our bodies around a lot
We'll forget that we forgot how to talk
When we dance
When we
When we dance
When we

Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart at any second?
(We won't have a hard time, you can get what you want
You can see if you're right, you're gonna get what you want
You’re a tall glass of water, I haven't bothered you with ice
I haven't watched you watch, season 5 of The Wire)
I am terrified your body could fall apart at any second
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them
(We can go to bed hungry, we can stay up all night
We can stay under the covers and play with flashlights
I care about the kids, I care about you
I might not sing it for me, but I'll sing it for you)
When we dance
When we dance
(I got news for you, this is how I feel
Let's keep up the experience, they're just messing with you
We can be two brothers, we can just act nice
There's something you'll keep me singing I can't understand)
When we dance
When we dance
(We can get real messy and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet, won't be making no sounds
I'll try my best not to touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my)9Embed
