The Golden Age Lyrics
I wish I lived in the Golden Age, givin' it up on the Broadway stage
Hang with the rats and smoke cigars
Have a break with Frank and count the stars
Dressed to the nines, with hair to match
Shiny jewels, casino cash
Tapping feet, wanna take the lead
A trip back in time is all I need!

Oh! Sing it out loud, gonna get back, honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me
Sing it out loud, on a trip back, honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

I’m on my way, gon' make it big, gon' make the songs for the chicks to dig
It’s really hot and a little bit sour, we’re getting your strength to maximum power
Flying away from reality, whatever-ever happened to gravity?
I see it clear, a shooting star!
I’m a really good singer la-di-da-da-da!

Sing it out loud, gonna get back, honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me
Sing it out loud, on a trip back, honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Yeah! Sing it out loud, gonna get back, honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me
Sing it out loud, on a trip back, honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Oh-yeah-yeah!

Oh, silver screen on a rainy day, Sally Bowles in a cabaret
Shaking sticks, oh what a show, rushing joy from tip to toe
Rambling down the boulevard, with a fire burning in a wooden heart
My mind is set, I walk the line
But I never really thought it would feel this fine! Yeah!

Sing it out loud, gonna get back, honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me
Sing it out loud, on a trip back, honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Sing it out loud, gonna get back, honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me
Sing it out loud, on a trip back, honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free
Yeah! Hey! Hey! Oh! Ooo! Ooo-ooo!
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo1Embed
