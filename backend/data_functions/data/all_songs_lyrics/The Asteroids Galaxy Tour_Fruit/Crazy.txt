Crazy Lyrics
Higher
Come take me higher
My sweetest joy
You're my love
You're my fall
Fire
I'm your admirer
Guess we're blinded by the writings on the wall

It's gonna get crazy
It's gonna get mad
It's gonna get hazy
Making me sad
It's gonna get crazy
It's gonna get mad
It's gonna get hazy
Ooh, so sad

Oh no
Can we have no no
Please help me disappear for good
For a while
Let go
If only I could let go
Of the echoes in my mind from this love crying
It's gonna get crazy
It's gonna get mad
It's gonna get hazy
Making me sad
It's gonna get crazy
It's gonna get mad
It's gonna get hazy
Ooh, so sad
Oh
Well-eh-ell
Yeah hey
Eeh eh

Longer
Not too much longer
Can i run your race-less mile
On my face
Thunder
My little wonder
We're more than closer to the end of our days

It is so crazy
Oh it's so mad
It's gonna get hazy
Making me sad
It's gonna get crazy
It's gonna get mad
It's gonna get hazy
Ooh, so sad
I run awayEmbed
