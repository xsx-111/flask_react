Lady Jesus Lyrics
Somebody joined
Somebody drowned
When lady jesus come to town
She made the call, she made it fall
In a crusade fire never seen before
Somebody joined
Somebody drowned
Who's gonna care for a blinded fool?
Who's gonna save this blinded fool?
Watch out everyone, here she comes
Claiming loud she's the chosen one
Who's gonna save this blinded fool?

This is it, a money pit
A sense of fear, a mother wit
Disguise
Spooky eyes
How come she don't take advice?

Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside

Walk the streets of my city hood
A silly sense of love and youth
What is left of an empty space
Is a silent scream for a better day
Walk the streets of my city hood
This is it, a money pit
A sense of fear, a mother wit
Disguise
Spooky eyes
How come she don't take advice

Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside, never getting inside, never getting inside, never getting inside
Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Never getting inside

Never, ever, gonna get inside
How does it feel, eating souls for money? Huh?Embed
