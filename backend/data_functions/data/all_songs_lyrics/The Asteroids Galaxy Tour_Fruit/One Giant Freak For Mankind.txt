One Giant Freak For Mankind LyricsToday or tonight, I know the truth
Tomorrow, like years, go blame my youth

That's my girl, that's my soul, I love you!
That's my girl, that's my soul, I love you!
Oh yeah!
Rain for two, my roof tonight
I'm on a ___, without a fight
Get of my drain, before to late
Lost my time, lost my mind, I love you!
Lost my time, lost my mind, I love you!
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm losing it
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm loving it
Give up the win , but don't give up
Under my ___, your over doubt
Killing me softly, what a joy
It's all right, got no pride, I love you!
It's all right, got no pride, I love you!
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm losing it
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm loving it
I'm living on a shoestring, I am searching for the real thing
I'm lost, in the city night, wondering what's on the other side
Side.....
I'm living on a shoestring, I am searching for the real thing
I'm lost, in the city night, wondering what's on the other side
Side.....
Other side...
Well she is one giant freak from mankind, like a mother nature's son
It's been around, round, round, round for a while
Come on
Come on
Other side...
