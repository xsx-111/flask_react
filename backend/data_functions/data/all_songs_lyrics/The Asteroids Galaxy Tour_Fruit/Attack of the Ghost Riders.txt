Attack of the Ghost Riders LyricsLipstick on my face
Thunder in the sky
The shades are drawn
Don't ask me why
But with the ghost riders on the go
I think you know
But with the ghost riders on the go
I think you know
It goes something like this
(Attack)
Crater in my brain
Where the strippers go insane
Cabin number 4
Ain't gonna smile no more
But with the ghost riders on the go
I think you know
But with the ghost riders on the go
I think you know
It goes something like this
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack, of the ghost riders
Attack
You know it goesEmbed
