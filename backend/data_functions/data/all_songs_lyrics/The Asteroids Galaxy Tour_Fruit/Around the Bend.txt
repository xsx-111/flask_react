Around the Bend Lyrics
Muck around, waste another mile now
Muck around, waste another mile now
You feel the need, there is no way to return
You feel the need, oh yeah it burns
What a ride, hot love on a platter
Yeah, yeah

Give me that thing
Give it my friend
Give me good, good times around the bend
I'll stay forever
Give me that thing
Give it my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you

Lay down on daddy's lawn
Lay me down, smell the break of dawn
You feel the heat, there is no way to return
You feel the heat, oh yeah it burns
Pick a fruit, let me be your apple
Yeah, oh yeah!
Give me that thing
Give it my friend
Give me good, good times around the bend
I'll stay forever
Give me that thing
Give it my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you
Give me that thing
Give it my friend
Give me good, good times around the bend
I'll stay forever
Give me that thing
Give it my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you

Give me love
Give it my friend
'Round the bend
Hot, hot love
Give me that thing give it my friendEmbed
