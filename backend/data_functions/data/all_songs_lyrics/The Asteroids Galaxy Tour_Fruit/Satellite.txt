Satellite Lyrics
Free wheeling on a dead end road
I dream of you in my veins
Excluding is a choice of dope
Let go
I wanna disappear
Don't mind the dark, I can't pass out
The moonlight shines on my pale face
Desire in a silent shout
Hey you
It's time you re-appear

Think I need somebody
A real somebody now
Gonna need somebody
Are you somebody
Think I need somebody
A real somebody now
Gonna need somebody
Are you somebody

I know you,yeah,you're just my kind
Your flow underneath my skin
With you I wanna waste some time
Think twice
Tonight I'm on my own
Think I need somebody
A real somebody now
Gonna need somebody
Are you somebody
Think I need somebody
A real somebody now
Gonna need somebody
Are you somebody

I'm waiting for the sun to rise
Shine through that cloud of mine
Yeah I'm waiting for the sun to rise
Shine through that cloud of mine
C'mon c'mon
I'm waiting for the sun to rise (yeah)
Shine through that cloud of mine
Yeah I'm waiting for the sun to rise
Shine through that cloud of mine
C'mon c'mon
Let's blow the rain away

Think I need somebody
A real somebody now
Gonna need somebody
(C'mon c'mon)
Are you somebody
Think I need somebody
A real somebody now
Gonna need somebody
(C'mon c'mon)
Are you somebody
Are you somebody
(C'mon, c'mon)
Are you somebody
Are you somebody
C'mon c'mon
Let's blow the rain awayEmbed
