Inner City Blues LyricsRockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it
Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
No, this ain't livin'
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Oh, Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Oh, Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Oh, this ain't livin' this ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no, no, no
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes
No! Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Oh, it makes me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, this ain't livin' this ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin', this ain't livin'
Oh, No
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God know where we're heading
No! Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Oh, it makes me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, this ain't livin' this ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin', this ain't livin', this ain't livin
Oh, no
This ain't livin', no, no, no, no, no
Yeah!Embed
