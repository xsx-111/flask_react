Bad Fever Lyrics
Oh I got to, yeah I got to
Call out your name and it use to
Make me feel good, yeah, real good
My body is out for a rebound
I want to, I really want to
Be doing the things that we ought to

You know what to give
Give me all you got before I'm gonna get a bad fever
Gonna get a bad fever

Here comes the red van
It's my gun man
A part of my heart with a beer can
It's no scam, much better than
Those fatty creeps with a bad tan
I got shivers, he's my Peter Pan
I'm Tinkerbell going to Neverland

You know what to give
Give me all you got before I'm gonna get a bad fever
Gonna get a bad fever (oh)
You know I'm gonna get a bad fever
Gonna get a bad fever (oh)
Come on over, I’ll make you understand
You could be my cover
You could be my man

I got to, yeah I got to
Call out your name and it use to
Make me feel good, yeah, real good
My body is out for a rebound
I want to, I really want to
Be doing the things that we ought to

You know what to give
Give me all you got before I'm gonna get a bad fever
Gonna get a bad fever (oh yeah)
You know I'm gonna get a bad fever
Gonna get a bad fever (oh)

Come on over
I’ll make you understand
You could be my cover
You could be my man
Don’t you ever feel that we're spinning the wheel?
Don’t you ever see I'm head over heels?
Don’t you ever wonder how it would feel to give me all you got?
Don’t you ever feel like that we're spinning the wheel?
Don’t you ever see I'm head over heels?
Don’t you ever wonder how it would feel
To give me all you got before I'm gonna get a bad fever

You know I'm gonna get a bad fever
You know I'm gonna get a bad fever
I'm gonna get a bad fever (yeah)
Bad fever
You gonna get me bad feverEmbed
