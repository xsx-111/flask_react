Perfect Heaven Space LyricsIn my perfect heaven space there's a picture of you
To think of all the time I've wasted not looking at you
Answering the questions before it's been asked
The answers is in the question I hope you don't ask
In my perfect heaven space there's an answer for you
And on my heart I wear a sleeve that you knitted for me
And you just wanna pull that thread and unravel me
Answering the question before it's been asked
The answers in the question I hope you don't ask
On my heart I wear a sleeve that you knitted for me
(piano solo chorus)
In my perfect heaven space there's a memory of you
To think of all the ghosts I've faced just remembering you
Answering the question before it's been asked
The answers in the question I hope you don't ask
In my perfect heaven space there's an answer for you
