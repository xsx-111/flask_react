Sailing Away LyricsWhat are we gonna do
When you've stopped crying?
What ever you're going through
It's not worth dying
Chasing away the blues
I know you're trying
And nobody wants to lose
I don't know why
Cause I live by the river
Live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away, today
What are you gonna say
When they stop laughing?
You're giving it all away
When you've got nothing
How many times a day
You feel like walking?
Taking a holiday from
All the shy-y-y...
But I live by the river
Live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away, today
Cause I live by the river
Live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away, today
And you've got to grab
The bull by the horns my friend
It's the only way to go
And when the story's told
We can go home
So what are we gonna do
When you've stopped crying?
What ever you're going through
It's not worth dying
Keeping away the blues
You know I'm trying
What've we got to lose
And testify-y-y...
Cause I live by the river
Live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away
I'm sailing, away
I'm sailing, away, todayEmbed
