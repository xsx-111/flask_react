Eyes Wide Open Lyrics
All these visions in my head
Should have gone to bed before the watershed
Some are alive some are dead
Makes no difference when they're in your head
Keep the door open a crack
So I can see them when they attack
Some are white
Some are black
Makes no difference when they're on your back

And I can't stop crying
And I can't stop driving
'Cause the day is dying, dying, dying
And my eyes wide open

Count the sheep jumping the fence
So I can see tee pees when I'm feeling tents
Disbelief hung in suspense
Eiderdown is my own defense

And I can't stop crying
And I can't stop driving
'Cause the day is dying, dying, dying
And my eyes wide open
All these visions in my head
Should have gone to bed before the watershed
Some are alive
Some are dead
Makes no difference when they're in your head

And I can't stop crying
And I can't stop driving
'Cause the day is dying, dying, dying
And my eyes wide openEmbed
