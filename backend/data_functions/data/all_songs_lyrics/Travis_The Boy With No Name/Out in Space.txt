Out in Space LyricsOh my friend
We have spent
So much time looking for someone to blame
'Cause we're the same
And jealous games
Take up time we could spend on other things
Oh my friend
If it ends
Let us go and then not look back again
We can't be
You and me
Taking ourselves much too seriously
But out in space
A million miners work upon the night's coal face
And all I see is black
And all the stars look back at me
Oh my friend
What a friend
I'd have thought you'd have stayed here till the end
To take a bow
Draw the crowd
We're just words in the sand at high tide
But out in space
A million miners work upon the nights coal face
And all I see is black
And all the stars look back at me
Oh my friend
We should spend
Some more time looking from the other end
'Cause we would see
So clearly
We blame ourselves as much as we blame we
We blame ourselves as much as we blame we
We blame ourselvesEmbed
