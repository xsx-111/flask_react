Under the Moonlight LyricsCan you see the moonbeam
And the colour of the lights
They're like flowers blooming in motion
Watching them fade
The last fireworks of the night
I begin to wake
To relive this memory
When the answer is clear and beyond belief
There's a gift of love
That awaits the final day
But tonight
Tonight
Under the moonlight with the one you love
Under the big sky for the one you love
Riding under the moonlight with the one you love
Going places together tonight
In the far distance
As the dream nears the end
And summer lovers pass the time
Holding on to what they can't keep
Into the horizon
Where the ocean meets the sky
So gather up your voice
'Cause tonight's the night
Tonight
Under the moonlight with the one you love
Under the big sky for the one you love
Riding under the moonlight with the one you love
Going places together tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Stars light up the coastline
And we'll feel this way
For today
And for all time
Under the moonlight with the one you love
Under the big sky for the one you love
Riding under the moonlight with the one you love
Under the moonlight
Oh we're going places together tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Under the moonlightEmbed
