Closer Lyrics
I've had enough of this parade
I'm thinking of the words to say
We open up unfinished parts
Broken up, it's so mellow

And when I see you then I know it will be next to me
And when I need you then I know you will be there with me
I'll never leave you

Just need to get closer, closer
Lean on me now, lean on me now
Closer, closer
Lean on me now, lean on me now

Keep waking up (Waking up), without you here (Without you here)
Another day (Another day), another year (Another year)
I seek the truth (Seek the truth), we set apart (We set apart)
Second dance, second chance (Second chance)

And when I see you then I know it will be next to me
And when I need you then I know you will be there with me
I'll never leave you
Just need to get closer, closer
Lean on me now, lean on me now
Closer, closer
Lean on me now, lean on me now, lean on me now

And when I see you then I know it will be next to me
And when I need you then I know you will be there with me
I'll never leave you

Just need to get closer, closer
Lean on me now, lean on me now
Closer, closer
Lean on me now, lean on me now, lean on me now

Closer, closer
Closer, closerEmbed
