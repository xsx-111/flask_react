Battleships LyricsWhen will you carry me home
Like the wounded star in the movie
When will you carry me home
Take it back to the start when you knew me
'Cause when you talk to me that way
I'll be a million miles away
I guess it's just another day
In love
We're battleships
Drifting in our wee river
Taking hits
Sinking, it's now or never
Overboard
Drowning in a sea of love and hate
But it's too late
Battleship down
When will you figure it out
That you're not always right little darling
When will you figure it out
That it's not worth the fight little darling
'Cause when you can't think what to say
You go and throw it all away
I guess it's just another day
In love
We're battleships
Drifting in our wee river
Taking hits
Sinking, it's now or never
Overboard
Drowning in a sea of love and hate
But it's too late
Battleship down
But you're too smart
And I'm too dumb
With no heart in the middle
We're battleships
Drifting in our wee river
Taking hits
Sinking, it's now or never
Overboard
Falling into the ocean
Ship to shore
Drowning in a sea of love and hate
But it's too late
Battleship downEmbed
