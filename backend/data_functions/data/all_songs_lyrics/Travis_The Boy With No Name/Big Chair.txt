Big Chair LyricsWell you know that I heart everything about you
And that's why it's quite hard to get through this alone
You're the only one I can talk to about it
In the darkest night I will be on my own
These walls that we climb are hard to recognise
They fall when I say your name
Here we go fast and slow on the big chair
We don't know where we're going on the big chair
Don't you know it's hard, quite, in a time of confusion
To tell you that I love you
You see it could have been me instead of you
It could have been me if I wanted to
But it wasn't, so we'll have to face the truth
These walls that we climb are hard to recognise
They fall when I say your name
Here we go fast and slow on the big chair
We don't know where we're going on the big chair
Time to pull the shutters down
Breaking clouds don't make a sound
When they cry
Here we go fast and slow on the big chair
We don't know where we're going on the big chair
Here we go fast and slow on the big chair
We don't know where we're going on the big chair
Big chair, big chair, big chair
Big chair, big chair, big chair1Embed
