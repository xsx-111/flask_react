Colder LyricsI'm in love with everything
With every face I've ever seen
And every place I've ever been
Has left it's mark upon my worries
I colour in the world I see
I pick apart the melody
'Cause maybe there's a symphony
Caught inside but there's no way out
And the sky is falling down and there's an angel on the ground it's getting colder
I'm standing looking down there's not a sound around the town it's getting colder
Colder
I would show you everything
But everything is too extreme
We'll wait and see the entropy
At the end when we all start flying
But the sky is falling down and there's an angel on the ground it's getting colder
I'm standing looking down there's not a sound around the town it's getting colder
The sky is falling down and there's an angel on the ground it's getting colder
I'm standing looking down there's not a sound around the town it's getting colder
The sky is falling down and all the people on the ground are getting colder
I'm standing looking down again but you can't help me now I'm getting colderEmbed
