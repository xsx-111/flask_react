New Amsterdam LyricsJean Michel Basquiat, Fran√ßois Truffaut
Robert Zimmerman, and De Niro
Paris Texas
End of the world
New York, New York
Goodbye girl
And they meet on Bleeker Street
Or the park that is central, oh
I watch the sun go down
Down down beneath the ground
And it's a new day
It's a new dawn
In New Amsterdam
The stranger in the moonlight
Looks stranger in the moonlight
And they meet on Bleeker Street
Or the park that is central, oh
I watch the sun go down
Down down beneath the ground
And it's a new day
It's a new dawn
In New Amsterdam
And we meet on Bleeker Street
Or the park that is central, oh
I watch the sun go down
Down down beneath the ground
And it's a new day
It's a new dawn
In New AmsterdamEmbed
