One Night LyricsI wake up to find you lying awake with your hands in your head
You cannot run can't escape from the things that you said
And you can tell anybody
Anybody who comes
You can tell anybody
But the damage is done
The new day's begun
One night
Can change everything in your life
One night
Can make everything alright
One night
Can turn all your colours to white
One night
It's easier said than done
Turning and turning but never returning to what you once had
Learning to care for the ones you hold dear but it's too... it's too bad
One night
Can change everything in your life
One night
Can make everything alright
One night
Can turn all your colours to white
One night
It's easier said than done
All that I am
All that I am
All that I am
Lying beside you as cold as a statue your hands are still warm
Trying to wake you as daylight it breaks through the eye of the storm
So you can tell everybody
Everybody who comes
You can tell everybody
But the damage is done
The new day's begun
One night
Can change everything in your life
One night
Can make everything alright
One night
Can turn all your colours to white
One night
It's easier said than done
One night
One night
One night
One night
It's easier said than doneEmbed
