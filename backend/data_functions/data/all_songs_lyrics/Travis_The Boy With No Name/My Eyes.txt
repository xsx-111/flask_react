My Eyes LyricsDeep in my heart
There's no room for crying
But I'm trying to see your point of view
Deep in my heart
I'm afraid I'm dying
I'd be lying if I said I'm not
Welcome in, welcome in
Shame about the weather
Welcome in, welcome in
You're welcome
It's a sin it's a sin
Where birds of a feather
Are welcome to land on you
Ya ya yay
Ya ya yay
You got my eyes
We can't see what you'll be
You can't disguise
Either way
I will pray
You will be wise
Pretty soon you will see
Tears in my eyes
As each day goes by
Makes way for another
We discover that we're not alone
And each day we try
The best we can to recover
All the feelings that we left below
Welcome in, welcome in
Shame about the weather
Welcome in, welcome in
You're welcome
It's a sin it's a sin
Where birds of a feather
Are welcome to land on you
Ya ya yay
Ya ya yay
You got my eyes
And we can't see what you'll be
You can't disguise
But either way
I will pray
You will be wise
Pretty soon you will see
Tears in my eyes
Welcome in, welcome in
Shame about the weather
Welcome in, welcome in
You're welcome
It's a sin it's a sin
Where birds of a feather
Are welcome to land on you...
Ya ya yay
Ya ya yay
You got my eyes
We can't see what you'll be
You can't disguise
But either way
I will pray
You will be wise
Pretty soon you will see
Tears in my eyes
Pretty soon you will see
Tears in my eyes
Oh pretty soon you will see
Tears in my eyesEmbed
