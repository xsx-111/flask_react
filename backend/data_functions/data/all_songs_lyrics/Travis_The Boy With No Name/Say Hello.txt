Say Hello LyricsJust a little prayer
Living in my mouth
Wish you were here
Could be somehow
This game is lost
You're feeling low
Not strong enough
To let it go
Say hello
Say hello
Say hello
Into this heart
I put my blood
Each little part
Beats like a drum in perfect time
You never try
You never would (work it out)
Let go inside
You never could
To just say hello
Say hello
Say hello
Say hello
Say hello
Say hello
This Selfish Jean
Has taken home
It is locked within
But you'll never know
To Say hello
Say hello
Say hello
Say hello
Say helloEmbed
