3 Times and You Lose LyricsI had a nightmare I lived in a little town
Where little dreams were broken
And words were seldom spoken
I tried to reach you but all the lines were down
And so the rain began to fall on this little town
On this little town
The little people had very little left to say
Their words had all been shortened
It didn't really seem important
And I had a feeling that you were very far away
But then a little voice inside me said
"You'll never get away from here"
And it's 1-2-3 times and you lose
Of course it doesn't matter how you say it
I'm all out of luck
So there's nothing really more to say
I'm throwing it all away
Well we had opinions but now we all think the same
We never look at one another
Only when the other suffers
And I thought I saw you
But it was just another face
Plastered on a blank horizon
Running in the human race
And it's 1-2-3 times and you lose
Of course it doesn't matter how you say it
I'm all out of luck
So there's nothing really more to say
I'm throwing it all away
And it's 1-2-3 times and you lose
I'm all out of luck
So there's nothing really more to say
I'm throwing it all away
I'm throwing it all away
I'm throwing it all awayEmbed
