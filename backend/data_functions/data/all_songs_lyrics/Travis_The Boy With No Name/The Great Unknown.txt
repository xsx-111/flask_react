The Great Unknown LyricsI'm standing at the firing line
Too scared to jump to leave behind
The lights go down and there's nowhere left to hide
Into the great unknown!
You take my hand
But I'm too scared to jump
But I'm not ready yet
The green and the red and the yellow in my head
Into the great unknown!
Where do we go when all is said and done
Where do we go?
And I said, I said it's all been said and done
But who knows?
Who?
I've payed my songs for love for it
And dirty beast of parliament
And every one is a message never sent
Into the great unknown
Who?
Who who who?
Who?Embed
