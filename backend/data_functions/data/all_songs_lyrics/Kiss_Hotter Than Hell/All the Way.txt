All the Way Lyrics
One, two, three, four

You've got a lot to say
Every night and every sunny day
It's the same thing you've been sayin' to me
Every day
You say it's within your heart
You keep repeating that we'll never part
I'm so finally glad to hear you stop
For a day

You just keep talking louder
Complain to your mother and father
One of these days, you'll push me all the way

You're wearing clothes that fit you well
Baby baby, you're not hard to sell
I'll tell you what you wanna hear
For a day
So if you think you need advice
Just come to me, don't compromise
Baby baby, you're hypnotized
Every day
And you just keep talking louder
Complain to your mother and father
One of these days, you'll push me all the way

Yes, you just keep talking louder
Complain to your mother and father
One of these days, you'll push me all the way
Yes, you just keep talking louder
Complain to your mother and father
One of these days, you'll push me all the way
You just keep talking louder
Complain to your mother and father
One of these days, you'll push me all the way
You just keep talking louder
Complain to your mother and father
One of these days, you'll push me all the wayEmbed
