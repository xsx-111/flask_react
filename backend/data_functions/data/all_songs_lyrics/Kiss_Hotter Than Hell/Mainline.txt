Mainline Lyrics
You know that it's easy, so come on and please me
I want you
I'm needin' some lovin', I'm hot like an oven
It's so true

You know what I want you to do
So baby, won't you let me on through, yeah

Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time
Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time

I know you could use me, so please don't refuse me
Oh, love me
You've got to start givin' and baby stop livin'
Above me

You know what I want you to do
So baby, won't you let me on through, whoa yeah
Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time
Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time

Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time
Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time

You know that it's easy, so come on and please me
I want you
I'm needin' some lovin', I'm hot like an oven
It's so true

You know what I want you to do
So baby, won't you let me on through, yeah

Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time
Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one time
Mainline
Baby, won't you give it to me one timeEmbed
