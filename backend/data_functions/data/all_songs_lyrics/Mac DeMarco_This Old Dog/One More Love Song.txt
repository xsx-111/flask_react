One More Love Song Lyrics
Another turn, another shift
One last kiss from her lips
Another dream you're putting down
After all this time, it turns out all you found

Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

Another try, another go
Never thought you'd feel this low
Another dream put to bed
After all this time, it turns all you had

Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart
One more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart16Embed
