On the Level Lyrics
Boy, this could be your year
Make an old man proud of you, forget about the tears
On the level, see me eye-to-eye
Stand up like a man even from the other side

On the level
On the level

Man, I never had a choice
Never had a chance, never had a voice
On the level, carrying a name
Fall until my final day, now, who's there left to blame?

On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level6Embed
