Dreams from Yesterday Lyrics
Once your dreams
Come knocking at your door
It's time to realize
You aren't dreaming anymore
And once your life, is set to settle down
Take a look around you
No more dreaming to be found

So why, then, are you crying?
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday

Once a life believes it's got it set up
A closer look reveals
Just how empty you can feel
Once a dream
Is finally put to bed
Rest up, sleepyhead
You might as well be dead

So why, then, are you crying?
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday9Embed
