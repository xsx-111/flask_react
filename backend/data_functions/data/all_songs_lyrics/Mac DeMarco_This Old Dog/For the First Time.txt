For the First Time Lyrics
While she's been away
Living day-to-day has been tough
Without her at my side
Simply being alive has been rough

And though she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not trying to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

The time she's not around
Somewhere out of town, has been hard
But somehow this old heart found time to work it out this far

No, I know she's coming home soon
There are times I find it hard to feel that way
It's not inside me to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again13Embed
