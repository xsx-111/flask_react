Moonlight on the River Lyrics
I'd say, see you later, if I thought I'd see you later
And I'd tell you, that I loved you, if I did
It's so strange, deciding, how to feel about it
It's such strange emotion standing there beside it

I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
Home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies

I'd say, see you next time, if I thought there were a next time
Easy conversation, ain't exactly where we're at
It's so strange, deciding, how I feel about you
It ain't like I ain't used to going on without you

I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
