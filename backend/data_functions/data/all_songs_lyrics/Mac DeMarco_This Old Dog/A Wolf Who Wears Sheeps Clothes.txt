A Wolf Who Wears Sheeps Clothes Lyrics
Just trying to keep it light sometimes casts a shadow
Trouble is keeping quiet and you know well where your heart goes
Troubles with meeting anybody, these days are bringing you down
All predisposed to believe in, in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
Yeah

Don't let the world outside the windowpane get to your head
Hopefully make some sense of all this shit before you're dead
The troubles with meeting anybody, follow wherever you go
All predisposed to believe in, in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
