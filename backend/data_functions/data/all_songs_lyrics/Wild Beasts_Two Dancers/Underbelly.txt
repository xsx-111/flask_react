Underbelly LyricsHow the prayer rubs the rosary
How the make up make her face pretty
Oh how we have an underbelly
Bitten by brutality
How thereâ€™s guts fried up
How Lothario leers at slut
Oh how we have an underbelly
Bitten by brutality
And how in our first and last years
We are the most needy, least greedy, most grateful, least hateful
How die as deeply doe-eyed as we start, wooEmbed
