Two Dancers (ii) LyricsO, do you want my heart between your teeth?
Your hands are curling up like floating leaves
You who shall deserve
You who shall deserve
O, unpluckable flower of the moon!
O, untetherable bird of the blue!
You who shall deserve
You who shall deserve
Deserters!
Deserters!
Deserters!
Deserters!
The neighbours cup their ears to the walls
Two hearts
