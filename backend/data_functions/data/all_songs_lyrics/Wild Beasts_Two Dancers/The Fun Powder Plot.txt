The Fun Powder Plot Lyrics
When we turn up in our turn ups
Our hearts are heavy, our heads are ready to levy
For the yippee-less swing, for the tot-less cot
For the mock, for the shock, for the fun powder plot

With courage and conviction, In donkey-jaw diction
We cry for the cause, We cry for the cause
With courage and conviction, In donkey-jaw diction
We cry for the cause, We cry for the cause
Because the courts have left us lonely;
Disowned us daddies like the poopers of the party
Gently, gently take them from me
Gently, gently take them from me
Gently, gently take them from me
And I'll be left dumbfound as a donkey

This is a booty call
My boot my boot my boot my boot up your arse hole
This is a Freudian slip
My slipper my slipper my slipper my slipper in your bits

With courage and conviction, In donkey-jaw diction
We cry for the cause, We cry for the cause
With courage and conviction, In donkey-jaw diction
We cry for the cause, We cry for the cause
Because the courts have left us lonely;
Disowned us daddies like the poopers of the party
Gently, gently take them from me
Gently, gently take them from me
Gently, gently take them from me
And I'll be left dumbfound as a donkey
This is a booty call
My boot my boot my boot my boot up your arse hole
This is a Freudian slip
My slipper my slipper my slipper my slipper in your bits6Embed
