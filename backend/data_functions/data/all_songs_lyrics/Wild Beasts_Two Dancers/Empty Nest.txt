Empty Nest LyricsDid I judge this wrong?
But you had it all
You had it all
A gift of the gods
In your city of gold
And you'll piss it all
You had it all
And what drags the rope
You know, or, you don't
You had it all
Gone gone gone gone
Going going gone
The day you moved off
The whole village mourned
Love's no kind of joke
Or something small
And where will you go?
There's things you don't know
Fingers tearing your clothes
Baby ungrown
You had it all
Gone gone gone gone
Going going gone
And suffering alone
Your bowl emptied out
All your secrets known
I welcome your call
These walls don't fallEmbed
