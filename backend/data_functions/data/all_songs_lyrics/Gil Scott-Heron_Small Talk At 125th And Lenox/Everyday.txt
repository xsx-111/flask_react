Everyday LyricsEveryday, and hum, well just listen to it, hope you enjoy
Mmmmm
I can't seem to find
the words to say (to say)
I don't have strength to play the games
you need to play (to play)
Every day I seem to be running from the truth
I ask myself questions but it just ain't no use
Cause it seems no matter, no matter, what I try to do
I'm still loving and living, lying and losing
Every day (yeah, every day)
I've got a job
And to say the least
It don't mean a thing (it don't mean a thing)
It don't begin to compare
With the hurt and pain that I've seen (I've seen)
Sometimes I know I can't tell wrong from right (wrong from right)
I don't seem to know day from night
It's no small wonder that the whole world uptight
They're just loving and living, lying and losing
Every day (yeah, every day)
Stop on the way home from work to have a drink
Just to give myself a little time to think
Cause it seems that more and more I start to realize
That the truth that I wanted
The love that I needed
Has somehow disappeared before my eyes
I can't seem to find the words I need to say (to say)
I can't find strength enough to play the games you need, you need to play (to play)
Cause every day you got me, got me running from the truth
And no matter, no matter what I try to do
It seems that somehow it just ain't no use
I'm still loving and living, lying and losing
Can't seem to remember
God it's so confusing
I'm still loving and living, lying and losing
Every day (yeah, every day, every day)
Every day
