Paint It Black LyricsPicture a man of nearly thirty
Who seems twice as old, with clothes, torn and dirty
Give him a job, shining shoes
Or cleaning out toilets with bus station crews
Give him six children with nothing to eat
Expose them to life, on a ghetto street
Tie an old rag to his wife's head
And have her pregnant and lying in bed
Stuff them all in a Harlem house
And then tell them how bout things are down South1Embed
