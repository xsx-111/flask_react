Jilltro LyricsY'll ready to settle down and, and get with this?
You know settle into this feeling?
'Cause you know it's a lot of love here
Love, love, love
Give her love y'll, give her love Jill Scott
Love, love, love, love
I got to write about it
What's up everybody?
I'd glad to see you all here tonight
It's nice to get this love
I need it
Love
I love to write poetry, I love to sing
I love to write poetry, I love to read my poetry
But basically what I live for is, uhm?
(Love, love)
(Inspiration)
It comes from listening to Hip-Hop
(Inspiration)
It comes from R&B
(Inspiration)
It comes from listening to Jazz
(Inspiration)
It comes from Jill, you hear me?
(Love)
Give her love ya'll, give her love Jill Scott
Give her love ya'll, give her love Jill Scott
