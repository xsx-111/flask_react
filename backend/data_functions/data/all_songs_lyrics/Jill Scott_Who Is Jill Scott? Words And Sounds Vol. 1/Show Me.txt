Show Me Lyrics
If I asked you to trust me on all things
Could you do it?
If I needed you to map your position
Would you try it?
Your constantly talking about how much you
Love me, want me, need me
You told me stop talking
No more conversation
Necessary

Show me (x14)

If I needed you to replenish my faith in brothers
Could you do it?
If I needed you to be cool with my strength
Could you do it?
Your constantly talking about how much you
Love me, want me, need me
You told me stop talking
No more conversation
Necessary

Show me (x14)
Your word is love but you push me away
And won't say why
You show me your exterior, I need
To see your interior, I need
To be absolutely clear wit cha
If we are to ever stand a chance
It's the last dance don't you see
Show me the warrior you're gonna be

Warrior keep fightin, I know you're there
Keep fightin, warrior I know you're there
(repeat to end)Embed
