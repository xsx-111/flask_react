Watching Me Lyrics
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Ah
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Ah
(Yawn)

First thing when I wake up
And right before I close my eyes at night
I think
Sense
Feel, man like
I'm under some kind of microscope
Satellites over my head
Transmitters in my dollars
Hawking, watching, scoping, jocking
Scrutinizing me
Checking to see what I'm doing
Where I be
Who I see
How and where and with whom I make my money
What is this??
"Excuse me, miss
May I have your phone number and your social security?"
Who me?
When all I came to do is buy my double or triple A batteries
Please
I decline
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Ah
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Ah

Look here at this watch of mine
Gotta open it up
Don't know who's been in it
Tracking where I go
Finding out all my bi'ness
Se-cur-i-ty
Video cameras locked on me
In every dressing room
On every floor
In every store
Damn can I get that democracy
And Equality
And privacy
You busy watching me, watching me
That your blind, baby
You neglect to see
The drugs coming into my community
Weapons coming into my community
Dirty cops in my community
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
Busy watching me
Ah
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Ah
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me
Watching me

I ain't got no bars to this cage
If I'm gonna stay here
I'm gonna build me a lead house
Keep them satellites out
Direct-TV
Am I watchin' it or is it watchin' me?
Man I don't really know
But I feel like
I feel like I'm being scoped, y'all
Watched, y'all
Something ain't right
Something ain't right
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
Ah
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
And you keep saying that I'm free
AhEmbed
