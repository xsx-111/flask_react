Slowly Surely Lyrics
Slowly, surely I walk away from
That old desperate and tainted love
Caught up in the maze of love
The crazy craze of love
Thought it was good
Thought it was real
Thought it was
But it wasn't love

I just don't know where I should go
So slowly, surely I walk away
From self-serving, undeserving
Constantly hurting me love
Deserting me love
You said
I said
We said, but

Slowly, surely I walk away from
Confusing love, misusing love, abusing love
This can't be
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Self-serving, undeserving
Constantly hurting me love
I just don't know where I should go, no
I just don't know, know, know, know where I should go
So slowly, surely I walk away from
That old desperate and dazed love
Caught up in the maze of love
The crazy craze of love
Thought it was good
Thought it was real
Thought it was
But it wasn't love

I just don't know where to go
So, slowly, surely I walk away from
I walk away from
Slowly, surely I walk away from love
Slowly, surely one step at a time, but surely
I will pass the old love aside and love me
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Slowly, surely I walk away from desperate love
Caught up in the maze love
Crazy crazy crazy craze of love
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Slowly, surely I walk away from
Slowly, surely, slowly, surelyEmbed
