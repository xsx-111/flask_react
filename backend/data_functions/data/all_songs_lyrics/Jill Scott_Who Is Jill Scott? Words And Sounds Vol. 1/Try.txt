Try Lyrics
If you want it to happen baybay
Hold fast and believe
You can make it happen baybay
You can be where u pleaze
All you gotta do is try
Then try once again
Then try a few more times
Then try after then
When I was a little girl
Raised on N. Philly streets
I'd hear my people say
Ghetto'z all they'd be
But my mommy would hold me
Quietly give me peace
She'd look me in my eyes and she'd say to me
Chorus
As a teenager I dreamed to see the world
But how could I do this me a poor black girl
And just when my will was lost
And all hope seemed set free
I'd remember my mama's face and her tellin' me
Chorus
Try try try
Try try try
Try try try
Try and try again (repeat)
Now as a grown woman I still stumble and fall
But wit a lot of faith and the same amount of effort
I can withstand it all
I dun see some thangs now and been a few places
I'm now enjoyin' the beautiful world and the many new faces
I say
Chorus
If you want it to happen baybay 6xEmbed
