Love Rain (Head Nod Mix) Lyrics
There was this daddy long-leg spider who spun his lyrics between the trees
And she was the fly girl who didn't see the web, and this is the story, ha
Love

Down(Love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I said, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I said, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I say, "What'cha see?")
(Brand new, alive, from Jill Scott, makin' the ghetto feel hot)
(I say, "What'cha see?")
(A-let 'em know)  
Met him on a Thursday (Uh huh, uh huh), sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees
He was brown(Uh huh, uh huh)
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives
Word! (Uh huh, uh huh)
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
Talked about Moses and Mumia (Uh huh, uh huh)
Reparations through colors, memories of shell-tops
Oh, yeah, yeah, he was fresh, like summer peaches
Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy (—for the churro, two for the—)
(Uh huh, uh huh)
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
I felt dizzy and so near heaven
Love

(A-rain down)
(I said, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I say, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I say, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I say, "What'cha see?")
(Hah-hah)  
The rain was fallin'
Slowly and sweetly
And stinging my eyes
And I could not see that (Uh huh, uh huh)
He became my voodoo priest
And I, his faithful concubine (Uh huh, uh huh)
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips (Uh huh, uh huh)
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became brand new (New Jill Scott, everybody, c'mon!)
Now me non-clarivoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off its axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
(Repeat 1 in background)
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees, melody
Love
Rain
Down
Love
Rain
Down
Love
Rain
Down
Love
Rain
Down(Love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I said, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I say, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(A-rain down)
(I say, "What'cha see?")
(I see love)
(A-love rain)
(I said it's comin', said it's goin', said it's comin', said it's comin'
Said it's—)  
I stretched my arms towards the sky like blades of tall grass
The sun beat between my shoulders like carnival drums
I sat still in hopes that it would help my wings grow
So then I could really be fly
And then she arrived
Like day break inside a railway tunnel
Like the new moon, like a diamond in the mines
Like high noon to a drunkard, sudden
She made my heart beat in a now-now time signature
Her skin, a canvas for ultraviolet brushstrokes
She was the sun's painting
She was a deep cognac color
Her eyes sparkled like lights along the new city
Her lips pursed as if her breath was too sweet
And full for her mouth to hold
I said, "You are the beautiful distress of mathematics."
I said, "For you, I would peel open the clouds like new fruit
And give you lightning and thunder as a dowry
I would make the sky shed all of its stars like rain
And I would clasp the constellations across your waist
And I would make the heavens your cape
And they would be pleased to cover you
They would be pleased to cover you
May I please, cover you, please"
