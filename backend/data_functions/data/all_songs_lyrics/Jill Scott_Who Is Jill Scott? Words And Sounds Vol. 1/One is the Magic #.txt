One is the Magic # Lyrics
No hay nadie mas que yo, uno es el numero magico
En vida y en muerte, uno es todo comprende

If I multiply 2 times 2 is it really, really 4 me?
And if I add 5 to get 9 minus 8 that just leaves me
Me me me me me me me me
So many times I define my pride through somebody else's eyes
Then I looked inside and found my own stride
I found the lasting love for me
If I am searching for my spirituality passionately
I must begin with me

There's just me, one is the magic number
There's just me, one is the magic number

If I add myself unto myself multiplied times
You and yours and you again, there's just me
And if I divide 8 billion, 48 trillion, 98 zillion
There is, there is just me...
If I subtract one plus me to the 5th degree, use any theorem
There's just me
There's just me, one is the magic number
There's just me, one is the magic number

Me...me, me, me
Me...me, me, me
Me...me, me, me
Me...me, me, meEmbed
