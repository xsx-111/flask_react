A Long Walk Lyrics
You're here, I'm pleased, I really dig your company
Your style, your smile, your peace mentality
Lord, have mercy on me, I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be; baby, I feel free
Come on and go with me

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situation, temptation, education, relaxation
Elevation, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18

Your background, it ain't squeaky clean, shit
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all a sinner
But you put your good foot down and make your soul the winner
I respect that; man, you're so phat; and you're all that,plus supreme
Then you're humble; man, I'm numb with your feeling
I can feel everything that you bring

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptation, education, relaxation
Elevation, maybe we can talk about Revelations 3:17
Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze
And listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots
Or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, come on

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxation
Elevation, maybe we can talk about Psalms in entirety

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situation, temptation, education, relaxation
Elevation, maybe we can talk about Psalms in entirety
Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze
And listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots
Or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, come on

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situation, temptations, education, relaxation
Elevation, maybe baby, maybe we can save the nation
Come on, come on13Embed
