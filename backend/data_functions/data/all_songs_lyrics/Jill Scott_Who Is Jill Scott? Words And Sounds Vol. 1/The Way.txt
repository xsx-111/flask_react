The Way Lyrics
Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Jumped out of bed, took a shower, dressed, cleaned up my place
Made me some breakfast - toast, two scrambled eggs, grits
Grabbed my keys, grabbed my purse, grabbed my jacket
Off to work beaming all the way down 3rd

Is it the way you love me baby?
Is it the way you love me baby? (Yeah)

4:30, can't wait to get home
(I know you're comin' out with us)
Nah, girl, I got something else to do
(Damn Jill, don't be frontin' on your girls for real)
Go ahead, really get your groove on
'Cause tonight my man's coming through (Oh word?) yeah
We gonna have to connect some other time
(It's cool, I understand)
As much as I like to shake my thing on the dance floor
I got another nasty, freaky, just-right way in mind
Tonight I'm gonna beat the high score

Is it the way you love me baby? (Yeah)
Is it the way you love me baby? (Baby)
Is it the way you love me baby? (Is it, is it the way)
Is it the way you love me baby?Embed
