Exclusively LyricsHello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Mmm, this morning my man exclusively introduced me
To some good extra lovin'
He was lickin' and suckin' on everything
Just the way he should
This morning's extra lovin' was good
We laid there sweaty sex funky, happy as we want to be
Lovin' exclusively, my man and me
All night, all morning
So our stomachs were growlin' hungrily
So I jumped up and rushed to the store
In hopes of coming back and getting a little more
Of this morning's good extra lovin '
At the market the people were pushing and shoving
Trying to be the next in line, the turn was mine
The new girl at the counter was cute, not as fine as me
Was this some kind of women's intuition, some kind of insecurity?
Nah, 'cause my man is happy at home lovin' me exclusively
So I shook my head, "What's up?"
"Hello," she smiled as she rung me up
Orange juice $3.29
Croissants $4.85
She sniffed
Butter 89 cents
She sniffed
Strawberries $1.50 a pint
She sniffed, and sniffed, and sniffed, and sniffed again
And then replied, "Raheem, right?"
Right!?!Embed
