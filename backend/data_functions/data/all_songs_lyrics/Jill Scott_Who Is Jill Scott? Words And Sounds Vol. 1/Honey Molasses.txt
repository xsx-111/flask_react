Sweet epiphany
I waited for your call
But you chose not to call me
I wondered what happened
Were you inside a safe space?
And too I wondered
Were you thinking about me?
And if you were, why was I feeling so lonely?
By the phone alone to the bone
Although the night before
You were in my home, my body, my dome
In a circle of passion we Paris, Italy, Japan, Africa, Rome
We made music, we trombone
It was magic the way it happened
Pure electricity
I felt so inspired and afraid at the same time
I don't know whether sing or to rhyme
Call me

Hi, um, I was calling, I
I, last night was, I
Last night was, um, I
Look, just don't, just don't be afraid, okay?
Alright, I hope you'll call me back and
I'll talk to you, then, I
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Hello?Embed
