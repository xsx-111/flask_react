SeeSaw Lyrics
With you, with, with you...

Like a seesaw
Up and down
On a seesaw
Up and down
Up and down with you
A seesaw
Up and down
On a seesaw
Up and down
Up and down with you
With you, with, with you...

I see pictures in my mind
(With you)
I see fingers up my spine
(With you)
I saw my heart break in two
(With you)
I saw her again
With you
A seesaw
Up and down
On a seesaw
Up and down
Up and down with you
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you

I can see it your eyes
(With you)
I see through your thin disguise
(With you)
She was always my best friend
(With you)
I saw you and her again
I see pictures in my mind
I see fingers up my spine
I saw my heart break in two
I saw her again with you
With you, with you, with you, with you

Just stuff
I just...
The world just...
I just...2Embed
