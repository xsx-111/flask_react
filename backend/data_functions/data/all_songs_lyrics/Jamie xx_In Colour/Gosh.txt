Gosh Lyrics
Oh my gosh
Oh my gosh
Easy, easy
Hold it down, hold it down
Oh my gosh
Oh my gosh
Easy, easy
Hold it down, hold it down

Oh my gosh
Oh my gosh
Easy, easy
Hold it down, hold it down
Hold it down
Oh gosh
Oh my gosh
Easy, easy
Yes, UK massive
Yes, UK massive

To all the jungle massive all around the UK and beyond
In Ireland, France, Belgium, wherever you can pick this up, man
Many thanks for still keeping the vibe alive8Embed
