Unstookie Titled LyricsYou smoke your cigarette down to the bone
And since you vowed to back it you're too proud to sack it
You have to carry on, on your own
You think you had it under control
Best foot forward, don't look back no more
Could break your heart and tourment your soul
They sold my name after they stole my shame
Sold my name ah yeah...
Tumbled my game, tumbled their game
Tabloid sized brains
You smoke your cigarettes down to the bone
It's best not to mention you're craving for attention
Love from fame like blood from a stone
Too busy to notice that your throne
Turned to dust, there's no one left to trust
Last chance and your mind will blow
Suppose my name, suppose it came
And they sold my shame yeah...
Suppose it came and I tumbled their game
Tabloid sized brains
But is it really such a sin though
Don't think so
Is it such a sin though?
One and the same
One and the same
One and the same
One and the sameEmbed
