There She Goes LyricsI, I do declare
I was surprised to see you stayed
Only to be betrayed
By the one you gave all your love and trust to
And tell me how could I let go
Since I caught a glimpse of your immense soul
You were dancing to northern soul
Just one glance, ah when you know..
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
On the dirty road to fame
Dirty road to fame, my love, now oh
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
You're going to walk the plank again, walk the plank again
My love, now oh
I was to implore
That you forget all you saw
When you came through my door
And from your bag you pulled out more skag than IÂ´d ever seen
No! How could I let go?
Since I caught a glimpse of your white Plimsoles
Twisting and turning to northern soul
Just one glance, ah well you know
Everybody knows
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
On the dirty road to fame
Dirty road to fame, my love, now oh
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
You walk the plank again, walk the plank again
My love, now oh
There she goes a little, there she, there she, there she goesEmbed
