UnBiloTitled LyricsHe's stronger than the walls
You tried to build around him
To dumb and dumbfound him
For two thousand years I waited for your call
Screaming from the windows
Screaming bloody murder
The more that you follow me
The more I get lost
You think that you know me
You're pissing me off
Yeah, you said that you love me
Why don't you fuck off?
Anyone would think that you own me
You're ripping me
Messed my head, I messed my head
Oh, happy will I be
To shine fire upon everyone and no one
I messed my head and I messed my head
Oh, happy would I be
To shine fire upon everyone and no one
Wolfman and Bilo, on the run
Wolfman said to Bilo, "I'm calling it on"
Bilo said to blue eyes, "Put your trousers back on"
He's stronger than the walls
You tried to build around him
To dumb and dumbfound him
Two thousand years I waited for your call
Screaming from the windows
Screaming bloody murderEmbed
