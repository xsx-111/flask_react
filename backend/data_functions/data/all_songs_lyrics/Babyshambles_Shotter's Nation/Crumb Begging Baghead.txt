Crumb Begging Baghead LyricsDon't take me for a sunbeam
Don't take me for a sunbeam, a sunbeam, a sunbeam
It's just another faction of
Like another fraction of
Another taxer of your life
Don't take me for a sunbeam
Don't take me for a sunbeam, a sunbeam, a sunbeam
I'm a crumb beggin' baghead baby yeah
I'm a crumb beggin' baghead baby yeah
Bet you say that to all of the girls
And all the long lost wars
Any causes worth dying for
What passing bells for those die like cattle again
And again and again
Don't take me for a sunbeam
Don't take me for a sunbeam, a sunbeam, a sunbeam
I'm a crumb beggin' baghead baby yeah
I'm a crumb beggin' baghead baby yeah
Bet you say that to all of the girls
If you ever smile in the street of crocodiles
I doubt you'll ever smile again
Ah don't..... yeahEmbed
