Side Of The Road LyricsI'm half dead I'm a third alive
A quarter ticking over in the middle
By the side of the road
Don't get surrounded by people you hate
Who choke you out the house down the
Path and out the garden gate
All in or never
We're worse when we're together
White punks on dope
Spewin on the side
With the fans and the bands
And the gangs and the tramps
The monkey man can't hide
What the little girl will find
What is it that you're doing to me
I don't know what I know what I know it's like electricity
All in or never ......
What it is that you're doing to me
I don't know what I know what I know it's like electricity
All in or never ......
All in or never ......
I'm half dead I'm a third alive
A quarter ticking over in the middle
By the side of the roadEmbed
