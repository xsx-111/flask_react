Carry On Up The Morning LyricsIn the morning where does all the pain go
The same place the fame goes straight to your head
Ah, it's not easy gettin you out my head
It wasn't easy getting outta bed
So much shame on the workman who blames his tools
Then so the saying goes so it's said
The way you tease me, tease me outta my head
Ah, it's not easy forgettin what you said
I know you used to be into me now you've got it in for me
In the morning where does all the pain go
The same place the fame goes straight to your head
It wasn't easy gettin you outta my head
Ah, it's too easy gettin outta my head
Given up trying to explain I'll just put it in a song instead
Ah, it's not easy gettin outta bed
Ah, it's too easy gettin outta my head
I know where to find, where to find you my love
At the same old place by the river, the only way in is
Through the window, through the windowEmbed
