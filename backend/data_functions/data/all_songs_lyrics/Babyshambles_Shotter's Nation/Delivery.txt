Delivery Lyrics
By, oh by, the way
Of an explanation
Cast adrift
Off the shores of Shotter's Nation
I had a look in
Cave my skull in like a brick
Call now
What use am I to anyone?
I'm fucked, Forlorn, frozen
Beneath the summer
Don't sing along
Or you'll get what I got told

Here comes a delivery
Straight from the heart of my misery
So, comes a delivery
Straight from the heart, to you

Yeah you, now you, now you
You've finally left school
Oh what on earth
Do you intend to do?
See if you can
Tick the man, go round town
Where all you Skins, and Mods
You get together
Make pretend
It's 1969 forever
Find a girl, have a drink
Have a dance and play
The song that'll deliver me
Straight from the harshness of misery
Cos this song's a delivery
Straight from my heart to you
Yes here comes a delivery
Straight from the heart of the misery
Oh that song might deliver me
Straight from the heart, to you
So here comes a delivery
Straight from the heart of my misery
Here comes a delivery
Straight from the heart, to you3Embed
