French Dog Blues LyricsI model lacklustre panicky in vain search for the remedy
No words only melody come so I take my day off
My love, my love she sits with me I love I love her company
Raindrops on roses and dust filled trinkets
All this washes over you my french dog blues
Chien Bleu Chien französicher Hund
And the French dog blues
And the French dog blues
By the French dog blues
Never surrender to flattery
Frown on, come down on duplicity
And above all things my son... take the money and run
I still model lacklustre panicky in vain search for the remedy
No words only melody comes take another day off
Oh this washes over you... my french dog blues
Chien Bleu Chien französischer Hund
Yeah I see you
I only ever wanted the one with the flag
All you ever wanted was a sixty dollar bag
And a cheap limousine for your deep pile dreams on the highway
On the highway, highway
Chien Bleu Chien französicher Hund
That's the French dog blues....Embed
