Deft Left Hand LyricsYou seem the types who follow the line
Went from cheery vagabondage
To cold blooded luxury in four years
No lick spittle or pick thack
From sycophant claw back flunky
Oh, I want to lay by your side
Oh, I will lay down and die if I can't lay by your side
Weakened vessel or better half?
That woman's tears
Could be the death of me, oh dear
You know when she's had a few
She'll be onto you, there's no letting up
But, I want to lay by your side
Oh, I will lay down and die if I can't lay by your side
It may happen too easily, the golden years
So don't despair, don't dismay dry your tears
Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds
I, I had a blast off with the cast of a play on the radio
They were more liberal times
Destined to drone in monotone on your radio
It's a little dream of mine
Oh, but comments were less than complimentary
And the deft left hand it followed the right
I think about my happiest times
And one of them was, sat in bed
Watching a documentary on murderers
A bear cat, a mimosa and a view of arcady
Well, I want to lay by your side
Oh, I will surely lay down and die if I can't lay by your side
I want to lay by your side
Oh, I'll surely lay down and die if I can't lay by your side
Oh, I want to lay by your side
Oh, I will lay down and die if I can't lay by your side
I want to lay by your sideEmbed
