There She Goes - Demo LyricsI do declare I was surprised to see you stay
Only to be betrayed by the one you gave all your love and trust
And tell me how could I let go
Since I caught a glimpse of your immense soul
You were dancing to northern soul
Just one glance, ah well you know
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
On the dirty road to fame
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
You're going to walk the plank again, walk the plank again
I was to implore that you forget all you saw
When you came through my door and from your bag
You pulled out more skag than I'd ever seen
No! How could I let go?
Since I caught a glimpse of your white plimsoles
Twisting and turning to northern soul
Just one glance, ah well you know
Everybody knows
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
On the dirty road to fame
There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
You're going to walk the plank again, walk the plank again
There she goes a little, there she, there she, there she goesEmbed
