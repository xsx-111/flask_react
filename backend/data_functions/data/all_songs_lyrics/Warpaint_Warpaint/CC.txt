CC LyricsBreathe in me
Breathe
Breathe in me
Breathe
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You (spinning, dizzy)
Gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme more
I haven’t had this before
Been holding out for this one
Holding out for love
Not changing my mind so much
And still, and still
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You, you
Gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme more
I haven’t had enough
Gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme more
I haven’t had this before
Been holding out for this one
Holding out for love
Not changing my mind so much
Gimme more
Gimme more
I haven’t had enough1Embed
