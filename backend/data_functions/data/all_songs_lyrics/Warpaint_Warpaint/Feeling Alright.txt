Feeling Alright LyricsUnder the branches of feeling alright
I fell asleep just to dream about
I've known too many reasons to fight
So glad that I have taken my time
Hmmm, my mind is made
I see in bold now
I'm growing up to a starry state
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I know you can see me now
Under the flawless sky, feeling alright
Not careless, not hopeless
You can't bring me down
I've known too many reasons to fight
So glad that I have you on my side
I've taken my time
Only the right thing is happening
I can see it face to face, I'm not worrying
First rule of thumb you gave
Promise not to fake your way
So rest your head and go to sleep now
Ooh, ooh, my mind is made
I see you bold now
I'm growing up to a starry state
Oh, oh, oh
And soon you will see it better now2Embed
