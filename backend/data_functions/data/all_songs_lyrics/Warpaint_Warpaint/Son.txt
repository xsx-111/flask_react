Son LyricsA hundred times I arrived
Followed around again to win, to win
I needed once, running up the spaces of mine
Standing in the garden
Got my number
From the one who says go on
Standing in the garden
Got my number
From the one who says go on
Leave the son alone
You can care, you can stand the reason to go on
Can't hear anyone, tell you what you like
You can rest in finding that your roses will grow older
You can see the reason why your story is not over
Leave the son alone
I'm on my way, way back home
I've not been, I'm not gonna stay
Stay away too long
Leave the son alone
I'm on my way, way back home
I've not been, I'm not gonna stay
Stay away too long2Embed
