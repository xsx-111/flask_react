Biggy LyricsBlue
The color of my native skin
Colored into a color I've never seen
A sun so full and rising
True
The feeling runs across my chest
In my silence
There's a color I've never seen
The sunrise is finding me
Other worlds are spinning
Dance above the clouds
Hold my word to something
Let it make a sound
I felt it, the words that I want
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah I believe in love
Blue
The color of my native skin
Caught up between myself
But it's drawing me in
Into the color that you're making it
There's a world that I've never seen
Shining full and lightning
Made of a lover
Made of a lover
Made of a lover
Made of a lover
Made of a lover
Made of a lover
Made of a lover
Made of a lover
Made of a lover5Embed
