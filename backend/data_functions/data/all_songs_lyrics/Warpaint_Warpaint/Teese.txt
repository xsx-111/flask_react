Teese LyricsAll you see
You don't want to see
But can't seem to avoid
When you're trying to be right
On this trespassed life where
You don't seem to care
And you're making the motions to be aware
As to why you're here
All that the countless moments
Ask of the countless thoughts
Trying to figure me out
That never seemed to come around
Till I got to that part of you
That's me
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
I mean more now
I want more now
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven now
You're so golden
I'm so golden now
I want more now
I want more now
Looked at the moon tonight
I can't get enough
Your hand as it starts to touch
I can't get enough
So lie down, lie down
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
(You are so beautiful)
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
(You are so beautiful)
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
(You are so beautiful)1Embed
