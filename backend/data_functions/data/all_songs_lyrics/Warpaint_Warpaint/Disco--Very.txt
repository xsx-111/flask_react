Disco//Very LyricsOne, two, three, four

I've got a friend with a melody that will kill
She'll eat you alive
Like cyanide it's poison
She'll eat you alive

Don't you battle, we'll kill you
We'll rip you up and tear you in two
Don't you battle, we'll kill you
We'll rip you up and tear you in two
Don't you battle, we'll kill you
We'll rip you up and tear you in two

Only in the sound of the voices I scream

I heard my name, now I'm gone, tell me what I did
You saw me standing on my lone mountain
Dare me to play, not to put it off
The tears are not worth the wait
Your loveliness is so worth it (So worth it)
You're another one in a long, long time
Wrestling people for peace
Wrestling people for peace
Only in the sound of the voices I scream
Only in the sound of your voice did I scream
Only in the sound of the voices I scream

I make room for everyone
I make room for everyone
I need to take a break
Do you wanna look in my mind
Open up and see what you find
Holdin' on to just what I wanted
Hiding like a force, it was

Just behind the door, well, I wasn't not looking out
For nothing anymore but, ooh, look what I found
I was always talking too much
But only in the sound of my voice did I reach out

Only in the sound of the voice did I scream
Only in the sound of the voice did I scream5Embed
