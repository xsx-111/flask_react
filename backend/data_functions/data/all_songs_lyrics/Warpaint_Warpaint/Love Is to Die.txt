Love Is to Die Lyrics
All on my own
Here I stand
Am I humble? Am I ghost?
I'm on a limb to climb
To something lawless I hope
Am I humble? Am I ghost?
I'll find a way
To look towards this day
Got it all hooked up
This could only go one way
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not alive
I'm not alive enough
I'm not alive
I'm not alive enough
(Call 111, call 111)

Love is to die
Love is to not die
Love is to dance
Love is to dance and dance
Love is to die
Love is to not die
Love is to dance
Love is to dance and dance
Call 911, call 911

All on my own
It's confirmed
There's no words to compromise
You really see nothing of this girl
They look, they don't know
The roots behind
Cuz I've got a knife
To cut out the memories
So carefully
Too carefully
It's not necessary
To be so dark

Got to give in
Got to give in
Alert to the night
The last time I alter my mind
I give in
Got to give in
To the fight

Love is to die
Love is to not die
Love is to dance
Love is to dance
Love is to die
Love is to not die
Love is to dance
Love is to dance and dance
Love is to die
Why don't you not die?
Why don't you dance?
Why don't you dance and dance?
And dance, and dance, and dance...14Embed
