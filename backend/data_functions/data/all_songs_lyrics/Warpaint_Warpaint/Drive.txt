Drive LyricsI could drive
Drive myself crazy
But this time
I want to listen
I want to stay inside these visions
That seem like they say
It doesn't mean anything
You gotta get your back up off the wall!
And fall through the other side
Into the eye
Into the storm
Into the eye
Into the storm
Into the eye
Into the storm
Open my eyes
Into the storm
Open my eyes
Sitting alone and I'm waiting
All by myself
When the time goes slow
And I am not waiting for somebody else
And I wanna believe it
I want it, I need it
I guess when I looked at the truth
I was surprised
Surprised I finally could feel it
That I'm a lucky charm
Pushing me along
With every breath
I'm a lucky charm
(Into your eyes, into the storm)
I'm a lucky charm
(Into your eyes, into the storm
Into your eyes, into the storm)
I'm a lucky charm
(Into your eyes
Oh, oh, oh)
I'm a lucky charm
(oh, oh, oh)2Embed
