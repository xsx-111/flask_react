Keep It Healthy LyricsI could not believe
What I was seeing
There's no words
Seeing's believing
How could we
When did we
Forget where we came from
Touch the stars
Feel what we're made of
I could not believe
But you had said it
With all the experience
Was your crowning credit
You were there
You were there
When I first believed it
I first laughed and I was dreaming
(And in these hours you regret)
You wanna heal yourself
(You come from you, don't forget)
You didn't want the help
(You come from you, don't forget)
I never made a sound
(You come from you, don't mistake me)
For somebody else
Come on
Come on baby
Let's get going
There's no need to
Wear your clothing
Just take my hand
Take my heart
Into this moment
To where you understand
And where you believe it
In my dreams we are awake5Embed
