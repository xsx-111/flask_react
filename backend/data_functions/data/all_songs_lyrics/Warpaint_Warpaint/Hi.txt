Hi LyricsUp all night
You wore your falling heart
And opened up to us
And now we know the place you left
You sailed the saddest smile
And turned it inside out
Your mother
She knows your face
Can do without
In the middle of the day
We find love
In the middle of the day
We find love
So quietly you gave to us
Our life, our laugh
Our life, our laugh
Turned it inside out
I know it hurts
Feeling so stuck
When you can't come out
But you brought us up SO HIGH
In the middle of the day
We find love
In the middle of the day
We find love
In the middle of the day
We find love
Hi, hi, hi, hi....
In the middle of the day
In the middle of the day
In the middle of the day
We find love3Embed
