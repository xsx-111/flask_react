Where Dragons Rule LyricsThe dragons rise from the sea of flames
Through the night you can hear them marching
Breathing fire, wings of steel
By the thousands they take to the sky
Shadow us all
In a world
Where dragons rule
Where dragons rule
All across the sky they soar
Burning trails into the night
Laser eyes gleaming death ~ seek and destroy
Like shooting stars they fall from the sky
Death from above
In a world between myth and strange reality
In a world where dragons rule
Mission: Kill
We kill for the dragon ~ We have no reason
Mission: Kill
We die for the dragon ~ Is there a reason?
March!
Mission: Kill
We kill for the dragon
Where dragons rule
Where dragons rule
Where dragons rule
Mission: KillEmbed
