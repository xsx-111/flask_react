Masque of the Red Death LyricsThe pain lingers on beyond these castle walls
The red death is taking them all
While the king and his court dance the night away
At the masquerade
The hour of midnight grows near
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
That you breed
Dance while you may in the dark of the room
With the stranger
Laugh while you may, laugh at the danger
Is this a message from god
Or fate guiding hideous hands?
Won't you show us your face
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
That you breed
Masque of the red death
No one is saved, no one remembers your name
Your name
On and on, one by one we fall
Into the bleeding arms of the stranger
Ripping the masque from your face
I feel your disease running
Through my veins
A new king of death threatens us all
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
That you breed
Masque of the red death
The price that you pay for your lust
May be your lifeEmbed
