Lonely LyricsShe awakens from a dream to a silent room
Where shadows speak of memories
Another sleepless night
Afraid to face the day
It seems so long ago she shared the love
She feels so deep inside
Her love will never die
But still she feels so lonely...
Lonely in Love
Lonely in Love
She wakes up to another day
With everything going wrong
She wonders where she would be
If she had ever seen his face
She turns on the radio
But it's playing that same old song
She's pouring another drink
To drown away the memory of it all
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
Lonely in Love
There's a feeling she can't explain
That no one can understand
She just needs to get away
But there's nowhere that she can go
Tomorrow's so far away
She's longing for yesterday
If she could just turn back time
She wants to leave the world behind
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
(Lonely in Love)
(Lonely in Love)
(Lonely in Love)
The night will fade, the sun will shine
(Lonely in Love)
A new day
And light the way for you to find
New LoveEmbed
