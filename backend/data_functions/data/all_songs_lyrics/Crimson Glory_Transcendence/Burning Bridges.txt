Burning Bridges LyricsWe've all been hurt before
You know the pain
And just to love is not enough
So many times I've had to turn away
From love I know could be so true to me
Now I stand alone in my dark and lonely world
Surrounded by this cold embrace of jealousy
No feeling remains, like a restless heart
Naked in the frozen winds of sorrow
Now I feel the bridges burning
Flames reflecting in my eyes
The feeling's much too cold to share
Another broken heart to spare
Smoke clouds dreams I've left behind
I never meant to bring you sorrow
I never meant to cause you pain
I know how it burns so deep inside
It's burning me too
Leave me silent in the morning light
Hold me close until the morning comes again
I need you so bad
Tell me lies if truth reveals your love
Feel the flames are rising
The bridge is falling, the bridge is burning
I never knew that I would need you
I always thought you would be there
Now I feel the bridges burning
Flames reflecting in my eyes
I never meant to bring you sorrow
I never meant to cause you pain
Still thinking of you
You know I love you... stillEmbed
