Lady of Winter LyricsHer wraith rides the crystal sky
Of changing colors
The glowing clouds are moving through
The winter night
Snow is falling silver shining
Through the shadows deep blue dreaming
Eyes of diamond shine
Lady of winter, turning to rain
White world of wonder, fading away
Bright beams of violent light
Break the silence
Melting colors crushed beneath the waves
Of rolling flames
Seasons turning, burning burning
Lady of winter, song in the wind
Melody whispers, seasons will change
Lady of winter, turning to rain
White world of wonder, fading away
Lady of winter, song in the wind
Melody whispers, seasons will changeEmbed
