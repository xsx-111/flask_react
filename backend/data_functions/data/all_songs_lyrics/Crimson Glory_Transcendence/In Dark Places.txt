In Dark Places LyricsWaves pound the gloomy shores, I watch them roll
Across my feet so warm
I know she's waiting there for me
In ancient rhymes she whispers in the wind
A strange and haunting melody
As it fills the silence, I feel the shivers cold
Embrace my soul
From the deep she beckons me
Promising eternity
In a world where nothing's real
Beyond this realm of light and dreams
You, mystic moon it's you who rules the night
Breathing life into my dreams
I see your face in nightmares shining bright
So, it's farewell to you my sunlit world
So full of hate and misery
You see I just can't take it anymore
From my sleep you beckon me
Promising eternity
In your world of mystery
To your realm of harmony
In dark places
In dark places
In dark places we will be
Forever beyond the light
In dark places we'll be free
From the pain that fills our lives
Through arching moonbeams of light we glide
In bending shadows of warm starlight
Angels of colors light the night as they fly
Transcending into the electric sky
In dark places
In dark places
In dark places we will be
Forever beyond the light
In dark places we'll be free
From the pain that fills our lives
In dark places we will be
Forever beyond the light
In dark places we will see
Worlds we've always dreamedEmbed
