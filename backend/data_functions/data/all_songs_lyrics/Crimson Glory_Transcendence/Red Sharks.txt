Red Sharks LyricsTrapped in their world no free passage to leave
You accept their tyrannical dream
You pray to their gods not to your chosen ones
Freedom's clutched in the jaw of red kings
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Glory to red sharks
Answer to your red dictators
Feeding from your dreams
Cast into a sea of red sharks
Holding the power a hand that grips fate
Stripping from you all but fear
Hovering vultures like demons feed
On all who bow to their communist scheme
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no freedom, see no freedom, speak no freedom
Glory to red sharks
Answer to your red dictators
Feeding from your dreams
Cast into a sea of red sharks
Red sharks
Bloody red sharks
Red sharks
Red sharks
Bloody red sharks
Red sharksEmbed
