Eternal World LyricsDown through the valley of shadows we go
Into the canyon of moonlight below
Stairs of stone descending
Down where the magic river's bending
Down the river we go
To the sea of gold
(Where?) things are not as they seem
(Why?) you are not as you were
Behold eternal world
Where time has no meaning
Reality is dreaming
Feel your flesh is melting
Feel you spirit twisting
Feel it ripping at your mind
There's no time for praying
Feel your soul is pleading
Welcome to eternal world
Eternal world
Eternal world
Eternal world
Eternal worldEmbed
