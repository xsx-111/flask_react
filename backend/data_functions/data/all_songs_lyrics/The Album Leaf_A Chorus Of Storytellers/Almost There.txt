Almost There LyricsSpending the days walking in circles
Wasting away, lost in a haze
When the promise is made
Just a chance we take
Spending the days under the lights
Kept from our eyes, take them away
If the promise fades
Just a chance we take
Almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there again
And we're almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there again
Spending the days wasting away
Lost in a dream inside of me
When the promise is made
Just a chance we take
And we're almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there again
And we're almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there againEmbed
