We Are LyricsWe are the pushing, pulling
We are breaking the distance
If there's still some time in our thoughts
We walk away and back again
Under the night sky, the twilight
We find ourselves here again
Breaking out of standstill
We are the drifters from the shore
We are colors in the landslide
We are the burdens off the floor
Pushing, pulling
We are breaking the distance
Under the night sky, twilight
We walk away and back again
Breaking out of standstill
We are the drifters from the shore
We are colors in the landslide
We are the burdens off the floorEmbed
