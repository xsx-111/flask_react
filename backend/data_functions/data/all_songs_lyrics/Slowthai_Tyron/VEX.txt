VEX Lyrics
Beg somebody try test me
Bust yout, come through, fuck up your crew
People are, people are gettin' me vexed right now
Putting too much chip in the zoot
Oh, beg some—, beg somebody try test me
Bust yout, come through, fuck up your crew
People are, people are gettin’ me vexed right now
Putting too much chip in the zoot, oh

Woke up broke, so I dug in my heels
Brunt of the joke couldn't get in my feels
Took time, nobody is rеal (Yeah)
Can't be my slime, I don’t roll with eels (Yеah)
Put a blade in spine 'cause I love hot meals (Yeah)
I don't wine and dine when I'm playin' the field (Yeah)
Earn your stripes but a man's got kills
Ain't the love of your life, I'm the guy with pills
Sleepless nights, get cold chills
And a peaceful mind, been tortured still
Wet-wipe kids ain’t shit on my shoe
Used to get vexed, now I just, "Mm-hm"
Been bad since I stepped out the womb
In a barrel with crabs, had to make them food
Always wanted more, but I learned to make do
If my attitude’s poor, it's because of you
Beg somebody try test me
Bust yout, come through, fuck up your crew
People are, people are gettin’ me vexed right now
Putting too much chip in the zoot
Oh, beg some—, beg somebody try test me
Bust yout, come through, fuck up your crew
People are, people are gettin' me vexed right now
Putting too much chip in the zoot, oh, beg some

Box a fassy out his socks and slides
God forgive me if I end his life
Thought I was gonna say, "Bust my nine"
But that's not my line, gotta spud my guy
It's slowthai so I shout out Thai
Can’t sip my drink, can't even sky
Got court fines, still bust a slow wine
And please remember you are still in line
Skets gettin' me stressed right now
Calm down, darling, your poom poom's loose
I see you're tryna flex right now
Don't care about you or your Jimmy Choos
I ain't playin' kiss chase, I ain't playin' Duck Duck Goose
Can tell that you ain't got a clue
Heard your man's mixtape, thought it's a piss-take
So I use its case to ash my zoot
Beg somebody try test me (Pussio)
People are gettin' me vexed right now
Oh, beg some—, beg somebody try test me
People are gettin' me vexed right now

I wanna let the rope swing (Rope swing)
Pull up to your yard like I'm the post man
Never been the boy, I was a grown man (Grown man)
All I know's destroy, get with the program
Crackhead smokin' crack off of a Coke can
Packet in your bracket, I'm the snowman (Snowman)
Brother doin' life, he's in a snowglobe (Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up)
Albo sending white, he got a boat-load

Beg somebody try test me
Bust yout, come through, fuck up your crew
People are, people are gettin' me vexed right now
Putting too much chip in the zoot
Oh, beg some—, beg somebody try test me
Bust yout, come through, fuck up your crew
People are, people are gettin' me vexed right now
Putting too much chip in the zoot, oh, beg some
You're killin' me, now7Embed
