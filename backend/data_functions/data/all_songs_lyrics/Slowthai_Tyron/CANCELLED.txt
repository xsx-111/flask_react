CANCELLED Lyrics
Now you're dripping blood (Goat gang)
Now you're, now you're dripping blood
From the neck, from the neck
(Now you're dripping blood)

How you gonna cancel me?
Twenty awards on the mantelpiece
Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury
Girls in the crowd got their hands on me
About you wanna cancel who?
Fuck with the cult, now the gang's on you
I'm a vampire, got the fangs on you
Now you're dripping blood
How you gonna cancel me?
Twenty awards on the mantelpiece
Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury
Girls in the crowd got their hands on me
About you wanna cancel who?
Fuck with the cult, now the gang's on you
I'm a vampire, got the fangs on you
Now you're dripping blood

Now you're dripping blood
Now you're dripping blood
Now you're dripping blood
Now you're dripping blood
I ain't an actor, fuck the Oscars (Fuck 'em)
Main stage in my boxers (Brr)
Thousand grams, fuck the GRAMMYs (Yeah)
Same-same for the shottas (Yeah)
Massage for the posture
Only bad tings on the roster
I shot caffeine like I'm Costa (What?)
Mad ting, what the bumba?
Ayy, she said I do magic
Like Harry Potter, I'm off the vodka
Orderin' lobster, said it's preposterous
I'm so obnoxious, I need a doctor
Said I won't come back
I must be cancer, ain't got much longer
Then I made a comeback, kick it like Ong Bak
Now I got blood on my jumper

How you gonna cancel me?
Twenty awards on the mantelpiece
Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury
Girls in the crowd got their hands on me
About you wanna cancel who?
Fuck with the cult, now the gang's on you
I'm a vampire, got the fangs on you
Now you're dripping blood
Show me your face, let me see who's really tryna stop me
I pay the price, don't care what it cost me
I just gotta spit, can't put a sock in it
Endless poetry like Jodorowsky
Super sus, super off-key
Run through the streets with a few Gs
We ain't killing them softly
Know we got cranium shots for you zombies
We'll be purging 'til we pass out
Shell casing dropping on the ground
On my high horse, it's so far down
See you throwing stones in your glass house
Evidently
Nothing is going the way that you said it would be
Middle finger to my enemy
Foot on your neck, got them begging me, "Please"

How you gonna cancel me?
Twenty awards on the mantelpiece
Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury
Girls in the crowd got their hands on me
About you wanna cancel who?
Fuck with the cult, now the gang's on you
I'm a vampire, got the fangs on you
Now you're dripping blood9Embed
