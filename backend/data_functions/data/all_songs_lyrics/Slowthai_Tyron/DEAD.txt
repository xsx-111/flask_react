DEAD Lyrics
Take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll nеver take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am hеre till the end of time (Set, set, yeah)

See me posted up with a bimbo
Easy, life's been fucked and that's my window
It's just me, my friends and my kinfolk
We just laid a bet and it come in, so
B just bought a round, we watch the football
We don't take kindly to no insults
We all aim at you, plain and simple
Achoo, no bless you, I gotta get you
Take away my loved ones, you will never take the light
That shines inside my heart and makes me real by design
When it's ugly change for money, see that they ain't got no spine
People change for money, what's money with no time?
Say it once, say it once, yeah, everybody dies
Say it once, said it once, everybody dies
Mi vida loca, true, I lead this crazy life
Tune bangin' in the motor, gun fingers to the sky
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time (Set, set, yeah)

What don't kill you, fam', makes you stronger
I take liberties, try and I prosper
With no nicotine, Ty is a monster
You snake slithering, I'm Harry Potter
Leave a sentiment steeped in vodka
No one here ever can knock my posture
I stand tall, you ball, curl up and sob, bruh
I carve my name into each and every log
When we go (Yeah) where the flowers grow (Pow, pow, pow)
Let me know (Haha) how it goes (Brr)
I dare say, it's rare for me to care
I stare at thin air imagining what could be there
I visualise and see, to your surprise
My demise could never be, on G-O-D
You can take away my time, you can't take away my mind
My legend will live eternity (I'm forever blud)
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time
They can take away my flesh, but they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God, I am here till the end of time4Embed
