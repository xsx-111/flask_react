PLAY WITH FIRE Lyrics
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it burn
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it burn
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it burn
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip
Play with fire, fire (I'm hypersensitive, mmh)

"Soft lad, stop acting like a bitch"
I wish I pressed skip, everything is negative
It gets hectic, strеssin', if you're from the place I livе
They couldn't catch my drift with your nose in my business
Nail on the head, I make it click (Blaow)
A chain's only as strong as its links
That's why I gotta box from squints
And the coke makes the cats look like they're
Jar Jar Binks, top it off with a wink (Ching)
That's the icing on the cake, the cherry on the top (Uh-huh)
My bike ain't got no brakes, that's why I never stop (Stop)
I say it to your face, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Name a time and a place, gettin' brave, you dug your grave (Yeah)
I'm the next best thing since electric
It is what I said it is and that's expensive
Remember I didn't have a flint, skint (Brrt), tryna get it
Setting fire with my lighter, I did it ambidextrous (Brrat)
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip (Brr)
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it burn (Brrat)
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip (Zoom, zoom, zoom)
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it burn (Pew-pew, pew-pew)

Full moon, put me in a corner
Have me swingin' with a pool cue, I do this for them broke youts
No money in the lunchroom, my brothers in the magistrates
All they know is slangin' weight and bangin' 'til their knuckles break (Free 'em)
Mothers say "For Pete's sake," we could only keep Pete safe
Pete's up the street with the heat tryna bleed grapes
Some people can't see straight, need to find direction
If I clock an interception, Cruyff turn, watch your knees break

Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip (Brr)
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it burn (Bow)
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it rip
Play with fire, fire, play with fire, let it burn

Sometimes I feel like I've got my head in a blender (Small talk)
Compromise with too many empty promises (I hate the Internet)
If you love the world for its flaws, you will never be disappointed (Honestly, honestly you're)
You're my everything and I have no words (I fucking hate you)
(Just be sincere, be honest)
I just wanna make you proud (Sometimes I hate myself)
(I fucking hate you)
(Somedays I feel over-)
Do what you wanna do, not what's expected of you (I promise, I love you, I promise I'll get better)
If anyone's seen sleep, tell him I miss him dearly
I'm happy being the fucking flower boy
Don't let your mattress swallow you, wallowing, thinking what you're gonna do or gotta do (Fuck all these expectations)
My heart and mind are at war and my soul's out here playing piggy in the middle (Don't be scared to be yourself)
Why do I feel like I'm holding the short straw?4Embed
