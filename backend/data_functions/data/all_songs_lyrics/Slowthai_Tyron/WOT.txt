WOT Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

In the zone, in the zone, in the zone, gonna get this
In the zone, in the zone, in the zone, gonna get this
In the zone, in the zone, in the zone, gonna get this
In the zone, in the zone, in the zone, zone, yeah

Go-getter, gotta get it from the jump
Waved off rum, got skunk in my zoot
In the rave, drop a eccy with your mum
Young mum's drunk, slowthai too cute
No еffort and I do it nonchalant
Bendy Wendy, had to doggy that down
And I make hеr bend back like croissants
She said, "Ooh-la-la," 'cause she loves my smile
What's up, my lad?
Used to get licks, like pass me the pad
Then I hit licks, now they can't chat back
Fuck them kids, "Nah, you can't say that"
Man, I just did, like, can't say what?
Calm, I'm cool, I'm blessed, I'm a Don
Can't give me lip, get hit with the box
Tracky in socks when I walk in the shop, take tills and gwop
Yeah1Embed
