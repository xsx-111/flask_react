45 SMOKE Lyrics
Booyaka, uh

Rise and shine, let's get it
Bombaclaat (Bomba), dickhead, bombaclaat (Bomba), dickhead (Bombaclaat)
I used to jack cars with a Phillips
Speak patois in case somebody listens (What was that?)
And I got new boogs so the creps get christened
True they glistened (Uh)
Now they pigeon, who are you kiddin'?
Get a next pair, now the shoe's more fittin'
Council flat on a clingfilm ting
Wipe shoes on the mat, got new carpet (Uh)
Nike tracksuit, got it for a bargain
Got mums in my ear like a drill sergeant
They say time is money, guess I'm bidin' mine
So I never walk alone like Merseyside (Uh)
Your kilo come purcey-sized
Too many options, I can't decide (Bah)
Always got a smile in crucial times
And I always ran wild, couldn't find my tribe (Uh)
I used to rock Lyle & Scott
Vile lil' cunt from the Eastern sides (Uh)
Double-N till the day I die
Keep doublin', tryna multiply
Money to me like shit for a fly
So I stay getting P 'cos the world is mine
The .45 smoke, the .45 smoke (The whole world is mine)
The .45 smoke, the .45 smoke (Mine)
The .45 smoke, the .45 smoke
The .45 smoke, the .45 smoke
The .45 smoke (Bah), the .45 smoke (Bah)
The .45 smoke (Bah), the .45 smoke (Bah)
The .45 smoke (Bah), the .45 smoke (Bah)
The .45 smoke (Bah), the .45 smoke (Bah)

'Cos I grew up 'round shottaz, coppers, alcoholics
Drinking Foster's, anabolic
Rage amongst us, spliff, no blunt
Here to buss you and your mums
Always rains, don't see no sun
Take me for cunt, get knife to your lung
Do for fun, it's nothing long
People think I'm Satan's son
Shotters, coppers, alcoholics (Bah)
Drinking Foster's, anabolic (Bah)
Rage amongst us, spliff, no blunt (Bah)
Here to bust you and your mums (Bah)
Always rain, don't see no sun (Bah)
Take me for cunt, get knife to your lung (Bah)
Do for fun, it's nothing long (Bah)
People think I'm Satan's son (Bah)3Embed
