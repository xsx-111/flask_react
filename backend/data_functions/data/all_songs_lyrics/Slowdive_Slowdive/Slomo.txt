Slomo Lyrics
You give me your love, it's a curious love
You give me your heart, it's a curious thing
Our lady of the shipwreck is running through the storm
With her skirts blown back
Hands to the fore

My love and I go, it's a curious woe now
Like dreamers at dawn, awake but not yet
You gimme your heart, it's a curious thing now
Gimme your love, it's a curious love, yeah


It burns and it slides
It's a curious ride (Gimme your heart)
Gimme your heart, yeah
Gimme your heart

My love and I go, yeah, it's a curious ride
We're younger than clouds
Younger than clouds
It burns and it slides
It's a curious ride
Gimme your heart, yeah
Gimme your heart


You give me your love, it's a curious love
You give me your heart, it's a curious thing
Our lady of the shipwreck is running through the storm
With her skirts blown back
Hands to the fore

My love and I go, it's a curious woe now
Like dreamers at dawn, awake but not yet
You gimme your heart, it's a curious thing
Gimme your love, it's a curious love, yeah

My love and I go, it's a curious woe
Like dreamers at dawn, awake but not yet
You gimme your heart, it's a curious thing
Gimme your love, it's a curious love
My love and I go, it's a curious woe
Like dreamers at dawn, awake but not yet
You gimme your heart, it's a curious thing
Gimme your love, it's a curious love2Embed
