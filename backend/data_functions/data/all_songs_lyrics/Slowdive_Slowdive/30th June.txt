30th June LyricsThe most beautiful day I ever saw
With these eyes I saw the best in life
The most sensical day I had
Turning stones, turning stones over til they shone
(Dark as days, dark as days)
And you were caught in the dark
With nothing makes sense
But you were caught in the dark
Where nothing makes no sense
(Shadows down, shadows down / when I saw the light in you)
The most beautiful day I ever, ever had
With these eyes I saw the light in yours
The most sensical day I had
Turning stones, turning stones over til they shone
(Dark as days, turning stones, dark as days)Embed
