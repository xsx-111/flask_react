Falling Ashes Lyrics
Boy and the man
Hear the ghost in this town
Could this be it
Your final words, your own
We rolled the bed
Piece by piece, plank by plank
Then gathered in light
You were the grace of my night

Thinking about love
Thinking about love
Thinking about love
Thinking about love

The night boat floats past
The years tumble down
He's living alone
The only life that you know
California, I thought I saw ya'
Love of my life, grace of my night

Thinking about love
Thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love

Thinking about love
Thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
Thinking about love, thinking about love
