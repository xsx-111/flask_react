Everyone Knows Lyrics
You’re so beautiful
But you're all alone
I see you there
But I don’t know anything
And you holding back
Just holding on
You say you're fine
Going to America

You made a plan
You can sail away
Can rent a car
Take me to the place you know

Take me to America, America

To the great north
To the great north

Well it sounds like fun
But I don’t know anyone
Just say the word
Take me to America
I can let you go
We can take it slow
Just pack your bag
Take me to the place you know
Take me to America (America)
Take me to America (America)
Take me to America (America)2Embed
