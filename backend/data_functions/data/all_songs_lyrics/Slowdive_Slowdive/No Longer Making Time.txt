No Longer Making Time Lyrics
You come anyway
You say you're clean and you like it that way
You got a new boy
He keeps it light, yeah, you like a light love
Who cares anyway
Oh Lord, I remember those days
And all those nights
When you wanted so much more

Cathy, don't wait too long
We're no longer making time
Forever we'll be
Together, we breathe
No longer far to run

Come anyway
Come on down in your blue-eyed way
Comes and it goes
You come around and I don't know why
Just lovers and life
Common ground, yeah, there's no surprise
Just holding your arms
Holding on till the fear, it goes
Cathy, don't wait too long
We're no longer making time
Forever we'll be
Together, we breathe
No longer far to run

Cathy, don't wait too long
We're no longer making time
Forever we'll be
Together, we breathe
No longer far to run

Who cares anyway
Oh Lord, I remember those days
And all those nights
Holding on till the fear, it goes5Embed
