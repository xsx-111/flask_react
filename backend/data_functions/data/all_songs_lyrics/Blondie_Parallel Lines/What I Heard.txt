What I Heard Lyrics
Same old song and dance
Why do I give you another chance?
Drama every night
I don't want to fight
Same old story again but if you want to be my friend it's really got to end
Same old story

You told me you were done with her and I believed every word and now I wonder what I heard
You told me you were done with her and I believed every word and now I wonder what I heard

The drama won't stop
Said you've called the cops
Police don't care because it's crazy
And you keep calling me
I heard it all before
It's a total bore
The cat got out and he came running back for more


I told you I'd be cool
Now I feel like a fool
I got sucked into and it's crazy but it won't phase me
It's a total bore
I heard it all before
The cat got out and he came running back for more
