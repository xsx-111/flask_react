Bang a Gong (Get It On) LyricsWell you're dirty and sweet
Clad in Black
Don't look back
And I love you
You're dirty and sweet oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You got the teeth
Of the Hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl
Get It On
Bang a gong
Get It On
Oh yeah
You're an untamed youth
That's the truth
With your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty and sweet oh yeah
You're built like a car
You got a hubcap
Diamond star halo
You're built like a car
Get It On
Bang a gong
Get It On
Oh yeah
You're an untamed youth
That's the truth
With your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty and sweet oh yeah
Well you're windy and wild
You got the blues
I'm your shoes and your stockings
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl
Get It On
Bang a gong
Get It On
Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in Black
Don't look back
And I love you
You're dirty and sweet oh yeah
When you dance, when you walk
Dance, second chance, understand me
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl
Get It On
Bang a gong
Get It On
Oh take me
These boots were made for walking
And that's just what they'll doEmbed
