Side of the Road LyricsYou wait in the car on the side of the road
Let me go and stand a while
I want to know you're there, but I want to be alone
If only for a minute or two
I want to see what it feels like to leave without you
I want to feel the touch of my own skin
Against the sun, against the wind
I walked out in a field
The grass was high and it brushed against my legs
I just stood and looked out at the open space
At a farmhouse out a little ways
And I wondered about the people who lived in it
And I wondered if they were happy and content
Were there children and a man and a wife?
And did she love him and take her hair down at night?
If I stray too far from you
Don't go and try to find me
It doesn't mean that I don't love you
It don't mean that I won't come back and stay beside you
It only means that I need a little time
To follow that unbroken line
To a place where where the wild things grow
To a place where I always used to go
If only for a minute or two
I want to see what it feels like to be without you
I want to know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun, against the windEmbed
