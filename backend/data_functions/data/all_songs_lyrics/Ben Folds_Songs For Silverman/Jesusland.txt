Jesusland LyricsTake a walk, out the gate you go and never stop
Past dollar stores and wig shops
Quarter in a cup for every block
And watch the buildings grow smaller as you go
Down the tracks, beautiful McMansions on a hill
That overlook a highway with riverboat casinos
And you still have yet to see a soul
Jesusland
Jesusland
Town to town, broadcast to each house
They drop your name but no one knows your face
Billboard's quoting things you'd never say
You hang your head and pray
For Jesusland
Jesusland
Miles and miles and the sun goin' down
Pulses glow from their homes
You're not alone, lights come on
As you lay your weary head on their lawn
Parking lots cracked and growing grass
You see it all from offices to farms
Crosses flying high above the malls
Along the walk
Through Jesusland
