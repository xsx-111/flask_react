Time LyricsThink of me
Anyway you want
I can be
The problem if that's easier
In your head
Move the pieces around
Things I've said
Turn the memory upside down
And it makes it better I know
But sometimes it's hard to swallow
In time I will fade away
In time I won't hear what you say
In time, but time takes time you know
Tell your friends
The things they wanna hear and see
Start the drums
Band against the enemy
And in time I will fade away
In time I won't care what you say
In time, but time takes time you know
In your head
Move the pieces 'round
Things I've said
Turn the memory upside down
It might make it better, I know
But sometimes it's hard to swallow
In time I will fade away
In time I won't care what you say
In time, but time takes time you know
Time takes time you knowEmbed
