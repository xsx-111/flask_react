Landed Lyrics
We'd hit the bottom
I thought it was my fault
In a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out
What it was all about
Moved to the west coast
Away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still
I was still in love

Until I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong
Just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up
I've landed

The daily dramas
She made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me
And talk me back down
Until I believed
I was the crazy one
And in a way I guess I was
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
Treading the sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
If you wrote me off
I'd understand it
Because I've been on
Some other planet
So come pick me up
I've landed

And you will be so
Happy to know
I've come alone
It's over

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's okay to call
And I will answer for myself
Come pick me up
Come pick me up
I've landed1Embed
