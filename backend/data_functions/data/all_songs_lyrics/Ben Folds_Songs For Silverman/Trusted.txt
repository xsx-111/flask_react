Trusted Lyrics
It's funny I know
But I'm disappointed in you
I thought you could read my mind
But I came home early
And saw that a drawer'd been opened
Looks like you've been reading my diary instead

How does it feel to realize
You're all alone behind your eyes?
It seems to me if you can't trust
You can't be trusted

Caught in a dream
Picking up astral signals
Some of them psychic, you better watch what you think
Happens to be that
Everybody else's dreams are Freudian clues
You better watch what you dream

You wanna see the other side
What's going on behind the eyes
Still it seems if you can't trust
You can't be trusted
Didn't you know, we're as close as we can be?

The sun's coming up
She's pulled all the blankets over
Curled in a ball
Like she's hiding from me and
That's when I know
She's gonna be pissed when she wakes up
For terrible things I did to her in her dreams

You wanna see the other side
What's going on behind the eyes
Still it seems if you can't trust
You can't be trusted
Didn't you know, we're as close as we can be?
