Prison Food LyricsYou walked the earth
Talked and never spoke a word
She wonders who'll be the first to go
I said, you know
The biggest things we gotta face alone
Don't wanna waste time and go
Alone
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
A trace of me
It floats in my periphery
And every time I turn to see it goes
Alone
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Floating by like a satellite
To pass the time, you'll float by again
And I can tell you about the little things
So you don't think about the big things for a while
You walked the earth
Talked and never spoke a word
She wonders who will be the first to go
Alone
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
AloneEmbed
