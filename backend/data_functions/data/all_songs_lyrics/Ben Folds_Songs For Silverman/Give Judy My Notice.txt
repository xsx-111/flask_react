Give Judy My Notice LyricsJudy
Could anyone be loved any more
Than I love you?
Does it hurt you, too?
But Judy
I've been feeling small too long
I love you so
But something's wrong
'Cause I come running when you want me here
And when you want me to, I disappear
Give Judy my notice
I knew
If I made it easy for you
You'd settle for me
Yeah, eventually
But, Judy
I won't be your bitch anymore
And follow you round
And hold the door
'Cause I can't do this any longer
The vacuum left is so much stronger
Give Judy my notice
Give Judy my notice
Judy, you know I'm not mad anymore
At least most of the time
But that could take a while
And I've been living just to see you smile
Every once in a while
Tears fall
But that don't mean nothing at all
Just 'cause I said it first
Yeah, that's why it hurts you
And I'm not sorry if you're not sorry, too
And you're not sorry till I make you
Give Judy my notice
Give Judy my notice
Give Judy my notice
My notice
My noticeEmbed
