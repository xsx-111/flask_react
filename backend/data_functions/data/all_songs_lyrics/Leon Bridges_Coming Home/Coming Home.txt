Coming Home Lyrics

Baby, baby, baby
I'm coming home
To your tender sweet loving
You're my one and only woman
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want

I wanna be around
I wanna be around, girl
I wanna be around, girl
You, I wanna be around

Baby, how I'd be grieving
If you wanted to leave me all alone now
By myself, I don't want nobody else
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want

I wanna be around
I wanna be around, girl
I wanna be around, girl
You, I wanna be around
Baby, baby, baby
I'm coming home
To your tender loving
You're my one and only woman
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want

I wanna be around
I wanna be around, girl
I wanna be around, girl
You, I wanna be around, girl

I need you, baby
Girl I, I need your loving
Darling
Wanna hold you close
Girl, girl13Embed
