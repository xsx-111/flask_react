Pull Away Lyrics
Whoa, girl
I wanna (Pull away) from you
It's been too long
I wanna (Walk away) right now
I thought that our love was true
But all along, I was wrong

My pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
Our love, I thought I could sustain
Don't worry about me anymore
Cause I'll be gone by the morning time

Whoa, girl
I (Poured out my heart) to you
Despite
You put a (Knife in my back), straight through
I thought that our love was true
But all along, I was wrong

My pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
Our love, I thought I could sustain
Don't worry about me anymore
Cause I'll be gone by the morning time
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong7Embed
