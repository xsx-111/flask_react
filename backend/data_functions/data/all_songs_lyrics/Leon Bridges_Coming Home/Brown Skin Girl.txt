Brown Skin Girl Lyrics
Brown skin girl on the other side of the room
Brown skin girl staring with her brown eyes
Ooh, baby, don't you know you're a cutie pie?

Princess, little honey with the polka-dot dress on
Ruby-lipped lady whose name I don't know
Let me tell you, darling
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh whoo-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh whoo-ooh, OK

Brown skin girl with the white pearls 'round her neck
Brown skin girl, let me hold you close under the white moon
Cause baby, I'm ready and you know that I'm waiting on you

Princess, little honey with the polka-dot dress on
Ruby-lipped lady whose name I don't know
Let me tell you, darling
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh whoo-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh whoo-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh whoo-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh whoo-ooh6Embed
