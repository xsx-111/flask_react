All of Me Lyrics
All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see that I'm no good without you
Take my arms I want to lose them
Take my lips I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
And I know that I am no good without you
You took apart that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?


All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see that I'm no good without you
Take my arms I want to lose them
Take my lips I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
And I know that I am no good without you
You took apart that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?1Embed
