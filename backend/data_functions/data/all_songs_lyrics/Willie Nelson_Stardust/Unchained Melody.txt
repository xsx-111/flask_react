Unchained Melody Lyrics
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

God speed your love to meEmbed
