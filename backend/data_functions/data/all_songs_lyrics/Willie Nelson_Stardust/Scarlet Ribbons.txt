Scarlet Ribbons Lyrics
I peeped in to say good night
And then I heard my child in prayer
And for me some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair
All the stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
And in our town no scarlet ribbons
Not one ribbon for her hair
Through the night my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking
I peeped in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be two hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
If I live to be two hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hairEmbed
