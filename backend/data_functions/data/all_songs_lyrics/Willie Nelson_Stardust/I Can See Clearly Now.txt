I Can See Clearly Now Lyrics
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It is going to a be a bright (bright), bright (bright)
Sun-Shiny day

I think I can make it now, the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is the rainbow I have been praying for
Its going to be a bright (bright), bright (bright)
Sun-Shiny day

Look all around, there is nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue skies

I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It is going to a be a bright (bright), bright (bright)
Sun-Shiny dayEmbed
