Moonlight in Vermont Lyrics
Pennies in a stream
Fallen leaves of sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont
Icy fingers waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snow light in Vermont

Telegraph cables swing down the highway
Travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadow lark
Moonlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables swing down the highway
Travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadow lark
Moonlight in Vermont
You and I at moonlight in VermontEmbed
