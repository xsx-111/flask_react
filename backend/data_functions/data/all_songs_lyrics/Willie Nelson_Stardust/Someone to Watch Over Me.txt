Someone to Watch Over Me Lyrics
There is somebody
I'm longing to see
I hope that she
Turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although she may not be the girl
Some men think of
As pretty
To my heart
She carries the key
Won't you tell her please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Although she may not be the girl
Some men think of
As pretty
To my heart
She carries the key
Won't you tell her please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over meEmbed
