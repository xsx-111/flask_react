As I Am Lyrics
Don't tell me what's in, tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win
This fight isn't your life, it isn't your right
To take the only thing that's mine
Proven over time, it's over your head
Don't try to read between the
Lines are clearly defined!
"Never lose sight of something you believe in"

Taking in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog!

I've been trying to justify you
In the end I will just defy you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!
As I am!
Still running uphill, swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity
''Slow down! You're thinking too much. Where is your soul?''
You cannot touch the way I play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way of all that I believe in

Taking in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog!

I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!
As I am!
