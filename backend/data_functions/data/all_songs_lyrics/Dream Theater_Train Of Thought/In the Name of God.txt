In the Name of God Lyrics

How can this be?
Why is he the chosen one?
Saint gone astray
With a scepter and a gun

Learn to believe
In the mighty and the strong
Come bleed the beast
Follow me, it won't be long

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Straight is the path
Leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak
Ethnic elimination
Any day we'll all be
Swept away
You'll be saved
As long as you obey

Lies
Tools of the devil inside
Written in holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide
Us all

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
They can't tell
Where God ends
And mankind begins
They know no other
Life but this
From the cradle
They are claimed
Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Hundreds of believers
Lured into a doomsday cult
All would perish
In the name of God
Self-proclaimed messiah
Led his servants
To their death
Eighty murdered
In the name of God

Forty sons and daughters
Un-consenting plural wives
Perversions
In the name of God
Underground religion
Turning toward
The mainstream light
Blind devotion
In the name of God
Justifying violence
Citing from the holy book
Teaching hatred
In the name of God

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Religious beliefs
Fanatic obsession
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?
Unyielding crusade
Divine revelation
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
Of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah...5Embed
