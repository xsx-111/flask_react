This Dying Soul Lyrics

Hello, mirror - so glad to see you my friend, it's been a while
Searching, fearless, where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial?
Face yourself, man!
Brace yourself and trace your hell back
You've been blinded, living like a one-way cold existence all the while!
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes, you long lost child!

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul, this dying soul
This dying soul!

Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you
Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage
Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain into blame and hate
Living on your own by twenty-one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

Possessive obsessions, selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments, passing all the blame

Living out a life of decadence
Acting without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most
Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while they can't stand the thought of you!
A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul, this dying soul
This dying soul!

Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

Come to me my friend (listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)
You'll find your peace of mind (give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (break out of this isolation)
Let humility (openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (a healing tranquility)
Help me
Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone
Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help i know you can
Be at one with god and man
Hear me
Believe me
Take me
I'm ready to break through this prison wall
