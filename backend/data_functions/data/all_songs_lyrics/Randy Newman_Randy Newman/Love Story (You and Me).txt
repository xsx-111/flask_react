Love Story (You and Me) LyricsI like your brother
I like your mother
I like you
And you like me, too
We'll get a preacher
I'll buy a ring
We'll hire a band
With an accordion
A violin
And a tenor who can sing:
You and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me, baby
You and me, you and me
You and me, baby
We'll have a kid
Or maybe we'll rent one
He's got to be straight
We don't want a bent one
He'll drink his baby brew
From a big brass cup
Someday he may be President
If things loosen up
You and me you and me, baby
You and me you and me you and me, baby
You and me you and me you and me, baby
You and me you and me you and me, baby
I'll take the train into the city
Ev'ry mornin'
You may be plain - I think you're pretty
In the mornin'
And some nights we'll go out dancin'
If I am not too tired
Some nights we'll sit romancin'
Watching the Late Show by the fire
When our kids are grown
With kids of their own
They'll send us away
To a little home in Florida
We'll play checkers all day
Until we pass awayEmbed
