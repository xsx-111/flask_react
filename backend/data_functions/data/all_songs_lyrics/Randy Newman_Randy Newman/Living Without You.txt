Living Without You LyricsThe milk truck hauls the sun up
And the paper hits the door
The subway shakes my floor
And I think about you
Time to face the dawning gray
Of another lonely day

Baby, it's so hard living without you
It's so hard, baby it's so hard
Baby, it's so hard living without you
Everyone's got something
And they're out tryin' to get some more
They got something to get up for
Well, I ain't about to
Nothin's gonna happen
Nothin's gonna change

Baby, it's so hard living without you
It's so hard, baby it's so hard
Baby, it's so hard living without youEmbed
