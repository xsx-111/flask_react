Bet No One Ever Hurt This Bad LyricsSit by my window and watch the rain
I hear it beating on my window pane
Well, it makes me so sad
Bet no one ever hurt this bad
My baby left me and now I'm alone
Wait for a letter and I sit by the phone
Oh, the troubles I've had
Bet no one ever hurt this bad
Since you went away
I can't face the day
And night brings nothing but pain
Thought I could go on
I see that I was wrong
Baby, please come home
I just can't stand to be alone
Somebody somewhere hear my plea
And send my baby back to me
It'd make me so glad
Bet no one ever hurt this badEmbed
