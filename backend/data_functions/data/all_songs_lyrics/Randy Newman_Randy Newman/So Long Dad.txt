So Long Dad LyricsHome again
And the streets are not much cleaner
And the quaint old south side scenery
Is quaint no more
Just older than before
Go up the stairs and down the hallway
To my daddy's door
Your son is home, Dad, and he's found a girl
And she's the greatest girl in all the world
I think you'll like her, Dad, I hope you do
But if you don't that's alright, too
What's new?
Do you still work at the drugstore, Is that true?
Still polishing the same floor
I missed my good old Dad
My, but I'm glad to see you
Home again
But we won't be staying here, Dad
Come and see us, Poppa, when you can
There'll always be a place for my old man
Just drop by when it's convenient to
Be sure and call before you do
So long, DadEmbed
