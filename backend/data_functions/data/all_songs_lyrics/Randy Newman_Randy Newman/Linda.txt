Linda LyricsSeven ships without a sail, seven cats without a tail
Boy, it's weird here on this spooky old pier tonight
But I'm not frightened 'cause I know what it is
Everything is just the same as it was
I'm in trouble because of Linda, she hurt me so badly
She said she'd be here on our special pier, I love her
Linda, the carousel's playing
But that merry-go-round is bringing me down
'Cause I remember what it meant to you
Linda, Linda
I love youEmbed
