Laughing Boy LyricsLaughing boy keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Laughing boy keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Find a clown and grind him down
He may just be laughing at you
An unprincipled and uncommitted
Clown can hardly be permitted
To sit around and laugh at
What the decent people try to do
Laughing boy keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Laughing boy keep moving
Keep moving, keep movingEmbed
