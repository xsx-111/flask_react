Davy the Fat Boy LyricsI've been his friend
Since we were little babies
I was a comfort to his mother
And a pal to his dad
Before they passed away
They said, "Please take care of our Davy
You may be the only friend
He ever will
Have"
Davy the fat boy
Davy the fat boy
Isn't he round?
Isn't he round?
What do he weigh, folks?
Can you guess what he weigh?
You know, it's only a quarter
Win a teddy bear for the girlfriend
Or something for the wife
You got to let this fat boy in your life!
I think we can
Persuade him to do
The famous fat boy dance for you
Give me half a chance
I just know you'll like my fat boy's dance!

Davy the fat boy
Davy the fat boy
Isn't he
Isn't he
Round?Embed
