The Beehive State LyricsSince you're the delegate from Kansas
Will you kindly take the floor
And tell us what Kansas is thinking
And what is Kansas for?
Well Kansas is for the farmer
We stand behind the little man
And we need a firehouse in Topeka
So help us if you can
I see the gentleman from Utah
Our friendly Beehive state
How can we help you, Utah?
How can we make you great?
Well, we got to irrigate our deserts
We've got to get some things to grow
And we got to tell this country about Utah
'Cause nobody seems to knowEmbed
