Cowboy LyricsCold gray buildings where a hill should be
Steel and concrete closing in on me
City faces haunt the places I roam alone
Cowboy, cowboy, can't run, can't hide
Too late to fight now, too tired to try
Wind, once blew free
Now scatters dust to the sky
Cowboy, cowboy, can't run, can't hide
Too late to fight now, too tired to tryEmbed
