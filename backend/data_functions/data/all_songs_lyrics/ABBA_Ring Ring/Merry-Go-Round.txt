Merry-Go-Round Lyrics
I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friend
Now it seems I have to start again

Merry-go-round where am I bound
With my love and feelings, merry-go-round?
Who wants to kiss me and hug me and miss me?
Yes, who wants to do it? I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round, wish I had found
Somebody to care for, where am I bound?
Life is so lonely if life is just only
To love with my loving goes round and round

Looking for someone who would want to stay
I might find her with a bit of luck one day
But who knows so until then
I can only try and try again

Merry-go-round where am I bound
With my love and feelings, merry-go-round?
Who wants to kiss me and hug me and miss me?
Yes, who wants to do it? I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round, wish I had found
Somebody to care for, where am I bound?
Life is so lonely if life is just only
To love with my loving goes round and round
Merry-go-round where am I bound
With my love and feelings, merry-go-round?
Who wants to kiss me and hug me and miss me?
Yes, who wants to do it? I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round, wish I had found
Somebody to care for, where am I bound?
Life is so lonely if life is just only
To love with my loving goes round and round

Merry, merry, merry, merry, merry-go-round
(Merry-go-round, merry-merry-go-round, merry go-round)
Merry, merry, merry, merry, merry-go-round
(Merry-go-round, merry-merry-go-round, merry go-round)
Merry, merry, merry, merry, merry-go-round
(Merry-go-round, merry-merry-go-round, merry go-round)
Merry, merry, merry, merry, merry-go-round
(Merry-go-round, merry-merry-go-round, merry go-round)
Merry, merry, merry, merry, merry-go-round
(Merry-go-round, merry-merry-go-round, merry go-round)
Merry, merry, merry, merry, merry-go-round
(Merry-go-round, merry-merry-go-round, merry go-round)Embed
