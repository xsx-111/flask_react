You Got Me Dizzy LyricsListen to me babe
What I said is right
I'll leave home in the mornin' baby
But I can't stay out all night
'Cause you got me dizzy
Yeah, you got me dizzy
Yeah, you got me dizzy
And I can't even see my way
Let me tell you babe
What I say is true
I ain't never, never loved nobody
In the way that I love you
Now, you got me dizzy
Oh, you got me dizzy
Yeah, you got me dizzy
And I can't even see my way
I hear you
Wait a minute babe
Don't you bip or bop
You done made me love you baby
And I swear, I just can't stop
'Cause you got me dizzy
Oh, you got me dizzy
Yeah, you got me dizzy
I can't even see my wayEmbed
