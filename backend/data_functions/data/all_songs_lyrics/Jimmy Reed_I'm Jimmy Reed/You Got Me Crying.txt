You Got Me Crying LyricsI got a little girl
And when she hold me in her arms
I'm out of this world
And she help keep that world
She's gotten me cryin' a valley of tears
You know, baby, you know
Because you know how I feel
You've gotten me cryin'
Oh yeah, you know they're real
Now you know, darlin', that you thrill me so
Tellin' you, honey, you don't have to go
You've gotten me cryin' a valley of tears
You know baby, oh, because you know how I feel
You've gotten me cryin'
Oh yeah, you know they're realEmbed
