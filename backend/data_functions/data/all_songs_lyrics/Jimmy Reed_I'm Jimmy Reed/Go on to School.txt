Go on to School LyricsI met a little girl that was on her way to school
I met a little girl, she ain't nobody's fool
Well go on, baby, don't be nobody's fool
They got ya readin' and writin', workin' 'rithmetic
I know those teachers about to make ya sick
But go on, baby, don't be nobody's fool
I'll see ya in the mornin' on your way to school
Well you know they got you standin' at the head of your class
And the kids don't like it, tryin' make you feel bad
Go on, baby, don't be nobody's fool
I'll see ya in the mornin' on your way to schoolEmbed
