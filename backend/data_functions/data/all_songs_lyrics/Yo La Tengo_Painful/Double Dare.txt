Double Dare LyricsI, I should know
You shouldn't have to tell me
Sometimes it's the way we feel, oh, the way we feel
We feel pretty bad
In a double dare
He's got wandering eyes
And I see 'em look at you, looking straight at you
But I know where they are
I'll walk you home
You take as long as it takes
The sun in the morning sky, in the morning sky
We'll know where we are
We'll know where we areEmbed
