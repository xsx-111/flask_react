I Was the Fool Beside You for Too Long LyricsI was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
For too long
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
For too long
The things about you that would drive me wild
Still drive me wild
But now in a different way
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
For too longEmbed
