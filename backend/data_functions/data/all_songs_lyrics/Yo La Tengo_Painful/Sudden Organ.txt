Sudden Organ LyricsWill you stare?
Will you stare as the final curtain starts to fall?
Will you watch?
Will you watch with closing eyes, with closing eyes?
Everyone
Everyone's a little worried, you know I am
But I hate to watch the days go by
Watch the days go by
Another day
Another time
Another way for the moment
Watch it for a sign
Well, I don't know
But I'm pretty sure that I want to shoot it in the back
As the days go by
I'm stepping on them all like ants
I've seen the way that they look at you
Maybe you
Or maybe not a guess, we'll know it after a while
I'm wondering just how this will stop
How's it gonna stop?
Another day
Another time
Another way for the moment
Watch it for a sign
Another day
Another time
Another way for the moment
Watch it for a signEmbed
