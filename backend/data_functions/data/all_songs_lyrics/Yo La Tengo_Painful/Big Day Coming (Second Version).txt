Big Day Coming (Second Version) LyricsLet's be undecided
Let's take our time
And sooner or later
We will know our mind
We'll be on the outside
We won't care
'Cause we're together
That's somewhere
And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
I can hardly wait
Let's wake up the neighbors
Let's turn up our amps
The way that we used to
Without a plan
We can play a Stones song
Sitting on a fence
And it'll sound pretty good
'Til I forget how it ends
And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
I can hardly wait
I woke up early
Couldn't go back to sleep
'Cause I'd been thinking
Of where it all would lead
So I made you wake up
Said "let's take a walk"
I want to hold your hand
We don't have to talk
And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
And I can hardly wait
I can hardly waitEmbed
