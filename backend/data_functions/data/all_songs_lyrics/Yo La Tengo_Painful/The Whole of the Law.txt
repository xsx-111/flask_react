The Whole of the Law LyricsWell, I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean
If I knew you were waiting for me
I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean
I'd plumb the depths of every sea for you
I'd escape from my chains
And I'll reach out for you
Maybe I'm in love with you
Maybe, maybe I'm in love with you
I had to contact you, found out I was in love with you
I had to contact
That's it, that's the law, that's the whole of the law
The whole of the law1Embed
