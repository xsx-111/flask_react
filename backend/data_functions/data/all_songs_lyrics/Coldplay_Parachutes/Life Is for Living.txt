Life Is for Living Lyrics
Now I never meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
Don't let it stand in our way
Cause my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living
We all know
And I don't want to live it alone
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
And just sing
Ah, ah, oh2Embed
