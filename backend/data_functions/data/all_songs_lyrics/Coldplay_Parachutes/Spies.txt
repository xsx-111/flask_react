Spies Lyrics
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here, where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know?
Show me the right way to go"

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives, look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear, no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh, I forget everything I learn

And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
Ah, and if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They canâ€™t touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies

They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies17Embed
