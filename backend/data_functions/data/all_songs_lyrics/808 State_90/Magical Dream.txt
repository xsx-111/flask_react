Magical Dream LyricsIt's a fantasy taking over your mind
So let it roll, let it roll with ease
It will take control of the rest of your soul
And explode into a magical dream
Fields of thought, mountains of dreams
Rivers of hopes and dreams
Fields of thought, mountains of dreams
Rivers of hopes and dreams
Imagine looking through a window and there's no one there
Looking back into time, there's no need to compare
'Cause my thoughts, they linger beyond extreme
Think I'll expect you agree, a magical dream
It's a fantasy taking over your mind
So let it roll, let it roll with ease
It will take control of the rest of your soul
And explode into a magical dream
Fields of thought, mountains of dreams
Rivers of hopes and dreams
Fields of thought, mountains of dreams
Rivers of hopes and dreams
Imagine looking through a window and there's no one there
Looking back into time, there's no need to compare
'Cause my thoughts, they linger beyond extreme
Think I'll expect you agree, a magical dream
Fields of thought, mountains of dreams
Rivers of hopes and dreams
So come with me and have no fear
Just close your eyes and disappearEmbed
