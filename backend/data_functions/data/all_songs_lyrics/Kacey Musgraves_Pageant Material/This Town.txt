This Town Lyrics
We had a girl that came in with a drug overdose the other day. And she got real belligerent. And she bit one of the nurses. (Oh man). And, I mean, she bit (Ohhh)â€”you could see every tooth (Nooo! Hehe). It took two or three of us to get her off of her. It's a crazy Wednesday

We finally got a flashing light
They put it in last year
And everybody got real happy
When the grocery store got beer
And last time the census men came a-knockin'
We were busting at the seams

Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

Big enough for a ZIP code
A VFW
A good Mexican restaurant
A beauty shop or two
Got a Methodist, a Baptist
And a Church of the Nazarene

Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Yeah, it's too dang small to be mean
Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

You'll end up in the paper
Wreck your family name
What goes around comes back around
By Friday's football game
We only got one sheriff
But we all know how to keep the peace

Aww, and don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other
Yeah, somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other1Embed
