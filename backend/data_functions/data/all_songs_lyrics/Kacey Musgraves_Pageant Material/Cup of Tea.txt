Cup of Tea Lyrics
Maybe your jacket is a hand-me down
Maybe you slept with half of your hometown
In a world of squares maybe you're just round

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea

Maybe you're working at a hotel bar
Maybe you're still driving your high school car
Maybe you still don't know just who you are

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please

Oh, maybe you married the wrong person first
Maybe your hair's way too long
Your sister's in jail
Or maybe you failed out of college
But, hey, life goes on
And we've all got the right to be wrong
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it black, some like it green
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Why would you wanna be?1Embed
