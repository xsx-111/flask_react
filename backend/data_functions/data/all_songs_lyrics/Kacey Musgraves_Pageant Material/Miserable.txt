Miserable Lyrics
Your heart's as heavy as the stones you throw
Can't see the flowers for the weeds you grow
You blow your bubbles just to watch 'em burst
For you it's always bad to worse

And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

Your neighbor's dirty laundry's cleaner
And the wolf at your door's always meaner
Your sky's still grey when the sun's around
But you can't set sail with your anchor down

And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable
I'm miserable

Can't laugh enough for the both of us
Be half enough for the whole of us
If misery loves company
Then I can't keep you company no more
You
You
You
You... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable1Embed
