Wizard of Finance LyricsYeah, whoa-whoa-whoa
If I was a wizard of finance
Speculating every day on Wall Street
My dividends would be so tremendous, baby
Even Dow Jones would find it hard to believe
It's your lovin'
Can I kiss you
Can I squeeze you
Can I hug you
Right now baby (it's the squeezing kind)
(x2)
All-right!
If I had plenty of money
I would probably spend it all in one year
I'd be busy buying you flowers, girl
Just to show I appreciate your being here
It's your lovin'
Can I kiss you
Can I squeeze you
Can I hug you
Right now, baby
It's the squeezing kind
(x2)
It's the lovin' kind
It's the squeezin' kind
(x2)
It's your lovin'
Can I kiss you
Can I squeeze you
Can I hug you
Can I squeeze you kind, yeah darling
It's the lovin' kind
It's the squeezing kind
(x2)
If I were a wizard of finance
I would probably invest my life in you
My dividend would be so tremendous, baby
Even Dow Jones won't believe it's true
It's the lovin' kind
It's the squeezing kind
(x2)
It's your lovin'
Can I kiss you
Can I squeeze you
Can I hold you
Can I hug you
Can I please you
Can I squeeze you kind, yeah
It's the lovin' kind
It's the squeezing kind
