Bop Gun (Endangered Species) LyricsHmm!
Yeah!
Oooooh, yeahhh-aayy!
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Movin' right on you, baby!
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Bound to get down, (down!) baby
Turn me loose
We shall overcome
Where did you get that Funk from, huh?
Turn them on
They're spoiling the fun
Let's shoot them with the Bop Gun
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Movin' right on 'round, (hey baby)
We got to get over the hump (x4)
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Bound to get down, baby (hey!)
Turn me loose
Let me shoot them with the Bop Gun, ha, hmm
Endangered species (x3)
Let me shoot them with the Bop Gun
Endangered species (x4)
We got to get over the hump (x4)
When the Syndrome is around (on guard!)
Don't let your guard down
All you've got to do is
Call on the Funk, ohhh
On guard!
Defend yourself!
We shall overcome
Where did you get that Funk from?
They're spoiling the fun
Shoot them with my Bop Gun
Ohh, hey baby
On guard!
Protect yourself!
Movin' in on you, baby
I don't think you hear me
I said they're spoiling the fun
We shall overcome
We got to shoot them with the Bop Gun
Hey, babe
Bound to get down
Closing in on you
When the Syndrome is around
Don't let your guard down
All you got to do is
Call on the Funk (moving in on you, baby)
To dance is a protection
Funk is your connection
All you got to do is
Funk and dance
On guard!
Protect yourself!
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Endangered species (x5)
Shoot them with the Bop Gun
Endangered species (x7)
You got to shoot them with the Bop Gun
Endangered species (x6)
You got to shoot them with the Bop Gun
When the Syndrome is around
Don't let your guard down
All you've got to do is
Call on the Funk
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Movin' in on you
Turn me loose
We shall overcome
Where'd you get that Funk from, huh?
