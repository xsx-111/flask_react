Placebo Syndrome LyricsThere's so much syndrome, baby
There's so much syndrome, baby
When all the smiles are out of town
You're going round and round
You find the Syndrome
When your ups lift you down
Your placebo is too weak
You're in the Syndrome
You're in the Syndrome
And the intensity of their sadness
Is equal to the intensity they enjoy
There's so much Syndrome, baby
When all the thing is out of sound
And there's no coming round
Play with the Syndrome
What used to be such fun to do
Can often lead you weak
Into the Syndrome
Livin' at the top of the Syndrome
Placebo Syndrome
Livin' at the top of the Syndrome
Placebo Syndrome
(x5)
There's so much Syndrome, baby (there's so much Syndrome)
When all the smiles are out of town
You're falling round and round
You find the Syndrome
When your ups lift you down
Your placebo is too weak
You're in the Syndrome
(x2)
So good, in the syndrome
Livin' in the syndrome
Syndrome, livin' in the syndrome
(It's good to be, don't know what to do)
Livin' at the top of the Syndrome
Placebo Syndrome
