Turn Your Back Lyrics
And when the clock strikes 12, tell me where you gonna be?
Cleaning up the mess we’ve made or watching your TV?
And if you have to ask, then you don’t have a clue
There’s snow in Arizona while they’re bombing in Beirut!

I hope some day… when I’m dead and gone
We learn to right… everything that’s wrong
With loving hands… turn sick to strong
Our time will tell… if life goes on, on, on, on, on

When the storm hits your front door
With a roar you can’t ignore
You run, run away!
But there’s no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night
You don’t got no chance to fight
‘Cause you’re too late!
So kiss your ass goodbye, mate!

It just don’t make no sense, there’s a million mouths to feed
We got military action over monetary need
And you can turn your back, or you can plant the seed
You can choose compassion over universal greed
I hope some day… when I’m dead and gone
We learn to right… everything that’s wrong
With loving hands… turn sick to strong
Our time will tell… if life goes on, on, on, on, on

When the storm hits your front door
With a roar you can’t ignore
You run, run away!
But there’s no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night
You don’t got no chance to fight
‘Cause you’re too late!
So kiss your ass goodbye, mate!
When the storm hits your front door
With a roar you can’t ignore
You run, run away!
But there’s no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night
You don’t got no chance to fight
‘Cause you’re too late!
So kiss your ass goodbye, mate!

Well, you can turn your back but it won’t go away
And you don’t look scared but you should be afraid
You can shut your mouth but you still have a say
But you just don’t care for tomorrow today
Well, you can turn your back (but it won’t go away)
And you don’t look scared (but you should be afraid)
You can shut your mouth (but you still have a say)
But you just don’t care (for tomorrow today)
Well, no way, way
No way, no way, no way, no way!

When the storm hits your front door
With a roar you can’t ignore
You run, run away!
But there’s no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night
You don’t got no chance to fight
‘Cause you’re too late!
So kiss your ass goodbye, mate!
When the storm hits your front door
With a roar you can’t ignore
You run, run away!
But there’s no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night
You don’t got no chance to fight
‘Cause you’re too late!
So kiss your ass goodbye, mate!2Embed
