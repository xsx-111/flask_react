Bloody Nails + Broken Hearts LyricsLay down, lay down with your drunken fools
I never thought you could be so cruel
And all the rumours I heard were true
You had another man in our room
Peel off the banner just from the wounds
I still have plenty of scars to prove
I’m sick of covering up the truth
So now I’m taking it back from you

From the start, drew a target on my heart
So you can throw your poisoned darts
You’ll never kill, never kill

You left a trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And you keep tearing them apart
With bloody nails and broken hearts
Now I know fairy tales don’t come true
And Cinderella don’t fit the shoe
Some day I’ll get back the love I gave
Some day you’ll pay for the mess you’ve made


You left a trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And I bet you thought I’d miss your bitter kiss
(Your bitter kiss, your bitter kiss
I’ll never miss your bitter kiss
Your bitter kiss, your bitter kiss
I’ll never miss your bitter kiss)
So now I’m taking it back from you
(So now I’m taking it back from you)
Yeah now I’m taking it back from you

You left a trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And I bet you thought I’d miss your bitter kiss
(Your bitter kiss, your bitter kiss)Embed
