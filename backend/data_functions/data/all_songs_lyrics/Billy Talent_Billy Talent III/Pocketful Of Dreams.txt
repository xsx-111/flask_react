Pocketful Of Dreams Lyrics
Vanities are only charity
And she makes donations at the Tiffany’s
Life is hard without a credit card to get by, get by
She sold her dreams for security
To a man that now she hardly ever sees
With a cold Martini in her hand, she don’t mind, don’t mind

So throw all your luxuries aside
You can’t take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your eyes
They're full of dollar signs

Oh, reach into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don’t matter if you fail
You’re too scared to try ‘cause you might break a nail, oh

If you desire a plastic happiness
Then climb the social ladder to the top, my friend
And don’t forget to thank the piggy bank in the sky, so high
So throw all your luxuries aside
You can’t take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your eyes
They're full of dollar signs

Oh, reach into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don’t matter if you fail
You’re too scared to try ‘cause you might break a nail, oh
Oh, reach into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don’t matter if you fail
You’re too scared to try ‘cause you might break a nail, oh
 2x
Oh, reach into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don’t matter if you fail
You’re too scared to try ‘cause you might break a nail, oh
Oh, reach into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don’t matter if you fail
You’re too scared to try ‘cause you might break a nail, ohEmbed
