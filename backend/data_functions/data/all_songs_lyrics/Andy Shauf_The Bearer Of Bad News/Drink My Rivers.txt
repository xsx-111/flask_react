Drink My Rivers LyricsLight sleeper
Easy dreamer
Do you dream of me
When I'm far away
Do I drift further every day
When i drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
It's not as bad as it seems
Dig deeper
Daylight dreamer
I'll try to dream of you
When you're far away
When you seem further every day
I'll drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
It's not as bad as it seems
Light sleeper
Easy dreamer
When you dream of me
Am I far away
Do I inch closer every day
Do I drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
Is it as bad as it seems?3Embed
