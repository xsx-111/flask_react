Covered in Dust Lyrics:
Spin my tires
Start my fires
I will wade on through
:
Castle red
I'll be dead
Long before you
:
I will die a poor man
Covered in dust
Dreaming of you
:
Tip toes
Plain clothes
I am a closed hand
:
Chipped brow
Somehow
I hope you understand
:
I will die a poor man
Covered in dust
Dreaming of you
:
I will die a poor man
Covered in dust
Dreaming of you1Embed
