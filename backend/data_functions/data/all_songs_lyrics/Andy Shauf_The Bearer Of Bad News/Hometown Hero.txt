Hometown Hero LyricsHometown hero, flexing his charm
With a borderline joke to the guys at the bar
And they slap their knees like they've not heard it before
Thirty-five years old, wearing his badge
Nickname for life on the shoulder of his bomber
That he wears as the coach of the high school team
He lights his cigarette
And says, "Man, these things will kill me someday"
Raises his glass and says, "Here's to hoping"
Hometown hero, flexing his arm
With a five-yard pass to the end of the bar
He says, "I'll be right back, I'm just gonna go grab another pack."
Walks one block to the all-night station
And steps into a situation
There's a man with a gun pointed at the nervous clerk
And before he could think
He was tackling the gunman
Who hit his head and was knocked unconscious
The clerk, relieved, said, "Oh my god
You're a hero, man, and you should stick around
'Til the cops get here, maybe you'll make the morning news."
But the hometown hero rose to his feet
Tossed him the gun and said, "Thanks, but I've gotta run
I'll take a pack of Camel lights and be on my way."
He stepped outside the door
Heard the sirens in the distance
Lit his cigarette
And said, "Man, these things will kill me someday"
Exhaled smoke and said, "Here's to hoping"1Embed
