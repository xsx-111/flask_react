Lick Your Wounds Lyrics
Painted doorway
Open minded
Creaking stair set take me skyward
Close your blue eyes, kiss my dry lips
Learn my lessons
Put your dress on

Light this sidewalk
Drunk I stumble
Words from my mouth, hear me mumble
Who am I to fall in something
Close to loving
Ever hurting?

Find my heartbeat
Drugs and failures
Make your way to cure my senses
Close your blue eyes, kiss my dry lips
Fall in love with my own loneliness

Baby lick your wounds
Baby lick your woundsEmbed
