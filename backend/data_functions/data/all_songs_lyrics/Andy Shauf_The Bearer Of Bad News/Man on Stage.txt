Man on Stage LyricsI am the man on stage slurring your favourite songs.
Making up a few of the words as I go along.
Taking the edge off of me
Is a necessity when I'm singing these words that I no longer mean.
I am not a poet, I'm a broken heart
And though you didn't dispute it, I don't really play the part.
I am not dishonest, I'm a lost detail
Leaving out the good words to hide my trail.
I am not singing this to comfort you
Though my words aren't daggers, I'm just telling the truth
That I am not a poet, I'm a broken heart
And though you didn't dispute it, I don't really play the part
I am not a poet, I'm a broken heart
I am not a poet, I'm a broken heart
I am not a poet, I'm a broken heart
I am not a poet, I'm a broken heart1Embed
