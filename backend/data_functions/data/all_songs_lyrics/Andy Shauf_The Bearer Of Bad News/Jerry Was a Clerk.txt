Jerry Was a Clerk Lyrics
Me and a couple friends, we had a big idea
About getting money and getting out of here
We were wide-eyed dreamers of wealth
We were getting tired of killing time
Filling up our heads with cheap wine
Jerry had a van so we could make our escape

He would say, "Boys, our time has come
To live among the privileged ones"

Now it was Jerry's plan, but we all agreed
Skip town and split the money up evenly
Lay low 'til the winter rolled in
He said, "I know an old farmer doesn't trust the bank
Keeps his money buried out behind his water tank
He told me once when he was out of his mind"

"Oh, boys our time has come
To live among the privileged ones"
Now Jerry had a girl, the only one of us
To ever have one last, and so, no questions asked
She'd be the fourth one involved
Her name was Mary-Anne, and she was nice enough
Always a cashier, only once in love
With Jerry - the dreamer and the clerk

Who said, "Boys our time has come
To live among the privileged ones"

So on that Friday night on which we all agreed
We took our shovels and crept out carefully
Through the farmyard darker than sin
The plan went off without a hitch
'Til we passed the chicken coop and Mary tripped
Turned the hens to sirens in the night
And when the farmhouse lights turned on
A warning shot rang out into the dawn
And we ran like hell for Jerry's van
But when we arrived, we were only three
And while Jerry's greed fed gas to the engine
His words showed us a coward we'd never seen
As he said, "Boys, our time has come
We're gonna save ourselves and live among the privileged ones"Embed
