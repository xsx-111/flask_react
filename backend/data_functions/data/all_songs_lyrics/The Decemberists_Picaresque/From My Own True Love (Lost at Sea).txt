From My Own True Love (Lost at Sea) LyricsFour score years
Living down in this rain swept town
Sea salt tears
Swimming round as the rain comes down
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me?
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me?
A letter for me
From my own true love
Lost at sea
Lost at sea
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me?
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me?
A letter for me
From my own true love
Lost at sea
Lost at seaEmbed
