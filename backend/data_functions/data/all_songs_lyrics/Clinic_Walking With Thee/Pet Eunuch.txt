Pet Eunuch LyricsRenee I'm bored while you pulsate come as ever
Seeking more sun here in your day come as ever
Making me warm here to your taste come as ever
Beat them black and beat them blue
Beat them 'till they oh oh oh
Use the best and use the best and oh oh oh
Would you know now it's getting late come as ever
Knowing your eyes are dinner plates come as ever
Making me warm here to your taste come as ever
Beat them black and beat them blue
Beat them 'till they oh oh oh
Use the best and use the best and oh oh oh
Come they'd never know
Come they'd never know
Come they'd never know
Come they'd never know
Come they'd never know
Come they'd never knowEmbed
