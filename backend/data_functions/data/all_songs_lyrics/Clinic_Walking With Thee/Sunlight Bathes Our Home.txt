Sunlight Bathes Our Home LyricsMagical magical magical weather sunlight bathes our home
Shirley I'm up and up forever sunlight bathes our home
Keeping our life and limbs together sunlight bathes our home
Back and forth the colours go where it stops noone knows
Sing and sing this together
Sing and sing this at home
Laughter laughters untethered
Laughter laughter at home
Merriment has made our split halves whole
Watch it all watch it all watch it beginning sunlight bathes our home
None of us here could keep from grinning sunlight bathes our home
Back and forth the colours go where it stops noone knows
Sing and sing this together
Sing and sing this at home
Laughter laughters untethered
Laughter laughter at home
Merriment has made our split halves whole
Would you be would you be would you be governed sunlight bathes our home
Keeping our lives and limbs uncovered sunlight bathes our home
Back and forth the colours go where it stops noone knows
Sing and sing this together
Sing and sing this at home
Laughter laughters untethered
Laughter laughter at home
Merriment has made our split halves whole
Sunlight binds our home together
Sunlight binds our home together
Sunlight binds our home together
Sunlight binds our home togetherEmbed
