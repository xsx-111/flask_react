For The Wars LyricsSunshine boy the endless joy rushes in our home
Sunshine boy the endless joy rushes in our home
In one and out one come my love
In one and out one now its safe and warm
And long before
You're all made up for the wars
Christ, oh Christ, all in their rows
Christ they're in their rows
Come and watch and lap it up
Christ they're in their rows
In one and out one come my love
In one and out one now it's safe and warm
And long before
You're all made up for the wars
In one and out one come my love
In one and out one now it's safe and warm
And long before
You're all made up for the warsEmbed
