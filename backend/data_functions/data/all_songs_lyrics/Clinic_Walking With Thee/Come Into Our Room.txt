Come Into Our Room LyricsCandlelight and all things bright come into our room
Candlelight and all things bright come into our room
Now now the winter glows
See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room
See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room
Now now the winter glows
Now now the winter glows
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you
Snug as bugs inside your love come into our room
Snug as bugs inside your love come into our room
Now now the winter glows
Now now the winter glows
Now now the winter glows
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you
Fingerbobs has wolfed the lot come into our room
Fingerbobs has wolfed the lot come into our room
Now now the winter glows
Now now the winter glows
Now now the winter glows
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you
Come into your room
Come into your room
Come into your room
Come into your room
Come into your room
Come into your roomEmbed
