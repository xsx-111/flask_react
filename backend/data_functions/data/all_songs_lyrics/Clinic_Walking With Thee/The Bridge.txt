The Bridge LyricsBits of batter cook in the glow
You need the love you need it to show
Come come come oh how we know
You need the love you need it to show
Come and glow
Its good as ever
Good as ever close
Look at all the sun on the waves
You need the love you need it today
Come come it's never too late
You need the love you need it today
Come and glow
Its good as ever
Good as ever close
Meet me on the bridge out of sight
You need the love you need it to die
Come come you know that is time
You need the love you need it to show
Come and glowEmbed
