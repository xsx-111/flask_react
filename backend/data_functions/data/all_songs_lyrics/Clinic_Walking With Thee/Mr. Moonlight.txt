Mr. Moonlight LyricsKathy in the sun
Kathy has just come
No other family warmth that blinds your home
And people in the know are just people in the know
Rush them on the sands and all go home, its goodnight
Candleman would never
Oh candleman would never mind
Lesters on the ropes
Lester and the hoax
No other family warmth that binds your home
And people in the shows are just people in the shows
Rush them on the sands and all go home, its goodnight
Candleman would never
Oh candleman would never mind
Sonny knows you know you know what has begun
Sonny come come up the front
All the elephants came out now you can dismount
With the family warmth that binds your house
People in the know are just people in the know
Rush them on the sands and all go home, its goodnight
Candleman would never
Oh candleman would never mind
