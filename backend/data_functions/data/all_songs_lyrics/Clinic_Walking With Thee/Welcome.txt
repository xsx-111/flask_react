Welcome LyricsYou see your sun is gentle, see your Sunday clothes
And the new beginnings just biginning to unfold
Best of all the summers warm see our lady with her shawl
Come and come forever could you go go go for more
Now your welcome with us more
Now your welcome with us more
Who would you disintegrate for?
And see us in the kitchen, see us on the floor
And the new biginnings that are biginning at the door
Best of all the summers warm see our lady with her shawl
Come and come forever could you go go go for more
Now your welcome with us more
Now your welcome with us more
Who would you disintegrate for?
Get it all in the open, get it out of your cloak
And the new biginnings just biginning to unfold
Best of all the summers warm see our lady with her shawl
Come and come forever could you go go go for more
Now your welcome with us more
Now your welcome with us more
Who would you disintegrate for?Embed
