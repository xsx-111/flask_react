The Vulture LyricsNita and her black haired mother in the warmth and in the glow
Sow them up like any other, sow them up like one you know
Sow them up like one you know, sow them up like one you know
Vulture, vulture uncovered
Vulture, vulture disclosed
And the best you left here for others
Is the best the rest of us know
Gilly in the summer lazing in the warmth and in the glow
Sow them up like any other, sow them up like one you know
Sow them up like one you know, sow them up like one you know
Vulture, vulture uncovered
Vulture, vulture disclosed
And the best you left here for others
Is the best the rest of us know
Vulture, vulture in pieces
Vulture, vulture disclosed
And the best you left other people
Is the best the rest of us knowEmbed
