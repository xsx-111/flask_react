The Equaliser LyricsWant to, want to put you together
Want to more and more
Want to, want to put you together
Want to more and more
Want to with the biggest smile
Peeking out of either eye
Come and come and look we're on a roll
Are you an acceptable host?
Are you an acceptable host?
Are you an acceptable host?
All for the best and the best then we left so...
Have to, have to, put this together
Have to more and more
Have to, have to, put this together
Have to more and more
Have to with biggest smile
Peeking out of either eye
Come and come and look we're on a roll
Are you an acceptable host?
Are you an acceptable host?
Are you an acceptable host?
All for the best and the best then we left so...
Want to, want to put it to bed
Want to more and more
Want to, want to put it to bed
Want to more and more
Want to with the biggest smile
Peeking out of either eye
Come and come and look we're on a roll
Are you an acceptable host?
Are you an acceptable host?
Are you an acceptable host?
All for the best and the best then we left so...Embed
