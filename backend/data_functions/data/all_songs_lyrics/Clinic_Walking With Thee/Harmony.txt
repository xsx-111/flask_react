Harmony LyricsI believe in harmony
I believe in Christmas Eve
Free for all the happiness
And no one's living on their wits
One so kind and one so wise
One so kind throughout your life
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Come, fill yourself with dreams
I believed in destiny
I believed your trust was free
Free for all the happiness
And no one's living with regret
One so kind and one so wise
One so kind throughout your life
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Come, fill yourself with dreams
Oh and now we know
No-one ever told
Now you can be bold
I believed in solitude
I believed till there was you
Free for all the happiness
And no one's living on their wits
One so kind and one so wise
One so kind throughout you life
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Come, fill yourself with dreams
Harmony and no dilemmas
Harmony and no dilemmas
Harmony and no dilemmasEmbed
