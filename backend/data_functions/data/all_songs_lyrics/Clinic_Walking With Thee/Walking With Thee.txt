Walking With Thee LyricsAs you climb up the stairs and come back forever
Summer's in the house, how untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
And they'll have us know your mind's back together
Stitched it up for once, how untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
No!
No!
No no no no no no no no!
A million joys, a million joys here
You could set your watch, how untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
And with us or not, you get good affection
You could set your watch, how untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
No!
No!
No!
No no no no no no no no!
If you climb up the stairs and come back forever
Summer's in the house, how untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
And they'll have us know your mind's back together
Stitched it up for once, how untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
No!Embed
