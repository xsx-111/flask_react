Alternative: Our Love LyricsAll eyes on you now
The cigarette burning, the taste of ash in your mouth
I understand, I understand
This ain't a dream, it's your world caving in
Strange clouds I'm under
Waiting from nothing, now you've got no place to hide
Our love is a moment in time
I always knew we'd get the feeling that's right
Get a feeling that's right
Oh, get a feeling that's right
Jump in the setting
To get a feeling that's right
Don't stop believing
Jump in the setting, hide the voices within
Our love is a moment in time
I always knew we'd get the feeling that's right
Get a feeling that's right
Oh, get a feeling that's right
Jump in the setting
To get a feeling that's right
Ooh, streetlights illuminate feeling
Ooh, red sky, just don't stop believing
Ooh, streetlights illuminate feeling
Ooh, red sky, just don't stop believing
All eyes on you now
The cigarette burning, the taste of ash in your mouth
I understand, I understand
This ain't a dream, it's your world caving in
Don't stop believing
Don't stop believing
Don't stop
Don't stopEmbed
