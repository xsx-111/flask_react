Forgiveness Lyrics
Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us

Alone to face a hostile place
A moment's peace ain't coming
The constant cold cracking your bones
The stench of life worth living

The line in the sand ain't drawn for everyone
The flag in your hand don't make you American
Stripping your soul back, be forever young, forever young
Forever young

Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us

Wake up, walk on, you are alone
The world you're in's too heavy
But soak your skin in love and sin
Falling like confetti
The line in the sand ain't drawn for everyone
The flag in your hand don't make you American
Stripping your soul back, be forever young, forever young
Forever young

Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us
Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us

The line in the sand ain't drawn for everyone
The flag in your hand don't make you American
Stripping your soul back, be forever young, forever young
Forever young

Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us
Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us

Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us
Forgiveness makes fools
Of all of us2Embed
