The Law Lyrics
What's that accent? Where are you from?
What are you drinking? How'd I get some?
Sinking my teeth into something new
Doing what my maker taught me to

Don't let it get heavy
You are the law
Don't let it get heavy
You are the law
Why won't you come get me?
You are the law

I'm wired in, I'm ten feet tall
Tell me my failing, take my call
Sinking my teeth into someone new
Be my angel, just look at you

Don't let it get heavy
You are the law
Don't let it get heavy
You are the law
Why don't you regret it?
You are the law
The law, the law
The law, the law2Embed
