Alternative: Oh My World Lyrics
Slow your head, turn it off
Fireworks are keeping you from sleep
You're the whole world spinning, magnetized
Just turn it off and find a way to dream

Come and see me in your slumber
If you wake, I'll pull you under
Share a dream
And put the world far away
In the moment life spills over
And the nights blur into each other
Close your eyes
And let the fireworks play

When the wasters bark their blindness
And the pain eclipses kindness
Close the door and close your eyes
With me
Save the tears for when you're older
As the years weigh on your shoulders
As the fireworks play with the stars
Tonight
Slow your head, turn it off
Fireworks are keeping you from sleep
You're the whole world spinning, you're magnetized
Just turn it off and find a way to dream

Oh my world, oh my world, oh my world
Oh my world, oh my world, oh my world
Oh my world, oh my world

Oh my world (oh my world, oh my world, oh my world)
Oh my world (oh my world, oh my world, oh my world)
Oh my world (oh my world, oh my world)
Oh my worldEmbed
