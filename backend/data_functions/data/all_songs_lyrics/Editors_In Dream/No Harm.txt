No Harm Lyrics
I'll boil easier than you, crush my bones into glue
I'm a go-getter
The system's in red, the room is inbred
I'm a go-getter

Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, no harm

My children despise my wonderful lies
I'm a go-getter
I see through your walls and your space down your halls
I'm a go-getter

Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, no harm

The fever I feel, the fake and the real
I'm a go-getter
My world just expands, things just break in my hands
I'm a go-getter
Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm8Embed
