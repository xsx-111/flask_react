Ocean of Night Lyrics
Wasting on nothing
Effortlessly, you appear
Sound of the thunder
Reverberate in your ears
This is a slow dance
This is the chance to transform
Pause for the silence
Inhabit the calm of the storm

This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night

Love is a feeling
Buried with me in the yard
Gaze at the skyline
Under the ocean of stars
This is your slow dance
And this is your chance to transform
Lost to a moment
The moment you confront the storm
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
Uh uhh..

I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire
I am your hope down the wire
So you can hold back the fire

This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
Ocean of night
Ocean of night
Ocean of night
Ocean of night1Embed
