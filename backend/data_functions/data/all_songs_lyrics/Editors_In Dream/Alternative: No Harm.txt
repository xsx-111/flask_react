Alternative: No Harm Lyrics
I boil easier than you, crush my bones into glue
I'm a go-getter
The system's in red, the room is inbred
I'm a go-getter

My children are spies, my wonderful lies
I'm a go-getter

Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, no harm

The fever I feel, the fake and the real
I'm a go-getter
My world just expands, it's out of my hands
I'm a go-getter

Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, no harm

Don't harm, no harm
Don't harm, don't harmEmbed
