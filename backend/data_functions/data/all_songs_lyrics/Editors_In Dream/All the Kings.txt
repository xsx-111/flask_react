All the Kings Lyrics
Send me to Venus, send me to Mars
The crippling fear of colliding stars
Break from tradition, the first little taste
A gentle reminder, the tear on your face

But the beat of your heart
Is alone in the dark

The place where we met is haunted by thieves
Sifting through memories, from the foreign leaves
Oh, bank us your soul, now race with the clock
Immunity over, take a moment, then stop

But the beat of your heart
Is alone in the dark
The beat of your heart
The beat of your heart

Loneliness forever, loneliness forever
Holding back a river, holding back a river
All the kings are coming
Marching to the sound from your ribcage
So send me to Venus, send me to Mars
Seen all your failures, all your scars
Seen it all burn down, we dance to the sparks
We dance to the beating of your broken heart

Loneliness forever, loneliness forever
Holding back a river, holding back a river
All the kings are coming
Marching to the sound from your ribcage

Oh, let it all burn down
We built a house on the sun
Oh, let it all burn down
We didn't know what we'd done
Oh, let it all burn down
We built a house on the sun
Oh, let it all burn down
We didn't know what we'd done

Loneliness forever, loneliness forever
Holding back a river, holding back a river
All the kings are coming
Marching to the sound from your ribcage
Would you hold on?
Would you hold on?
All the kings are coming

But the beat of your heart
Is alone in the dark
Beat of your heart
Beat of your heart
Beat of your heart
Beat of your heart1Embed
