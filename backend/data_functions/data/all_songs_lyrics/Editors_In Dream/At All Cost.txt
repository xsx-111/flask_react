At All Cost Lyrics
Out of touch
And older than I look
I've got nothing to say
To my oldest friends
Warmth is in
The awkward silence
Carried on an anxious glance
Hold my hand, let's dance

Don't let it get lost
Don't let it get lost
At all cost
At all cost

When I'm cold
And all out of line
And all my doubts are dead
Take me back to bed

Don't let it get lost
Don't let it get lost
At all cost
At all cost
Don't let it get lost
Don't let it get lost
At all cost
At all cost

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oohEmbed
