Salvation Lyrics
The moon rising
Over the ugly moulage
Keep talking
Who you running from?
Tonight, we succumb
With the disappearing sun
Good fortune
Gets stuck in your teeth
Good-looking
You're a unicorn dancing in the flames
Anger in your veins

Son, you were made to suffer
Oh, but the morning comes
But when the light is failing
Temptation takes you to

Salvation
Swimming with the swarm of electric stars
Salvation
Deliverance is ours by the light of the stars

Move closer
Drink the morning air
Don't embrace
Taste of lemonade
Suffer, then be still
Wallow in regret
Son, you were made to suffer
Oh, but the morning comes
But when the light is failing
Temptation takes you to

Salvation
Swimming with the swarm of electric stars
Salvation
Deliverance is ours by the light of the stars
Salvation
Swimming with the swarm of electric stars

Son, you were made to suffer
Oh, but the morning comes
But when the light is failing
Temptation takes you to

Salvation
Who you running from?
Salvation
Who you running from?
Salvation
Swimming with the swarm of electric stars
Salvation
Deliverance is ours by the light of the stars
Salvation
(Salvation)
Salvation
Who you running from?
Salvation
Salvation
