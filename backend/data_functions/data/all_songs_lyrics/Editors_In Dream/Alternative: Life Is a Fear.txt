Alternative: Life Is a Fear Lyrics
Wait around here long enough, you'll see
Another junction, line up and lay down for me
You fall wonderfully
If I question everything you say
Another answer crumbles, the birth of my day
Is when you appear

You, calling out a name
You, swimming to me through a dream

Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks

Every siren often my lullaby
Every heartbeat functioning thrown to the night
I'm quenched in your light
And see the floor rising through a dream
Forgotten thoughts lost in a memorable theme
And soaked to the skin

You, calling out a name
You, swimming to me through a dream
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks

I wanted life to be that
I wanted life to be that
I wanted life to be that
I wanted life to be that

You, calling out a name, oh
You, swimming to me through a dream

Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracksEmbed
