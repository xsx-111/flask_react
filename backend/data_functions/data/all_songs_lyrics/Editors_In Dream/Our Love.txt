Our Love Lyrics
All eyes on you now
The cigarette burning, the taste of ash in your mouth
I understand, I understand
This ain't a dream, it's your world caving in (I always knew)
Your world caving in (I always knew)

Strange clouds I'm under
Waiting for nothing, now you've got no place to hide
Our love is a moment in time
I always knew you'd get the feeling that's right

Get a feeling that's right
Oh, get a feeling that's right
Jump in the city
To get a feeling that's right (I always knew)
(I always knew)
(I always, I always, I always knew)

Don't start believing
Jump in the city, hide the voices within
Our love is a moment in time
I always knew we'd get the feeling that's right
Get a feeling that's right
Oh, get a feeling that's right
Jump in the city
To get a feeling that's right

Ooh, street light illuminate feeling
Ooh, red sky, just don't start believing
Ooh, street light illuminate feeling
Ooh, red skies, just don't start believing
(I always knew)
(I always, I always, I always knew)

All eyes on you now
The cigarette burning, the taste of ash in your mouth
I understand, I understand
This ain't a dream, it's your world caving in

Don't start believing
Don't start believing
Don't start
Don't start
Don't start believing
Don't start believing
Don't start
Don't start
Don't start believing
Don't start believing
Don't start
Don't start
Don't start believing
Don't start believing
Don't start
Don't start
Don't start believing (I always knew)
Don't start believing (I always)
Don't start (I always)
Don't start (I always knew)
(I always knew)
Don't start believing (I always knew)
Don't start believing (I always)
Don't start
Don't start (I always knew)1Embed
