I Almost Lost My Mind LyricsWhen I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
My eyes was full of tears
Since she left me behind
I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet
I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet
My eyes are full of tears
Where can my baby be?
I went to see a gypsy to get my fortune read
I went to see a gypsy to have my fortune read
My head hung in sorrow
When she said what she said
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mindEmbed
