Laundromat Blues LyricsYou been meetin' your man, baby
Down at the local laundromat
I say, you been meetin' your man, baby
Down at the local laundromat
I've done got wise
An' daddy ain't goin' for that
Early every mornin'
You grab your old blouse or two
Yeah, you get up early in the mornin'
An' you grab your old blouse or two
Oh, you know you're right down to the laundry
While your man is waitin' on you
You better hear my warnin'
I'm gettin' madder everyday
Yeah, you better hear my warnin'
I'm gettin' madder everyday
I don't want you to get so clean, baby
You just might wash your life away
Ya hear?
Well, alright
I know you don't know it, baby
But things look bad for you
The laundry's gonna trap you, darlin'
An' one more, one more dress will doEmbed
