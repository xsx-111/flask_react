Kansas City LyricsI'm goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
I'm goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
They got some crazy lil women there an' I'm gonna get me one
I'll be standing on the corner, of 12th Street and Vine
I'll be standing on the corner, of 12th Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby an a bottle of Kansas City wine
Well I may take a plane, I may take a train
But If I have to walk, I'm going there just the same
I'm going to, Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
They got some crazy lil women there an' I'm gonna get me one
Hey!
Well I may take a plane, I may take a train
But If I have to walk, I'm going there just the same
I'm going to, Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
They got some crazy lil women there an' I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy lil women there an' I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy lil women there an' I'm gonna get me oneEmbed
