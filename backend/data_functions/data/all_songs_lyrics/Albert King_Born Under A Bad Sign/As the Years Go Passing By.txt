As the Years Go Passing By LyricsThere is nothing I can do, if you leave me, with a cry
There is nothing I can do, if you leave me, with a cry
Baby my love will follow you, as the years go passing by
I give you all but a home, that's one thing you get the night
I give you all but a home, that's one thing you get the night
You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing by
I'm gonna leave it up to you, so long, baby good bye
I'm gonna leave it up to you, so long, baby good bye
Baby my love will follow you, yes, as the years go passing by1Embed
