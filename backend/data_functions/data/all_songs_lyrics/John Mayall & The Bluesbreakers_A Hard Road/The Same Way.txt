The Same Way LyricsDon't want no evil woman make a fool out of me
My girl she's so sweet she's my honey bee
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way
Wake up in the morning get my breakfast in my bed
My girl she's so good love her till I'm dead
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way
Don't want no other woman I could never be satisfied
My girl looks so good standing by my side
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same wayEmbed
