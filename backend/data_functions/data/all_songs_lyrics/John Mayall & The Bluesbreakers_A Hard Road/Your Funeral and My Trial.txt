Your Funeral and My Trial LyricsPlease come home to your daddy and explain yourself to me
Because I and you are man and wife trying to start a family
I'm begin you baby cut out that off the wall jive
If you can't treat me no better it got to be your funeral and my trial
I love my baby got to see her when I can
I don't want my baby messing with another man
I'm begging you baby cut out that off the wall jive
You got to treat me better or it got to be your funeral and my trial
When I and you first got together it was on one friday night
We spent two lovely hours together and the world knows all right
I'm just begin you baby please cut out that off the wall jive
You know you got to treat me better if you don't it got to be your funeral and my trial
The good lord made the world and everything was in it
The way my baby love is some solid sentiment
She can love to heal the sick and she can love to raise the dead
You think I'm joking but you better believe what I say
I'm begging you baby cut out that off the wall jive
You got to treat me better or it got to be your funeral and my trialEmbed
