Evil Woman Blues LyricsTime's going to come you'll want me back someday
Time's going to come you'll want me want me back someday
But you are evil woman you don't mean me no good at anyway
You was blind to me baby I give you all I can
You was blind to me baby but still I give you all all I had
But you but you are evil woman I'm a strong man
You caused me so much trouble I don't want to see your face no more
You caused me so much trouble I don't want to see your your face no more
'cause you are the evil woman don't want you hanging around my doorEmbed
