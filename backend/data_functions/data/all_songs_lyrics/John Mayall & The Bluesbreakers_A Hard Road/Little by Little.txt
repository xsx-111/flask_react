Little by Little LyricsI followed you last night baby in my car
Afraid I might find what I was looking for
Little by little I'm losing you I can see
Bit by bit your love sneaks away from me
What you doing baby you know it ain't right
I wonder what you doing that it takes all night
Little by little I'm losing you I can see
Bit by bit your love is drifting away from me
You look so disgusted when I try to kiss you
I guess I don't thrill you like I used to do
Little by little I'm losing you I can see
Bit by bit your love is drifting away from me
I tried to tail you last sitting in my car
But I was scared that I would see what I was looking for
Little by little I'm losing you I can see
Bit by bit your love is drifting away from me
You stay out all night till the break of day
You stop up your ears to everything I say
Little by little I'm losing you I can see
Bit by bit your love is drifting away from meEmbed
