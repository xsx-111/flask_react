The Supernatural LyricsThese fits of depression are torturing me
The lives that I've seen won't breathe again
A sad child of madness, they'll never be free
Born again to die, the agonies begin
And soldiers keep coming, like warriors they die
But gangland's alive when mothers cry
'Cause hate's blind addictions, a killing machine
And it burns on the fuel of shattered lives
Lost child, lost child
The seeds of all evil are sown in their minds
And harvest the sad fields of woe
'Cause dead boys are martyrs that live on forever
But now it's too late for their souls
And standing on sanities too fragile edge
And worship the, 'Lord of the Flies'
And wade through the slaughter you've made of thy brother
And drown in his blood then when he dies
You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyes
You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyes
Don't turn out the lights 'cause there's demons in the night
And they prey on the fears in us all
They hide inside and wait and they shun the light of day
The screams in their dreams fill us all
Children of the night
Such a sad tune they rhyme
The bloody boys that sing a wicked song
And for all of them they're just memories in the wind
Rise and see
It's the dawn of insanity
Keeper of the gates of fire
And the Heretic has said
You don't have to be afraid
Till I, till I come to get ya
And child in time
On the swords edge you ride
And cast a spell of Heresy
And die in vain
Like a wild dog in chains
And no one can save or set you free
You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyes
You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyesEmbed
