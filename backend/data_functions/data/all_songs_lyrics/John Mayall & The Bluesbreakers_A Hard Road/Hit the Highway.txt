Hit the Highway LyricsI'm going to hit the highway travel all up and down
I'm going to hit the highway travel all up and down
When my feet start a moving they take me all down the town
It's eleven fifty seven by the clock on the shelf
It's eleven fifty seven by the clock on the shelf
By the time it comes to midnight I'll be long gone by myself
The night is full of maybe the hard gold is calling me
The night is full of maybe the hard gold is calling me
Take my blues of trouble going to let the highway freeEmbed
