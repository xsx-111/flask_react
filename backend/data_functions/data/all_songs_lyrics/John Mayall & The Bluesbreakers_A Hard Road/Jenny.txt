Jenny LyricsMy blues for jenny means she's not around
I wish my jenny could be homeward bound
I'd live through all my lonely confusions if I knew I see her again
I think of jenny as a memory
I wish my jenny could be here with me
I'd live through all my lonely confusions if I knew I see her again
I don't see jenny and the years pass by
May be that jenny got another guy
I'd live through all my lonely confusions if I knew I see her againEmbed
