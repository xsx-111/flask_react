Dust My Blues LyricsI'm gonna get up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my blues
Gonna get up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my blues
I gotta leave my baby, I ain't got no time to lose
I don't want no woman, that'll treat me wrong all the time
I don't want no woman, that'll treat me wrong all the time
Well I'm tired of the way she treats me, 'cause I'm about to lose my mind
I'm gonna write a letter, I better send her a telegram
I'm gonna write a letter, I better send her a telegram
She left me soon this morning, and she's got me in an awfull jam
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I believe, I believe my time ain't longEmbed
