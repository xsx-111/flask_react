So Many Roads LyricsSo many roads so many trains to ride
So many roads so many trains to ride
I've got to find my baby before I'll be satisfied
I was standing by my window when I heard that whistle blow
I was standing by my window when I heard that whistle blow
You know I thought it was a streamline but it was a b and o
It was a mean old fireman and a cruel old engineer
It was a mean old fireman and a cruel old engineer
That took away my baby and left me standing hereEmbed
