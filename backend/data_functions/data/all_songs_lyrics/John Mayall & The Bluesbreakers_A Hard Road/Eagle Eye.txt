Eagle Eye LyricsAin't going to be your fool ain't going to be your fool
Ain't going to be your fool ain't going to be your fool
You know i'm going to take it easy i got my eagle eye on you
Ain't going to be your dog ain't going to be your dog
Ain't going to be your dog ain't going to be your dog
You know you're going to take my word i got my eagle eye on you
Ain't going to be your owl ain't going to be your owl
Ain't going to be your owl ain't going to be your owl
You know if you treat me this was i got my eagle eye on you
Ain't going to be around babe the way you treat me
Can't speak about it ain't going to be your fool no moreEmbed
