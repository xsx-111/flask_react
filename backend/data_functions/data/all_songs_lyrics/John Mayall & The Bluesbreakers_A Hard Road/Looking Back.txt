Looking Back LyricsI saw her walking down the street
The little girl did look so sweet
I followed her for half a mile
I had to stop and talk a while
I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her
She had a yellow golden hair
I'm going to follow everywhere
She had a wiggle when she walk
I wanted her to stop and talk
You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her
She had a yellow golden hair
I'm going to follow everywhere
She had a wiggle when she walk
I wanted her to stop and talk
You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her
You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her
You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at herEmbed
