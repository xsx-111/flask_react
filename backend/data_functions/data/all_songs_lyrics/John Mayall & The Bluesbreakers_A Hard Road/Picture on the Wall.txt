Picture on the Wall LyricsI was looking through my pictures of days that's been and gone
I was looking through my pictures of days that's been and gone
Well I saw a man and woman you and me when we were one
We were night and day together first plane across the sea
We were night and day together first plane across the sea
Well I think of summer weather see a picture of you and me
At day the sun's a ball of fire couldn't even hold your hand
At day the sun's a ball of fire couldn't even hold your hand
But at night I hold your body to keep me warm in the cold cold sand
Well it's a sad old recollection since we saw that picture fade
Well it's a sad old recollection since we saw that picture fade
I upset you left you crying left you and I forgot on that plane
Every time I think of summer I see a picture on the wall
Every time I think of summer I see a picture on the wall
It will always be a reminder that you were my only one
It will always be a reminder that you were my only oneEmbed
