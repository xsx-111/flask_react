Out of Reach LyricsI'm so lonesome I don't even have a friend
I'm so lonesome I don't even have me no friend
I've done so much crying will I never laugh again?
People evil people don't hurt me so bad
My mind's been broken my heart feels so sad
Evil people well I can't even walk out of my door
I ain't different from nobody and I just can't take no more
I've got to leave where I'm going I don't know
I've got to leave where I'm going I just don't know
And I've had so much trouble I'm out of reach I can't take no moreEmbed
