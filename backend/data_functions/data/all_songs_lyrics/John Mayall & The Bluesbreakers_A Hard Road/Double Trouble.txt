Double Trouble LyricsLay awake at night
Oh so low I've been troubled
Can't keep a job
I'm layed off and havin double trouble
Hey, Hey, you can make it if you try
Baby, That's no lie
Livin' in generations of millionaries
Hard for me to keep decent clothes to wear
Laugh at me walkin'
I have no where to go
Bad luck and trouble has taken me
Got no money to show
Hey, Hey, They say you can make it if you try
Generations of millionaries
Hard for me to keep decent clothes to wearEmbed
