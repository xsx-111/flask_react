Top of the Hill LyricsYou won't hang around with other people you won't hold a job for many time
You won't talk to me about tomorrow you never left the city around the crime
But when i hear you say you'll be leaving every day you'll be coming on top of the hill
You've taken all the trouble where you're living you've taken all the live i had to give
You call around to say you will be dying i want to hear you say you want to live
But when I hear you say you'll be leaving every day you'll be coming on top of the hill
I've been trouble I've been blue I've been so worried all over you
I've been trouble I've been blue I've been so worried all over you
But when I hear you say you'll be leaving every day you'll be coming on top of the hill
No amount of talk is going to help you you've got to find a friend you really need
No use a being real evil you've got to settle down and take a weed
But when I hear you say you'll be leaving every day you'll be coming on top of the hill
I've been trouble I've been blue I've been so worried all over you
I've been trouble I've been blue I've been so worried all over you
But when i hear you say you'll be leaving every day you'll be coming on top of the hillEmbed
