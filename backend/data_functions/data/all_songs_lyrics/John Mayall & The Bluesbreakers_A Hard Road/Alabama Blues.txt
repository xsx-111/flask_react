Alabama Blues LyricsI never will go back to alabama that is not the place for me
I never will go back to alabama that is not the place for me
You know they killed my sister and my brother and the whole world let them peoples go down there free
I never will love alabama alabama seem to never have loved poor me
I never will love alabama alabama seem to never have loved poor me
Oh god I wish you would rise up one day lead my peoples to the land of pea
My brother was taken up for my mother and a police officer shot him down
My brother was taken up for my mother and a police officer shot him down
I can't help but to sit down and cry sometime think about how my poor brother lost his life
Alabama alabama why you want to be so mean?
Alabama alabama why you want to be so mean?
You got my people behind a barbwire fence now you trying to take my freedom away from meEmbed
