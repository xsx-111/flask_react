Missing You LyricsToo many times away from home
The days is lonely the night time gone
I'm missing you baby I'm missing you baby
I love you so good I need you so bad
I hate to leave you I got to go
Friend I don't have to leave you no more
I'm missing you baby I'm missing you baby
I love you so good I need you so bad
I'm going to send you a letter as soon as I can
To stop all your worrying to where I am
I'm missing you baby I'm missing you baby
I love you so good I need you so badEmbed
