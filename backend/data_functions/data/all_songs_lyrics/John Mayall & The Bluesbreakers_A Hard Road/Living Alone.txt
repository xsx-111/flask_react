Living Alone LyricsAll of the tears you've been shedding for me
So much sorrow it never should be
Never to find peace in my mind
I'm living alone with my blues
One of these days it won't be long
I'll wake up screaming and you will be gone
Never to find peace in my mind
I'm living alone with my blues
You left me awake the world is outside
You can cut me to pieces you'll be satisfied
Never to find peace in my mind
I'm living alone with my blues
All of the tears you've been shedding for me
So much sorrow it never should be
Never to find peace in my mind
I'm living alone with my bluesEmbed
