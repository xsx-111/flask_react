The Stumble LyricsDon't want no evil woman
Make a fool out of me
My girl, she's so sweet
She's my honey bee
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way
Wake up in the morning
Get my breakfast in my bed
My girl, she's so good
Love her till I'm dead
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way
Don't want no other woman
I could never be satisfied
My girl looks so good
Standing by my side
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same way about me
She feels the same wayEmbed
