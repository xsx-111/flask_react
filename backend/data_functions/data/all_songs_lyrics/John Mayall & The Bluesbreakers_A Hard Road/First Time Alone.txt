First Time Alone LyricsThere was nothing like that first time
I was alone with you
And the glow of your eyes told me love
Sweet perfume in your hair
There was nothing like the way
Time went by as we lay by the fire
And the burning logs flickered flames
That drew us close without a sound
First time I was alone with you
Your bed was so soft with your sweet whispering
Your fingers explore my burning skin
Gentle as a butterfly
No matter how many things we've known together
There will never be such a peace
Like that first time
I was alone with youEmbed
