Another Kinda Love LyricsPoor little baby you've got your lover she's a girl
Poor little baby you've got caught up in the world
I've got to say you lost your way
You're a woman another kind of woman another kind of love
You just pile on your misery now you have failed
But deep down inside yourself see if you can tell
Poor little baby you've got caught up in the world
I got to say you've lost your way
You're a woman another kind of woman another kind of love
I can show you a brand new world now you'll never be satisfied
When there's nowhere to run baby there's nowhere to hide
Poor little baby you've got caught up in the world
I've got to say you've lost your way
You're a woman another kind of woman another kind of loveEmbed
