Sitting in the Rain LyricsI'm sittin' out here in the rain baby
Under that old green tree
I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby
Under that old green tree
I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby
Wonderin' why you don't come back to me
I got a blister on my heel baby
Splinter run right thru my heart
I got a blister on my heel baby
Splinter run right thru my heart
And I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby
Wonderin' why you and me we had to part
I'm so sorry baby we're not allowed to be
Said I'm so sorry baby we're not allowed to be
I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby
Wonderin' why you don't come back to meEmbed
