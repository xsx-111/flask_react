Outlaw Blues Lyrics
Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some funny lagoon?
Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some muddy lagoon?
Especially when it's nine below zero
And three o'clock in the afternoon

Ain't gonna hang no picture
Ain't gonna hang no picture frame
Ain't gonna hang no picture
Or hang no picture frame
Well, I might look like Robert Ford
But I feel just like a'Jesse James

And I wish I was
On some Australian mountain range
Oh, I wish I was
On some Australian mountain range
I got no reason to be there, but I
Imagine it would be some kinda change

I got my dark sunglasses
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses
I'm carrying my good luck, my black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'
I just might tell you the truth
I got a woman in Jackson
Oh, I ain't gonna say her name
I got a woman in Jackson
I ain't gonna say her name
She's a brown-skin woman
But I love her just the sameEmbed
