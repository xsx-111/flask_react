Loose Cannons LyricsIt's only so long that you can stare at the stars
Until they become a black spot with white dots
And it would be heartbreaking
To imagine you and me as two prematurely retired loose cannons. Take it off you conscience
Did you honestly think that you could be satisfied
To open the door and never step inside
It's in allegiance to your young wisdom
That I am taking our lives and tearing them apart
I do hope when you can't rest wistful for an arm around your chest that you realize with every kiss your lips were half of itEmbed
