If It Kills Me LyricsMy bed won't be on fire
I will sleep like a baby
My head won't be restless
It'd be nice to get off my feet
I know I will be resting in peace if it kills me
If I was stranded on a desert island and could only take three things with me I know what they would be
Mostly though I'd be looking forward to the view
I don't care if it's not healthy
I don't care if it kills meEmbed
