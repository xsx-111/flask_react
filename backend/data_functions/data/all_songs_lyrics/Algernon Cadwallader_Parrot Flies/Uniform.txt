Uniform LyricsLick the windows you are shopping through
Try to lick your way through the glass
Inside you could be a mannequin
Get dressed up and stand around
Cool shirt
Cool shoes
Short tie
Short hair
Uniform
Dressed to kill and I'm sure you will
Gonna put you out of business in a heartbeat
The day that you're found out for being a statue and put it to use
I've seen enough store fronts in the city to believe it's sinkingEmbed
