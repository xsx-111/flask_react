Sad LyricsSmoke and mirrors are good for barbecues and vanity
But interfere with what you are trying to tell me
Call it what it really is
Call it target practice
And I feel like a punching bag tonight
Talk out loud
Use words that people understand
Everything else is written in sand
And I know it will blow over
I wish it would have ended
I wish it would have ended
I wish it would have ended
Without being so long-winded
Call it target practice
Call it target practice
Call it what it isEmbed
