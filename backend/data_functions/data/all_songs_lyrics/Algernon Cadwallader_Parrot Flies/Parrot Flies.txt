Parrot Flies LyricsSo quick to cry
Give it all up, toss it aside
Sure, it will deteriorate eventually
Out of your mind but you're left no better
Why not build it into a mountain you can climb?
Take your bags and dump them on the floor
Now do it some more
Quickly you will see that your arms won't be so tired and you'll have all the making of a fort
Conflicts need resolutions
They are a catalyst and I'm collecting lemons
A parrot flies a thousand miles only to find he's gone the wrong direction
He thinks if this is where I am, then this I is where I belongEmbed
