Chewed Up And Spit Out (In A Bowl) LyricsI wrote a book about living in paradise
And how living in paradise isn't what it's like in books
You can't hold attentions with pretty sunsets and white sand
Computer desktops crop out the gritty lives of the Kiribati
But that's what it's like living in paradise
So what do you do when you're down and out on an island the size of a nipple?
