Springing Leaks LyricsI'm not hugging you no more
Because you hug back like a cactus
Out come rosy-red cheeks like springing leaks
So, shuffle, sway, pick up things and look underneath them
So, shuffle, sway, pick up things and look underneath them
So, shuffle, sway, pick up things and look underneath them
So, shuffle, sway, pick up things and look underneath them
Trail off and disappear
Kids grow up and they all have one
Suburban folk-lore. Legend of failure
A diamond in the rough polished up to be an immaculate piece of shit
I hope you make itEmbed
