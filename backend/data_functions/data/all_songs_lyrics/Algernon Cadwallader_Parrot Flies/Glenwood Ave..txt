Glenwood Ave. LyricsSouthern Illinois Street
Canopied sycamore trees
Wears its age on its sleeve
Neighborhood kids duck next to front porches and crack eggs
Orange juice and sugar mixed with sticks on a bed of dead leaves and dirt
Making secrets and having feelings before feelings hurt
We're in the backyard
The temperature has plummeted
We were crushed up and grounded with a little bit of sugar
And I packed the bed and headed for the corner
Past the kids and the porches
That's where I lost my buddy, and buried my buddy
I get crushed up and groundedEmbed
