Pitfall LyricsPitiful
You fall into the alligator pit
Following something that is not beating in your chest
You have insulted all the mouths salivating at your slip
Exercise your wrists
Exercise your grip
Exercise common sense
You will cut yourself with your own knife
Have yourself make a face that you like
So you resemble yourself in the knife
Have yourself make a face that you like
So you can recognize yourself in the reflection of the knife1Embed
