Nothing at All LyricsNow she sits by the riverside
Watching the waters glide by
With a sigh
And the things she put faith in
Are ripples just waving her by
With a sigh
She sees lovers pass by with much more than a kiss
Ah, this is a girl who had everything
Finds she's nothing at all
Now the wind seems so cold
Seems so old as it laughs at her fears
And her tears
And as ducks swim away from her
Visions of past love appear
In her tears
She sees love in his face as she tells him to go
And so here's a girl who had everything
Finds she's nothing at all
What would she say if she saw him, yeah
Now that she's gone, man, you're losing, yeah-heh
Now you can see what she's seeing, yeah-heh
For sure she's more than just choosing, yeah
You're losing, man, yeah
Oh baby, whoo, yeah, baby
Oh-whoo, yeah, man you're losing
Alright, eh-yeah, alright
Now she sits by the riverside
Watching the waters glide by
With a sigh
And the things she put faith in
Are ripples just waving her by
With a sigh
She sees lovers pass by with much more than a kiss
Ah, this is a girl who had everything
Finds she's nothing at allEmbed
