Why Not? LyricsDon't sing a tune to yourself
You might believe this one
Try not to sew it yourself
The threading won't stretch none
Don't give me none of that line
Why not?
Got to sing something
Love's song there's nothing to find
Why not?
Dead before playing
Don't sing a tune to yourself
You might believe this one
Try not to sew it yourself
The threading won't stretch none
Who says the things that go in
The song is only saying
Dead thought can kill a good thing
The band is only playing
Don't give me none of that line
Why not?
Got to sing something
Love's song there's nothing to find
Why not?
Dead before playing
Why not climb a hill
With someone who hates you?
Why not hate someone
Who climbs a hill with you?
And as time passes by
Your feet start slipping
And you are wondering why
There is no forgetting
Don't sing a tune to yourself
You might believe this one
Try not to sew it yourself
The threading don't stretch none
Who says the things that go in
The song is only saying
Dead thought can kill a good thing
The band is only playing
Don't give me none of that line
Why not?
Got to sing something
Love's song there's nothing to find
Why not?
Dead before playing
Dead before playingEmbed
