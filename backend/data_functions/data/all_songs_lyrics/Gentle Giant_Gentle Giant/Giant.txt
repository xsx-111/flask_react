Giant LyricsThe birth of a realisation
The rise of a high expectation
Together successful, defiant, yeah
Together the parts make a giant
See the world in the palm of his hand
Striding steps that will cover the land
He is coming, hear him coming
Are you ready for his being?
Hear the giant
Feel the giant
Touch the giant
See the giant
Together successful, defiant, yeah
Together the parts make a giant
Yeah
The birth of a realisation
The rise of a high expectationEmbed
