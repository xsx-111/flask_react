Funny Ways LyricsSorry to have been so much of a bore
But in my own funny ways I find I learn much more
I realise what you think from your eyes
But in your own funny ways I find I learn much more
My ways are strange
They'll never change
They stay strange ways
Sorry to be so close from the start
But for all that I care we could be miles apart
I understood that you never would
Understand a way of life I never could
My ways are strange
They'll never change
They stay strange ways
Go your own way or wait for me
Go your own way or wait for me
Go your own way or wait for me
Go your own way or wait for me
And so you see what happened to me
Since the time when I judged my life in nights and days
I realised that my life was lies
So you see what I mean with all my funny ways
Sorry to have been so much of a bore
But in my own funny ways I find I learn much more
Funny ways
Funny ways
Funny ways
