Bird of Prey Lyrics
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah!

I can see that look that says beware
Try to move in closer if you dare
So I must sit and play my waiting game
And for a while I know she'll do the same
Fly away

Watches like an eagle from its tree
Then like a bird of prey she captures me
But I am older and more wise than you
Bird of prey straight into me you flew
Fly away!

Now every time
I try to set her free, yeah, oh
I'm glad to say
She comes right back to me, ah
But if I knew
She didn't want to stay, yeah, oh-ah
I wouldn't try to keep
That lovely bird of prey, yeah
Oh-ah, oh-ahEmbed
