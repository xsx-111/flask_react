Here Am I Lyrics
I sit in my sunny chair
With my head held low
I know the reason i'm dreaming
It's really been fun
But where is there left to go
Save to give my life a new meaning

And if by chance
You'd come my way
I'll have to say

Here am I, give me love
Here am I, give me love

How was I to know
Your heart wasn't satisfied
When you never troubled to tell me
No wish that you made to me
Ever was denied
I played it just the way
That it should be
But then you turned
And walked away
I have to say

Here am I, give me love
Here am I, give me love

Here am I, give me love

I imagine I must sit here
Till the winter comes
And just watch the days
Growing shorter
The gathering dust won't go
Till my thinking's done
And I walk from this troubled water

By then my need won't be so bad
And I'll gladly say

Here am I, give me love
Here am I, give me love
LoveEmbed
