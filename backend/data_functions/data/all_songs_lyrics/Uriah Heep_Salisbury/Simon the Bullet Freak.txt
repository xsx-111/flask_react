Simon the Bullet Freak Lyrics
Greater than to face it
Give me your money
Make my life sunny for a day
Road that leads to nowhere
Please stop your crying
I ain't fit for dying this way

Go steal another with your eye
Go try some other heartless lie

Now I have hope of speaking
Bring back the moon
Don't play your silly games with me
Oh, what a waste of daydream
What is your need?
I'm gonna plead until you help me

You've lost all sign of your direction
You're only looking for the next one
The next one to kill

Ashes of destruction spread out so far
Blackened nurses crying over me
See a one-time city, now just a scar
Tears of the flower man fill the sea
Give me a chance to fly away
There's nothing here for me today
Today

Simon the bullet freak
Simon the bullet freak
Simon the bullet freak
Simon the bullet freak
Simon the bullet freak
Simon the bullet freak
