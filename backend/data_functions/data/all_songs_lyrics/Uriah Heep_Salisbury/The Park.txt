The Park Lyrics
Let me walk a while alone
Among the sacred rocks and stones
Let me look in vain belief
Upon the beauty of each leaf

Here is green in every glade
The tree tops lean providing shade
Maypoles spin in happy sound
All nature's strength around

And there's a horse that feels no pain
It's iron strength to take the strain
Children rock it to and fro
And gaily drink its color glow

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

Above the sky, devoid of cloud
Thinks not to cast a thunder shroud
Upon this place so full of joy
A field of gold of love's employ
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

So why my heavy heart you say?
When tears would stain the sights so gay
My brother's dreams once here did soar
Until he died at the hand of needless war

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohEmbed
