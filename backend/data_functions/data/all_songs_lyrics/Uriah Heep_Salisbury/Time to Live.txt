Time to Live Lyrics
Let me see the sunshine
Let me feel the rain
Let me go where I wanna go
Well I wanna smell the flowers
See the dawn again
Find those friends I used to know
Find those friends I used to know

Well I spent twenty long years
In a dirty old prison cell
I never saw the light of day
If you could understand
Oh, that kind of living hell
That's the price I have to pay, oh yeah
That's the price I have to pay
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh

They said I killed a man
But I never told them why
So you can guess what I've been through
So for twenty long years
I've been thinkin' of that other guy
And what I saw him do to you
What I saw him do to you
Listen here
So when tomorrow comes
And I walk outside that door
Try to understand the strain
But if you smile that smile
I know I couldn't ask for more
I know I'd do it all again, yes I will
I know I'd do it all again

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Do it all again
Do it all againEmbed
