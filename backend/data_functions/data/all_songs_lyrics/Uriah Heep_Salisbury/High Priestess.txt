High Priestess Lyrics
You, who brought
The sunshine to my eyes
You, who wondered
Through my sad disguise
And I have a love that cannot die
For you

High priestess of my heart
Tell me that we won't part

Then let's get together in the sky
Leave the lonely world to wonder why
For we have a love they can't deny
So true

High priestess of my heart
Tell me that we won't partEmbed
