Salisbury Lyrics
Somewhere in your eyes
That very special glow
Something drawing me
To where I do not know
I never really thought
That I would lose myself
Now I'm going faster than anybody else
You move without a sound
And touch me with your hand
Just like the rain that fondles
Every grain of sand
This thing we're gonna do
It's just for you and me
I'm gonna make it good, good as it can be
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Your kiss is sweeter now
Your breath is getting warm
We must take our time
And last it through 'til dawn
I wonder will it be oh, I expect it to
There have been other girls
No one else like you
I feel a power here I never felt before
And I begin to see
What draws us to want more
Oh girl of all my dreams
Please tell me if I'm wrong
Because I've been blue, but we belong
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
As time passed and all too fast
I just knew we couldn't last
And I guessed that the end
Was near at hand, oh yeah
Though we tried our love inside
It just crumpled up and died
What went wrong I will never
Never understand, you tell me why

Alone again, how could you leave me?
Alone again, I don't wanna be
Alone again, yeah

There's a line in a rhyme
I was going to send to you
It says, "All that is to be will surely be"
So oh, though you had to go
Cause you needed someone new
Is there still a chance
That you'll come back to me?
I want you back, you see

Alone again, how could you leave me?
Alone again, I don't wanna be
Alone again, yeah
Somewhere in your eyes
That very special glow
Something drawing me
To where I do not know
I never really thought
That I would lose myself
Now I'm going faster than anybody else
You moved without a sound
And touched me with your hand
Just like the rains that fondle
Every little grain of sand
This thing we're gonna do
It's just for you and me
And I'm gonna make it good
Just you wait and see
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh1Embed
