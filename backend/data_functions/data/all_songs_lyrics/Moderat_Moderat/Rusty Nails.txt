Rusty Nails LyricsIn broken speech
You tricked me on shaky ground
Don't tell me...
It feels like
Walking on rusty nails
But the pain's not mine
Where we collide
Down is the only way out
Cause hell's above
I've tried to
Focus on anything
But the strain inside
Some words rush
Oh like jets in the sky
Don't stay long
Just passing by
But you talked it away
You talked it awayEmbed
