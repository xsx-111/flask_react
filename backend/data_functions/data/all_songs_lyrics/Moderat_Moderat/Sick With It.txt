Sick With It Lyrics
Come and see my perfect mediacenter
All my money, all my time I've spent on it
All specialized, all reinvented
State of the art to enter the internet
I can hear my demons howling
Into the cyberspace they're calling
Login the pass
Pandora's box is open

My head, my feet, my brain
Driving me insane
My blood, my lungs, my veins
Are burning up in flames

It makes you feel like ice cold winter
In this labyrinth of filth and sin
Some things are sweet and some even sweeter
Link by link the ice is getting thin
On my deadly journey right to the center
This dragging twister taking me under
I'm willing to survive, can't surrender
To the call of this phony splender
My head, my feet, my brain
Driving me insane
My blood, my lungs, my veins
Are burning up in flames

My head, my feet , my brain
Driving me insane
My blood, my lungs, my veins
Are burning up in flames
Call from a distance
Voices of bliss
Voice from a distance
Calling my name
Mi na go (Wouldn't) enter this
Mi na go enter disya flamesEmbed
