Yeah
Hey
My model display grits
I grovel for pancakes
I've boggled for ages
Your novel's on paychecks
I squabble ---
To topple the A-list
Fuck music to death
Then I bottle the fragrance
They swallow the cake mix
From Chicago to Cambridge
Do I follow the ---?
No, ---
The irresponsible ---
I'm a hospital patient
Not a nautical bayfish
You should follow the ancients
All this rapper toy shit
Turn to asteroid bits
Collecting unemployment
Because I've been anointed
For the wrong figures
I shot horse whisperers
That endorse ---
More sorcerers
I'm a pragmatist
When I search for slurs

Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick

Guess what the drift by the beast-worn, be warned, D. Horne triceratops
Porch monkey, Bugs Bunny, unfunny like Carrot Top
On one, spawned from fashion-forward ---
Fast forward --- DJ shit
Straight from the ---
Under the Disney tarp --- zebra's point
Sculpt a bug, double dutch, into the reader's choice
Consume my singing voice and eat a dick
My button eyes customize very own alphabet
--- thunder thighs ---
Comprise my new free jazz albums yet

Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Uh, my head hurt
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Beats way sick
Do whatever I say
Every night and day
Blood diamond ice tray
Give it back right away

Y'all need a tool yard
--- a cleanse
I'll bet they juice far
My niggas too hard

Quick switch to plan B

We don't let you eat
Then shit in the pantry
