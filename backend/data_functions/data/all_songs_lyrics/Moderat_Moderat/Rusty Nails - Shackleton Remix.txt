Rusty Nails - Shackleton Remix LyricsUnbroken speech
You tricked me on shaky ground
Don't tell me
How it feels like walking on rusty nails
But the pain's not mine
When we collide down is the only way out
'Cause﻿ hell's above
I try to focus on anything
But the strain inside
So words rise while I touch the sky
Won't stay long
Just passing by
But you talked it away
You talked ït away ...Embed
