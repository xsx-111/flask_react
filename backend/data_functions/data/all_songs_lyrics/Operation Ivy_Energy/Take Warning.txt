Take Warning LyricsListen up!
Oh, take warning, take warning
Really gotta take warning
Stand by your friends
Wrong or right
Can't call that justice
If it's just a stupid excuse to fight
Single out and attack
Ones who got no defense
You call that a new way of thinking
I call it regression to ignorance
Take warning, take warning
Take warning, take warning
New generation coming, and we really gotta stand up to them
Take warning, take warning
No one's got a thing against you
Unless you've got something to prove
We don't need no new set of standards
We don't need a new set of rules, man
Heard all that shit before about stomping out any difference
We say stand together
Not to fight, just to exist
Take warning, take warning
Take warning, take warning
Intimidation coming, and we really gotta say no to them
Take warning, take warning
Enough is enough is enough
Why don't you just ease up?
I saw another beat down last night
Take warning
Who's the next to hit the ground tonight?
Take warning
Take warning
Take warning, take warning
Take warning, take warning
Intimidation coming, and we really gotta say no to them
Take warning, take warningEmbed
