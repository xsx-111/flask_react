Caution LyricsCaution is a word that I can't understand
Caution is a word that I can't understand
C-A-U-T-I-O-N is a word I could not understand
Walked the dog with a real short leash
Turned around, saw the dog walk me
Stainless steel and painted glass
Give me a pulse like a hammer and a mind to match
No relief, no food, no sleep
When you're king for a day, you're a whore for a week
(All right)
Caution is a word that I can't understand
Ah, caution is a word that I can't understand
C-A-U-T-I-O-N is a word I could not understand
Walked the dog with a real short leash
Turned around, saw the dog walk me
Stainless steel and painted glass
Give me a pulse like a hammer and a mind to match
No relief, no food, no sleep
When you're king for a day, you're a whore for a week
(Yeah)
Caution is a word that I can't understand
Caution is a word that I can't understand
I didn't get it then
I think I got it now
Caution, my friend
Don't step in the water 'til you know you can swim
Caution is a word that I can't understand
Caution is a word that I can't understand
(Yeah, caution)
Can't understand
(Yeah, caution)
Can't understandEmbed
