Knowledge LyricsI know things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off the bottom of the barrel
Wide open road of my future now
It's looking fucking narrow
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
We get told to decide
Just like, as if, I'm not gonna change my mind
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
What'cha gonna do with yourself?
Boy, better make up your mind
What'cha gonna do with yourself, boy?
You're running out of time
This time I got it all figured out
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't, don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
And that's fine1Embed
