One Of These Days LyricsThese boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days, these boots are going to walk over you
Walk all over you
These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days, these boots are going to walk over you
Walk all over you
(All right, get out the way)
(Yeah)
Walk all over you
Walk all over you
Walk all over you
Walk all over you
Walk all over you
Walk all over you
Walk all over you
Walk all over you
(Yeah)Embed
