Tell It Like It T-I-Is LyricsDoin' it right, day and night
Doin' it right, day and night
Doin' it right, day and night
Yeah, tell it, tell it, tell it like it T-I-is
I gotta feel it
You gotta move it
You gotta move it, move it, move it
To the deep, deep rhythm
Tell it, tell it, tell it like it T-I-is
Seems like things are gettin' so bad
That you can smell it
Yeah, so open those eyes
And get the real picture
It's time to tell it
I wanna talk, baby
I wanna say something
I've got to tell it like it
T-IE-IE-IE-I is
Tell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-isTell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-is
Tell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-is
Tell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-is
Whoahh!
Tell it, tell it
I've got to tell it
I want to tell it-whoo!
You got me talkin'
I wanna say something
Got me talkin'
I wanna say somethin'-yeah!
If you're looking for a moving sidewalk
Dreamin' 'bout a monorail to take you away
Well, the day is now
And her's the biz-
You better get the real picture
Tell it like it T-I-is
I'm spinnin' to the rhythm of the earth
And the ocean
See the situation
Oh what a sight
I wanna talk, baby
I wanna say somethng
I've got to tell it like it is
T-IE-IE-IE-is
Like it T-I-is
Tell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-isTell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-is
Tell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-is
Tell it, tell it, tell it, like it T-I-is
Like it T-I-is
Whoahh!
Ooh, don't upset
The balance of your nature
Make the jump when the coast is clear
Ooh, don't upset
The balance of your nature
Reach the level above your fears
Can you feel the movement
Hear the untamed melody
Tell it like it is and was and
Always should be-yeah!
Like it is and was, and always should be
Is and was, and always should be
Is and was, and always should be
Is and was, and always should be
Tell it, tell it
I've got to tell
I wanna tell it-whoo!
You got me talkin'
I wanna say something'
Got me talkin'
I wanna say somethin'
Tell it Tell it Tell it Tell it
