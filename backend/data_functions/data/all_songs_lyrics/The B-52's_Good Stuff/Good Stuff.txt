Good Stuff LyricsBrrrr!
All right
Bum bum-Bum bum
Ooo baby!
What?
How about givin' me some of that good stuff
Well...
Here it 'tis
Here it 'tis
Here it 'tis
Here it 'tis
Are you lookin' for it?
Are you lookin' for it?
You'll hear it from me
Good stuff baby
Do you want it?
Do you know how to get it?
That good stuff baby
Good good stuff
I got sincerity that's bonifide
And a heart so fine it's certified
So let your good stuff rain down on me
Your dang good stuff that's true and tried
Are you lookin' for it?
Are you lookin' for it?
You'll hear it from me
Good stuff baby
Do you want it?
Do you know how to get it?
That good stuff baby
Good good stuff
What's the use of gettin' if you ain't sharin'
My eyes are strainin' from all the starin'
You've become my magnificent obsession
So how's about joinin' my lovin' session?
Are you ready? I'm ready
Are you ready? Uh yeah
Are you ready for this? I guess so
Come on baby
Say whoa!
Take me down where the love honey flows
Kiss you nice, nibble your toes
Take me down where the good stuff grows
Love you nice, tickle your nose
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
The big dipper sure ain't big enough
To hold all of your dang good stuff
So let the people say we're down right nasty
I just say we're down right
That good stuff that I am seekin'
It's got me peakin' and it's got me freakin'
Watch my lips I am speakin'
It's got me trickin' and it's got me treatin'!
I got sincerity that's bonifide
So come on now and let your good stuff rain down on me
(Take me down)
I want the stuff
(Take me up)
That's tried and true
Take me to the place they have the good stuff
Yeah
Take me down where the love honey flows
Kiss you nice, nibble your toes
Take me down where the good stuff grows
Love you nice, tickle your nose
Take me down where the love honey flows Kiss you nice, nibble your toes
Take me down where the good stuff grows
Love you nice, tickle your nose
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
Good stuff, gimmie some of that good stuff
Don't leave me hangin'
I wanna be dangin'
