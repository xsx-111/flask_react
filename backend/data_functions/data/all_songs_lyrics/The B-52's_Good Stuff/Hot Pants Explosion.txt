Hot Pants Explosion LyricsYou know what I say to your hot pants?
Say what?
Say get on down, ah ha ha...
I'm in shippin', if you're receivin'
'Cause what I see I ain't believin'
The longest legs in the shortest pants
You got me doin' a matin' dance
Pant pant
You got me pantin' like a dog
Pant pant
Ooo I'm a hot pants hot dog
You burned a hole in my mind
When I saw your cute behind
Wearin' those hot pants
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Sizzlin' hot hot pants
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Sap's up spring's on the rise
I'm bustin' out my tube top tonight
Workin' the night shift, I get off at three
Breakin' out of that factory
Thunder thighs-hangn' out!
Moon beams, dancin' about
If you would be so kind
Put on those red hot pants and take a stroll through my mind
Hot pants, hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Sizzlin' hot hot pants
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Hot pants explosion
At the factory
Baby it's so sweet how you got me chokin'
Chokin' on the sizzle you deliver in that outfit so smokin'
Hot pants flare up
Ooo scintillatin' sizzlin' steamin'
Honey those hot pants got me screamin'
Supercalifragiwhata outfit you got on
Super vixen ooo foxy
Studball hunky baby rock me
Supercalihalitosis ooo that outfit's the absolute mostest
Ooo I've seen London and I seen France
But I never saw nothin' so hot as you in your hot pants
Sizzlin' hot hot pant
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Scorchin' hot pants
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Burnin' hot hot pants
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Steamin' hot hot pants
Hot hot hot hot pants, hot pants
Who says hot pants are dead and gone
Wait'll they see what you've got on
Yeah, I never saw nothn' so doggone hot
You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not
Here a hot, there a hot
Hot pants on a cute little butt yeah
I see the Army the Waves and the Wacs yeah
Marchin' down the railroad tracks in hot pants
Hot pants stretchin' tight
Yeah hot pants clingin' right
Hot pants, they're gettin' so hot
We might have to take 'em offEmbed
