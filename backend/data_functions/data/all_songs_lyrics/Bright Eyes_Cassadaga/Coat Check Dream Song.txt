Coat Check Dream Song LyricsShrill as a choir of children
Urgent like the first day of May
False and inflatable feeling
Tugs at my senses, big as the Macy's Parade
One brick on top of another
Such is the measure of man
Planets are inset like diamonds
On a gravity halo, eternity's wedding band
I slept with that dealer all summer
The ecstasy's still in my spine
Coat check I couldn't remember
Walked into the winter, came out on the other side
And in the south the sun is shining
Back in the east the lights went out
Stuck on a ladder to heaven
On trial way back in the Hague
Lullaby sounds from the engine
In my Styrofoam coffin, asleep on the interstate
Black globes, old symbols of freedom
A murderer still on the lam
Cities encircled in iron
On a great silver beltway, democracy's shackled hands
SÃ©ance that brought us together
Objects we move with our minds
Coat check and I lost the number
Short sleeves in the winter, fell back through the other side
Out in the west the cars are crashing
Up in the north the ice gave out
Saada Tekmel be 'Lhouria
HouriaEmbed
