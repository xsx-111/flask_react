Hot Knives LyricsThe wife forgave the mistress
For she only entertained
The pain was gone the instant
She cleared her throat to speak her name
Said, "Both of us must suffer from the same unending ache"
The world was not of interest
Though her days were never dull
Her bed beneath a crucifix
On guests performing miracles
With the Son of God just hanging like a common criminal
"When I do wrong, I am with God,"
She thought
"When I feel lost, I am not
At all"
So give me black light, so give me hot knives
On a dance floor, no one tells time
Oh, I've made love, yeah, I've been fucked, so what?
I'm a cartoon, you're a full moon, let's stay up
She went to see a mystic
Who made medicine from rain
And gave up her existence
To feel everything, dream others' dreams
Bid farewell to her family with one ecstatic wave
Out the window
As the car rolled away
She just vanished
Into a thick mist of change
So let us rejoice
In all this pink noise
An oscillation
That we can pinpointEmbed
