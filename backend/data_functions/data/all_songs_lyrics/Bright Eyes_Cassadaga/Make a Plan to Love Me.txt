Make a Plan to Love Me LyricsI heard you're scheming new pyramids
Another big idea to get you rich
Make a plan to love me sometime soon
You said you got a foot in the door
You buy and you sell, you buy some more
Make a plan to love me sometime soon
Life is too short, death doesn't ask
It don't owe you that
Some things you lose you don't get back
So just know what you have
And make a plan to love me sometime soon
First you want to ride off into the sun
Then you want to shoot straight to the moon
Make a plan to love me sometime soon
When you're young the world's a ferris wheel
I know we will grow old, it is lovely still
Make a plan to love me sometime soon
Life is too short to be a fool
I don't owe you that
Do what you feel, whatever's cool
But I just have to ask
Will you make a plan to love me?
Will you make a plan to love me?
Will you make a plan to love me sometime soon?Embed
