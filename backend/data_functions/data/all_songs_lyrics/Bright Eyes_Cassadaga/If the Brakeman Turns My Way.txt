If the Brakeman Turns My Way LyricsWhen panic grips your body and your heart's a hummingbird
Raven thoughts blacken your mind until you're breathing in reverse
All your friends and sedatives mean well but make it worse
Every reassurance just magnifies the doubt
Better find yourself a place to level out
Got a cricket for a conscience, always looks the other way
A cocaine soul starts seeming like an empty cabaret
Hey where have all the dancers gone now that music doesn't play?
Tried to listen to the river but you couldn't shut your mouth
Better take a little time to level out
I never thought of running
My feet just led the way
Mixed up signals, bullet trains
Cars are switched out in the crazy rain
I could meet you any place
If the brakeman turns my way
All this automatic writing, I have tried to understand
From a psychedelic angel who was tugging on my hand
It's an infinite coincidence but it doesn't form a plan
So I'm headed for New England or the Paris of the south
Gonna find myself somewhere to level out
Are your brothels full, Oh Babylon, with merry middlemen?
Never peer out of their periscopes from those deep opium dens
All this death must need a counterweight, always someone born again
First a mother bathes her child, then the other way around
The scales always find a way to level out
I tried to pass for nothing
But my dreams gave me away
Mixed up signals, bullet trains
People snuffed out in the brutal rain
I could live to any age
If the brakeman turns my way
It's an old world it's hard to remember
Like a dime store mystery
I'm a repeat first time offender
Who has rewritten history
Mixed up tea leaves, phantom pain
Fuzzy logic in the crazy rain
Getting better every day
If the brakeman turns my way
Mixed up signals, bullet trains
Cars are switched out in the blinding rain
He'll be smiling as he seals my fate
When the brakeman turns my way1Embed
