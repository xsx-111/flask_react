Thing Lyrics
Back seat
Fidgeting
Stop that
Fidgeting

Are we gonna do this thing?
Sorry, I said do this thing
When we gonna do this thing, bitch?

Pull over, immediately
I think I'm gonna freak, nevermind

Are we gonna do this thing?
Sorry, I said do this thing
When we gonna do this thing, bitch?

Is that him?
Is that him?
This doesn't look right, oh oh
Let me watch from the side, nevermind
I'll waiting on the sideline
I see you running on the hill
Won'tcha
I'll be running on the sideline
I see you running on the hillEmbed
