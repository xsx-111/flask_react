Fool LyricsI made your dress
I laid it out
On the couch you bought
That I picked out
I titter and coo
Like a cartoon
I congratulate you
Then I leave the room

I made your dress
I'm bleeding out
On the couch you bought
That I picked out
I do a little move
To a giggling flute
I preen and I plume
Like a buffoon1Embed
