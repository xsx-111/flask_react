My Body LyricsI go hungry
Pick at the shell
Paw the bottom
Of the well
I wear my body
I go bottom
Struggle for air
I go humming
'Like a prayer'
I wear my body
I wear my body like a rotted peach
You can have it if you handle the stink
I'm as open as a gutted pig
On the small of every pack
You'll see a picture of me
Wearing my body
I go guzzle
Scrap from the bin
Take it all
On the chin
I wear my body4Embed
