Grid Lyrics
I know you worry
Baby, sometimes - maybe baby
You were right
I know you worry
Baby, sometimes - maybe baby
You were right
I can see
See for miles
The same old line
The same old line
The same old line
The same old line

There is no angel
Above the grid
Maybe baby
This is it
A diamond
Swallowed and shit
Then swallowed again
Then swallowed again
Then swallowed again
Then swallowed again
The grid keeps calling, it's all in my head
The grid keeps calling, it's all in my head
The grid keeps calling, it's all in my head
The grid keeps calling, it's all in my head
The grid keeps calling, it's all in my head

At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been
At least we know
Where it's been1Embed
