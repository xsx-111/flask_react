No Good LyricsThere's no gentle way
There's no safe place
For the heart to hang
When the body's no good
Am I meant to fray the edge?
On the outside looking in
All used up
But never used enough
To me love was always a hidden thing
Stolen moment at a time
A feeling only held for a little while
And then ripped from your arms
Like a child
I carry their names
The secret shapes
An aching braid
Around my heart
Traced in the park
An outline in chalk
Where I took his hand in mine
For a little while, everything was alright3Embed
