All Along LyricsWhat drives me to my man?
Earthly or divine or otherwise
Is no business of mine
You wasted my time
You wasted my time
Deep down I never did feel right
Even now sometimes -
That feeling is a lie
You wasted my time
You wasted my time
A heart long-desperate oh for just a little bit
A heart long-desperate oh for something I had all along
I don't need your love
I don't need your love
I don't need you to understand
I need you to listen3Embed
