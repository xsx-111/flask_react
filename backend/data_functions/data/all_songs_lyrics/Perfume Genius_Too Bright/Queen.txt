Queen Lyrics
Don't you know your queen?
Ripped, heaving
Flower bloom at my feet
Don't you know your queen?
Cracked, peeling
Riddled with disease

Wrapped in golden leaves
Don't you know me?
Rank, ragged
Skin sewn on in sheets
Casing the barracks
For an ass to break and harness into the fold
Mary

No family is safe
