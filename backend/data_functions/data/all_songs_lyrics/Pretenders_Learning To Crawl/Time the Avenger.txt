Time the Avenger LyricsNobody's perfect
Not even a perfect stranger
Oh, but what a gal
She was such a perfect stranger
And you're the best in your field
In your office
With your girls, and desk and leather chair
Thought that time was on your side
Not time the avenger
Nobody is permanent
Everything is on loan here
Even your wife and kids
Could be gone next year
And with what you have left
You'll be forever, under pressure to support her
And a lover who looks strangely
Like time the avenger
Time, time hear the bells chime
Over the harbor in the city
Time, one more vodka and lime
To help paralyze that little
Tick, tick tick tick ...
Nobody's perfect
Not even a perfect gent
When your property took the A train
I wonder where your manners went
You were standing at the station
In your briefcase was your aftershave and underwear
Can you hear the whistle blow
Sounds like time the avenger
Time, time hear the bells chime
Over the harbor in the city
Time kill another bottle of wine
To help paralyze that tiny little
Tick, tick tick tick ...Embed
