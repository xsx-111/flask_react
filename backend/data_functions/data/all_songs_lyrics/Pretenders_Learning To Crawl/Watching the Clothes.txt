Watching the Clothes LyricsOh, Saturday night
Mmm, everyone's having fun
I'm at the laundromat
Trying to get my washing done
Like I've done before
Time and time again
Watching the clothes go 'round
Another week sees its end
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
Oh, I've been working hard
Mmm, trying to make some money
Would you like sour cream
On your potato, honey
I've been kissing ass
Trying to keep clean
Serving the middle class
Yeah, it's a clean routine
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
The dirty whites
Mmm, getting whiter
The dirty colors
Getting brighter
The dirty delicates
Do the final rinse
There goes my Saturday night
I go without a fight
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'round
Watching the clothes go 'roundEmbed
