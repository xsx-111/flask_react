2000 Miles Lyrics
He's gone
2,000 miles
Is very far
The snow is falling down
It's colder day by day
I miss you

The children were singing
He'll be back at Christmas time

And these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream
You appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow
Sparkle

Our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmas time

2,000 miles
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Wherever you go
He's gone
2,000 miles
Is very far
The snow is falling down
It's colder day by day
I miss you

I can hear people singing
It must be Christmas time
I hear people singing
It must be Christmas timeEmbed
