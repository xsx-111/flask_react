Ghost Hardware Lyrics
"He looked inside me..."
He

Love you
He
(Love you)
He
He
Ohh no
He
He
Love you
He
Love you
He
(Oooh no)
"That record, that record, this mix...
You know, it all clicks together."
He
He
Love you
He
He
He
Love you
He
Love you
He
Love
He
He made it so hard for me to love you
Can we ever like that
Love you
Love you
Ohh no...8Embed
