Shell of Light LyricsGive me a hug
Closer, closer
Closer, closer (who knew?)
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
Closer, closer (it's true)
Closer, closer (who knew?)
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
Closer (no, no), closer (no, no)
Closer, closer
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
(love you here) Closer, (love you here) closer
Closer (no, no), closer (no, no)
Who knew?
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
Love you some more
God, can you whisper in her ear?
I wasn't sure if we could be friends
God, can you whisper in her ear?
I wasn't sure if we could be friends
God, can you whisper in her ear?
I wasn't sure if we could be friendsEmbed
