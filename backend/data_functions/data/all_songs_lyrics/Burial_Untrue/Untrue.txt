Untrue Lyrics
Girlfriend...

To the way I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
To the way I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied

To the way I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
To the way I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied

To the way I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
(And it's all)
Girlfriend...
We could be friends
Away from my heart
Away from my heart
We could be friends

To the way I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
And it's all, because you lied
To the way I feel inside
And it's all, because you lied

Girlfriend...
And...
The endlessness...4Embed
