Near Dark Lyrics
Going out, I was just...
I envied you, I envied you
Going out, I was just
I was just not in it, at all
Even still then...
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you, any more
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I envied you, I envied you
I envied you, I envied you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you, any more
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I envied you, girl, I envied you, girl
I envied you, girl, I envied you, girl
I envied you, girl, I envied you, girl
I envied you, girl, I envied you, girl
I can't take my eyes off...3Embed
