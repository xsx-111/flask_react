Etched Headplate Lyrics
"A hardcore. He's not setting out to hurt people. He's got a lot of love in him. And you know, for his mother, his brother and his girlfriend. He actually, I think, wants to do the right thing. So it's more a question of, will power and self discipline and circumstances..."

Dark angel
Fall from the heavens above
God send me an angel to heal my heart
From being in love
And after all I still love you
In my life (can)
But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes
Then I
(Can)
And after all I still love you
In my life (can)
But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes
Dark angel
Fall from the heavens above (can)
God send me an angel to heal my heart
From being in love (can)
And after all I still love you
In my life (can)
But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes
Then I can be an angel
But it wasn't good enough for you
Dark angel
Fall from the heavens above (can)
God send me an angel to heal my heart
From being in love
And after all I still love you
In my life (can)
But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes
Then I

And after all I still love you
In my life (can)
But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes
Dark angel
Fall from the heavens above (can)
God send me an angel to heal my heart
From being in love (can)
And after all I still love you
In my life (can)
But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes
