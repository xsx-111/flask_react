Archangel Lyrics
Holding you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Kissing you

Holding you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Kissing you
Tell me I belong, tell me I belong, tell me I belong
Holding you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Kissing you
Tell me I belong, tell me I belong, tell me I belong
