The Only One Lyrics
Let me tell you now, all that's on my mind
For a love like yours is oh so very hard to find
I've looked inside myself, now I'm very sure
There can only be you for me, I need you more and more

You turned me inside out and you showed me
What life was about, only you
The only one that stole my heart away
And I wanna do all I can just to show you
Make you understand, only you
The only one that stole my heart away

When you're in my arms, when I'm close to you
There's a magic in your touch that just comes shining through
Want you everyday, want you every night
There can only be you for me, you make it seem so right oh girl 'cause

You turned me inside out and you showed me
What life was about, only you
The only one that stole my heart away

In my mind there's no other love
You're the only girl my heart and soul is thinking of
Only you, only me (Only me)
There can never ever be another
That understands the way that I feel inside 'cause
You turned me inside out and you showed me
What life was about, only you
The only one that stole my heart away
Yeah, you turned me inside out and you showed me
What life was about, only you
The only one that stole my heart away

You stole my heart away
You stole it
You stole my heart away
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away, yeah you
You stole my heart away
Oh, you stole it
You stole my heart away
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away
You stole my heart away
You stole my heart awayEmbed
