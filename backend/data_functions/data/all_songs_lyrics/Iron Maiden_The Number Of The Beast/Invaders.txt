Invaders Lyrics
Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared - don't run - stand your ground

They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won

Invaders... Pillaging!
Invaders... Looting!

Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back

Invaders... Fighting!
Invaders... Marauding!


Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle-wearyâ€‹ fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen

You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day

Invaders... Raping!
Invaders... Plundering!Embed
