Dig Me Lyrics
It's here I sit and rust amid this ruin and rancor
Like tire irons, toothy grills and car parts before me
The acid rain floods my floorboard
Burns my pores and rots my upholstery
Once I was worshipped, polished magnificently
Now I lay in decay by the dirty angry bay

I'm ready to leave
I wanna be out of here
I'm ready to ride away
I don't wanna die in here
I'm ready to ride

My skin is metallic now, no longer an elegant powder blue
My body unhinged and sleeping in the jungle
Of motor block manifolds and metal relics
What was deluxe becomes debris, I never questioned loyalty
But this dead end demolishes the dreams
Of an open highway

I'm ready to leave
I wanna be out of here
I'm ready to ride away
I don't wanna die in here
I'm ready to ride
Dig me
But don't
Bury meEmbed
