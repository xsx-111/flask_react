Sleepless Lyrics
In the dream I fall into the sleepless sea
With a swell of panic and pain
My veins are aching for the distant reef
In the crush of emotional waves

All right, get a hold of yourself
And don't fight it, it's over your head
It's all right, the rumble in your ears
It's all right to feel a little fear
And don't fight it, it's over your head
It's all right, you wake up in your bed

Silhouettes like shivering ancient feelings
They cover my foreign floors and walls
Submarines are lurking in my foggy ceiling
They keep me sleepless at night

All right, get a hold of yourself
And don't fight it, it's over your head
It's all right, the rumble in your ears
It's all right to feel a little fear
And don't fight it, it's over your head
It's all right, you wake up in your bed
Hey, can you picture the sight?
The figures on the beach in the searing night
And the roaring hurt of my silent fight
Can you pull me out
Of this sleepless night?
Of this sleepless night
Can you pull me out?Embed
