Man With an Open Heart Lyrics
She wouldn't need to be a bird without a wing
Or be a servant to a telephone ring
She could be sleeping in the comfort of another bed

It wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
It wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
It wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh

She could be moody, dramatic as a play
Or be evasive as a shadow in the shade
Could be irregular and singing in her underwear

It wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
It wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
It wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Her wild and wise womanly introspectiveness
Her faults and files of foolishness

Wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
Wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
Wouldn't matter to a man with an open heart
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Here comes right now
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh2Embed
