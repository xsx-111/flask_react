Model Man Lyrics
I look for the signs, I look for the symptoms
I look for the slight calm before the storm
I feel the silence, I feel the signals
I feel the strain, tension in my head
Well, what more can be said?

Not a model man, not a saviour or a saint
Imperfect in a word, make no mistake
But I'll give you everything I have
Take me as I am

I look for the signs, I look for the symptoms
I look for the slight calm before the storm
I feel the silence, I feel the signals
I feel the strain, tension in my head
Well, what more can be said?

I'm not a model man, not a saviour or a saint
Imperfect in a word, make no mistake
But I'll give you everything I have
Take me as I am

Not a model man, not a saviour or a saint
Imperfect in a word, make no mistake
But I'll give you everything I have
Take me as I am

I look for the signs...1Embed
