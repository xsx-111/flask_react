To Our Knees LyricsAnd the love we all need
Was running hard to be free
It got caught up in the forest
By the branches on the trees
By the creatures of the daylight
And the beasts of the night
Then the mountains and the rivers
Took their toll on its lean
It went stumbling down a hillside
Where it landed on its knees
On its knees, on its knees
On its knees. And: scene
And the love we all need
Once relented from its speed
We adored it and abused it
Till it brought us to our knees
To our knees
To our knees
To our kneesEmbed
