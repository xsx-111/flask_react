Amethyst LyricsYou hide, you always hide
So deep inside the amethyst mine
The color bleeds and fades to white
What used to be a violent mind
Afraid, the things they say
They reach and strain to get their way
You claim they can't touch you
Still you choose to take the edge of the room
Oh time, it pulls out your eyes
It makes you choose between two lives
So what? You've got that too
You're nobody's stupid girlEmbed
