Mother LyricsWhen you became my mother, there was time
You thought I'd be a daughter, but didn't mind
And as the world began to measure and define
We had time
We had time
You gave me light and language and a name
You held me to the fire, to the flame
Now if I could tell the future, all the same
Why would I?
We have time
Deep beneath the surface of the earth
So many bodies waiting for the word
When every child and mother will return
Forever
We'll have timeEmbed
