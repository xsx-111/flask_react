On My Own LyricsAt the end of the story
At the start of the song
That's the part that just threw me
On my own
How a want turns to hungry
How a hope turns to "no"
How a fear turns to angry
On my own
On my own
So if you wake up before me
If you find you were wrong
Then there's nothing worth holding
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthdayEmbed
