Waiting LyricsI'm waiting like a child
Hope runs wild
The truth can hide
Sometimes right behind the sorrow
I see beyond the smile
Cheat and lie
I'm not blind
Suicide, still I'll be here tomorrow
So leave it alone
Dogs come home
Even the stone finds a place within the hollow
Yeah
I'm waiting like a child
Hope runs wild
The truth can hide
Sometimes right behind the sorrow
