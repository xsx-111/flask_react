Clarence White LyricsClarence White and Josh Murray
I never thought I'd see the day
It hurts to hear but it's so easy to say
Clarence White
I know I shouldn't be afraid
You think it's pretty (oh no)
But I am a raging river
I'll cut through your city (oh no)
Just like destroying angel
The one from the movie (oh no)
The one with Charlton Heston
That used to scare me
But I know I shouldn't be afraid
I know I shouldn't be afraid
I know I shouldn't be afraid
I know I shouldn't be afraidEmbed
