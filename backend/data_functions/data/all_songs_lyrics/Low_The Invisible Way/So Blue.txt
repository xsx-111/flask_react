So Blue LyricsDream the day
Caught in the sway
Miles gone inside
Into the air
I take a breath
No longer care
To be the death
Even time
We took a light
Songs leaving alive
Into the air
I take a breath
No longer dare
To be the death of you
Of you
So blue
So blue
With you
With you
And into the air
We take a chance
Can no longer bear
To miss the dance
With you
With you
So blue
So blue
With you
With you
So blue
So blue
With you
With you
So blue
So blue
With you
With you
So blue
So blueEmbed
