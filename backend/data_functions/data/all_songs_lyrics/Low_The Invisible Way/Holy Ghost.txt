Holy Ghost LyricsSome holy ghost keeps me hanging on
Hanging on
Some holy ghost keeps me hanging on
Hanging on
I feel the hands, but I don't see anyone
Anyone
I feel the hands, but I don't see anyone
It's there and gone
Feeds my passion for transcendence
Turns my water into wine
Makes me wish I was empty
Now I don't know much
But I can tell when something's wrong
And something's wrong
But some holy ghost keeps me
Ooh, oohEmbed
