Bang! LyricsBang!
You're so vicious baby
Bang!
You sure know how to control me
You're as cool as ice cream
Bang!
You're so evil baby
Bang!
You're no sweetheart baby
Bang!
You keep me blushing all the time
And the way you kiss keeps me hanging on
And the way you love keeps me hanging on
Hanging on
Kids wanna bop
Out in the street
Fu-fu-fun
All summer long
Kids wanna bop
Out in the street
Fu-fu-fun
All summer long
Bang!
When you hit me baby
Bang!
When I scream out baby
Bang!
You know I love it all the time
Bang!
So excited baby
Bang!
Just like a rocket baby
Bang!
To the stars now baby yeah
And the way you kiss keeps me hanging on
And the way you love keeps me hanging on
Hanging on
Kids wanna bop
Out in the street
Fu-fu-fun
All summer long
Kids wanna bop
Out in the street
Fu-fu-fun
All summer long
