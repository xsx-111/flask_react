Last Dance LyricsYour lipstick
Smeared beside
I adore you
I always have
And every time you overdose
I rush to intensive care
Another sad-eyed stare
Before you disappear
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it for me baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it for me baby
Ooh, ooh
Then, save it for me baby
Ooh, ooh
Then, save it for me baby
Your addiction
And you are in love
Not starcrossed
I wait my turn
And every time you overdose
I rush to intensive care
Another sad-eyed stare
Before you disappear
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it for me baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it for me baby
Ooh, ooh
Then, save it for me baby
Ooh, ooh
Then, save it for me baby
I wanna know, I wanna know
If it's the last, if it's the last dance
I wanna know, I wanna know
Baby, baby, please
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it for me baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it for me baby
Ooh
Then, save it for me baby
Ooh (This is the last dance, this is the last dance)
Then, save it for me babyEmbed
