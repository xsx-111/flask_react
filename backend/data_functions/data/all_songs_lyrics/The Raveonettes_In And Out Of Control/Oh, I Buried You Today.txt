Oh, I Buried You Today LyricsOh, I buried you today
But you wouldn't stay away
It's so hard for me to say
Sweet words about you
Will you put my heart at ease
Will you do it for me please
I know a heart is hard to please
When love fades
All the kisses I missed
Oh, cruel things you could do
But my heart was on fire
But now I cry
But my heart was on fire
But now I cryEmbed
