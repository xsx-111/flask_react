Suicide Lyrics
Dream little girl
On lonely street
Little runaway girl
Do it again
Do it again

Your boyfriend's mean
And your mom's a bitch
Little runaway girl
Do it again
Do it again

Run run run away
You're gonna get your fun in this trashy world
Empty hearted boys by your side
Lick your lips, fuck suicide
Suicide
Not tonight
Suicide
Not tonight

You're ripe for love
New York's the shit
Little runaway girl
Do it again
Do it again
On the Brooklyn Bridge
You fix your stare,the East River sleeps
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

Run run run away
You're gonna get your fun in this trashy world
Empty hearted boys by your side
Lick your lips,fuck suicide
Suicide
Not tonight
Suicide
Not tonight
