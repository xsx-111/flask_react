Wine Lyrics
You, me
Stars sleep
Lone roads
Sprinkled with tears
Don't self destruct
Kill time with a baseball bat

And it makes me cry, makes me cry
Summer threw our love away
Makes me cry, makes me cry
Summer threw our love away
Threw our love away

Nose kiss
Drunk on wine
Red moon
In love forever

And it makes me cry, makes me cry
Summer threw our love away
Makes me cry, makes me cry
Summer threw our love away
Threw our love away
A bad wipeout
You beat 'em everytime
A bad wipeout
You beat 'em everytime
You beat 'em everytimeEmbed
