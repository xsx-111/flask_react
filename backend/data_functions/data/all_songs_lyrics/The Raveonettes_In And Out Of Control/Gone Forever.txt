Gone Forever LyricsBaby baby I won't forget you
In the night when I drink my head off
Memories of you and I
Help me help me please
In the summer when we stood out
Stood out in a boring crowd
And the radio blasted out
Ramones and Rockaway Beach
And when you said everything's a mess
I know you meant you and me
Meant you and me
That's when I knew baby this is the end
This is the end
Baby baby when I told you
I wanna be just like you
You laughed cause you always wanted to
Be somebody else
Now I tremble in New York City
The times we had were the best yeah baby
Those time when we had each other
Are gone now gone now forever
And when you said everything's a mess
I know you meant you and me
Meant you and me
That's when I knew baby this is the end
This is the endEmbed
