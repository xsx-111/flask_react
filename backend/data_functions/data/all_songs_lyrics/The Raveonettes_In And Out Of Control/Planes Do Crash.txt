Planes Do Crash LyricsYou're in love
Ecstacy
Right now, you and me
Plans do crash
Plans do crash
I crush my blow
To cats in the rain
Plans do crash
Plans do crash
All I wanna do
Is scare with you my soul bad
My soul bad, my soul bad, my soul
All I wanna do
Is scare with you my soul bad
My soul bad, my soul bad, my soul
Fire in love
Jealousy
Stranger's perfume
Plans do crash
Plans do crash
Sound of bells
Soft nature
Burning love
On the rain
Plans do crash
Plans do crash
All I wanna do
Is scare with you my soul bad
My soul bad, my soul bad, my soul
All I wanna do
Is scare with you my soul bad
My soul bad, my soul bad, my soulEmbed
