The Chosen One LyricsIn a half can turn
Do you change me?
Do you feel well?
'Cause, baby, I'm ready to go
Change the sound
The chosen one
It ain't me, 'cause
Baby, I'm ready to go
And I cut myself fucking cruel
I wanna scream, I want something too
I gotta go 'cause time is mean
Love me all the time
This thing's getting out of hour
This makes I'm wearing
The coolest clothes
I start, I falling count
Looking up kids
In New York state
You wanted me
'Cause, baby, I'm ready to go
Go out there, Ben
You used to kills
You followed me
And, baby, I'm wearing shoes
And I cut myself fucking cruel
I wanna scream, I want something too
I gotta go 'cause time is mean
Love me all the time
This thing's getting out of hour
This makes I'm wearing
The coolest clothes
I start, I falling count
Catch me, catch me, do it, baby
Catch me if can now, baby
Catch me, catch me, do it, baby
Do it, do it, baby
Just do it, do it, baby
Love me all the time
This thing's getting out of hour
This makes I'm wearing
The coolest clothes
I start, I falling count
Love me all the time
This thing's getting out of hour
This makes I'm wearing
The coolest clothes
I start, I falling countEmbed
