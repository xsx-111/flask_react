D.R.U.G.S. LyricsI see you sick and curled up like cats do
When psychos abuse them yeah
You want to purr but you're far too gone
I check your collar and you got no name
And I know you want it
And I know you like it
And I know you got it
And I know you love
D.R.U.G.S
You're full of silence when I tell you
Cats are meant to be cool and cute
You're off your head you look like a corpse
Milk-white face like the saddest moonEmbed
