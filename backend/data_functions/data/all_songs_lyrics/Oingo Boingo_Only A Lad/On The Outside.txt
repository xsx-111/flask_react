On The Outside Lyrics
They laugh at me aloud, they say I'm just a clown
That I ain't got no pride, I'm on the outside
The girls look really cute, they really make it work
They think I'm just a jerk, I'm on the outside
I never could sit still, I never was too hip
I never caught the ride

I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside now

This is where it all begins
Right here
On the outside, lookin' in
I'm on the outside

I never was a punk, I never shot junk
I never even tried, counterculture passed me right by
(I'm on the outside)
Don't talk to debutantes, don't eat in restaurants
The patrons sit and stare
The waiters make wisecracks behind my back
(I'm on the outside)
The teachers there in school, they flunked me by the rule
They say I had no motivation, brains, or dedication
I guess the imbeciles were right
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside now

This is where it all begins
On the outside, looking in
Looking in at you
I'm just an alien through and through
Tryin' to make believe I'm you
Tryin' to fit
Just a stranger on the outside, looking in


The disco makes me sick, I wear the wrong clothes
I say the wrong things
You know I can't dance, my feet are much too wide
(I'm on the outside)
You think you set the trends, you wear your hair just right
Your clothes are outta sight
Your house is modern; really kitsch
You get so macho when you're with your bitch
(I'm on the outside)
I see them go to work, I see them go to sleep
I see them on TV, I see them laugh and cry
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside
(I'm on the outside)
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside
(I'm on the outside)
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside
(I'm on the outside)

I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside now

This is where it all begins
On the outside, looking in
Looking in at you
I'm just an alien through and through
Tryin' to make believe I'm you
Tryin' to fit
Just a stranger on the outside, looking in

I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside now
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside now
I'm on the outside
I'm on the outside now1Embed
