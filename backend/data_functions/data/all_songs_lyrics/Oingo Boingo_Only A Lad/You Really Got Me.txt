You Really Got Me Lyrics
Baby, you really got me now
You got me so I don't what I'm doin'
Oh, yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

Oh, yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Doing, doing, doing
Oh, yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

You really got me
You really got me
You really got—me
You really got

Me, me, me
You really got me

Please, don't ever set me free
I always want to be by your side
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Oh, yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Doing, doing, doing
Oh, yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

You really got me
You really got me
You really got—me
You really got

Me, me, me, me
Me, me


Please, don't ever set me free
I always want to be by your side
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

Oh, yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Doing, doing, doing
Oh, yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You really got me
You really got me
You really got—me
You really got

Me, me, me, me
Me, me
