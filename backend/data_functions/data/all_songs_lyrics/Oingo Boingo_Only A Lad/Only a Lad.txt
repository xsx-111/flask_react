Only a Lad Lyrics
Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell
Everyone said, "If you don't get straight, you'll surely go to Hell!"
But Johnny didn't care
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old
He didn't wanna do what he was told
Just a prankster - A juvenile gangster
His teachers didn't understand, they kicked him out of school
At a tender early age just because
He didn't want to learn things
Had other interests - He liked to burn things
The lady down the block
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad
So he took it the first chance he had
And then he shot her in the leg
But this is what she said

(He's only a lad) You really can't blame him
(Only a lad) Society made him
(Only a lad) He's our responsibility
Oh, oh, whoa whoa
(Only a lad) He really couldn't help it
(Only a lad) He didn't want to do it
(Only a lad) He's underprivileged and abused
Perhaps a little bit confused
Oh, oh, oh, oh whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh, whoa whoa whoa
His parents gave up, they couldn't influence his attitude
Nobody could help, the little man had no gratitude
And when he stole the car
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far
He didn't mean to hit the poor man
Who had to go and die
It made the judge cry

(Only a lad) He really couldn't help it
(Only a lad) He didn't want to do it
(Only a lad) He's underprivileged and abused
Perhaps a little bit confused
Oh, oh, oh, oh whoa whoa

It's not his fault that he can't behave
Society's made him go astray
Perhaps if we're nice, he'll go away
Perhaps he'll go away, he'll go away-ay

(Only a lad) You really can't blame him
(Only a lad) Society made him
(Only a lad) Is he our responsibility?
Hey there, Johnny, you really don't fool me
You get away with murder and you think it's funny
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die
Oh, oh, oh, oh whoa whoa whoa
Hey there, Johnny Boy, I hope you fry!
Oh, whoa whoa whoa
Oh, whoa whoa whoa, oh-oh2Embed
