Controller Lyrics
There's someone knockin' on my door
There's someone knockin' on my door
I think they're looking for me
I think they're looking for me
Pretend there ain't nobody home
Don't make a sound; don't even move
Don't give them nothing to see
I think they're looking for me

(S'alright, s'alright) I got to run, I got to run
(S'alright, s'alright) I got to run, I got to run
(S'alright) I got to run!

There's someone crawling in my yard
There's someone creeping on my roof
There's someone tapping my phone
I feel it deep in my bones
They want to probe my intuition
They want to find out what I know
Why don't they leave me alone?
Why don't they leave me alone?

(S'alright, s'alright) I got to run, I got to run
(S'alright, s'alright) I got to run, might be the catcher
(S'alright, s'alright) Or the controller, can't be too careful
(S'alright, s'alright) I take precautions, they're very clever
(S'alright!) I got to run!
Faceless surgeons armed with razors
Cut out our imagination

There's someone knockin' on my door
There's someone knockin' on my door
I think they're looking for me
I think they're looking for me
Pretend there ain't nobody home
Don't make a sound; don't even move
Don't give them nothing to see
I think they're looking for me

(S'alright, s'alright) I got to run, I got to run
(S'alright, s'alright) I got to run, might be the catcher
(S'alright, s'alright) Or the controller, can't be too careful
(S'alright, s'alright) I take precautions, they're very clever
(S'alright!) I got to run!

Faceless surgeons armed with razors
Cut out our imagination
It's a strange thing, deadly reason
Razors cut with such precision
Probing deep without detection
Razors never lie
It's all right
I think they're looking for me
I think they're looking for me
I think they're looking for me
I think they're looking for me1Embed
