War Lyrics
One, two
One, two, thank you

There's no peace, only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease, only grow
You better be prepared to fight

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War

There's no pain, it will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you're lost, in your despair
Forever black eternal night

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life
War, destroyer
War, destroyer

It needs no side to justify
Laying down your life

War, destroyer
