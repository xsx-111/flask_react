Move Over LyricsYou say that it's over baby
You say that it's over now
Still you hang around, now come on
Won't you move over
You know that I need a woman
You know that I need a woman
But when I ask you to, you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please don't you do it to me babe
Please don't you do it to me
Take this love that I offer
Honey let me be
Make up your mind, you're playing with me
Make up your mind, you're playing with me
Let me be your lover baby
Let me honey let me be
Make up your mind, you're playing with me
Make up your mind, you're playing with me
Let me be your lover baby
Let me honey let me be
No, no, no
No, no, no
You say that it's over baby
You say that it's over now
Still you hang around, now come on
Move over
You know that I need a woman
You know that I need a woman
When I ask you to you just tell me
Maybe you can
Please don't you do it to me babe
Please don't you do it to me
Take this love that I offer
Honey let me be
I ain't quite ready for walkin'
Ain't quite ready for walkin'
What ya do with your life
Move over baby
Make up your mind, you're playing with me
Make up your mind, you're playing with me
Let me be your lover baby
Let me honey let me be
Let me be
Let me be
