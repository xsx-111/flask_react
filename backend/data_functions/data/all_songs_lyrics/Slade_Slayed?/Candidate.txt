Candidate LyricsSee him all alone
No one seems to like him, he's uncool
No one seems to like the way he rules
See them all alone
Talking of the secrets of the moon
Spending hard-earned money they'll just lose
What we really want is some way to adjust
All the values that we have been left to trust
I just can't believe they are real, very real
Far from real
See them on their own
See their cartoon faves in the news
Storming from the house in ones and twos
Can you hear them cry
Making accustions to each other
Campaigning for the mark of a young mother
What we really want is some way to adjust
All the values that we have been left to trust
I just can't believe they are real, very real
Far from real
What we really want is some way to adjust
All the values that we have been left to trust
I just can't believe
They're real, very real
Far from real
See them all alone
See them all aloneEmbed
