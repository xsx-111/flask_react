Let the Good Times Roll / Feel So Fine LyricsOOh c'mon baby, let the good times roll
C'mon baby, let me thrill your soul
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long
I said baby, yeah this is it
This is something that I just can't miss
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long
I feel so good, sugar, when you're home
I said, "Come on baby, I wanna rock ya all night long, honey"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel so good now that you're home
C'mon let me hold ya
C'mon let me kiss ya
C'mon let me see
What I been missin'
I feel so good now that you've come back home
I feel so fine, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Ooh, I'm forgiven
All I been missin'
Feels so good
Oh, so fine
Oh, so fine
Now that you've come back home
A-One, two, a-one, two three, four!
I feel so good, sugar, when you're home
I said, "Come on baby, I wanna rock ya all night long, honey"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel so good now that you're home
C'mon let me hold ya
C'mon let me kiss ya
C'mon let me see
What I been missing
I feel so fine now that you've come back home
I feel so fine, can't you see I got ya on my mind?
Ooh, I'm forgiven
All I been missin'
Feels so good
Oh, so fine
Oh, so fine
Now that you've come back home
One, two, one, two three, four!Embed
