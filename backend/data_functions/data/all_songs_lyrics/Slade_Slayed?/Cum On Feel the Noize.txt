Cum On Feel the Noize Lyrics
Baby baby baby!
Ee-ow...

So you think I got an evil mind, well I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time, well it makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Anymore
Oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
We get wild, wild, wild
So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
At your door

So you say I got a funny face, I ain't got no worries
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Say I'm a scruff bag well it's no disgrace, I ain't in no hurry
And I don't know why
I just don't know why
Anymore
Oh no
So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
We get wild, wild, wild
So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
At your door
So you think we have a lazy time, well you should know better
And I don't know why
I just don't know why
And you say I got a dirty mind, well I'm a mean go getter
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Anymore
Oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
We get wild, wild, wild
So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
At your doorEmbed
