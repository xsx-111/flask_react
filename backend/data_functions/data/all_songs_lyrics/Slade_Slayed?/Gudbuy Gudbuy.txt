Gudbuy Gudbuy LyricsI can see you here but don't worry
With your hair down in your eyes and you say hi
I had to come back without due warning
Now I caught you making love I'll say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I just want you to say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I just want you to say goodbye
I can see you cry out I'm sorry
Blow your nose and wipe your eyes and you'll know why
I had to come back without due warning
Now I'll pack my things and then I'll say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I just want you to say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I just want you to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Bye, goodbye
Bye, goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I just want you to say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I just want you to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Bye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I want you to say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I want you to say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
I want you to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Bye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbyeEmbed
