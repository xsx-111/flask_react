I don't want to drink my whisky like you do
I don't need to spend my money but still do
Don't stop now a c'mon
Another drop now c'mon
I wanna lot now so c'mon
That's right, that's right
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
I said Mama but we're all crazy now

And you told me fool fire water won't hurt me
And you tease me
And all my ladies desert me
Don't stop now a c'mon
Another drop now c'mon

That's right, that's right
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
