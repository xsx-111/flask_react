Look at Last Nite LyricsLook at last nite, look at last nite
Everybody trying to know you
Never did try, ever did try
Never would try to know you
You'll be right here today - gone tomorrow
Maybe they'll care today - but not tomorrow...
Do you feel good, do you feel good
Everyone trying to meet you
Can you tell why, do you know why
Suddenly how they treat you?
You'll be right here today - gone tomorrow
Maybe they'll care today - but not tomorrow...
Yeah, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Look at last nite, look at last nite
All the things have changed you
Do you know why, look how they try
You realize they made you
You'll be right here today - gone tomorrow
Maybe they'll care today - but not tomorrow...
Look at last nite, look at last nite
Everyone trying to know you
Never did try, ever did try
Never would try to know you
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Look at last nite, look at last nite, oh oh
Look at last nite, look at last nite
Oh oooo oh yea yea yea yea...Embed
