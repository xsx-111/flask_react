Man Who Speaks Evil LyricsHis mind is hurtsome with grief
He sits and watches a grass or leaf
He can tell when a new one grows, he can
And watches as maggots flee from the throat of a dead man
Across two seas he can hear
And grabs your words before you speak them
He hears the sound of drinking grass, he does
And the Arctic moves each gigantic load for his owner's sake
He's a man who speaks evil
He's a man who is evil
He looks at evil as a good thing
He can speak evil, he can hear evil
He really, really lives it
He can feel that all his thoughts are changing
That all his thoughts are changing by the hour
He can feel
This man is hurtsome with grief
He sits and watches a grass or leaf
He talks to them all while they grow, he does
And wanders like a dog day thief
Inside out, and below you know
He's a man who speaks evil
He's a man who is evil
He looks on evil as a good thing
He can speak evil, he can hear evil
He really, really lives it
He can feel that all his thoughts are changing
That all his thoughts are changing by the hour
He can feelEmbed
