My Life Is Natural LyricsI played the sands /f time and I loved and lost
They gave their bodies to two-time whores
They gambled everything they got
A greedy mind cut out the cards
They even loved with another man's wife
They even loved her with other men
They've also drank a lot of wine
Some men have even had a good time
My life is natural, hey hey hey
My life is natural, said a said a said a
My life is natural, woh woh woh
My life is natural
Maybe tomorrow a change in the life of the man in the street's gonna come
Maybe tomorrow. Hope it's tomorrow
You got the sands of time and they piled up high
They've done their best to wreck their mind
Instead of joke they told a lie
They started wars so men could die now
To try to suss out what is evil and what is good would take a mind wiser than mine
To start a setting the world to rights would take another Christ now
My life is natural, My life is natural
My life is natural, My life is natural
Maybe tomorrow a change in the life of the man in the street's gonna come
Maybe tomorrow. Hope it's tomorrowEmbed
