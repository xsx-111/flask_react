Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me LyricsYou know how to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
When a girl's meaning yes, she says no
You got rude talk
You got one walk
All your jokes are blue
You've got long nails
You tell tall tales
Some you think are true
And there's nowhere to go you won't go
If there's nowhere to run you go slow
If you move up to me then I'll show
You the way
Then you'll know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
When a girl's meaning yes, she says no
You got a sweet tongue
You sing love songs
Can't you learn to spell?
Take me back home
You got it all wrong
'Cos we sing that as well
And there's nowhere to go you won't go
If there's nowhere to run you go slow
If you move up to me then I'll show
You the way
Then you'll know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
When a girl's meaning yes, she says no, oh
Oh, you know how to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
When a girl's meaning yes, she says no
You know how to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy, yeah
And I thought you might like to know, know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know, know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
You know how to pleeze me (wo-oh)
You're learnin' it easy (wo-oh)
And I thought you might like to know
How to skweeze me (wo-oh)
