This Is How It Goes Down Lyrics
I hear my name
I hear the trash you're talking
In your sleep, the secrets that you're keeping
A chick, this smart
Did you really think that you could keep her in the dark?

Does she purr?
Does she make it hard
Hard to speak?
Does she dress the part?
I'm sure she'll take some getting used to
Brother, she'll never be me

Feel the burn, take a spin
Suck the poison out of me
I will make you beg, I will make you come
To your senses if you keep
Up the shit, take the hit
Dig the grave
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
Gonna run, gonna scream
Gonna crawl down on your knees
When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me
Doesn't matter because I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
I'm gonna rage
Stay out really late
Gonna hang with all my friends you hate
I may try that threesome
Better late than never
And better without you

This is your future as I see it
You will be homeless, bald and broken
She will have left you when she finds out who you are
You're nothing but an extra, and baby, I'm the star

Feel the burn, take a spin
Suck the poison out of me
I will make you beg, I will make you come
To your senses if you keep
Up the shit, take the hit
Dig the grave
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
Gonna run, gonna scream
Gonna crawl down on your knees
When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me
Doesn't matter because I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
Suppose this is how the story goes but ever since that door closed
I've been going down (Down)
The dream, in the pink got me nauseous
I should've grown more cautious, and clever, whatever
You'll never find a dude with a better head game
And you can take that both ways
You laughing like I'm playing with your fingers up like OJ
Miss, you would have a three-some without me
I'll pull an OJ and text you some incriminating pictures from my old days

Feel the burn, take a spin
Suck the poison out of me
I will make you beg, I will make you come
To your senses if you keep
Up the shit, take the hit
Dig the grave
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
Gonna run, gonna scream
Gonna crawl down on your knees
When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me
Doesn't matter because I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down
Somebody done lied to you
Because you're not such a big shot. dude
You might want to rethink it through
You should've asked me
I would've told you the truth
Somebody done lied to you
Because you're not such a big shot. dude
You might want to rethink it through
You should've asked me
I would've told you the truthEmbed
