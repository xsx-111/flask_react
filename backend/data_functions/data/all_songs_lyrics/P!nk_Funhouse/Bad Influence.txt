Bad Influence Lyrics
Alright, sir
Sure, I'll have another one, it's early
Three olives, shake it up, I like it dirty (Dirty)
Tequila for my friend, it makes her flirty (Flirty)
Trust me
I'm the instigator of underwear
Showing up here and there, uh-oh (Oh no)
I'm always on a mission from the get go (Get go)
So what if it's only one o'clock in the afternoon
It's never too soon to send out all the invitations to the last night of (Your life)

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party, it's genetic
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
Alright ma'am (Ma'am)
Calm down, I know your son said he was at my house (My house)
He was the captain of the football team, but I turned him out
He wasn't the first and he won't be the last, so tone it down
This happens all the time
I'm a story they tell, the alibi
They wanna go home, I asked them (Why?)
It's daylight (Not night)
They might need a break from all the real life (Get a life)
It gets to be too much sometimes
It's never too late to send out all the invitations to the last night of (Your life)

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party, it's genetic
It's electrifying wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, you'll never know
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
I'm off to see the doctor
I hope she has a cure
I hope she makes me better
What does that even mean? We don't know!

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party, it's genetic
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party, it's genetic
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party, it's genetic
It's electrifying
(You can) wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
I'm a good excuse (Good excuse)
To be a bad influence on you and you and you
(You're too tired! You're not too tired!)1Embed
