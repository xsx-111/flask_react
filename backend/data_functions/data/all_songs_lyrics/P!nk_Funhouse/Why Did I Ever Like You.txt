Why Did I Ever Like You Lyrics
Barabarabaraadada
There was a 5.8 earthquake today
And it kind of got me thinking
I'd still have all my hate for you intact
Even if I lost everything

What did I say?
Why are you shaking your head?
You know you done me wrong
I may be crazy; it's all in my head
But I want you done and gone, yeah

Why did I ever like you? What did I see?
Whatever it was must've been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on me

It's hard to believe I ever laughed at anything you said
'Cause you're just not funny
Who would believe I'd let you do all those things
Oh, I guess the joke was on me

I tried to be zen
I've even asked all my friends
To help me let it slide
But all I see is your face
In my favorite place
And I can't help but wonder why
Why did I ever like you? What did I see?
Whatever it was must've been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on me

I tried to be zen
I've even asked all my friends
To help me let it slide
But all I see is your face
In my favorite place
And I can't help but wonder why

Why did I ever like you? What did I see?
Whatever it was must've been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on me

Tell me, why did I ever like you? What did I see?
Whatever it was must've been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on meEmbed
