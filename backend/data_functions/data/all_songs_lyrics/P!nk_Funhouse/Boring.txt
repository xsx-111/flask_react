Boring Lyrics
Uh, that's hot

It's tasty
It's like a cupcake
It's cotton candy
It melts in your mouth
And lately, I've been getting hunger pains
When you lick your lips while you check me out

Fast car
Boring
Girlfriend
Boring
Got money
Boring
No-oh-oh-oh
Hot friends
Boring
Rock band
Boring
Not interested
No thank you
If you want me
You're gonna have to catch me
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa
And if you catch me
You're gonna have to show me
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa

You're scrumptious
I kinda like it
I'm indecisive
I change my mind a lot
But you're hot (You're so hot)
But I think you kinda know it
Really hoping you don't blow it, so bring it (Bring it)

You're tired
Boring
You're sore
Boring
You worked all day
Boring
Whoa-oa-oa-oa
Big boat
Boring
Black AmEx
Gistening six pack
Well, heh
If you want me
You're gonna have to catch me
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa
And if you catch me
You're gonna have to show me
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa

If I let you catch me
It's because I think you're really cute
And if you don't get it right
I'mma be like really, really mad
Uh, insert rap here
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, go!
Go!
That's hot (It's Scott Storch)

Whoa-oa-oa-oa
If you want me, you catch me, yeah, whoa-oa-oa-oa
If you catch me, you show me, yeah, whoa-oa-oa-oa

If you want me
You're gonna have to catch me
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa
And if you catch me
You're gonna have to show me
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa
Fast car
Boring
Girlfriend
Boring
Got money
Boring
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Hot friends
Boring
Rock band
Boring
Not interested
Whoa-oa-oa-oaEmbed
