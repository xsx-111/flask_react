Version Girl LyricsVersion girl, what's your name?
Oh you come and you go
Version girl, what's your name?
Just like the morning sun
It's so hard to find a personality with charms
Like yours for me
Oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee
Version girl, what's your name?
Don't you know I long to say
Version girl, what's your name?
It's so hard to find a personality
With charms like yours for me
Oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along
So my heart will be satisfied
So please let me be your number one
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun
Version girl, what's your name?
Oh you come and you go
Version girl, what's your name?
Just like the morning sun
It's so hard to find a personality with charms
Like yours for me
Version girl, what's you name?
Oh you come ......etc
Oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee
Talking:
Version girl, what's you name?
Oh you come .......
Oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along
So my heart will be satisfied
So please let me be your number one
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun
Version girl, what's your name?
Oh you come and you go
Version girl, what's your name?
Just like the morning sun
It's so hard to find a personality with charms
Like yours for meEmbed
