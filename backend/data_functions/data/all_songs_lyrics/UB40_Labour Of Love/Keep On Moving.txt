Keep On Moving LyricsLord, I gotta keep on moving
Lord, I gotta get on down
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Law, they coming after me
I've been accused of a killing
Lord knows, I didn't do
For hanging me, they are willing
That's why I gotta get on through
Law, they coming after me
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Lord, I gotta get on down
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Law is coming after me
I've got two boys and a woman
They're just gonna suffer now
Lord forgive me for not going back
But I'll be there anyhow
I'll be there anyhow
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Lord, I gotta get on down
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Law is coming after me
Now maybe someday I'll find a piece of land
Somewhere not by or near anyone
Then I'll send for my love, love, love sweet woman
And my two grown up sons
My two grown up sons
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Lord, I gotta get on down
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Law is coming after me
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Lord, I gotta get on down
Lord, I gotta keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Law is coming after me1Embed
