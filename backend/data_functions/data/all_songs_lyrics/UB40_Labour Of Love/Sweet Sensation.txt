Sweet Sensation LyricsI can feel those thrill's walking over
When you hold me tight
Now I feel those pains aching over
When you say goodnight
(chorus)
Oh what sweet sensation
Lord what strange devotion
You've got love and devotion
And I won't forget your charm
Now there's nothing left for me to say girl
But stay in your world
You've got so much soul deep inside girl
And love that's richer than gold
(chorus to fade)Embed
