She Caught the Train LyricsAnother night of loneliness, my love is gone
She made a fuss, and she was wrong, yet she is gone
I asked her friends if they'd seen her
They said she'd take the train
I ran to catch the train, oh my, the train is gone
Another night of loneliness, my love is gone
She made a fuss and she was wrong, yet she is gone
I asked her friends if they'd seen her
They said she'd take the train
I ran to catch the train, oh my, the train is gone
Another night of loneliness, my love is gone
She made a fuss and she was wrong, yet she is gone
I run to catch the train, oh my, the train is goneEmbed
