Cherry Oh Baby LyricsCherry oh, Cherry oh, baby
Cherry oh, Cherry oh, baby
Don't you know I'm in love with you
If you don't believe it's true
What else is there for me to do?
So long I've been waiting
For you to come right in
And now that we are together
Please make my joy come over

Oh oh ee oh oh ee oh
Oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cherry, oh, Cherry, oh, baby
Don't you see I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe I do
Then why don't you try me?
I will never let you down
I will Never make you wear no frown
If you say that you love me madly
Well babe I'll accept you gladly

Oh oh ee oh oh ee oh

Cherry, oh, Cherry, oh, baby
Don't you see I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe I do
Then why don't you try me?
I will never let you down
I will Never make you wear no frown
If you say that you love me madly
Well babe I'll accept you gladly
