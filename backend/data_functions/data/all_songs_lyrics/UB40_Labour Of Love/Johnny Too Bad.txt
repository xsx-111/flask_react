Johnny Too Bad Lyrics
Walking down the road with a pistol in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad
Woah oh!
Walking down the road with a ratchet in your waist
Johhny, you're too bad
Woah oh!
You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad
You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad

One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah oh!
One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah oh!
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue and there'll be no rock
No Rock
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue and there'll be no rock
No Rock

Walking down the road with a pistol in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad
Woah oh!
Walking down the road with a ratchet in your waist
Johhny, you're too bad
Woah oh!
You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad
You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad

One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah oh!
One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah oh!
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue and there'll be no rock
No Rock
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue and there'll be no rock
No Rock
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue and there'll be no rock
No Rock
You say that you're bad, you gwan like you're mad
You terrorize the people and you make dem sad
Woii woii, you are the Babylon
You think  that you're tough, you gwan like you're rough
Intimidate a man just to call him bluff
Woii woii, you are the Babylon

You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad
You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad

You stop and you search, and you bruk inna mi house
You turn it upside down like a damn crabble house
You set up a man anyway you can
You double cross the man according to plan
Woii woii, you are the Babylon
Woii woii, you are the Babylon

You thief a man weed, put it pon the street
You get a 3 years stretch curtesy of the Queen
Woii woii, why you so wicked?
You come a man dance, you a take chance
You better watch your step or you will get lost
Woii woii, because you're so wicked

You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad
You're just robbin' and stabbin', lootin' and shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad

In the daytime you smile
In the night time you snarl
You get equipment fi get inna brawl
You let loose your dogs to set upon the wogs
You come in disguise, but everyone get wise
Woii woii, you are the Babylon

You gonna run, you gonna run, but you cannot hide, no no
Oh no, but you cannot hide...
But you cannot hide, no no
You gonna run, you gonna run, but you cannot hide, no no...Embed
