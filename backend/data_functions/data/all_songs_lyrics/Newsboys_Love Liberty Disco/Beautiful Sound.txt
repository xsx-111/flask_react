Beautiful Sound Lyrics
Turn the page, can't turn the light out
Every word every line carries to my soul
Dark letters on a page singing so loud
Where did I go wrong not to hear Your...?

Eighteen years, I guess it was alright
I let You do the thinking I'd just bide my time
Father to son, Sunday hand me down
Where did I go wrong not to hear Your song?

It's a beautiful sound
Movin' through the crowd
Voices lifted up
On high for You
It's a beautiful song
We've only just begun
To understand
Rediscovering You

To have found You and still be looking for You
It's "the soul's paradox of love"
You fill my cup, I lift it up for more
I won't stop now that I'm free
I'll be chasing You like You chase me
It's a beautiful sound
Movin' through the crowd
Voices lifted up
On high for You
It's a beautiful song
We've only just begun
To understand
Rediscovering You

Oh, something's so beautiful here

It's a beautiful sound
Movin' through the crowd
Voices lifted up
On high for You
It's a beautiful song
We've only just begun
To understand
Rediscovering You

It's a beautiful sound
Movin' through the crowd
Voices lifted up
On high for You
It's a beautiful song
We've only just begun
To understand
Rediscovering You
It's a beautiful sound
Movin' through the crowd
Voices lifted up
On high for You
It's a beautiful song
We've only just begun
To understand
Rediscovering You

Something tells me it's alright
You know it's gonna be alrightEmbed
