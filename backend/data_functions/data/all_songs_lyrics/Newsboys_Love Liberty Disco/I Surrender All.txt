I Surrender All Lyrics
I surrender all
To the promises You made
And I will give it all
To the maker of the day

No one knows your heart
And no one knows your fears
When no one solves the mysteries
Or even wipes away the tears

I surrender all
To the promises You made
And I will give it all
To the maker of the day

Can you hear the sound of laughter
From the other side of life?
There are days when I feel like a stranger sometimes
Tell me, are there any other fools like me?

I surrender all
To the promises You made
And I will give it all
To the maker of the day
This reliance on another world
Has a great effect on this world
This conscience of another world
Has a great effect on grace recollection
He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are
He only loves us 'cause of who he is
He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are
He only loves us 'cause of who he is

I surrender all
I surrender all (He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are)
To the promises You made (He only loves us 'cause of who he is)
I surrender all
And I will give it all (He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are)
To the maker of the day (He only loves us 'cause of who he is)
And I surrender all
I surrender all (He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are)
To the promises You made (He only loves us 'cause of who he is)
And I surrender all
And I will give it all (He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are)
To the maker of the day (He only loves us 'cause of who he is)
I surrender allEmbed
