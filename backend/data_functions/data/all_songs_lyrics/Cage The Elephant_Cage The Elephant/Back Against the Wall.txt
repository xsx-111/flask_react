Back Against the Wall Lyrics
Tonight, I'll have a look and try to find my face again
Buried beneath this house, my spirit screams and dies again
Out back, a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen, I've fallen to my knees

I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

Blanket of silence makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence of fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains, took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become a platform for your lies

I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

Now you know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Oh God, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Deep in the jungle, camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
A hand holds up the sky while, shamefully, I make my plea
The altar's calling, but my legs won't seem to stand
Guess I'm a coward scared to face the man I am

I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

Now you know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Oh God, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Now you know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Oh God, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall9Embed
