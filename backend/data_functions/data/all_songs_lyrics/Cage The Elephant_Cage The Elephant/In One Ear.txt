In One Ear Lyrics
They say that we ain't got the style, we ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise, tryna make the radio
I'm an antisocial anarchist who sound like so-and-so
They say I'm just a stupid kid, another crazy radical
Rock 'n' roll is dead, I probably should have stayed at school
Another Generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh, they'd love to see me fall, but I'm already on my back

So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

Now I know I'm not a saint, I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws, I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize, cast another stone
Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal, I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fucking drunk
They think they know my thoughts, but they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words they'd find a message tucked beneath
But it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit even though they never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

You hear that? You hear what's coming?
Oh, you better run for the hills
Cause we're coming to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down

Here's the moral to the story: we don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money, we don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us, go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us, adds the fire to our flames

And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit so you know we never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playing music cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand15Embed
