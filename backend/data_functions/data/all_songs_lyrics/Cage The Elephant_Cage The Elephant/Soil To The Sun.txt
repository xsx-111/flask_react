Soil To The Sun Lyrics
In the depths of my mind, I laid sleeping
Well, I had such a dream when I woke, I was weeping
The vision I saw danced around me
And my heart saw the things that my eyes couldn't see

Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screaming

"Come one, come all, come see and believe in
The truth will shine if you open your eyes
And you'll see it move as it moves on the masses
The weak will rise and give birth to the sky"
And give birth to the sky

No, it didn't stop there, it consumed me
And it crushed me with joy as its beauty swept through me
I was moved by the weight of it all
I've been touched by the light, yes, I know what i saw

Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screaming
"Come one, come all, come see and believe in
The truth will shine if you open your eyes
And you'll see it move as it moves on the masses
The weak will rise and give birth to the sky"
And give birth to the sky

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, oh

I saw the dreamers dreaming, I heard the people singing
The dinosaurs are dying, the mind control's subsiding
I saw a new path beaten, free thinkers freely thinking
Can't stop a thought from breathing, it moves like fire

The sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screaming

"Come one, come all, come see and believe in
The truth will shine if you open your eyes
And you'll see it move as it moves on the masses
The weak will rise and give birth to the sky"
And give birth to the sky, ooh2Embed
