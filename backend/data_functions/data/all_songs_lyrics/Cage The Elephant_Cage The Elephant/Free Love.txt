Free Love Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Come on girl, hey

She move so quick, she move so fast
She move so quick she make the good times last
She said even in the morning said you know that it's on
Even in the morning
Oh, oh, oh

Free love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Love
Love
Love

She like it rough, she bend them bones
She starts a-screaming when she's ready to go
She said even in the morning said you know that it's on
Even in the morning
Oh, oh, oh
Free love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Love
Love
Love

Pretty girl come with me, two on two, three on three
Passion is the flavor climbing up this tree
Make it right, move around, keep it on the underground
Just beneath the covers I can see the sea

She knocking knees, so full of pride
She make the move cause she had nothing to hide
She said even in the morning said you know that it's on
Even in the morning
Oh, oh, oh

Free love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Love
Love
Love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Free love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Love
