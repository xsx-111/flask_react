Tiny Little Robots Lyrics
When you gonna fire it up?
When you gonna fire it up?

I've got you moving to the city
Oh my, you think you're looking pretty
But they've got a pistol, too
Tucked down beneath their shoe
It's a new sensation, world annihilation
Moving through the music, patiently it's waiting
The city's screaming, I can hear them breathing
Crying out for wisdom, hungry minds are feeding

And I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot, they designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side

Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?

I've got you marching to a drumbeat
Oh, my, you got another nosebleed
They'll keep you so amused
You'll never taste the truth
It's a new creation, total domination
Chains across your shoulders, social captivation
Kill our leaders, persecute our teachers
Criticize our culture, crucify free thinkers
I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot, they designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side

Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?

Fill our eyes with money, vanity that's cunning
Only on the surface, diamonds look so stunning
Mass deception altered our perception
Sold it to the children, made a new connection

And I know that you're tired of this
Cause you're a robot, they designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side

Our sidewalks are broken, our minds have been twisted
The billboards are lying, the lies have been made
The streets are all empty, we paved them with zombies
A lost generation generically made
When amidst all the madness I saw a flower
A dream that was creeping I kept in my sight
Then it turned and it took me, an explosion, it shook me
Beauty that screams "I'm alive"4Embed
