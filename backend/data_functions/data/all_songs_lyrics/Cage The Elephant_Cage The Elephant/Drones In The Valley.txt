Drones In The Valley Lyrics
While bullets shower the earth
We turn our heads and cover our faces
Now flames devour the sky
And I hear these words in the back of my mind

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We've got no time to waste, oh which way shall we go
Is the world spinning out of control
Which way shall we go, which way shall we go
I can't believe this, it makes me sick

Fresh smell of death on your tongue
You bait the hook and here come the children
Another grave stone to sell
While you get rich in the valley of Hell

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We've got no time to waste, oh which way shall we go
Is the world spinning out of control
Which way shall we go, which way shall we go
I can't believe this, it makes me sick
The devil's creeping, he's got us eating from his dirty hands
We feast on lies which makes it hard for us to take a stand
Out in the desert there's a forest full of fallen trees
It's what they want but, no, it's not what we need


Screaming at the ceiling doesn't make it better
Slipped into a coma, lost my favorite sweater
Ask them no more questions you'll never catch them lying
It's time to make our move and strike them right between the eyes

Here we stand at this fork in the road
We've got no time to waste, oh which way shall we go
Is the world spinning out of control
Which way shall we go, which way shall we go4Embed
