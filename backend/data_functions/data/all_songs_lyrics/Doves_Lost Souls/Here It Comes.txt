Here It Comes Lyrics
This is a call
A call to all
It goes out to those who've been bad
And I should know
Because I've been
Yeah maybe once a week on Mondays

You should've seen
What I've seen
She doubles up and comes back Sunday
And she will come
Into your heart
And it goes on and on and on

Here it comes
Here comes my days in the sun
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun

This is the day
This is the time
To stare at the skies and wonder
We live a lie
You'll never find
Yeah never in a month of Sundays
You should've seen
What I've seen
He doubles up and comes back Monday
And he will come
Into your heart
It goes on and on and on

Here it comes
Here comes my days in the sun
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun
And you don't know how it feels
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sun


Here it comes
Here comes my days in the sun
Here it comes
Another time in the sun
And you don't know how it feels
Here it comes
Here comes my time in the sunEmbed
