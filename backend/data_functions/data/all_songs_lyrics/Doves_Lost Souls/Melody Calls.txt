Melody Calls LyricsShe stops out till morning
She hangs out at fairgrounds
Moving to a new sound
Waiting to forget the past
A melody calls
Loops around, a setting sun
Time to lose herself again
A melody calls
A setting sun, a melody calls
Time to lose myself again
The words don't come so easy
She can't say what's inside
The sounds they do speak for me
The sounds remain forever
Stays with her till morning timeEmbed
