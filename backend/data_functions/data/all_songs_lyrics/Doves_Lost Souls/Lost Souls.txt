Lost Souls LyricsTrying to make some sense of the days
Now that they're all good
Every little thing that they'd say
Well you know they could
She lies to console
For she cries for a lost soul
You
You know we're gone
We're all so lost, lost
Said I couldn't get out of bed
Is that the law
Every little thing that I said
You just can't ignore
She lies to console
For she cries for a lost soul
You
You know we're gone
'Cuz we're all so lost
You
You know its gone, gone
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
(She cries for, she cries for)
Lost souls
(She cries for the lost souls)
Lost souls
(We're waiting, the lost souls)
Lost souls
(This is for the lost souls)Embed
