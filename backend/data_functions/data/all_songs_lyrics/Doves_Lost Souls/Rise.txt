Rise LyricsBelly up in a sea of love
Drowning's good in a sea of funk
Drowning's good in a cedar love
I'll keep you there, I'll keep you there
So long...
So long...
City lights come back in June
Seems the sun has gone too soon
Miles away from anywhere
Feels so warm in the southern air
So long...
So long...Embed
