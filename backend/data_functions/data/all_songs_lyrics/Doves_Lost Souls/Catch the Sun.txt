Catch the Sun Lyrics
Every day it comes to this
Catch the things you might have missed
You say get back to yesterday
'Cause I ain't ever going back
Back to the place that I can't stand
But I, I miss the way you lie
'Cause I'm always misunderstood
Pulled apart and ripped in two
But I, I miss the way you lie

Catch the sun before it's gone
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone
Catch the sun, it never comes
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire

'Cause I never really understood
Why I didn't feel so good
But I, I miss the way you lie
'Cause I've always been up and down
Never wanted to hit the ground
But I, I miss the way you lie

Catch the sun before it's gone
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone
Catch the sun, it never comes
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
Good night, hey

Catch the sun before it's gone
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone
Catch the sun, it never comes
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Oh, oh, hey, my, my, my
Hey, yeah
Oh, oh, hey, my, my, my, my, my
Hey, yeah
Oh, oh, hey, my-y-y-y
Hey, yeah
Oh, oh, heyEmbed
