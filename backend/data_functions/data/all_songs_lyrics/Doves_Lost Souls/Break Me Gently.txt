Break Me Gently Lyrics
Walk inside, gets noticed
Fears conspire, they won't go away
And I know, and I see, you'll be breaking hearts again

You break me gently
Break me gently
Break me gently

Break my fall in vain
Pain won't go, rest in peace
And I look, and I see, you could be breaking souls again

And I see me, break me gently
Break me gently
Break me gently
