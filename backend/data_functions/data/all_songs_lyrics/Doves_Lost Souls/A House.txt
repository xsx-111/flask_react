A House Lyrics
It was a day like this and my house burnt down
And the walls were thin and they crashed to the ground
It was a day like this and my life unwound
You could've struck me a line and that's okay now
We could always put it together again
You could've told me a lie, and a lie so thin, so thin
Now everything's clear

Day after day and the life goes on
And I try to see the good in everyone
If I ever find myself here again
I'll give everything1Embed
