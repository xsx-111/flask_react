Dream Again Lyrics
Don't be afraid if you hear voices
Or feel the sweet air spoken upon you
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words
Of hope will reassure, show me the future
Will see us join together
If the oceans split or the mountains sigh
Then I will keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again

Don't be afraid if you're descending the deepest despair
Without a handrail to guide you
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words can confuse
But when you're sleeping
They shift and slide together
Bring meaning to the canyon's cry
Oh I, I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispers are where
You live a little fear but feel the future
Well, I feel us dream together
I feel no fear, I feel no fire
Oh I, I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream...1Embed
