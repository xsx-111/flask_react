Katherine Kiss Me LyricsKatherine, kiss me
Slippy little lips will split me
Split me where your eye won’t hit me
Yes, I love you—
I mean I, I'd love to get to know you
Sometimes I say the stupid things I think—
I mean I, sometimes I think the stupidest things
Oh and do you ever wonder
How the boy feels?
Katherine, kiss me
Flick your cigarette, then kiss me
Flick your eyes at mine so briefly
Your leather jacket lies in sticky pools of cider, blackberry
You glance a ricochet from every alpha male behind me
Eyes like marbles on a washing machine
Oh and do you ever wonder
How the boy feels?
Katherine, kiss me
In the alleyway by jakeys
Jacking in the sodium light
Yes, I love you—
I mean I, I mean I need to love
And though your opened eyes stay bored upon the overflowing pipes above me
Tonight, I don’t mind
Because I never wonder
How the girl feels2Embed
