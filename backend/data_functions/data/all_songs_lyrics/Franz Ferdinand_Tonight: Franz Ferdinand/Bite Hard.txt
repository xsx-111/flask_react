Bite Hard Lyrics
You don't know I sing these songs about you
You don't know the pseudonyms I assume
You don't know the pseudonyms I assume
For you

Are you happier now that the gods are dying?
Or do you dream of Heston with omniscient beard?
You should be happier now with no one to pray to
Or would you love to break your knees while begging and praying?

Bite hard
It's a broken smile
That's breaking their hearts
And breaking their mind
Bite hard
It's 5:05
Your engine's alive
And we ride together
Bite hard
Bite hard

I may be lonelier now but I'm happy alone, honest
It ain't lonely alone, what would we talk about anyway?
No, I'd never resort to kissing your photo, honest
I just had to see how the chemicals taste there, honey
Bite hard
It's a broken smile
That's breaking their hearts
And breaking their mind
Bite hard
It's 5:05
Your engine's alive
And we ride together
And we ride together
And we die together
Bite hard
Bite hard
Bite hard

I never
No, I never
I never
No, I never
I just had to
I just had to
I just had to
See now honey
Bite hard
It's a broken smile
That's breaking their hearts
And breaking their minds
Bite hard
It's a 5.05
Your engine's alive
We ride together
We ride together
We die together1Embed
