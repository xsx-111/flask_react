Turn It On Lyrics
It ain't easy being this kind of lover when you never call me
It ain't easy being this kind of lover, won't you ever call me
Oh, I'm dedicated, yes, I'm a forgiver
Oh, I'm dedicated, sure, I'm a giver
I'm dedicated, yes, I'm a forgiver
I'll forgive you always

Although I know you turn it on, yeah (turn it on)
Although I know you turn it on, yeah (turn it on)
Although I know you turn it on, yeah (turn it on)
Although I know you turn it on, yeah, turn it on

You don't want to know how I manage alone
Oh no, you don't want to know what goes on when I'm on my own
You don't want to know how I plan on my own, oh no
You don't want to know how I know when you're on your own

I’ll never be alone, yeah (turn it on)
You know I’d follow you to Rome, yeah (turn it on)
I know the places you call home, yeah (turn it on)
You know I’ll get you on your own, yeah, turn it on
Ah, You know I know where you are
You know I know where you are
You know

I can't have another (you turn it on)
I can't stop thinking of you (you turn it on)
If I can't have you then nobody can
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you turn it on, you turn it on
You turn it on, you turn it on
You turn it on, you turn it on
Woo, you turn it on1Embed
