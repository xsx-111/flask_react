Lucid Dreams Lyrics
I'm gonna give my aimless love
My angry heart, my desire
I woke with wings from lucid dreams
I knew the reason I felt hollow
Was that I may never know
If there is some great truth or not
There is noâ€”

I'll dream a nation of you
A new utopia for you to live in
I'll dream a nation of me
A new ambrosia that we can live in
Lucid dreams, uh-huh, yeah
I'm living in lucid dreams, uh-huh, yeah

Sweep slides on my stereo
Short wave ride my rodeo
Beat came from Addis Abylon
But I'm flying to Istanbul
Oh, so why don't you come along?

I'll dream a nation of you
A new utopia for you to live in
I'll dream a nation of me
Another Narnia where we can live in
Lucid dreams, uh-huh, yeah
I'm living in lucid dreams, uh-huh, yeah
Lucid dreams, I'm living in lucid dreams
I'm living on shortwave streams tonight
Lucid dreams, I'm living in lucid dreams
I'm living on shortwave streams tonight
I'm living in lucid dreams, uh-huh, yeah
I'm living in lucid dreams, uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
