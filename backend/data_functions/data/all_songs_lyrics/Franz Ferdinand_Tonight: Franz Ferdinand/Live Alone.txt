Live Alone Lyrics
I want to live alone
Because the greatest love
Is always ruined by the bickering
The argument of living
I want to live alone
I could be happy on my own
Live the rest of my life
With the vaguest of feeling
 (x2)
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here, I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

And so I'm going to live alone
I'm not saying that our love is the greatest
But I'm in love with you
And want to stay in love with you
So I'm going to live alone
Yeah I'll be happy on my own
Live the rest of my life
With the vaguest of feeling
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

In NYC when I get in a taxi
I say "Man" to the driver
So he'll say "Man
Oh, I can imagine
Having a drink with that guy"
"He's alright" 
 (x2)
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here, I'll be here
Wishing I could be there1Embed
