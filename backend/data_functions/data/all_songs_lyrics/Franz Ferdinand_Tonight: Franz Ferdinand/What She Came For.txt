What She Came For Lyrics
I got a question for ya, I got a question for you
Where'd you get your name from, where'd you get your name from?
I got a question for you
Where do you see yourself in five minutes' time?

With a laugh like that, or a look like that
You makes us all feel gauche like itâ€™s a smutty joke but
With a laugh like that, or a look like that
You make us all just go
La-la-la-la

Whoa, look out, you're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt
Whoa, look out, you're what she came for
She knows what she came for
No question, no doubt
Whoa
You're what she came for, whoa

I got a question for ya, another question for ya
How do you feel the, how do you feel the pressure?
Why you wearing what you're wearing?
Where will your life be gone in five minutes' time?
So say something stupid, you know that you'd love to
