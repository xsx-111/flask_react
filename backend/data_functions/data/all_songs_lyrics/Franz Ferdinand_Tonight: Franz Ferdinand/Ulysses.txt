Ulysses Lyrics
Well I sit and hear sentimental footsteps
Then a voice say, "Hi, so
So whatcha got, whatcha got this time?
C'mon, let's get high
C'mon Lexo, whatcha got next-o?
Walk 25 miles, oh
Well I'm bored, I'm bored
C'mon, let's get high
C'mon, let's get high
C'mon, let's get high, high"

Well, I found a new way
I found a new way
C'mon, don't amuse me
I don't need your sympathy
La, la-la-la-la
Ulysses
I found a new way
I found a new way, baby

Am I Ulysses? Am I Ulysses?
"No, but you are now, boy
So sinister, so sinister
But last night was wild
What's the matter, there?
Feelin' kind of anxious
That hot blood grew cold
Yeah, everyone, everybody knows it
Yeah, everyone, everybody knows it
Everybody knows ah..."
La, la-la-la-la
Ulysses
I found a new way
I found a new way, baby
La, la-la-la-la
Ulysses
I found a new way
I found a new way, baby

Oh... Oh, then suddenly you know
You're never goin' home
You're never, you're never
You're never, you're never
You're never, you're never
You're never goin' home

You're not Ulysses, oh baby, no
La-la-la-la
You're not Ulysses
La-la-la-la11Embed
