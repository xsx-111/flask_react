Lucid Dreams (Original Version) Lyrics
Sweep slides on my stereo
Short wave ride my rodeo
Beat came from Addis Abylon
But I'm flying to Istanbul
Oh, so why don't you meet me there?

There is no nation of you, there is no nation of me
Our only nation lives in lucid dreams
Lucid dreams, I'm living in lucid dreams
I'm living on shortwave streams tonight

Well, I'll dial Alexandria
If you dial into Ithaca
South Fisher, German bite
I skate on the world tonight
Oh, so why don't you come along?

There is no nation of you, there is no nation of me
Our only nation lives in lucid dreams
Lucid dreams, I'm living in lucid dreams
I'm living on shortwave streams tonight
I'm gonna give my aimless love
My angry heart, my desire
I woke with wings from lucid dreams
I knew the reason I felt hollow
Was that I may never know
If there is some great truth or not

There is no nation of you, there is no nation of me
Our only nation lives in lucid dreams
Lucid dreams, I'm living in lucid dreams
I'm living on shortwave streams tonight

Lucid dreams, I'm living on lucid dreams
Now there is just plain mystery1Embed
