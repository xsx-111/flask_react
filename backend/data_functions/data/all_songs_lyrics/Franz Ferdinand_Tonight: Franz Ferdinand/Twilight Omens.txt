Twilight Omens Lyrics
I wrote your name upon the back of my hand
Slept upon it and I woke up with it
Backwards on my face
Reading forwards from my mirror
To my heart

Twilight omens in my life
Then I hear your name
Hear the radio sing your name
Should I give you a call
What can I say
Maybe you still feel the same

I typed your number into my calculator
Where it's spelled a dirty word
When you turn it upside down
You can turn my dirty world
The right way round

Twilight omens in my life
Then I hear your name
Hear the radio sing your name
Should I give you a call
What can I say
Maybe I still feel the same
Twilight omens in my life
Keep hearing your name 
Keep hearing you sing your nameEmbed
