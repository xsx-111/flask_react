Graffiti Women LyricsGraffiti women draw pictures on the wall
Graffiti slogans and situations fall
Just made up people who wander through the rain
Graffiti people got nothing got no name
And you sleep but they'll find you
And they'll carve their number in your minds
And they steal what they want from who they want, from time to time
Graffiti women swap stories in the dark
Graffiti women take photos at the dark
And tenement people who wander through the day
Graffiti people got nothing got no name
And you sleep but they'll find you
And they'll carve their number in your minds
And they'll steal what they want from who they want, from time to time
And you sleep but they'll find you
And they carve their number in your minds
And they steal what they want from who they want, from time to time
And you'll sleep but they'll find you
And they carve their number in your minds
And so steal what you want from who you want, from time to timeEmbed
