You'll hide among the covers
And wave as the aeroplanes go by
There's nothing to say when you sleep all day
But "bye bye"
Your mind will find another
And that's where the days have gone
And all you can hear is a stereo somewhere
Playing a pig of a song
And you'll know her
Know her
When she comes
When you turn the light out, light out
She'll come
She called you from across the city
You hired a car to crawl
But with the high rise still in your eyes
You wonder who's out there at all
And you'll know her
Know her
When she comes
When you turn the light out, light out
She'll come
When you turn the light out, light out
She'll come
