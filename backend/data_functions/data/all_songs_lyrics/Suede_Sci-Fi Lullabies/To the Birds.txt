To the Birds LyricsDon't take your life cos your bicycle won't fly
You may be going to heaven tonight
Don't spoil the show for the love of some albino
You won't be going to heaven alone
I see her
By the window
Waiting every night
So I wouldn't give a shit if your bicycle's in bits
I think I'm going to heaven on it
I see her
By the window
Pour the poison from you
I'll go there
Through the window
In my sixteen hole boots
And I'll sing to the birds here at my side
And I'll sing to the birds who will save my life
Don't take your life cos your bicycle won't fly
You may be going to heaven tonight
I wouldn't give a shit if your bicycle's in bits
I think I'm going to heaven on it
I see her
By the window
And I see there's a day
We'll walk out
Through the traffic
And pour the poison away
So I'll sing to the birds there at my side
And I'll sing to the birds who will save my life
I will lie down for her
I will lie down for her
I will lie down for her
I will lie down for her
I will lie down for her
I will lie down for herEmbed
