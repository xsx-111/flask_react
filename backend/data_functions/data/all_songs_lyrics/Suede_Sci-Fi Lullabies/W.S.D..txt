W.S.D. LyricsDressed as a cowboy on top of a hill
It's sadder than it probably sounds
He gets lovely the more he's ill
Don't o.d. on him now
Dressed as a woman with horrible hair
And singing to the birds in town
Who goes walking through traffic out there
Don't o.d. on her now
Oh is it true
What they say about you?
Oh is it true
What they say about you two?
Married to me is a hungry son
Who wants to push me from the 2nd floor
We're so disco we can't get on
In this world anymore
Oh, is it true
What they say about you?
Oh, is it true
What they say about you two?
Dressed as a cowboy in a permanent gag
It's sadder than it probably sounds
So fucking what if he's licking the bag
Don't o.d. on him now
Oh, is it true
What they say about you?
Oh, is it true
What they say about you two?Embed
