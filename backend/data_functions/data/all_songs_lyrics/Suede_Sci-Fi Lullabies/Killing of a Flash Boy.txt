Killing of a Flash Boy Lyrics
All the white kids shuffle to the heavy metal stutter and go
Sh-shaking on the scene like killing machines and they know
When she's stacked up top, she's a sucker for the shotgun show
Sh-shaking obscene like killing machines, here we go

It's the same old show
He's a killer, he's a flash boy, oh
He's a killer, he's a flash boy, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Shake your fake tan through aerosol land and you'll know
That you'll suffer for your sex by the caravanettes, oh no
And that shitter with the pout won't be putting it about no more
Oh, sh-shaking obscene like a killing machine, here we go

It's the same old show
He's a killer, he's a flash boy, oh
He's a killer, he's a flash boy, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's the same old show
He's a killer, he's a flash boy, oh
This is the killing of a flash boy, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And Athena loves your body
So think of the sea, my baby
Think of the sea as you murder me
Think of the sea, my baby
Think of the sea as you murder me
Murder me, murder me
Murder me, murder me, murder me

Same old show
He's a killer, he's a flash boy, oh
This is the killing of a flash boy, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's the same old show
He's a killer, he's a flash boy, oh
This is the killing of a flash boy, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh1Embed
