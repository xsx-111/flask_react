The Big Time LyricsI watch the slow hand kill the day
See my starring role tick away
I watch the skyline for him to come
And when he comes along we'll be gone
And we'll go into the city
Into the light
We'll be there in the headlines
There overnight
Cause this is the big time
This is the way
Now he's in the big time
He'll show you the way
This is the big time
This is the way
Now he's in the big time
And you're in the wayEmbed
