My Insatiable One LyricsIn the high life, I've got this feeling now
I've got this horrible feeling
On the escalator, they took it out on him
As the ridiculous world went, oh
Oh, he is gone
He's my insatiable one
Oh, he is gone
He's my insatiable one, oh
On the high wire, dressed in a leotard
There wobbles one hell of a retard
On the escalator
We shit paracetemol
As the ridiculous world goes by
Oh, he is gone
He's my insatiable one
Oh, he is gone
He's my insatiable one
Oh, he is gone
He's my insatiable one
Oh, he is gone
And he was my inflatable oneEmbed
