Every Monday Morning Comes LyricsOh when you and I
Watch the planes go by
Silver in the sky
Do whatever we like
Oh you and me
See the birds in the sea
People on the streets
Do whatever we please
But every Monday morning comes
Every Monday morning, yeah
Oh every Monday morning comes
Every Monday morning, yeah
Oh, when you and I
Watch the London sky
Traffic rolling by
Do whatever we like
So we chase the day away
Feel the morning rain
Piss our money down the drain
And do whatever they say
But every Monday morning comes
Every Monday morning, yeah
Oh every Monday morning comes
Every Monday morning, yeah
But every Monday morning comes
Every Monday morning, yeah
Oh every Monday morning comes
Every Monday morning, yeahEmbed
