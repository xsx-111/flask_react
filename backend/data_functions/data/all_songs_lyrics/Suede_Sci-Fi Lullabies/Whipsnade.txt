We are only young
But we style our future with a cattle gun
We aren't idle rich
So we smile for tomorrow with a bitch of an itch
'Cause when the firelight shocks like a cop shop pyre
We'll sack the politics for premonition and fire
And we'll move like Nureyev at night

Coast to coast
Side to side
Shines the light of fine enlightened minds
Coast to coast

We are only young
But we style our future in the shadow of guns
We aren't idle rich
So we smile for tomorrow with a bitch of an itch
'Cause when the stylized kick of the film star whip
Cracks down on the millions
Cracks the kids on the hips
We'll be moving like Nureyev at night
'Cause coast to coast
Side to side
Shines the light of fine enlightened minds
Coast to coast
Side to side
Feel the steel that shines outside the blinds
Coast to coast
Side to side
Blades engraved with babies' names
While pylons hide the suicide
