Come unto me, my winter son
We could lie on the rails
And when the morning comes
We'll be miles away
Miles away
Slipping away while the city sleeps
Running away from this cruel disease
We're miles away
Miles away

Modern boys
Modern boys
Hand in hand, sick of the fear
Chasing away all the hungry years
We're the modern boys

Come unto me, my sickly thing
We could lie on the rails
But to really win
We'll just drive away
Drive away
Yes, the world calls, my international
So let the decades die
Let the parties fall
And we'll be miles away
Miles away
'Cause we'll be living like...

Modern boys
Modern boys
Hand in hand, sick of the fear
Chasing away all the hungry years
We're the modern boys
Modern boys
Into the night, under the stars
Jumping the lights in the silent cars
He's on your left, I'm on your right
It's so easy in the concrete nightEmbed
