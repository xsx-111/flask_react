The Sound Of The Streets LyricsShe walks the streets of summer
Inside her, there's no future
She walks the streets to pass the time
The cash machines are laughing
As plastic people passing
She walks the streets to pass the time
Sadie, Sadie, hear the sound of the streets
Insane as anything, ah-ah
Sadie, Sadie kn-knows the sound of the streets
It's the same as anything, ah-ah
She sees the midnight taxis
The toilets and the back streets
She feels the wheels and needs a line
Outside there's crazy parties
There's dames in faces laughing
So many ways to pass the time
Sadie, Sadie, hear the sound of the streets
Insane as anything, ah-ah
Sadie, Sadie kn-knows the sound of the streets
It's the same as anything, ah-ah
She walks the streets of summer
Inside her, there's no future
She walks the streets to pass the time
Inside she feels like winter
For the child that died within her
She walks the streets to pass the time
Sadie, Sadie, hear the sound of the streets
Insane as anything, ah-ah
Sadie, Sadie kn-knows the sound of the streets
It's the same as anything, ah-ahEmbed
