Europe Is Our Playground LyricsRun with me baby, let your hair down
Through every station, through every town
Run with me baby, let's take a chance
From Heathrow to Houndslow, from the Eastern block to France
Europe is our playground, London is our town
So run with me baby now
Run with me baby, let your hair down
Through every station, through every town
Run with me baby, let's make a stand
From peepshow to disco, from Spain to Camber Sands
Europe is our playground, London is our town
So run with me baby nowEmbed
