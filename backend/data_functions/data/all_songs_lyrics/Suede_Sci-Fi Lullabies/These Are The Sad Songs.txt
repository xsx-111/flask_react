These Are The Sad Songs Lyrics'Lay Lady Lay' and 'Band of Gold'
'A Day in the Life', 'And Dream of Sheep'
'Sea Song' and 'Vincent' and 'Death Disco'
Listen to the music in your sleep
These are the sad songs, the broken words
These are the sad songs, the lies you've heard
These are the good times you keep inside
These are the good things that you can have if you try
'Venus in Furs' and 'An Occasional Dream'
'Sign o the Times' and 'Bill is Dead'
'Lazyitis' and 'Big Louise'
Listen to the music in your head
These are the sad songs, the broken words
These are the sad songs, the lies you've heard
These are the good times you keep inside
These are the good things that you can have if you try
These are the sad songs, the broken words
These are the sad songs, the lies you've heard
These are the good times you keep inside
These are the good things that you can have if you try
These are the sad songs, the broken words
These are the sad songs, the lies you've heard
These are the good times you keep inside
These are the good things that you can have if you tryEmbed
