You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
You thought you'd come on and amaze me with your money
You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
Get flash get cash get phoney
You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
You thought you'd come on and amaze me with your money
You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
Get rich get stitched get lonely
So come and amaze me so come and amaze me
It takes everyone every son, every dad and every mum
Some find a one and a one turns them on, it's money
You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
You thought you'd come on and amaze me with your money
You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
Get wheels, get heels, get sloaney
You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
You thought you'd come on and amaze me with your money
You thought you'd come and amaze me honey
Get fucked, pissed up, get loaded
So come and amaze me, so come and amaze me
It takes everyone, every son, every dad and every mum
Some find a one and a one turns them on, it's money
