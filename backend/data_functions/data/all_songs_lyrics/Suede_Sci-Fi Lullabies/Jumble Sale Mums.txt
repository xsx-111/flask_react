Jumble Sale Mums LyricsOh, jumble sale mums, what are they on?
Kids just sit hanging round the street
And they've got somebody else's clothes on
Jumble sale dads, boil in the bag
Says some things that I can't repeat, and he swears...
Oh, this ain't the highlife
This ain't the highlife
This ain't the highlife
This ain't the highlife
Oh, jumble sale mums, what are they on?
Kids just sit hanging round the street
And they've got somebody else's clothes on
Jumble sale dads, now she's packed her bags
Says some things that I can't repeat, and he swears...
Oh, this ain't the highlife
This ain't the highlife
This ain't the highlife
This ain't the highlifeEmbed
