Another No One LyricsShe takes the blame takes the pain but the world smiles
Cos outside is just a taxi ride to drive away
So she packs her bag calls a cab and the world smiles
Cause inside well she feels all right and turns to say:
Yes it's the end the final showdown
Yes it's the end of our small love
You'll have to find another no one
To take the shit like I have
Well I guess this is the end
I guess this is the end
She feels the sun, phones her mum and the world smiles
'Cos outside in the morning light it's another day
So she packs her bag, smokes a fag and the world smiles
'Cos inside well she feels all right, and turns to say:
Yes it's the end, the final showdown
Yes it's the end of our small love
You'll have to find another no one
Who'll take the shit like I have
Well I guess this is the end
I guess this is the end...
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh wellEmbed
