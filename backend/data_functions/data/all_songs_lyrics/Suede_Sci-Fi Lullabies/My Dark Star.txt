My Dark Star Lyrics
In a hired car, she will come to England from the sea
And as the tide flows, the London snows will come
And from the skyline shines the lies of the government's singular history
So in a hired world, she will buy a gun

And she will come from India
With a love in her eyes that say, "Oh, how my dark star will rise."

In rented gear, 2000 years, we waited for a man
But with a tattooed tear, she'd die for us all tonight

And she will come from India
With a love in her eyes that say, "Oh, how my dark star will rise."
Oh, how the dark star
Oh, how the dark star
Oh, how the dark star will rise
And she will come from India
With a gun at her side
Or she will come from Argentina
With her cemetery eyes that say, "Oh, how my dark star will rise."
Oh, how the dark star will rise
And she will rise
She will rise
And she will rise
She will rise
And she will rise
She will rise
She will rise
She will riseEmbed
