Have You Ever Been This Low? LyricsHave you ever been this low?
The taxis take you where you wanna go
Broken windows, endless television shows
I haven't ever been so low
I am the one, oh
I sing the song, oh
My lights are on, oh
But there's nobody home, oh
Nobody home, oh
So much happening today
A thousand people come and go and stay and fade away
They draw the blinds and watch the show
Have you ever been so low?
I am the one, oh
I sing the song, oh
My lights are on, oh
But there's nobody home, oh
Nobody home, ohEmbed
