Where's all the money gone?
I'm talking to you
All up the hole in your arm
Is the needle a much better screw?

But oh, what will you do alone?
'Cause I have to go

Where is this life of fun that you promised me?
Nothing here works but your works and I mean it
I have to leave

But oh, what will you do alone?
'Cause I have to go

If I was the wife of an acrobat
Would I look like the living dead, boy?
You're on the wire and can't get back
Let's talk about the living dead
Could have had a car
Could have had it all
Could have walked in the sky
But we stare at the wall
I know where the money's gone
I know what you do
'Cause I've seen the hole in your arm
And the needle's a much better screw

But oh, what will you do alone?
Cos I have to goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
