This Time LyricsOh, day after day, every morning
The city sighs and cars collide
Oh we take the train
Through the winter hinterlands and garage bands
An we wash it away, we wash it away this grey
Wash it away
Oh, cos this time is yours and mine
Oh hear the city sound
See the lonely crowds
This scene is you and me
Oh in the lazy sun
We're the only ones
Oh, day after day, every morning
The roundabouts will take us out
Past every train in every station
Traffic signs and circle lines
Oh we wash it away, we wash it away this grey
Wash it away
Oh, cos this time is yours and mine
Oh hear the city sound
See the lonely crowds
This scene is you and me
Oh in the lazy sun
We're the only onesEmbed
