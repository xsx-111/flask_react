Watch Out Lyrics
You move like a flame of fire
Your eyes like a flash of lightning
The answer to all desire
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing

You'd better watch out
I said you'd better watch out
Watch out - anywhere you go I'll find you
Watch out - I'll be staying close behind you
And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
Oh, you'd better watch out
I said you'd better watch out

It's been kind of funny lately
You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger

You'd better watch out
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out
Watch out - anywhere you go I'll find you
Watch out - I'll be staying close behind you
And I've tired of waiting
Yes it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
So you'd better watch out
Yes I said you'd better watch out
Watch out, watch out
And I'm tired of waiting
Yes it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
I said you'd better watch out
Girl, you'd better watch out
Ah, you'd better watch out
Ooh, ah, you'd better watch outEmbed
