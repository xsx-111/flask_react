Long Black Veil LyricsTen years ago, on a cold dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
The slayer who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The scaffold stood high, eternity neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil, she cries on my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but meEmbed
