Sean LyricsSean I'd say the best one came from Tupelo, Mississippi
I'll tell you now that grown men cry and Irish girls are pretty
Sean I'd say the best one came from Tupelo, Mississippi
I'll tell you now that grown men cry and Irish girls are pretty
Uh, aye uh, aye uh, aye uh
Though fear and hurt and care can lead me to despair
I saw why I'm here the morning you appeared
Sean, I sat awhile on clouds to ask God if he's living
I should have spent some time on knees in thanks for what he's given
Uh, aye uh, aye uh, aye uh
From parents smart and strong to both of us passed on
From kings is where you come, through daughters and through sons
Through daughters and through sons
Sean I'd say the best one came from Tupelo, Mississippi
I'll tell you now grown men cry and Irish girls are prettyEmbed
