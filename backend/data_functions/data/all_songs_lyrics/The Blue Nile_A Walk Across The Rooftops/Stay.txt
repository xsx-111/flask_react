Stay Lyrics
I'm taking off this party hat
The white situation is over
New situation begins
The red guitar is broken
To beat the drum of youth again
Take too long to say

Stay, stay, stay I will understand you
Stay, I will understand you

I write a new book everyday
The love theme for the wilderness
I fit the words together
Candy girls want candy boxes
She loves the music box forever
She's crying on my shoulder

Stay, stay, stay I will understand you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will understand you

Summer girls in disarray
Can be so free and easy now
Well, we'll be free and easy
Stay, stay, stay and I will understand you
Stay, I will understand you

I write a new book everyday
A love theme for the wilderness
A love theme

Stay
Stay
Stay
