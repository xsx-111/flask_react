Bug Eggs LyricsGet these bug eggs out of our drinks!
It's unpleasant to feel one has spent more money than usual
But it was worth it
And I will be able to make the money back
Shells with eyes
Shells with bowties
Shells pressed into the wall
When I think back to some of the ways I've allowed myself to be treated, I cringe
The things I thought I had to do
I was a toasted teenage peanut
I should've tucked my teeshirt into my Y-fronts but it's too late now
I am not as fresh faced as I usеd to be
But what I've lost in that area
I'vе gained in confidence
And dress sense
And other things
Cow and boy
No worry, no care
No worry, bug eggs
Thin, outer coverings that can be cracked
No worry, bug eggs
I don't know why but you look good to me
I find I appreciate stripes for the first time
Curving round your body
Your bare mud slopes
Shells with eyes
Shells with bowties
Shells pressed into the wall
Body now feels like a body suit
Sun lands on your side and shows hairs
I'll decide what's appropriate, beachcomber
Shell that looks like a hamburgerEmbed
