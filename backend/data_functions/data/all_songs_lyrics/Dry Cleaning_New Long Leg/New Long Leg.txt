New Long Leg Lyrics
You are
No, you are
Let me see your knees
Peas rolling
A useless long leg
Are you taking a photo or drinking a bottle of water?
You’re a spoon, pal, you are

Doo doo doo, don’t remember anyone, sorry
Doo doo doo, I ask you
Sometimes like this
Sometimes like this
A useless long leg

Will there be a hairdryer in my state room or should I bring one?
What about shampoo?
Will we be able to have laundry done on the ship?
And what are the prices?
Are thеre some kind of revеrse platforms, shoes that make you go into the ground more, make you reach a lower level?
Nevermind
Would you choose a dentist with a messy back garden like that?
I don’t think so
Doo doo doo, don’t remember anyone
I ask you
Sometimes like this
Sometimes like this
A useless long leg

Sunburnt chin, a raw drawn-on eyebrow
You are
No, you are
A useless long leg
You are

Doo doo doo, don’t remember anyone, sorry
Doo doo doo, I ask you
Sometimes like this
Sometimes like this
A useless long leg

This new bloody big problem
No more shared sundae
This absolutely huge fuck upEmbed
