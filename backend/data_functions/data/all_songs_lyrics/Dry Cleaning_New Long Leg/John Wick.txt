John Wick Lyrics
No, that’s not true
Eyes drift to the TV, mostly uncles and fathers
Mostly eating nuts, seeds and berries
What do you think your parents feel?
That nod that says, “I’ve seen things”

They’ve really changed the pace of The Antiques Roadshow
More antiques, more price reveals
Less background information
The reason the price reveals were so good was because we had to wait for them
Where these bin men at then?
I like your wardrobe but I never know if it’s ok to take the clothes
Hold on to your beehive

Mostly uncles and fathers
Mostly eating nuts, seeds and berries
What do you think your parents feels?
That nod that says, “I’ve seen things”

Someone pissed on my leg in the big Sainsbury’s
If you’re an Aries
Then I’m an Aries
Raincoat sweat

A poster, an Elmo costume
A young guy on a ski holiday
Naked muscly loner
A young guy on a ski holiday
A poster, an Elmo costume
What can I say?
A drawstring dog bag
A young guy on a ski holidayEmbed
