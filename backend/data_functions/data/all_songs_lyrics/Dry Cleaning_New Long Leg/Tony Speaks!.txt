Tony Speaks! Lyrics
It's not a competition
Remember you can judge
Your achievements based on things other than
How much money you have
They built the roads
Short memories
Short memories and finger rolls
Lovely ponytail
Angry man
Writing symphony songs
In his room
Head full of gnomes
Zooming through Wales

I'm just sad about the collapse of heavy industry
I'll be alright in a bit
Buried under coal pieces
Coal gets dug up
Then piled up
Then it falls
On top of us
Coal under us, then over us
Please, not more
Father Goblin
Fathеr Goblin comes to help children brеathe
Under the desks
Big cardboard cut-out
It's Ed, Ted, Ben, Dan, Howie
It's pinky, chalky
I always thought of nature as something dead and uninviting
Wet, empty trees
But there used to be a lot more of it
Oh, right
Crawling and flapping, and turning itself over
Well, I don't live when it was like that, I live now
So, I don't get it

Tony speaks!
Holding gourd lamp, then coconut lamp
Then tin can lamp
Pets on fire, shoes on fire
I'm on fire

A submissive hand enters the cup to retrieve pomegranate seeds
A submissive hand enters the bag to gather crisps
And so, a submissive hand enters the bag to retrieve and gather, gather crisps
And so, a submissive hand enters the cup to retrieve pomegranate seeds
They built the roads
Short memories
And fifty thousand crappy stickersEmbed
