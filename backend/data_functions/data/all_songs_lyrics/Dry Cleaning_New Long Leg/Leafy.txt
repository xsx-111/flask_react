Leafy LyricsIt's my playground
Black skirt, shoes and trainers
Shane has joined the chat
It was chucking it down when I stepped out
It's not now
Come on then
Carl and Terry
"Are there llama plushies here?
In this shop?"
She's definitely in a league of her own
So just stream...
Sick of that shit
All the while
An exhausting walk in the horrible countryside
A tiresome swim in a pointless bit of sea
Knackering drinks with close friends
Thanks a lot
Simple pimple, stomach stab
What are the things that you have to clеar out?
Baking powder, big jar of mayonnaise
What about all the unеaten sausages?
Clean the fat out of the grill pan
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do now
Trying not to think about all the memories
Remember when you had to take these pills
Remember when you had to take these pills
Maybe I just need someone
Never talk about your ex
Never, never, never, never, never slag them off
Because then they know
Then they know
All the while
An exhausting walk in the horrible countryside
A tiresome swim
Knackering drinks
Thanks a lot
Simple pimple, stomach stab1Embed
