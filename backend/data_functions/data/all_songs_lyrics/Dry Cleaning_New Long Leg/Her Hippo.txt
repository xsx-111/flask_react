Her Hippo Lyrics
The house is just twelve years old, soft landscaping in the garden
An electrician stuck his finger in the plughole and shouted "Yaba!"
Her hippo
Everyday he's a dick

Strong one, no one
The man above, a name, a word
I get upset in the heat
I'm smiling constantly and people constantly step on me

His shadow looms around
A feeling of bees' legs on my face
Safe inside a secret love
Let's run!

Anyway
Mystical Shakespeare shoes
A trapped pеrson screaming
The last thing I looked at in this hand-mirror was a human arsеhole
Well, Helen's situation has really put all that in the shade now
There he goes, he doesn't care
Mostly angry, scrappy songs
And where does that romantic jealousy come from?
Te amo Manuel
Married then
Her hippo
Every day he's a dick

Strong one, great one
The man above, a name, a word
I'm smiling constantly and people constantly step on me
I'd like to run away with you on a plane but don't bring those loafers

That silly woman's done a too-straight fringe
A baby's appearance
More espresso, less depresso
Solutions for damp since 1971
"But I can rebuild!"

I'm a devious snake and I keep it in my wig room
Well...
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
I'm inside the gate, it's a tiny little area and it's rammed, everything's going great so far
Got my shorts on in preparation for the hot, these idiots in trousers they don't know what they're doing
Feel like I want to send you twenty texts
Let me know when you're inside the plane

I'm smiling constantly and people constantly step on me3Embed
