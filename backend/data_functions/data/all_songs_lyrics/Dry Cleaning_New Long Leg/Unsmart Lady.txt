Unsmart Lady Lyrics
Don't cry just drive
Good luck band
What've you been doing?
Yeah

Fat podgy
Non make-up
Unsmart lady

Call Ronny
What've you been up to?
Cool
Yeah

Fat podgy
Non make-up
Unsmart lady

If you like a girl, be nice
It's not rocket science
A tanned foot squeezed hopefully into a short boot
A Kerry Bog Pony
High fever
Hair remover
Hair remover
Hair fever
Hair remover

Don't cry just drive
Good luck band
What've you been doing?
Yeah

Fat podgy
Non make-up
Unsmart lady

Fat podgy
Non make-upEmbed
