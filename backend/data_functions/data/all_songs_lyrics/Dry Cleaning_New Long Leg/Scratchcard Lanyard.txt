Scratchcard Lanyard Lyrics
Many years have passed but you're still charming
Rows falling and exploding, you can't save the world on your own I guess
Don't send me it
You keep it
You keep it
You keep it

Weak arms can't open the door, kung fu cancel
It'll be okay, I just need to be weird and hide for a bit and eat an old sandwich from my bag

I've come here to make a ceramic shoe
And I've come to smash what you made
I've come to learn how to mingle
I've come to learn how to dance
I've come to join the knitting circle
I've come to hand weave my own bunk bed ladder in a few short sessions

It's a Tokyo bouncy ball
It's an Oslo bouncy ball
It's a Rio de Janeiro bouncy ball filter!
I love these Mighty Oaks, don't you?
Do everything and feel nothing
Wristband themepark, scratchcard lanyard
Do everything and feel nothing
Do everything and feel nothing
Pat Dad on the head
Alright, you big loud mouth
And thanks very much for the Twix
I think of myself as a hardy banana with that waxy surface and the small delicate flowers
A woman in aviators firing a bazooka
A woman in aviators firing a bazooka

I've come here to make a ceramic shoe
And I've come to smash what you made
I've come to learn how to mingle
I've come to learn how to dance
I've come to join the knitting circle
That's just child chat
Why don't you want oven chips now?

It's a Tokyo bouncy ball
It's an Oslo bouncy ball
It's a Rio de Janeiro bouncy ball filter!
I love these Mighty Oaks, don't you?
Do everything and feel nothing
Wristband themepark, scratchcard lanyard
Do everything and feel nothing
Do everything and feel nothing
You seem really together, you've got a new coat, new hair
Well, I'll tell you one thing, you've got it coming
One day you're gonna get it
