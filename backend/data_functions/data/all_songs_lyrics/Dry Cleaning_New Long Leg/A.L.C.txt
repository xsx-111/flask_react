A.L.C Lyrics
You can’t just come into my garden in your football kit
And start asking questions about who lives here
Who’s asking?

It’s a memory of a café that you loved
But you didn’t have anyone to take there
They had a sushi counter and a counter that did pastries and mixed salads
In Hendon
I’m tall when I’m young and I’m short when I’m old
I can’t change

A lonely job for £45 a day
A lonely job for £32 a day
Just take it
Things are changing

Time to shut up old actors
Time to fix old pants
Time to get fed up
Telephone call comes through the wall
A sunny day with a grey sky
A wonky parking job for cheap chocolate mousse
Things are changing
Things are changing
You
You foil beast
You foil beast
You foil beast

Talk to me in the bath
