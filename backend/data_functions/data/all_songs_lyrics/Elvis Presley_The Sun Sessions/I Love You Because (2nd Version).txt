I Love You Because (2nd Version) LyricsI love you because you understand dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
I love you because, because my heart is ligther
Honey everytime, everytime I'm walking by your side
And I love you, yes I love you because the future is a little bit brighter
And the door, the door of my happiness, you open wide
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're youEmbed
