Being in Love Lyrics
Being in love means you are completely broken
Then put back together the one piece that was yours
Is beating in your lover's breast
She says the same thing about hers
She says the same thing about hers
However, I have gotten here I have plans to be with you
And for the first time, it is working
And for the first time, it is working
And for the first time, it is working
And I am proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
Yeah, we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn

What’s left after that’s all gone I hope to never learn
But if you stick with me you can help me
I’m sure we’ll find new things to burn
'Cause we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
Yeah, we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn1Embed
