Nervous Bride Lyrics
The women are dressed up and they are up to no good
You're dressed up for liberation
You flash that fire flag you fly above
The bright hot sails of your eyes
They say vaguely goodbye
They say vaguely goodbye

There is a long delay in our words
Then there are no words
And I lay down tonight as nervous as a bride
She's not nervous but she tries
She's not nervous but she tries
And it's vaguely goodbye
And it's vaguely goodbye
And it's vaguely goodbye1Embed
