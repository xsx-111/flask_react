Coxcomb Red Lyrics
I wanted that heat so bad
I could taste the fire on your breath
And I wanted in your storm so bad
I could taste the lightning on your breath

I watched you hold the sun in your arms while he bled to death
He grew so pale next to you
The world is so pale next to you

Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black

You said every road is a good road
Between the next road and your last road
Every love is your best love
And every love is your last love
And every kiss is a goodbye
And every kiss is a goodbye

I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
He grew so pale next to you
The world is so pale next to you
The world is so pale next to you
Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black2Embed
