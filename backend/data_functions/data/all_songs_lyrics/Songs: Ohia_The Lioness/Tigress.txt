Tigress Lyrics
It's difficult not to worry about what happens next
Certain looks sort out confused looks
And certain looks sport confused looks

And I watched us talking in the mirror
And you put on that look
That says this little star wishes she weren't single

It is the eye that catches me a man protesting his worth
It is the ear that catches you putting the shake on your words
You are alert as a tigress at a common table with her fate
You can almost taste it

We'll be gone by morning or be together by then
We'll be gone by morning or be together by then
And I believe every woman has made up her mind to winEmbed
