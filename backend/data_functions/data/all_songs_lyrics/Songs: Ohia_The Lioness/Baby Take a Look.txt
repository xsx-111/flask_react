Baby Take a Look Lyrics
Baby, take a look
Baby, take a look
Baby, take a look
Look at your man
Do I look like a man who doesn’t understand
You are the one true thing
In a world full of untrue things
If you’re down on your luck
If you’re down on your luck
If you’re down on your luck
I will hold you 'til better times
I will hold you 'til better times
So baby, take that look
So baby, take that look
So baby, take that look
Look at your man
Do I look like a man who doesn’t understand?
You are the oneEmbed
