Back on Top Lyrics
There ain't nothing beyond hope
There ain't nothing beyond hope
I've been thrashed by the hope of your body
I've been thrashed by the hope of your eyes
You looked me square in the eyes
You said don't take but one thing to be your truth
You said don't take but one thing to be your truth

When I'm back on the top again
When I'm back on the top again
That is the truth
That is your truth

There ain't nothing beyond truth
I've been thrashed by the truth of your body
I've been thrashed by the truth of your eyes
You looked me square in the eyes
You said don't take but one thing to be your truth
You said don't take but one thing to be your truth

When I'm back on the top again
When I'm back on the top again
That is the truth
That is the truth
That is the truthEmbed
