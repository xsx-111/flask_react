The Black Crow Lyrics
Through sparrow black wind
A dead crow calls out to his wing
We were lightning across the whole world
We were lightning
Lightning, lightning

And the guise to black cats we made a cross when our shadows met
And the guise to black cats we made a pact when our shadows passed

Through sparrow black wind
A dead crow calls out to its wings
I'm getting weaker I'm getting thin
I hate how obvious I have been
I'm getting weaker
I'm getting weaker
I'm getting weaker
I'm getting weaker

And I look down and see the whole world
And it's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading
It's fading4Embed
