Jake Leg Lyrics
Jake leg
Steal this wine away
Flay me
Underneath the brine

Running away through the sick and the pure
"Mind your feet!" lest they firmament tread
Crawl past the soft spiraled sinewy teeth
"Soiled dove!" steal the fruit of its jaws

Lady
Keep those hounds at bay
Feed me
The fruits of Avalon

The body's a vessel, the hand finds a cure
"Flesh is weak!" and my lip needs a meal
Weak in the knees and you're wet on the floor
"Ace of staves!" we will dance evermoreEmbed
