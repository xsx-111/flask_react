Steel That Sleeps the Eye LyricsSteel that sleeps with the morningstar
Would that I could sin once more
Blades will sing over stone and field
That their song might grace our fall
Pallid limbs in the raven's thrall
Fracture sulphur honey skin
Waves are screaming abraxan hymns
So that shoreline virgins cry
Reel in place
'Til the bastards take me away
Sober taste of the eye
Steel that sleeps the eye (x4)1Embed
