The Sweetest Curse LyricsCurse with me
Profane and discreet
Make her move
Cross veins and chamomile
Soft and sweet
Seasalt silver-meat
Buried deep
In crowskin overcoat
Save your breath
This may be the last
There is no novelty here on the earth
O'saviour!
Forever threadbare and faded
Drunken and arcane
Curse the day
O'saviour!
There's rotgutted whiskey in ladles
For to ease the pain
Or drown away
Save her!
You've crushed all the bones and the cradles
All along the way
Along the way1Embed
