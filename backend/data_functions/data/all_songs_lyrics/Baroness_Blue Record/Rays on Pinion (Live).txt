Rays on Pinion (Live) LyricsSave your soul
It's bright with holes
Rays on pinion
Lay me down
Our trust lies in mighty wing
As we thrust ourselves into the drink
Pitched boats sail and ploughmen toil
To drift on and work the soil
Stow your gaze
Away these waves
Stain reflection
May we drown
This is our last goodbye
This is our final cry
This separation of bird and bone
Is an introduction to tide and lung
We've resigned ourselves to soar home
Despite these wayward raysEmbed
