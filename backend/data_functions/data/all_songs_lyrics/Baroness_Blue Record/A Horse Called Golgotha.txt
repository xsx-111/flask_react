A Horse Called Golgotha LyricsCall the boy
He's down the hollow
Cull the tide
Distill the rye
Now it's time for medication
Stallions on the eiderdown
The stained horizon
Ablaze with revolvers
Stampedes and bridles
Exorcise the family demons
Stallions on the eiderdown
The stained horizon
The dark rein and rider
The steed named GolgothaEmbed
