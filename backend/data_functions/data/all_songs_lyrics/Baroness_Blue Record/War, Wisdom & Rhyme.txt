War, Wisdom & Rhyme LyricsOnly an angel can feed
On ashes and ovaries
Blame the pagans and saints
They are one
War, wisdom and rhyme
Peach and the rattlesnake
We are grave
We are graves
We will die

Burnt confederate steel
Spoilt milk on the grave
We were wrong
War, wisdom and rhyme
Catfish and bayonet
We are grave
We are graves
We will die
Grave fire
War, wisdom and rhyme
We willEmbed
