Wanderlust (Live) LyricsPerambulation
Wading
Milk the keel through tidal slough at down
On and on
Grating and lapping at the swollen stinking skin
Imitation
Mating muscles cut through cord
Through mountain's own
On and on
Sated but engorged on mother's milk and fed as twins
Bold defecation
Raise the bow and aim for crimson dawnEmbed
