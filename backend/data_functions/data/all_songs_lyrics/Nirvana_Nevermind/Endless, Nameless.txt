Endless, Nameless Lyrics
Silence
Here I am
Here I am
Silent
Bright and clear
It's what I am
I have
Died

Mother
Mother
Mother
Mother

Death
And violence
Excitement
Right here
Died
Go to hell
Here I am
Right here
Ow!
Mother, no más
No más, mamá

Death
Is what I am
Go to hell
Go to jail
In back of that
Crime
Here I am
Take a chance
Dead
