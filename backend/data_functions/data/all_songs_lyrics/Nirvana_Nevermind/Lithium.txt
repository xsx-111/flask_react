Lithium Lyrics
I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you, broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day for all I care, and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze, 'cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head, and I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've hurt, but I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there, and I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack

I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you, broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day for all I care, and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze, 'cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack150Embed
