Territorial Pissings Lyrics
Come on, people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

Never met a wise man
If so, it's a woman

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there!
Gotta find a way! Aah! Aah!
