On a Plain Lyrics
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do? (Ooh, ooh)

I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)
I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do? (Ooh, ooh)

I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)
I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done and I can go home
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do? (Ooh, ooh)

I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)
I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)
I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)
I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)
I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)24Embed
