Kiss Of The Velvet Whip LyricsFeel the pain burning, reaching up your spine
How your body shudders higher as you climb
You're reaching for the sky as the lash descends
Tingling stars of fire, burning in your head
Lightning in your opening eyes, bursting thoughts of power
Feel the velvet whip turning sweet thoughts to sour
Feel the pain burning, reaching up your spine
How your body shudders higher as you climb
You're reaching for the sky as the lash descends
Tingling stars of fire, burning in your head
Lightning in your opening eyes, bursting thoughts of power
Feel the velvet whip turning sweet thoughts to sour
Down and down you slowly slide
Your burning body under mine
Together a world with legs entwined
Silky skin with hardened lines
The scent of leather in the air
The colours change not really there
You taste the sweetness of the pain
Will you ever climb so high again?
Feel the pain burning, reaching up your spine
How your body shudders higher as you climb
You're reaching for the sky as the lash descends
Tingling stars of fire, burning in your head
Lightning in your opening eyes, bursting thoughts of power
Feel the velvet whip turning sweet thoughts to sour
Down and down you slowly slide
Your burning body under mine
Together a world with legs entwined
Silky skin with hardened lines
The scent of leather in the air
The colours change not really there
You taste the sweetness of the pain
Will you ever climb so high again?
Feel the pain burning, reaching up your spine
How your body shudders higher as you climb
You're reaching for the sky as the lash descends
Tingling stars of fire, burning in your head
Lightning in your opening eyes, bursting thoughts of power
Feel the velvet whip turning sweet thoughts to sourEmbed
