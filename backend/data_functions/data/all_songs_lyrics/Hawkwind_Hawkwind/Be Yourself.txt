Be Yourself Lyrics
Be yourself, see yourself
I can see others like me
Be yourself, see yourself
Try and find peace of mind
Be yourself, see yourself
Be yourself, see yourself
Be yourself


Be yourself, see yourself
I can't find peace of mind
Be yourself, see yourself
I can see others like me
Be yourself, see yourself
Be yourself, see yourself
Be yourself, see yourself
Be yourselfEmbed
