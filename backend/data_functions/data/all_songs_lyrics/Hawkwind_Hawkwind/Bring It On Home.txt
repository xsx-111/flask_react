Bring It On Home LyricsWell, I bought my ticket and I got my load
And the conductor yells "now all aboard"
Well, I take my seat and I sit right back
And I watch that train go down the tracks
I said, "Baby"
I said, "Baby
Gonna bring it on home now
Gonna bring it on home now
Gonna bring it on home now"
Well, I bought my ticket and I got my load
And the conductor yells "now all aboard"
Well, I take my seat and I sit right back
And I watch that train go down the tracks
I said, "Baby"
I said, "Baby
Gonna bring it on home now
Gonna bring it on home now
Gonna bring it on home now"Embed
