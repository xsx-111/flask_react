I Hate This Town Lyrics
Horrifying as it was for me
To see your face today
I guess I knew that it would happen at some point
And I dreaded it because I knew
That you would be so kind
You're good at that, you've got it right down to a science

So you observe the strict rules laid out in the books of etiquette
And tell me you hope I enjoy my stay
And I feel numb, and I can't believe
That I was stupid enough to leave my bed today
If I'm so smart, then why is this happening?

You know, I hate this fucking town
You cannot even leave your fucking house
Without running into someone who no longer cares about you
Somebody whom you desperately want to see
But you know it's only going to cause more grief
'Cause there is nothing left to say
And he can't hear you anyway

It's so confusing 'cause I really want
To hate you, but my intellect reminds me
That that doesn't make no sense
And I wanted to be your friend
But I couldn't pull it off in the end
And I'm disappointed with myself because I thought I could
But then again you always made it clear
That you do not care either way
Which begs the question
"How can I still claim to love you?"
You told me time and time again
That you don't lose, you always win
And that to make an effort would just be beneath you

You know, I hate this fucking town
You cannot even leave your fucking house
Without running into someone who no longer cares about you--
Somebody whom you desperately want to see
But you know it's only going to cause more grief
'Cause there is nothing left to say
He can't hear you anyway

Now, I'm packing my bags again
And you are not inside of themEmbed
