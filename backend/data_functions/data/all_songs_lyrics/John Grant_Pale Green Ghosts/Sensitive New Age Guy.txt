Sensitive New Age Guy Lyrics
Take Picasso, Otto Dix, and some Salvador Dali
Accompanied by Wagner, plus some Public Enemy
She isn't any of these things, and she would never want to be
She's a special kind of thing made from a secret recipe

He had a deeper understanding of the state that we are in
She didn't run away and hide, she stayed right through the bitter end
He demanded our attention, and we tried to do our best
She was taking us to school, but most of us would fail the test

She's just a sensitive new age guy
You came to the wrong place if you came to see her cry
If you only have the guts, then please look deep into her painted eyes
You could be a better human she just wants to see you try

He always played the good cop to her fabulosity
Where she had been they had to replace light bulbs constantly
'Cause she could only always be the brightest in the room
She had a special way of preaching glamour mixed with doom

With just a simple quip she'd wipe that smirk right off your face
And replace it with a smile while demonstrating latex grace
And with time I saw him less and less. I don't know where he went
But it was I who ran away to some far foreign speaking place
She's just a sensitive new age guy
You came to the wrong place if you came to see her cry
If you only have the guts, then please look deep into her painted eyes

She's just a sensitive new age guy
You came to the wrong place if you came to see her cry
If you only have the guts, then please look deep into her painted eyes
You could be a better human she just wants to see you tryEmbed
