GMF Lyrics
You could probably say I'm difficult
I probably talk too much
I overanalyse and overthink things;
Yes, it's a nasty crutch
I'm usually only waiting for you to stop talking so that I can
Concerning two-way streets, I have to say that I am not a fan

But I am the greatest motherfucker that you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head, down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget, you could be laughing sixty-five percent more of the time
You could be laughing sixty-five percent more of the time

Half of the time I think I'm in some movie
I play the underdog of course
I wonder who they'll get to play me
Maybe they could dig up Richard Burton's corpse
I am not who you think I am
I am quite angry, which I barely can conceal
You think I hate myself
It's you I hate, because you have the nerve to make me feel

But I am the greatest motherfucker that you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head, down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget, you could be laughing sixty-five percent more of the time
You could be laughing sixty-five percent more of the time
I should have practiced my scales
I should not be attracted to males
But you said that I should learn to love myself
Make up your mind, Doctor Frankenstein

‘Cos I am the greatest motherfucker that you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head, down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget, you could be laughing sixty-five percent more of the time
You could be laughing sixty-five percent more of the time

‘Cos I am the greatest motherfucker that you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head, down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget, you could be laughing sixty-five percent more of the time
You could be laughing sixty-three percent more of the time
You could be laughing twenty-five percent more of the timeEmbed
