Ernest Borgnine Lyrics
How much is enough? That's a really tough question
You ought to give it some thought sooner or later
Got off of the hooch and the crack and skipped the smack down
But then you had to find yourself a lower low
Doc ain't lookin' at me - says I got the disease
Now what did you expect? You spent your life on your knees
It was never too late. Tell me - what were you afraid of?
Do the numbers in your head or get out your calculator

I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do

Sorry that you think you had it rough in the first world
You ought to get out a map sooner than later
Knowledge has turned into a trap; you have to slow down
Get out of your head and spend less time alone
But you never learn, you get your labyrinth on
You lay awake at night and think that you are getting old
You don't need to panic now; you got time to do that later
You're the Jack who's chasing Danny outside in the snow
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do

I got to meet him once, and he was really, really cool
And when I think about everything's that he's been through
I wish he'd call me on the phone and take my ass to school


I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do
I wonder what Ernie Borgnine would do

I got to meet him once, and he was really, really cool
And when I think about everything's that he's been through
I wish he'd call me on the phone and take my ass to schoolEmbed
