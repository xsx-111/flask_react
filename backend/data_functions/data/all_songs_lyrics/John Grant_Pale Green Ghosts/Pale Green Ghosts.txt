Pale Green Ghosts Lyrics
Back then I often found myself
Driving on the road at night
And the radio was broadcasting the ocean
Warm late spring wind whips through my hair
I am right here, but I want to be there
And no one in this world is gonna stop me

Pale green ghosts at the end of May
Soldiers of this black highway
Helping me to know my place
Pale green ghosts must take great care
Release themselves into the air
Reminding me that I must be aware

At 25 and 36 to Boulder
I was getting warm
But now I'm getting colder
And I stomp my feet ammending like a child
I hope you get everything you wanted boy
I hope you conquer the world and turn it into your toy
But don't come crying when you're forced to learn the truth

Pale green ghosts at the end of May
Soldiers of this black highway
Helping me to know my place
Pale green ghosts must take great care
Release themselves into the air
Reminding me that I must be aware

Pale green ghosts at the end of May
Soldiers of this black highway
Helping me to know my place
Pale green ghosts must take great care
Release themselves into the air
Reminding me that I must be awareEmbed
