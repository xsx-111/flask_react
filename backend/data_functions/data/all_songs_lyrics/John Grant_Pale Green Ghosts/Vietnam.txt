Vietnam Lyrics
To say that I'm a man undone
Is understatement at its worst
I was completely incapacitated
By your southern charm
It hit me like an ancient gypsy curse
But this instrument you use with such precision
It's like a concrete wall
A thousand meters tall
And I've tried to climb its icy walls a million times
But I simply cannot find inside of me
The requisite resolve

Your silence is a weapon
It's like a nuclear bomb
It's like the Agent Orange
They used to use in Vietnam
And it's accompanied by an apathy
That's deafening to the ears
You know it is complete and perfect
And you wield it without fear

It isn't complicated; you just don't care
You attack me by not saying anything
You say that you don't bring your anger to me
But it poisons every fiber of your being
Now you started something that you cannot finish
And left me standing in the wreckage on my own
And the only thing that brings me any comfort
Is the knowledge is that, no matter who you're with
You'll always be alone
Your silence is a weapon
It's like a nuclear bomb
It's like the Agent Orange
They used to use in Vietnam
And it's accompanied by an apathy
That's deafening to the ears
You know it is complete and perfect
And you wield it without fear

Your silence is a weapon
It's like a nuclear bomb
It's like the Agent Orange
They used to use in Vietnam
And it's accompanied by an apathy
That's deafening to the ears
You know it is complete and perfect
And you wield it without fearEmbed
