All Right Now Lyrics
It's all here now
It's all here now
It's all here now
It's always been here
It's all right now
It's all right now
It's all right now
It's always been right

You do not have to leave
Or go out walking, dear
You do not have to reach out
To somebody near
You do not have to hold her
In your fingertips
It's always been there with you
You are what it is

And it's all right now
It's all right now
It's all right now
It's always been right
All right
All right
All right
All right
I hear you in my thoughts
I see you in my dreams
I know you're on my mind
And you are everything
Stay and stay awhile
And it still reminds I'll be here
And start it

All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now1Embed
