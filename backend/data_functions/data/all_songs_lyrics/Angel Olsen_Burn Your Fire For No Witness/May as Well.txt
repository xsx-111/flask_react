May as Well Lyrics
It may as well have been forgotten
Or did it simply slip your mind?
Is that my heart there splitting open?
I guess it just fell to the side

I've tried my best to keep you smiling, love
Maybe it's been all in vain
But I would try a million times, my dear
Tell me would you do the same?

One could say it's complicated, love
Like nothing they've seen before
Or simply that it is a thought we share
Forever it must be ignored

If you really love me, there's no way to tell
I'm always arriving when you say farewell
In all of my dreams we are husband and wife
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my life2Embed
