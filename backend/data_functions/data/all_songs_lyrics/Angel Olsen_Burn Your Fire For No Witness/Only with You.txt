Only with You LyricsYou can love, you can love, you can lose
When it all looks the same
You can love, you can love, you can lose
When you're tired of playing
Here I am, there you are
I don't know where we're going
Or where we have been
I look back when I know
It's not there where I left
Have to find it again
Or the feeling I had when it had me
It was only with you
Here it is, there it goes
Was a force of its own just passing through
You can love, you can love, you can lose
When it all looks the same
You can love, you can love, you can lose
Even at your own game
You can look, you can look, you can see
What you wanted to see
All your life you've been looking
Whatever it is, you don't find it in me
All your life you've been looking
Whatever it is you don't find it in me
All your life you've been looking
Whatever it is you don't find it in me
You don't find it in me
You don't find it in me
You don't find it in me
You don't find it in me2Embed
