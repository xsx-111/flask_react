Hi-Five LyricsI feel so lonesome I could cry
But instead I'll pass the time
Sitting lonely with somebody lonely, too
Well, there’s nothing in the world I’d rather do
Now tell me if you don’t feel this way
But all I want, all I ever need
Is someone out there to believe
Sometimes believe
Not always believe
Sometimes believe
Now we don’t have to take it too extreme
We'll keep our hands, our legs, even our lips apart
But I’m giving you my heart, my heart
Are you giving me your heart?
Your heart
Are you lonely too?
Are you lonely too?
Hi-five, so am I
All of your life
Stuck in time
I’m stuck, too
I’m stuck with you, I do, I do
Do you believe?
Of you, of you3Embed
