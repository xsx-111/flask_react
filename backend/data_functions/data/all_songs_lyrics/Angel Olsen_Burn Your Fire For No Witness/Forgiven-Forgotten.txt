Forgiven/Forgotten LyricsAll is forgiven
Alright, you are forgiven
If there's one thing I fear
If there's one thing I fear
It's knowing you're around
So close but not here
So close
Oh, but not with me here
So close
But not with me here
All is forgotten
All is forgotten
I've made up my mind
I've made up my mind
I've wasted my time
Making up my mind
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
But I love you
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Will you ever forgive me
A thousand times through
For loving you?
For loving you?
For loving you?3Embed
