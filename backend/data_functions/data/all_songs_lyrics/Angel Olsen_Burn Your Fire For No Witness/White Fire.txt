White Fire LyricsEverything is tragic, it all just falls apart
But when I look into your eyes, it pieces up my heart
If I only had an answer to put it all to bed
I wish sometimes I could take back every word I've said
I walk back in the night alone, got caught up in my song
Forgot where I was sleeping, none of the lights were on
I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
I laughed so loud inside myself, it all began to hurt
So I turned on a picture show, I disappeared the lines
As memories came flooding in, the tears blew out my eyes
I see an elevator a moment I am above
I look for you or someone who can still remind me of
The tight grip and the sun lick
And the calm way of all things summer
When it's all here, and it's all new
And you're not hungover
Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
When you don't know that you're wrong
Or just how wrong you are
My feet are always heavy as I inch toward the door
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves a hundred times before
But I guess we're always leaving even when we look the same
And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change
If you've still got some light in you, then go before it's gone
Burn your fire for no witness; it's the only way it's done
Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground and run5Embed
