Lights Out LyricsIf you don't feel good about it, then turn around
If you really mean it, baby stand your ground
No one's gonna take it for you, darling it's true
No one's gonna make it for you
If you feel like quitting now, then try a little harder
The things we need the most they seem to take a little longer
No one's gonna try it for you, darling no one
No one's gonna wait there with you
Just when you thought you would turn all your lights out it shines
Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind
If you don't believe me, you can go ahead and laugh
If you've got a sense of humor, you're not so bad
No one's gonna hear it the same as it's said
No one's gonna listen to it straight from your head
If you feel like running out, then stand in one place
When you're still and when you run there's something to face
No one's gonna see your life through, there's no way
I wouldn't want to know what you see every day
If you don't feel good about it, then turn around
If you really mean it baby, stand your ground
No one's gonna take it for you, darling it's true
No one's gonna wait there with you
Just when you thought you would turn all your lights out, it shines
Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind4Embed
