High & Wild LyricsYou're gone, you're gone
You're with me but you're gone
A feeling once so strong
Is now an old and forgotten song
You don't sing so high and wild
You don't sing so high and wild
You're here, you're here
But your spirit's disappeared
Off to some place that I don't know
Some human thing has squashed your soul
And I don't recognize you
I wish that this could turn our thing to bliss
And we could put our fears aside
And learn to laugh and be alive
And let our bodies be revived
But you can't
Say that you want me
What am I supposed to think? That's the truth?
Well, has it ever been easy for you?
To stand behind the things that I do
I wait for this to pass
For us to both say at last
On this dark and narrow path
The sun is shining and we remember what it is we're living for
I'm neither innocent or wise when you look me in the eyes
You might as well be blind
You might as well be blind
Cause you don't see me anymore
And you
You can't tell me that you love me
When I'm standing in your way
Well this would all be so much easier
If I had nothing more to say
Well this would all be so much easier
If I had nothing more to say
If only if only
I had nothing more to say
Oh if only if only
I had nothing more to say4Embed
