Iota LyricsIf only all our memories were one
We only had to blink, and it was done
If all the world could see it with one eye
In perfect color to the perfect sky
If only we could turn ourselves around
And all the things we're looking for were found
If only we grew wiser with each breath
If only we could dance our way to death
If only all our dreams were coming true
Maybe there'd be some time for me and you
If only all the world could sing along
In perfect rhythm to the perfect song
If only all our hopes were to be here
We'd just close our eyes when we want to disappear
If only all the love we needed was gained
If only we could always stay the same
If only we could always stay the same
We close our doors and then we go to bed
Weâ€™d never have to do it all again
There wouldn't be one thing to fight about
And time would turn our bodies inside out
And time would turn our bodies inside out4Embed
