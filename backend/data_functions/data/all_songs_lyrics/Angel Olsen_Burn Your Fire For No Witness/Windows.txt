Windows LyricsWon't you open a window sometimes?
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?
The wind in your hair, the sun in your eyes
Light
Light
We throw our shadows down
We must throw our shadows down
We live and throw our shadows down
It's how we get around
In the sun
In the sun
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Are you blind?
Are you blind?
Are you blind?
Are you dead already?
Are you alive?
Are you alive?
Won't you open a window sometime?
Won't you open a window sometime?
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?
The wind in your hair, the sun in your eyes
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?7Embed
