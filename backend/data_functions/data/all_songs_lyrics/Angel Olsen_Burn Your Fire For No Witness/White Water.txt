White Water Lyrics
I'm white water
White water
Oh, down upon her
Down upon her

She wants to be pure unsprouted
She wants to be unsprouted pure
She wants to hold unborn child
She wants to be child unborn

White
White water
White water
I'm white water
White water

She wants to be clean desire
She wants to be naked and never again
She wants to be never again nobody
She wants to be clean desire
She wants to be clean desire
She wants to be naked and never again
She wants to be never again nobody
She wants to be clean desire
I'm white water
White water
Oh, down upon her
Down upon her
White
White water
White water
I'm white waterEmbed
