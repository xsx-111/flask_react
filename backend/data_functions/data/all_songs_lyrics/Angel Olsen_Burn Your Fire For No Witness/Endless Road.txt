Endless Road Lyrics
Well, every road I see leads away from me
There's not a single one that leads me home
The road keeps saying, "Friend, come see what's round the bend"
So is it any wonder that I roam?

All the places I have been keep calling me back again
Down in the pines, I hear the cold winds blow
My heart keeps telling me, "Footloose and fancy-free"
And the road goes by and calls me as it goes

Maybe somewhere there's a someone waiting there with a smile
And maybe there'll be a place to stop and rest awhile
And maybe you weren't meant to be just a rolling stone
And there's a road to travel on that leads you back to home

Oh, but I'll keep traveling on, keep looking at the dawn
Till I can lay this lonesome body down
And when that day has come, I nevermore will roam
And every road I see will lead me home1Embed
