Stars LyricsI think you like to see me lose my mind
You treat me like a child I'm angry, blind
I feel so much at once that I could scream
I wish I had the voice of everything
I wish I had the voice of everything
To scream the animals, to scream the earth
To scream the stars out of our universe
To scream it all back into nothingness
To scream the feeling 'til there's nothing left
To scream the feeling 'til there's nothing left
I'll close my eyes
I'll close my eyes and try to breathe for the world
Well you could change my mind with just a smile
And just before I turn to leave, I think
I could use the thoughts you've given me
Oh, I could use the thoughts you've given me
To sing the animals to sing the earth
To sing the stars into our universe
To sing it all back into something new
To sing for life, for myself, and maybe you
Wish I had the voice of everything, sometimes
Wish I had the voice of everything
I'll close my eyes
I'll close my eyes so tightly for the world
Oh for the world
Oh for the world
