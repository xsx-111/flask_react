Comes the light
Comes the flame
Comes the child who is
Come the sword
Come the flame
Come the end of bliss's reign
Come the dawn
Come the day
Wake the softest soul up
Come the fire
Come the change
Lick the rose of Venus' shame
Come the night
Come the death
Down the path out of

Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven come
And seven go
And seven
Still remain, yeah
Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven on the grandest scale
And seven
Still remain, yeah, yeah

And the light
And the flame
Take the path on
And the night
And the day
Fall upon the knees of
And the child
In the flames
Casted out of Eden

Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven come
And seven go
And seven
Still remain, yeah
Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven on the grandest scale
And seven
Still remain, yeah, yeah

Seven on
Seven on
Seven on
Grandest scale
Remain, yeahEmbed
