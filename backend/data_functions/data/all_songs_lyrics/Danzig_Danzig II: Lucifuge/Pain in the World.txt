Pain in the World Lyrics
Heart full of Hell
Room to burn
Heart full of something unclean
Dreadful to know
Fair in the mirror
Hard on the soul
They should have known it from birth
Pain had come to this world

Crying
Pain has come to the world
Dying
Pain in the world

Heart full of sin
Breeds so slow
Should have killed it from birth
This treacherous son
Angel of wisdom
See how it's grown
Agony's bastard of lies
Coming down upon
Crying
Pain has come to the world
Dying
Pain in the world

Heart full of Hell
Indifferent and cold
Heart full of misery's seed
You should have learned
Hate is your mirror
Like it or don't
Angel of suffering smiles
Coming down from above

Crying
Pain has come to the world
Dying, yeah
Pain in the world
Crying
Dying, yeah2Embed
