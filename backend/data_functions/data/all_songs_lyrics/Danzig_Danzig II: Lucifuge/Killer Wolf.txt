Killer Wolf Lyrics
I'm the wolf
I'm the one you want
I'm the killer wolf
I'm 'onna pound you home
I'm the wolf
Howlin' all night
I curl up next to you
When you're all alone

When I go inside your little girl, and I do
When I come inside your little...

Just one kiss, yes
From my lips
Rake your soul
Over burning coals

I'm the wolf
Howlin' all night
I'm the king wolf
I put the chill in your bones
I'm the wolf
Hunting you down
I ain't no back door wolf
I don't scratch at no doors
When I go inside your little girl, and I will
When I come inside your little girl

Just one kiss, yes
From my lips
Rake your soul
Over burning coals
Just one touch
From my love
Make you howl
'Til the sun comes up
I'm the wolf

When I go inside your little girl, and I will
When I come inside your little girl

Just one kiss, yes
From my lips
Rake your soul
Over burning coals
Just one touch, yes
From my love
Make you howl
'Til the sun comes up
I'm the wolf
Howlin' all night
I'm your killer wolf
Whatever you want
I'm the wolf
Howlin' all night
I'm your wolfEmbed
