Blood & Tears Lyrics
Blood and tears
Blood and tears
Since you've been gone
I hear you've been crying
Blood and tears

All alone in your misery
So alone
Could you have been deceived
Since I've been gone
I hear you been crying

You cry a thousand tears
Darling don't despair
I know your heart still bleeds
Darling don't you care
There's blood in your tears

All alone in your misery
So all alone
You are lost, endlessly
Since you've been gone
I hear you been crying
You cry a thousand tears
Darling don't despair
I know your heart still bleeds
Darling don't you care
You cry a thousand tears
Darling don't despair
I know your heart still bleeds
Darling don't you care
There's blood in your tears


Yeah, you cry a thousand tears
Darling don't despair
I know your heart still bleeds
Darling don't you care
Yeah, you cry a thousand tears
Darling don't despair
I know your heart still bleeds
Darling don't you care

There's blood in your tears
There's blood in your tears
Blood and tears
Blood and tears
Blood and tears1Embed
