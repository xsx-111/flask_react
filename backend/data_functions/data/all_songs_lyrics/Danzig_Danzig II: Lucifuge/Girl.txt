Girl Lyrics
Girl
Let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the stars to reach us, girl

Girl
I'm gonna take you hard
I'm gonna bring you higher
Than your mind can take you

Girl
Let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the world to reach us girl

Girl
Let's flee the light
Diaphanous
Let's slip into the night

Girl
I'm gonna slip inside
I'm gonna slip inside
Fly on fire to your mind
Girl
I'm gonna take you hard
Gonna take you harder
Than your body can take you

Girl
Let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the stars to reach us, girl
Yeah


Girl
Let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the stars to reach us, girl
Yeah

Girl
Let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
Yeah
Let's climb too high
Let's climb too high1Embed
