Long Way Back from Hell Lyrics
Sold into slavery down in New Orleans
Goddess of the bayou light
Black dog's head on the killing bed
Severed and left to bleed
There on fire in the corner of the world
There in misery
There on fire in the corner of the world
Left for God to see

Do you want to take a life
Do you want to cross that line
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

Poison father of the human race
God of the tainted blood
Malevolence sneaking up the spine of the world
Ready for the bastard son
There on fire in the veins of man
There in misery
There on fire in the veins of man
Left for God to see
Do you want to take a life?
Do you want to cross that line?
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

Do you want to take a life?
Do you want to take a life?
Do you want to cross that line?
Do you want to cross that line?
Wanna cross that line

Sold into slavery down in New Orleans
Goddess of the bayou light
Black dog's head on the killing bed
Severed and left to bleed
There on fire in the corner of the world
There in misery
Lucifer's face in the mirror when you look
Left for God to see

Do you want to take a life?
Do you want to cross that line?
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me
And it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to goEmbed
