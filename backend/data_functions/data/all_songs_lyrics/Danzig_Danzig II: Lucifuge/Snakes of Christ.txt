Snakes of Christ Lyrics
Time to run, yeah
Time to hide
Holy War in the land of fire
Never tempt the wrath of gods
Gonna dance in the death of life
Take your hand, enter the world
Just remember you will surely die
Never sell evil for lies
Gonna give to you the kiss of life

Serpents of your Lord
Crawling to the will of god
Serpents of your Lord
Crawling
All evil

Serpent Jesus, Snake of Christ
Nailed to a cross of a holy design
Blood to water, water to wine
Whip the soul till a mother cries
Bring it down, baby, pierce the side
Start the legend with a funeral rite
Serpent Jesus, Snake of Christ
Gonna build you a world of lies
Serpents of your Lord
Crawling to the will of god
Serpents of your Lord
Crawling
All evil

Oh yea
Oh yea
Oh yea
Crawling

Serpent Jesus, Snake of Christ
Nailed to a cross of a holy design
Blood to water, water to wine
Whip the soul till a mother cries
Bring it down, baby, pierce the side
Start the legend with a funeral rite
Serpent Jesus, Snake of Christ
Gonna build you a world of lies

Serpents of your Lord
Crawling to the will of god
Serpents of your Lord
Crawling
All evilEmbed
