Done Got Old LyricsWell, I done got old
Can't do the things I used to
'Cause I'm an old man
Well, I done got old
Well, I done got old
I can't do the things I used to do
'Cause I done got old
Remember the day, baby
That done passed and gone
When I could love you
Most all night long
But now things gone changed
And I done got old
I can't do the things I used to do
'Cause I'm an old man
I can't look like I used to
I can't walk like I used to
I can't love like I used to
And now things gone changed
When I done got old
I can't do the things I used to do
Because I'm an old man
And I'm an old man
I'm an old man
I'm an old man
And I'm not the same
I'm a very old manEmbed
