Honey Bee LyricsSail on sail on my little Honey Bee sail on
Sail on sail on my little Honey Bee sail on
I don't mind you sailing
But please don't sail so long
Sail on sail on my little Honey Bee sail on
Sail on sail on my little Honey Bee sail on
You gonna keep on sailing
Take me to your happy home
I hear a lot of buzzing, sound like my little Honey Bee
I hear a lot of buzzing, sound like my little Honey Bee
She been all around the world making honey
But now she's coming back home to me
I hear a lot of buzzing, sound like my little Honey Bee
I hear a lot of buzzing, sound like my little Honey Bee
She been all around the world making honey
But now she's coming back home to meEmbed
