Lady Strange Lyrics
Ow
Ooh yeah
Oh
I never needed love before
Until I met you girl
A girl like you I have never seen
You came into my life like a whirlwind girl
You let me know what loving really means

Lady strange, oh lady strange I want you
Lady strange, oh lady strange I need you

You got me where you want me girl
So no messing around
You know I never played that hard to please
I've been here many times before
And walked this sacred ground
But this time you got me on my knees
You got me
 

Oh you're so strange
Oh oh oh
Taking love from you's like taking candy from a baby
But lady strange there is no stranger lady
No
Just you and me we make love, good love
So let me know what loving really means
Woman please

I need you
I want you
YeahEmbed
