No No No Lyrics
Oh yeah
She was a foxy rocker, a roxy roller
An unchained sex machine
Yeah
Slipping, sliding, electric gliding
And boy she was mean, I said mean
High class dealer, sipping her tequila
Coming on pretty strong
Real love stealer, rebel rousing squealer
She said go but I said no

I kept saying no, no no no no no
I kept saying no, no no no no no

Waiting at the back door
Couldn't take it anymore
Didn't know where she'd been
She looked pretty neat, turning on the heat
And only seventeen, seventeen
Winding her up, bringing her down
She wanted it just the same
Said stick around, that's when I found
I only had myself to blame

High class dealer, sipping on tequila
Coming on really strong
Rhythm stealer, rattle off squealer
She said go but I said no

Well I kept saying no, no no no no no
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no

I say no no no
I say no no no
I say no no
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no noEmbed
