On Through the Night Lyrics
The wait is done, the battle's won
So count the cost before you run
'Cause on and on your time was power
The clock on the wall ticks away the hours
Come on down, you're flying high
You'll never win if you never try
Stop the hate, carry the load
Come on, get this show on the road

On through the night
You can't stop me now
On through the night
You won't stop me anyhow

The stakes are high and getting higher
I'm flat on my face and you call me liar
I'm watching you, you're watching me
You're watching every move that I can see
My reputation's still at stake
I play it safe for safety's sake
Your ego and your promises
Are going to fade again and again
On through the night
You won't stop me now
On through the night
You won't stop me anyhow, not anyhow

All you want to hear is the audience applause
You can't get on stage for a country clause
And the road ahead seems a little rough
If you want to know my feelings, I say that's tough, that's tough

Your wheels ain't turning, you're out of gas
You pay by check but they take cash
Two roads ahead but which to take
And you can't see it's your mistake
They're waiting for you, they're waiting for me
And what seems like eternity
It's all tradition, they'll get you yet
In rock and roll, there's no safety net

On through the night
Can't stop me now
On through the night
Can't stop me anyhow
On through the night
Going on and on, on and on
On through the night
You can't stop me anyhow
Oh no, not anyhowEmbed
