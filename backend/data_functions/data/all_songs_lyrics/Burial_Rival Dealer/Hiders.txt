Hiders LyricsThere's a kid somewhere
You are the sound, it flies
The sound flies home
Out of the dawn
I will always protect you
Always protect you
You are the sound, it flies
The sound flies home
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be alone
You are the sound, it flies, the sound flies home
Come down to us
You going to take me away?4Embed
