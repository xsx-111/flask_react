Ike & Tina Lyrics
If you smile, I swear, girl, I'll dance these tiles
I'll give you everything that I got
Saves on a sovereign, ah, what?
Fuck it, you can have the whole lot
I'm only like joking
I'm much better off win a gamble slot jackpot
And dance with the devil on Friday
Max said beans are like the touch of God
Why not? I haven't got grief 'til Monday
Some say kids don't study, they cram
God damn, I hate that I am what I am
With slurs and errs and a half-done gram
I jig to the floor with my mama's Ray Bans
Looking like something out of Only Fools and
Maybe I am but you ain't understanding
This ain't a crash, no smooth up landing
Kids sing along, swing bedroom, hanging

Don't stop an alleyway writing
Double timing and all your violating
Well, police man coming
Fair enough, sonny, run the whole, the half-mile
Runny, runny, run the half-mile
Runny, runny, run the half-mile
Run, run, sonny
Run, run, sonny, run the whole, the half-mile
Now I'm down, well, I'll chill with lick
I spit drips on the whole like the M spit liquor
Much quicker than the next man bitter
'Cause she rolls with the lager and never asks questions
Where's my old friend Licky when I'm feeling the substance?
I'm like gurning it off of my face
Need a hug and I need corruption
Need the silent violent seductions
Move it down to the people I used to know
When I used to see, I'm gonna kick it on a solo ticker
Drip it like liquor, drop a MC and that
She don't know what she's chatting about
They love it when they live it
And if you love her, give it, rip it unwritten
Then she start kissing and I'm loving, loving, loving
She's always like hugging
Well, I'm just loving, loving

So if you're gonna run, run, sonny
Better run, run, sonny, run the half of the mile
When police come, run, run, sonny
Run, run, sonny, run the half of the mile
When police come, run, run, sonny
Run, run, sonny, run the half of the mile
When police come, run, run, sonny
When the police come, man, I'll see you later
All the kids do is buy you grief
All parents get is no fucking sleep
Even rip home when I'm chilling on
Drink it down, doing it a bit better off and on
Songs of the rights and wrongs
Sometimes come around with a battle roll gong
Other times, you be ruining rhymes and ruining decisions
And ruining visions and ruining spitting liquor on me
Probably leaving at the floor, she'd be giving me a grieving
I'd be leaving on the ceiling
Well, I'm finished with the cunts
Over and out, cuz, ready up, roll
What's to born again panic?
Panic buttons to stack tone static
Well, all of y'all can listen to this tune
While you're waiting in STD clinic waiting rooms
Well, as you ever, your mother said you late bloom

Said they're stunned, the stuff, then alleyway writing
Double timing with all your violating
Well, police man coming
Fair enough, sonny, run the whole, the half-mile
Runny, runny, run the half-mile
Runny, runny, run the half-mile
Run, run, sonny
Run, run, sonny, run the whole, the half-mile1Embed
