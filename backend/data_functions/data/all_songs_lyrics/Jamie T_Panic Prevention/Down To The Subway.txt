Down To The Subway Lyrics
Hey, what you say yesterday?
She had fun when they leave alone on Saturday and night
They love to drink and they love to have a fight
It's my town coming up down the road
She left you grim and down on the phone
Singing songs has all gone wrong
Since time's been passing, better run, son
Jack backdoor never go bitch-slap
The slap from your mother when you just got born
And how about calling off some times?
In cotton socks, getting ripped with our wives
Track back when I feel that knife and
Heavy in your lungs and down your spine and

Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy load
Down and up these side tar roads
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy load
Down these side roads

But it's all alright, sometimes
What you reckon about this one, boys and girls?
Next, uh, next number
That's appendice
I remember getting wasted
Before we drive to the races
Run down to the subway station
Got down and missed our train and
How did you get to go there?
I went back to my home where
I sat and drank my wine
I feel fine and so I'm home, contorting
Arms down, take your time
On Monday morning, feeling fine
Missy must've heard you say
"You learnt anything more about them?"
There's been backstabbing and a bitch-slapping
And a call of "four to the floor," she's bleeding
Who's gonna get her out of this place?
It's not me, not a gentleman's race
Walk to the pavement, look at people
Think to myself, jam in traffic
Love elastic, smack in the kitchen
Bitching reminds me of my classroom
Break-in pictures I'm flicking inward
Sinks the cops who got called to the brink or
Take time and muddle their way up
There's a buzz feeling, you let them forward
We're going down on the runway
We're going right down on the subway
We're going down on the runway
Gonna go catch the train
We're going right down to the subway
Gonna go get ourselves a Saturday
We're going
We're going down on a Sunday
Down to the subway, down 'til the Monday
We're going down on a Sunday
To the subway to challenge herEmbed
