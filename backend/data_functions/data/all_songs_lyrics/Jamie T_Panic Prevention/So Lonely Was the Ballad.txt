So Lonely Was the Ballad Lyrics
So lonely was the ballad
Harmonica man Sam was so knackered after jives of love
He puts on the gloves and then puts on his hat
Then it's home to the missus who sits on his tongue
Selfish sons with their packs of cigarettes
Forking out two, take your girl with the ticket
Sometimes sane, other times not with it
Standing at the picket, man, your hands, they're freezing

Girls with their pearls on the flex of Monroes
And half-G blow, Marilyn's gone loco, Navajo
Hi-ho Silver, hey-ho, let's go dancing with the average Joes
Who talk with their fists and argue with their friends
Always take the piss but they're loyal in the end
But watch out 'cause they'll steal your girlfriend
Take her 'round the back, she'll come back limping and

Girls singing on the bus, fellas kicking up a fuss
Crying out sighs but they're still looking dangerous
Oh, this is definitely all for you
Living life in the fast lane and, uh
Give it up when you got no game, oh well, uh
Oh, this is definitely all for you
So remember when you choke, there's a reason being
We leaving the town 'cause we ain't been believing
Blowing up smoke from the lung to the ceiling
Making sure nightmares turn up in your dreaming
We're all good as we bounce this way
On the mic every day, hitting up the country, oh
Good time in the old city
Who's listening and who wants more?

'Cause the girls singing on the bus, fellas kicking up a fuss
Crying out sighs and they're still looking dangerous
Oh, this is definitely all for you
Living life in the fast lane and, uh
Give it up when you got no game, I said, uh
Oh, this is definitely all for you

And just how it was that they noticed just how the panic times subsided after listening to this tape, so we would appreciate your feedback. People who have panic attacks often feel that they should be able to deal with them and indeed the resources you need are already within you. It's just that sometimes the appropriate responses to a particular situation are not immediately accessible

So some of them said you never made the cut
And young son breakaway, want to be older
Sober as a judge as the door slams shut
Three bags full and a "Yes" for the "No, sir"
Say as you leaving, "Get up and go, go"
Say, "Hello, showaddywaddy wa wo-wo"
There's never been a better way
Than getting right out of this town on Monday
Well, I still wear up my old tap shoes, they fit
You and me looked twelve years old back when I was ten Whilst boozy Suzi got woozy with a "who's he", advantage taking
If I ever see again that chaperone
Get kicked in the teeth, high street downtown
Well, her dress is ripped and her shoes are soaking
One step, three back, drinking potion
Girls singing on the bus, fellas kicking up a fuss
Crying out sighs and they're still looking dangerous
Oh, this is definitely all for you
Living life in the fast lane and, uh
Give it up when you got no game, oh well, uh
Oh, this is definitely all for youEmbed
