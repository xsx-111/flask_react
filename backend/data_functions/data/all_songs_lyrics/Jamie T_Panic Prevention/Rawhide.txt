Rawhide Lyrics
Rawhide, singing on the motorway

Gonna get to the post office, walk in the door
Look at the shopkeeper
Say, "Hello, sonny, where's your poppy?
And how much money does he keep in his locky?"
I heard her say and I walk away, is it got the time to go?
He screams to silence, "Dad's got no money
And I don't like violence, take what you want though"
(That's enough of that) Ba-da-ba-ba-ba, hey-oh, hey-oh
Well, they laid their plans of the mice and men
Out on the kitchen floor
Said, "Rookie, if you don't want to take the heat
You better roll out that door"
'Cause they're leaving five 'bout minutes in the car
They're gonna go driving far
And oh my God, venomous hide, we'll have hides of gold
And they moved on out to move it in and I know what to do
Said the young man who stood next to them
No longer, first of all, not part of the crew
Well, oh I say, "Same time, time is moving fast"
And motorways, they fly by satellite towns of the M25

Come see all your slave
Man, you give all you gave
Am I the one you tried to save? The man I loved
Is it all talking true? All the lies of me and you
Is it all to do with pride? Young rawhide
Young rawhide, young rawhide
You lied tonight to me
Well, you drive away, a man on the corner
Waiting on the motorway (On the motorway)
Then I slide downtown to the bored satellite and the fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
Well, he walked in the door, said, "Sonny ain't funny
Funny ain't Sonny ain't me"
I'm fine and dandy, got most to hand me
And no one makes no money for free (Money, money, money)
Get to the post office, walk in the door, look at the shopkeeper
Say, "Hello, Sonny, where's your poppy?
And how much money does he keep in his locky?"
I heard her say and I walk away, is it got the time to go?
He screams to silence, "Dad's got no money
And I don't like violence, take what you want though"
Run, run, run, your hideaway
Run, run, run, your hideaway
Run, run, run, your hideaway
Run, run, Sonny, run, your hideaway
Run, run, Sonny, run, your hideaway
Run, run, son, son, hideaway
Run, run, son, son, hideaway
Young rawhide, young rawhide, young rawhide
Lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied
Lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied, lied to me
Come see all your slave
Man, you give all you gave
Am I the one you tried to save? The man I loved
Is it all talking true? All the lies of me and you
Is it all to do with pride? Young rawhide
Young rawhide, young rawhide
You lied, you lied to me

Get to the post office, walk in the door, look at the shopkeeper
Say, "Hello, Sonny, where's your poppy?
And how much money does he keep in his locky?"
Get to the post office, walk in the door, look at the shopkeeper
Say, "Hello, Sonny, where's your poppy?
And how much money does he keep in his locky?"
