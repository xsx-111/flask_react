Dry Off Your Cheeks Lyrics
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew

Love it, oh, sometimes at least I fall, shit
Put it up, too much to call home sometimes
With a dance in the two step, look at you swing
Not sure what I mean, don't know what I sing
I just dance on the harpsichord string
Move it down when you're coming up
Lose it down when you're tiptoe dancing
Enhancing all the pressure prancing
All around this place every night and day
When we were in the rat race
Shouting back to the oldest people
Shout at them all, called down steeples
Like no screaming, my dear, they will dry off your cheeks
And now it's me, back to the factor
Too much of that can bring you right back to tragedy
More, I'll be losing myself in this race
You see me, see me, see me, see me, seeing me
See me, see me, well, it's in my liberty
With a hectic test and no one protesting you
When you so damn scared
Live for the life and the love I lead
And the lead in the life 'cause I never play fair
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew

I got my own way home, I got my own keys
So why are you looking at me like you my lady?
I got my own kinds of groovy
Smoking too much and drinking
You bring yourself down in pain
Biddy-bye, biddy-biddy-bye, biddy-bye, biddy-bye
To the love and the living and the live cut free
She's all on the floor while I drink whisky
And I look to the corner, think about me
All about me, well, I'll never go self
'Cause I walk with a pelvis, white boy Elvis
Dancin' around this floor much quicker than you
Look at this, look at boys dancing
Think they're all impressive, but they ain't do shit
I'm on the groove from the grooving
Losing as I use you, as I go moving, I'm crying the tears
Not for myself, not for you, honey, have no fear
And now I break to the floor when the old piano goes crashing
Sometimes I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
But I ain't here for more
I take my last match, desperate passion, and a few up facts
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew

Love it, oh, sometimes at least I fall, shit
Put it up, I was to call home sometimesEmbed
