Salvador Lyrics
From here to Salvador, the ladies dance
To fill us reckless sons with the passions of the heart

I've been around this town for so long
She's been dancing since the first day
I've been all around but I love coming back to see Lucy
She swings me over to pull me out
Twirls around and I fall about in giggles and laughter
Oh, I'm plastered and can't deal help it, I'm sorry, love
(A heart of gold)
But it's theâ€” what's to falling, feeling feet?
(And a face so pale)
And they're broke, bouncing around these streets
(With a second-hand dress)
They're lonely like you, and you for me
(And the lips of a temptress)
To ask for a dance or two (Ask her)
A heart of gold and a face so pale
With a second-hand dress and the lips of a temptress (Ask her)

With a bar stool banshee, howled out at me
The kings and queens of the clubs evolved from pubs
And too much broken heart love
And singing up the blues in a locked box bedroom
A wop-bopalu-bop to wop-bam-boo
Are you gonna take the chance?
Why do you care? No one plays fair
And neither do the lords of the dance
From here to Salvador, the ladies dance
To fill us reckless sons with the passions of the heart

Well, it's a bang-bang, Anglo Saxons at the disco
A-tishoo! All fall down
Hound dogs rowl on the prowl for the next young girl
Who told her daddy
"I'm going 'round Gemma's to learn and study"
I'm young, so free and I'm kinda sexy
And when I'm on the floor, all the boys that feel me
And old dear diary's never been a friend of mine

From here to Salvador, the ladies dance
To fill us reckless sons with the passions of the heart

Look, sorry, I'm working here
And you're ruining it
Yeah, work, like
Do you want to have an argument over a record?
Do you know what I mean?1Embed
