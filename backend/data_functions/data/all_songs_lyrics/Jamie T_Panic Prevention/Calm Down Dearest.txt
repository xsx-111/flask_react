Calm Down Dearest Lyrics
Big bang, where we going? What we doing this night?
Feel drunk already, maybe drink got spiked
But more likely of the like that I'm just a lightweight
But I don't care man, I've been drunk forever
I've sedated hatred, I've sedated pages
I've sedated worthwhile cages, stages, and all of my rage
This is a good time to start dancing to this song, man
A good one, DJ, play the record on, man

So where be Joey? Get us a drink: a Dimple whiskey
And look at the lady, she be shady, but we maybe
What you doing? Where you going to there after?
She says, "Get the fuck out, man, you seem to be so plastered"
Well, we be all the night, kicking and staring at girls alike
But, it's all good, man, what goes on?
Drink your can, walking it drunk down the Strand
And talk about that how we missed the whole car queue
Who the fuck are you?

It's heavy, it's on my mind
'Cause you just say you feel just fine
It's racking and stacking them lines
I said, calm down dearest
It's heavy, it's on my mind
You say you feel just fine
Been racking and stacking your lines
I said, calm down dearest
I remember shooting shit down down the old alleyways
Talking tragedies of music, like old Holliday
I remember what we're doing then, I don't remember now
It's the past, it's the future
I don't know how to carry on through the rights and wrongs
And kick it like we know the songs
Already before we rock steady down and on the dancefloor
And I don't get no fights when I get angry drunk
I sit down in the corner and I sulk my fucking socks off
So who the fuck are we? Just the boys in the city
It's all been done before and we do it again, so
We'll see you later, you alligators
We'll be back, I'm sure, next week and sit in the bar, you know
So goodbye, bye, we'll try never to die, but
We are so young we don't understand if we canna fly
So we're here now, we will be gone soon
But not today, not tomorrow, not the next tune

It's heavy, it's on my mind
'Cause you just say you feel just fine
It's racking and stacking them lines
I said, calm down dearest
It's heavy, it's on my mind
You say you feel just fine
Been racking and stacking your lines
I said, calm down dearest
It's heavy, it's on my mind
You say you feel just fine
Been racking and stacking your lines
I said, calm down dearest
It's heavy, it's on my mind
You say you feel just fine
Been racking and stacking your lines
I said, calm down dearest
Yeah! You're cool, twat
Fucking cunts doing wheelies on bikes, mate
I just wanna fucking run 'em overEmbed
