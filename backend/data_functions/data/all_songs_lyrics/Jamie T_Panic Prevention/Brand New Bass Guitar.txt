Brand New Bass Guitar Lyrics
Fucking croissant

Well I, I went to buy myself a handgun
Why you think, man? To shoot down everyone
So you better go running, star
But I spent all my money on this cracked out piece of shit
Called the bass guitar

(Run young son got himself a brand new bass guitar
Young son got a brand new bass guitar
Young son got a brand new bass guitar...)
Well, here we go
Say, "Break down low"
Say, "Hello, baby"

We all know what you got to do
Always just comes down to you
We all know what you got to do, man
Always just comes down to you
Said, "Shut that door"
Spewing all over the floor
She say, "Hello, baby"
Well I, I went drinking down at the bars
I went drink-driving in your mama's car
So you better go running, star
'Cause right now I'm not really sure
If I can drive for shit but fuck, ahhhh

(Run young son got himself a brand new bass guitar
Young son got a brand new bass guitar
Young son got a brand new bass guitar...)
Well, here we go
Say, "Break down low"
Say, "Hello, baby"
(Run young son got himself a brand new bass guitar
Young son got a brand new bass guitar
Young son got a brand new bass guitar...)

With a skinny wab-bab-alu-bala-bala-loo-bala
Dilly-dally-dilly-dah-oh-mo-wab-bam-boo!

I think that's the scrappiest version I've ever done of that in my lifeEmbed
