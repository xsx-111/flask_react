Back To Mine For A Moonshine Lyrics
Well, let's go back to mine for a moonshine
Make sure you're quiet, my mama's downstairs
She's been pissed since this morning, so she's cert passed out
That's why my dad is all asleep in armchair
Well, let's go back to mine for a moonshine
Make sure you're quiet, my mama's downstairs
She's been pissed since this morning, so she's cert passed out
That's why my dad is all asleep in armchair

Where are all the ladies at this party?
I'll just fuck off on my own back home
Oh, don't get me wrong, no pity
I'll just be happily merrily moving on
Maybe not that ready

Where are all the ladies at this party?
I'll just fuck off on my own back home
Oh, don't get me wrong, no pity
I'll just be happily merrily moving on
Oh, where the fuck are ladies at this party?
I ain't seen no one in an hour and a half, man
Oh, don't get me wrong, I'll go home lonely
Doesn't matter, right? Even though I'm a fucking starter
Ah, where the fuck am I going? I'll just go home alone
I shit a chicken down at yard at half-past any time
Oh, where the girls at this party?
Everybody's gone and parted off, a bucket
Well, let's go back to mine for a moonshine
Make sure you're quiet, my mama's downstairs
She's been pissed since this morning, so she's cert passed out
That's why my dad is all asleep in armchair
Maybe not that readyEmbed
