Operation Lyrics
Vauxhall Allegra over, Delta Noscar, over
Peter, Sita, receiving
Siva, Peter, Rita, Nita, Tita
Peter, Peter, over, over and over
Over and over, yes, Peter, Sita, Peter and Sita, over?
Knocker

Sitar singing on the operation
And people say they can't walk out
I remember you walking in
That's why you got this door looking lock stock
On the older days, my time
Seems to be running away
Singing up songs of the rights and wrongs
I don't expect anymore from me, oh

To all the dead people, and especially out to Diego
A friend with the criminal intention of the bad liaison
To all the dead people, and especially out to Diego
A friend with the criminal intention of the bad liaison

Take your problem to United Nations
Tell old Kofi about the situation
Tell him how you left the whole congregation
Sitting on their own in the pews, all alone
Have-a-go heroes shoutin' in the young done lock
Sinning it down, this sucks
For the break of the no-go zero
Kicking it down, don't want him to raise
Dig it up, give him away
Have a good luck
I ain't no abacus
But you can count on me, love

To all the dead people, and especially out to Diego
A friend with the criminal intention of the bad liaison
To all the dead people, and especially out to Diego
A friend with the criminal intention of the bad liaison

Take your problem to United Nations
Tell old Kofi about the situation
Tell him how you left the whole congregation
Sitting on their own in the pews, all alone
Gonna take your problem to United Nations
Tell old Kofi about the situation
Tell him how you left the whole congregation
Sitting in the pews all alone, all alone
Gonna take your problem to United Nations
Take your problem to United Nations
Take your problem to United Nations
Tell old Kofi about the situation
Is it a way out of the day
Calling yourself back to kingdoms?
Is it a time singing the lines
Of old Broadway?
Time, it has passed, being the last
To enter the race for the future
It passed so fast and fast is thin
And that's why we're withering
So good is the bad, the ugly left
With your face in the morning
You screamed at the back, told her just jack
About how you lived on the weekend
So killers in midst told you about it
Years before you answered
The whole of the point, the real today
Is passed and now you're finished

You scream like nothing's wrong
Sons of silence are in them songs
Out loud for the reservation
It's all thriller, no filler
And a beat came up the line
Three or four times
This is the first time that you say
It's all filler, no thriller
Filler, no thriller
Filler, no thriller
Filler, no thriller
Filler, no thriller
To the lost boys in the lost town
To lost girls in the lost and found
I'll find you out when you hit the ground
Don't stop moving, girly, dance around
To the lost boys in the lost town
To lost girls in the lost and found
I'll find you out when you hit the ground
Don't stop moving, girly, dance around
To the lost boys in the lost town
To lost girls in the lost and found
I'll find you out when you hit the ground
Don't stop moving, girly, dance around

You scream like nothing's wrong
Sons of silence are in them songs
Out loud for the reservation
It's all thriller, not filler
And a beat came up the line
Three or four times
This is the first time that you say
It's all filler, no thriller

Thirty-eight, a gin and tonic is my drink of choice. A cup of cocoa in bed. My enemy? I'm a fan of breaststroke, it's easy but frontcrawl is better for you. I'm a vegetarian. Good question, Jamie! I like lots of things... but, yeah, basically my big dirty ego. You go, you go!Embed
