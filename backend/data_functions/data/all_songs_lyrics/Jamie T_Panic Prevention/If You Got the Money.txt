If You Got the Money Lyrics
If you've got the money
I think it would be funny, oh-oh-oh
To take your girl, spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy
No longer lonely, oh-oh-oh
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

And all the boys, they go
Da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah
Dom-dom-de-de-dom-dom
Dom, da-dee-dah-doo-da-da-dom
Da-dee-doo-daa, dee-da-doo-dah
Dom-dom-de-de-dom-dom
Dom, da-dee-dah-doo-da-da-dom

I spend late nights trying to pick up love
Off the floor where the other brothers leave it be
Though it's stuck hard down, it's like chewing gum
Well, I'll gurn on the thought and sing my RIP
'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
No sweet melody, the sound of spit
Spat Orbit, spoke of lost hope
So toot what you toke, man, choke on it
We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
By three, we are thinking of the love we lost
By four, we be high, thinking of the girl lost
Second, check the odds, was it worth the cost?
Do you give a toss? Or are you looking away
Wondering why you can't eat, why you never sleep?
Drunk all the time, cold in the heat
Well, what you sow, man, is what you reap
If you've got the money, money, money, oh
I think it would be funny, ah
To take your girl, spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy
No longer lonely, oh-oh-oh
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
(I've been watching you)

You were always meant to walk out that job
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
That loving is all about doors unlocking
Now you're certain enough near a man free
With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
Tweedle on the needle, man, you're just the thread
Great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead
(Bang, bang, bang)
Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
Fight in the playground, bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother
Some other stay, want to run away
And Mama still wants you home for supper
Work all day, little to no pay
And dance uptown, right down to the gutter
With the dee-dom dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee
So move out of the way, man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dee-dom-dee
(I've been watching you)
So move out of the way, man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee
Move out of the way, man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee
(I've been watching you)

Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Yeah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Wah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Yeah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Well, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Wah, ma, money, money, money, money, money
Well, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Wah, she wants money, money

If you've got the money, ah
I think it would be funny, oh-oh-oh
To take your girl, spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, ah
No longer lonely, oh-oh-oh
Well, I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
She said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
(I've been watching you)
She said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-money oh
Yeah, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
(I've been watching you)

If you've got the money
I think it should be funny, oh-oh-oh
To take your girl, spend a bit of your cash for me
'Cause then she might be happy
No longer lonely, oh-oh-oh
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

I've only had three pints, I'm having a beer now
It's 12:30, as I'm about to open that fuckin' baby
I'm not fuckin' drinkin' that shit
Why not?4Embed
