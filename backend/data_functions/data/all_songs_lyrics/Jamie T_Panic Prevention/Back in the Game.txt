Back in the Game Lyrics
Take your brother down to the sea
Have a two's on a cigarette
Young sons mosey it happily
Learn facts on the Soviets
A crowded room that fits just three
Takes four, do you connect?
All this shit means fuck all to me
Long livers in the subsect

So crazy Billy Jay Jones
He robs banks just for the shits
Man alone, giggling, so stoned, pick up the phone
'Cause that money I lent
You said was just a loan, you're danger prone
With too much gel and a whiff of Dad's cologne
Leave me alone, 'cause now you're come down
And you've just gone lowered the tone

And after about ten dear minutes
He was back in the game
Thought he was done, man, thought he was finished
But he's back up again
And after about ten dear minutes
He was back in the game
Thought he was done, man, thought he was finished
But he's back up again
A tainted brain of intoxication
Purple heart smart-arse got on the transistor
Said that you missed her, looking for selectors
And found no one better than you
With brother boy blues
Kick up the old, take up the avenues
And talk like you do what you do, kicking up time
'Cause now you come down and it's for who the bell tolls

And after about ten dear minutes
He was back in the game
Thought he was done, man, thought he was finished
But he's back up again
And after about ten dear minutes
He was back in the game
Thought he was done, man, thought he was finished
But he's back up again

See who's done all, Oscar Peterson, over
Oscar Peterson Delta Foxtrot Nova, Foxtrot Oscar
All a Vauxhall Allegra, over?1Embed
