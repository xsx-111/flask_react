Northern Line Lyrics
You were a no-show down the jiving disco
My mama's at home, getting pissed on vino
When the kids buy draws but they're smoking Bisto
My flow goes straight but it ends illegal
And the regal sons get the purest bugle
And bullies only pick on the young and feeble
Now hey-ho, let's go mucho boozing
Sometimes you wonder, what am I doing?
You move and you groove when you lose what you lose
And you lose what you groove and you're moving away
And you move what you groove
When you prove what you lose
And you lose what you choose and you're moving away
Well, okay, what happen if we stay?
Straight to the barrier then run off away
I say what I mean, but don't mean what I say
Was I right? No? Oh, my goody gosh darn it
Chatting to Barney from High Barnet with no barnet
About how we cert do love it
A young son muppet with my ma's gin and tonic
And I'm puking up all over your Capri car bonnet

You got so much, I take too much
Always gonna waste your time
I need direction
Always been crap on the travel as I read the signs
So shut your mouth, love
Before I stick this track where the sun don't shine
Tick-a-tock the clock, what you're like a motherfucker drunk
Falling asleep on the Northern line
(All aboard! Last train!)
How would you feel getting left alone?
He was a toned-down original and stepped to toe
He was the bottomless bottles and the backwashed barrel
And the Sikh whose son was thrown out and left feral
It's all gone wrong in your life of answers
Use to take triple-As art to charge us
Take you away from your hazy days
Rave life just a blur in the halls of dancers

You got so much, I take too much
Always gonna waste your time
I need direction
Always been crap on the travel as I read the signs
So shut your mouth, love
Before I stick this track where the sun don't shine
Tick-a-tock the clock, what you're like a motherfucker drunk
Falling asleep on the Northern line

Wakey, wakey! Up you step! One-man band, eh?
What you doing? Where you, where you from?
Where you going to, man? Where's your kingdom?
Where you going? Where you wanna be?
You're holding it down with the pacemaker
But live it, but live it up and give it away
Give it away, give it away, give it away
Ah, where's your money?
Who's got their happy hand on Sky?
And you got so much
I take too much, always gonna waste your time
I need direction
Always been crap on the travel as I read the signs
So shut your mouth, love
Before I stick this track where the sun don't shine
Tick-a-tock the clock, what you're like a motherfucker drunk
Falling asleep on the Northern line
And you got so much
I take too much, always gonna waste your time
I need direction
Always been crap on the travel as I read the signs
So shut your mouth, love
Before I stick this track where the sun don't shine
Tick-a-tock the clock, what you're like a motherfucker drunk
Falling asleep on the Northern lineEmbed
