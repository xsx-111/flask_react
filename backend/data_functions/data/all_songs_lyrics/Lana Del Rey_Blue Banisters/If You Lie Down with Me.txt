If You Lie Down with Me Lyrics
Put your red boots on, baby, giddy up
Baby wants to dance, baby gets her way
Treat me nice, talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice, I'll treat you like a holiday

And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Babe, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the Fourth of July
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down, lie next to me
Get your jacket on, be a gentleman
Get into your truck and pick me up at eight
'Cause we were built for the long-haul freight train
Burnt by fire without trial like a stowaway

And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down, lie next to me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like, six times 'til I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
When you lie down, lie next to me
