Nectar of the Gods Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

What cruel world is this? Nectar of the Gods
Heroin gold in my veins and you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million and I just can’t stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone, call again, I wanna talk

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

What sweet world is this? Honey on the vine
School kid dreams came true, then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you, now I don’t know why
I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, ooh, ooh
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Californ-I-A, homeland of the Gods
Once I found my way, but now I am lost13Embed
