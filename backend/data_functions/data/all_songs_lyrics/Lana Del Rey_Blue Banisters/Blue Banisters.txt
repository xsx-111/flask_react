Blue Banisters Lyrics
There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, "How the hell did you get there?"
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, "A place I don't remember"
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, "Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's of age"
She said "You can't be a muse and be happy, too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy"
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who
Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
In my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause
Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters grey
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin', bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and grey, ah-ah

Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May
All my sisters fly to me
To paint, paint35Embed
