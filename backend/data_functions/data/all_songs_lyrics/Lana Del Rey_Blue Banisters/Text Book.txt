Text Book Lyrics
I guess you could call it textbook
I was lookin' for the father I wanted back
And I thought I found it in Brentwood
It seemed only appropriate you'd easily have my back

And then there was the issue of her
I didn't even like myself, or love the life I had
And there you were with shining stars
Standin' blue with open arms
You touched the detriment most of the friends I knew already had

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah
Could we do this dance again?
Do you think if I go blonde, we could get our old love back?
I guess this is really the end
I never felt jealous before this year, but I'm jealous now

People say we're too much alike
But maybe, finally, that'll make it right
In the end of all these sleepless nights
Other men I met felt right
Would smile at you and stick a knife
In your back
Finally, I met you so I'm not wonderin' why

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
There we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah
Old Man River keeps rollin'
With or without him
Old Man River keeps rollin'
Without him, oh, my old man
Old Man River keeps rollin', oh51Embed
