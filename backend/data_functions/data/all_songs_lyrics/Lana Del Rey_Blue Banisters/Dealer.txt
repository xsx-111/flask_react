Dealer Lyrics
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit-seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether

I check in, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend
I check in, I wreck it, and I'll explain
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

Please don't try to find me through my dealer (9275, 555)
He won't pick up his phone (Now you've got a busy tone)
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
Please don't try my father either (All circuits are busy, goodbye)
He ain't been home for years (All circuits are busy, you're high)52Embed
