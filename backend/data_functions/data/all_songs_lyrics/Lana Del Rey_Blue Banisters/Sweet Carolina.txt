Sweet Carolina Lyrics
Okay

Don't have to write me a letter
'Cause I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

We love every hair on your head
Love you like God loves you
And you say that you're scared
Might be unprepared for havin' the baby blues

Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

You name your babe Lilac Heaven
After your iPhone 11
"Crypto forever," scrеams your stupid boyfriend
Fuck you, Kevin

We lovе every freckle you have
We love you like God loves you
If you're ever stressed out, just dance in the night
If you get those baby blues
Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

Pink slippers all on the floor, woven nets over the door
It's as close as we'll get to the dream that they had
In the one night sixties, and
Jason is out in the lawn
And he power-washes every time things go wrong
If you're stressed out, just know you can dance to your song
'Cause we got you

If you get the blues, baby blues
Just know this is your song
It'll live on and on, way past me and you
If you get the blues, baby blues
You've got us, we've got you
So there's nothing to lose, and we love you

So don't write me a letter
I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear12Embed
