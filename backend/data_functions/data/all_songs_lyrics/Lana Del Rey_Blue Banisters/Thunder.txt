Thunder Lyrics
You roll like thunder when you come crashin' in
Town ain't been the same since you left with all your friends
You roll like thunder when you come crashing in
Regattas in the wind, that's why you're visiting

You act like fucking Mr. Brightside when you're with all your friends
But I know what you're like when the party ends

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

You roll like thunder, pourin' all your drinks
The party's lit and you, my friend, half-cut when it begins
You roll like thunder, you're tryna catch that wind
That lightning in the bottle, that moonbeam in your hand

And you try to see the bright side when each new day begins
But you're not satisfied at the rainbow's end
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

'Cause if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burnin', 'til rain (Just do it, don't wait)
Baby, keep me ablaze
Honey, if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burning, keep me alive (Just do it, don't wait)
Spare your blade

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then, honey, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then, baby, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
'Cause I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
If you're on fire, you're on fire
You should just keep burning (Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)22Embed
