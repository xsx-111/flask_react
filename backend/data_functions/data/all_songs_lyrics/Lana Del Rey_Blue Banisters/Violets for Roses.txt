Violets for Roses Lyrics
There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy
Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening

Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with me
And, boy, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with the city
Like thе Paramount sign sparkling
Sparkling just for me

You made me tradе my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha

There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the Merthys Alleys
In the streets have ceased
And still, the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening

Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with the streets
And, God, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I breakdance to the backbeat
And, God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryin' to make a woman change and trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
(Ah-la-ha, ah-ha)

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy13Embed
