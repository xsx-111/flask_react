Cracking Lyrics
It's a one-time thing
It just happens a lot
Walk with me
And we will see
What we have got
Ah

My footsteps are ticking
Like water dripping from a tree
Walking a hairline
And stepping very carefully
Ah

My heart is broken
It is worn out at the knees
Hearing muffled
Seeing blind
Soon it will hit the Deep Freeze

And something is cracking
I don't know where
Ice on the sidewalk
Brittle branches
In the air
The sun is blinding
Dizzy golden, dancing green
Through the park in the afternoon
Wondering where the hell I have been
AhEmbed
