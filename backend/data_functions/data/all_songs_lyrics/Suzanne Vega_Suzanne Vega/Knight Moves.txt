Knight Moves Lyrics
Watch while the queen, in one false move
Turns herself into a pawn
Sleepy and shaken, and watching while the blurry night
Turns into a very clear dawn

Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love many, can you love one?
Do you love me?...
Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love twenty, can you love one?
Do you love me?

One false move, and a secret prophecy
Well, if you hold it against her, first hold it up and see
That it's one side stone, one side fire
Standing alone among all men's desire
They want to know

Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love many, can you love one?
Do you love me?
Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love twenty, can you love one?
Do you love me?
And if you wonder what I am doing
As I am heading for the sink
I am spitting out all the bitterness
Along with half of my last drink
I am thinking of your woman
Who is crying in the hall
It's like drinking gasoline to quench a thirst
Until there's nothing there left at all

Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love many, can you love one?
Do you love me?
Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love twenty, can you love one?
Do you love me?

"Walk on her blind side" was the answer to the joke
It's said there isn't a political bone in her body
Well she would rather be a riddle, but she keeps challenging the future
With a profound lack of history

Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love many, can you love one?
Do you love me?...
Do you love any, do you love none?
Do you love twenty, can you love one?
Do you love me?
And watch while the queen, in one false move
Turns herself into a pawn
Sleepy and shaken, and watching while the blurry night
Turns into a very clear dawn

Do you love me...?
Do you love me...?
Do you love me...?
Do you love me...?
Do you love me...?
Do you love me...?
Do you love me...?Embed
