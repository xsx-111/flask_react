Comedy LyricsOh the awful title belies the quality
Of this unusual comedy
It's the same for you and me
And the days and nights you remembered me
The walls I never seen
Come to me
It's an awful tragedy
Fifty million reasons
Loving in the seasons
Fifty million lovers
Sitting at the doubles
Fifty million reasons
Loving in the seasons
When you cry it pulls me through
And you know the times we crossed the street
We'd rather laugh than greet
Honestly, it's a forgone comedy
And you know the walls we tried and made
You know it's never changed
Honestly, it's a long-lost comedy
Fifty million reasons
Loving in the seasons
Fifty million lovers
Sitting at the doubles
Fifty million reasons
Loving in the seasons
When you cry it pulls me through
Oh the awful title belies the quality
Of this unusual comedy
It's the same for you and me
And the days and nights you remembered me
The walls I never seen
Honestly, it's a long lost comedy
Fifty million reasons
Loving in the seasons
Fifty million lovers
Sitting at the doubles
Fifty million reasons
Loving in the seasons
When you cry it pulls me throughEmbed
