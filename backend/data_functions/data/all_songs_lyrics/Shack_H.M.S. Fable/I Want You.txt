I Want You LyricsIf the king isn’t looking
And he knows it’s understood
And the queen is above him
And she knows she’s looking good
And the seven’s on its way
And the eight is here to stay
Yeah he is
I want you
I need you
And if Merlin isn’t functioning
And he’s not up to scratch
You can ask the postal service
And they put it on your back
And the navy’s coming home
And the missionary’s alone
Yeah he is
I want you
I need you
I’ve got you
Yeah the navy’s coming home
And the missionary’s alone
Yeah it’s a spit of me Aunty Joan
I want you
I need you
I’ve got you
I want youEmbed
