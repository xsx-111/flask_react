Cornish Town LyricsBecause one he changed in island gael
And in Dingle and as far
And somehow you found that strange
It isn’t hard to understand
It’s just a different land
Like when you said close your eyes
And come and cross my street
And I will take you there
If you will come with me
But there’s an accordance with a psalm
That says come on
And what was wrong with the choice you made
If I don’t want to set it down
In a Cornish town
And what was wrong with loves that came
Well nothing to be true
When love’s was too
Like when you said close your eyes
And come and cross my street
And I will take you there
If you will come with me
But there’s an accordance with a psalm
That say come on
It says come on, it says come on
Nah la la la
What am I, what am I
What am I, what am I
It says
What am I, what am I
What am I
Your trailing colours through the air
You know you’ve come fine baby
Your trailing colours through the air
I know you’re some fine baby
Nah nah nah nah
La la la la
So this is nothing about soul fire
Or fields over down
There’s no frenzies out off
Off of Armagnac or brown
No razorblades reigning mainly
Up on the plain
Where things won’t change
Nah nah nah nah nah nahEmbed
