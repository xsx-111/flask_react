Pull Together LyricsLooking round on the faces served up by me
You see me smile that’s at least 1-0 to me
I spy your face your expression
You’re waiting to see
For the look that you love so much from me
I know, I know, I know I messed up again
Fell in love with my red telephone again
Don’t wanna see the Coach and Horses steps
No more, no no, no no, no no, no no…
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull together
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull together
You’re back around with a gift meant just for me
I don’t need no dough I can see you in the week
Don’t wanna see where the red cars coming again
Don’t wanna see Jimmy Mac’s ugly face again
I know, I know, I know I messed up again
My telephone’s busy all day ten to ten
Don’t wanna see where my red cars coming no more
No no, no no, no no, no no…
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull together
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull together
Don’t wanna see where the white cars coming again
Don’t wanna see Jimmy Mac’s ugly face again
I fell in love with my red telephone again
No, stop…
I know, I know, I know I messed up again
I wanna see where my red cars coming again
Don’t wanna see Coach and Horses steps no more
No no, no no, no no, no no…
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull together
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull together
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull together
You and I been criticised
We gotta pull togetherEmbed
