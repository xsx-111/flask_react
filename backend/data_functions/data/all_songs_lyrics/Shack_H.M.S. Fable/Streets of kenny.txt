Streets of kenny LyricsSearching through the streets again
Through the streets of Kenny
I'm looking for the boys again
Can't find Joe or Benny
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
I'm searching for the caz again
Through the Streets of Kenny
I'm looking for our joys again
Can't get shit get any
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
Hey
I'm looking for the boys again
Through the streets of Kenny
I'm searching for the caz again
Can't get shit get any
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
I don't want a bag
I want a big one
