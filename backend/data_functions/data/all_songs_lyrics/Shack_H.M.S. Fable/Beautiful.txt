Beautiful LyricsAnd here’s to you, I gotta tell you how I feel
Cos from the first you left something into me
It’s in you come to me and weight me in my sleep
Are you mind, are you there for me to see
You’re so beautiful in all that I can say
Come on around now come and make our day
It’s like you turned for me to look upon my scene
Cutting away at my artificial dreams
Are you floating over sinking onto me
And will I walk, wander space and worlds to see
You’re so beautiful in all that I can say
Come on around now come and make our day
You’re so beautiful you weight me in my sleep
You’re in my mind, my soul, my head, my feed
I’ll be the first to take your pain
If I can’t I’ll be there to take your strain
You’re so beautiful in all that I can say
Come on around now come and make our day
You’re so beautiful you weight me in my sleep
You’re in my mind, my soul, my head, my feed
You’re so beautiful the loons will shy from you
Dreamers dream daydreamers fears too
You’re so beautiful in all that I can say
Come on around now come and make our dayEmbed
