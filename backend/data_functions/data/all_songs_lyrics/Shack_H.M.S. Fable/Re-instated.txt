Re-instated LyricsNow the time is right for you and me
We’ll face the music now
And you will see
Cause you’re not the only one
Who takes it baby
It’s not too late
To be re-instated, maybe
Can’t find the words but I’m sure we’ll sort it out
Now the time is right for you and me
Let’s face the music now
But you will see
Cause you’re not the only one
Who breaks it baby
It’s not too late
To be re-instated, maybe
Can’t find the words but I’m sure we’ll sort it out
And you can fight for yourself
And you can think for yourself
And you can love, love…
Now the time is right for you and me
Let’s face the music now
You will see
And I remember when you made me feel so good
Just to be near you
Oh you’ve let me down so much – I fear youEmbed
