Since I Met You LyricsJason ran from the parking lot
Stumbling and clutching his knee
He’d only been shot in the knee poor baby
Should’ve been home for tea
Jason pulls a gun it’s a plastic one
And the shop assistants twitching
And shoots him without thinking
And I can’t think of anybody else since I met you
And things don’t seem to feel the same
The way they used to do
And such a nice day in a lovely town
Yeah the checkout girl she’s listening
And we’re heading for the city
And I can’t think of anybody else since I met you
And things don’t seem to feel the same
The way they used to do
Heading out of town yeah in Jason’s Rover
Better pull aside cause the party’s over now
Seargent says son you’d better come with me
Cause Jason’s in ward 3B and it’s over now
Yeah it’s all over now
And I can’t think of anybody else since I met you
And things don’t seem to feel the same
The way they used to doEmbed
