Jump at the Chance Lyrics(PIANO & GUITAR INTRO)
When you're not around
I never wonder where it's at
It's never more than what we are as friends
But if you come around
And look at me like that
And walk that walk and talk that talk again
Then I'm gonna jump at the chance
You know I'm gonna jump at the chance
Yeah, I'm gonna jump at the chance
You bet I'm gonna jump at the chance
When I'm all alone
I never miss the time with you
But then you show and there I go again
So when we're alone
And you've got the feeling too
I can't resist, we're still the best of friends
And...
Then I'm gonna jump at the chance
You know I'm gonna jump at the chance
Yeah, I'm gonna jump at the chance
You bet I'm gonna jump at the chance
(GUITAR SOLO)
Girl, I'm gonna jump at the chance
You know I'm gonna jump at the chance
Yeah, I'm gonna jump at the chance
You bet I'm gonna jump at the chance
Girl I'm gonna take it
I'm gonna dig it
Oooh
Take it
You know I'm gonna take it
You betcha betcha betcha bet, I'm gonna take it
Yes, I'm gonna take it...
