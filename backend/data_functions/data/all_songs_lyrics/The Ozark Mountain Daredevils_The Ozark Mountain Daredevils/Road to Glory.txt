Road to Glory Lyrics(FIDDLE, GUITAR & HARP INTRO)
There's a card game in the courtyard
And the winner loses all
When the judge checks his supper
It's so small
And the hills are grey with trouble
And the dry spring gathers dust
Your lover's crying in the valley
She lost her trust
(HARP SOLO)
But there is a road to glory
Somehow hidden in the past
Behind the gold, behind the treasure
Behind the mask
Then comes a team of four white horses
And a lady with night-black hair
And she looks to be such a fine one
But is she really there
I've gotta knooooooooow
I've gotta knooooooooow
I've gotta knooooooooooooooooooooooooow.............Embed
