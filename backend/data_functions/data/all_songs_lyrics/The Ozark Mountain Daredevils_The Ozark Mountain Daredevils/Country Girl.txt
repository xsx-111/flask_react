Country Girl Lyrics(HARP INTRO)
Well look see the moon comes risin' - tomorrow is yesterday
He left his home and now he's gone - a hopin' to find a way
A story of Rueben the cobbler - I'll tell you in this style
How he went down the road with his load - and shouted for a thousand miles
Oh country girl, oh won't ya come to me tonight
Oh country girl, smother me with delight
Oh country girl, ya drive away the pain
Oh country girl, ya make sunshine of the rain
(HARP SOLO)
With a hop and a hoop and a holler - he carried out his dues
Till the rotted roof made the push - that took old Rueben's shoes
And I wonder to be there with him - in that sky of grey
We'd sit on a cloud and cry out loud - till tomorrow is yesterday
Oh country girl, oh won't ya come to me tonight
Oh country girl, smother me with delight
Oh country girl, ya drive away the pain
Oh country girl, ya make sunshine of the rain
Oh country girl, oh won't ya come to me tonight
Oh country girl, smother me with delight
Oh country girl, oh, ya drive away the pain
Oh country girl, oh, ya make sunshine of the rain
Ya make sunshineEmbed
