Fools Gold Lyrics(GUITAR & KEYBOARDS INTRO)
I was falling off to sleep
I was drawn into a dream
And the lady there would weep
'till it turned into a stream
And she let me touch her heart
And listen to her sing
And she watched me fall apart
Like a man who would be kiiiiing
Ice cold water, running through her veins
Fool's gold and mirrors, reflecting nothing
Bright lady liar, bitter to the taste
Foolish desire, left no trail to traaaaaace
(ACOUSTIC GUITAR SOLO)
So I say her name again
I know she knows my call
And I feel the dream begin
Like a shadow on the wall
She's a shadooooow
She's a shadaw
She's a shadaw
She's a shadaw
She's a shadaw
She's a shadaw
Ice cold water, running through her veins
Fool's gold and mirrors, reflecting nothing
Bright lady liar, bitter to the taste
Foolish desire, left no traaaaaaaaaaail to traaace
Ice cold water, running through her veins
Fool's gold and mirrors, reflecting nothing
Bright lady liar, bitter to the taste
Foolish desire, leeeeft noooo traaaaaaaaaaail to traaace
