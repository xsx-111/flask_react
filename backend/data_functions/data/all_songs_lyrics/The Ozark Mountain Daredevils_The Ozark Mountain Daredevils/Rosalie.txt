Rosalie LyricsRosalie lives just on the edge of town
The crazy one you know, you've seen her around
Ooh, when Rosalie laughs, she never makes a sound
It's the only way, she knows she's takin' you down
Ooh, it's heavenly light, you've never seen such light
When Rosalie, she knows she's doin' it right
She won't say, and I never ask
You see it's all the same to her
And that's how it should be
But when she's layin' next to me
It's heavenly light, you've never seen such light
And Rosalie, she knows she's doin' it right
Ooh, silent Rosalie
She won't say, I never ask
You see it's all the same to her
And that's how it should be
But when she's layin' next to me
It's heavenly light, you've never seen such light
And Rosalie, she knows she's doin' it right
Ooh, silent RosalieEmbed
