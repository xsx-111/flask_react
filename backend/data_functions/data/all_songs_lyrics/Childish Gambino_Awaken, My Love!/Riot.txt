Riot Lyrics
Uh, ahhh!
Ayy

I can feel it deep inside my body
I've been watching all this all night
I got to move it
This pressure brewing
This world don't feel alright

Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Ohh, uh
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son, ahhh! Uh

No good's happenin'
World, we're out a captain
Everyone just wants a better life
Woo! They tried to kill us
Love to say they feel us
But they won't take my pride, ahh!
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high (Ah, uhh)
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son (Woo! Uh)

Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son4Embed
