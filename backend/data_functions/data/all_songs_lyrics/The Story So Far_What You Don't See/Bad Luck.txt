Bad Luck Lyrics
I try to rise and fall with the sun
But lately, it doesn’t make any sense to me
Walking by myself trap the silence in the hall
(Trap the silence in the hall)
And I can feel the pressure in my head
I’m the book you always opened but you never read
(Never read)
Beside the box you call your bed
(Beside the box you call your bed)

It’s your fault I’d say
I let this blind me
Forlorn in sullen head
Suffer your ill intent
Suffer your ill intent

Watch your mind ignore
Just like all those times before
That’s the way it is
And I won’t write you back anymore
There’s better faces
To fill all the spaces
Left by the masks you wore

Maybe that’s the reason I was never enough (never enough)
Cause all I do is chalk it up to bad luck (bad luck)
Unfinished business has me stuck (has me stuck, stuck)
Bad luck
It’s your fault I’d say
I let this blind me
It's your fault I'd say
I let this blind me4Embed
