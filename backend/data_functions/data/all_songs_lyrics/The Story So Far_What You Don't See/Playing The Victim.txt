Playing The Victim Lyrics
Crushing you inside of my grip again
You’re breathing in
Pushing this aside till when?
Ignoring that pain
Felt you creep inside of my head again
It all depends on where I am and who I’m there with
It’s rough when we’re both square one
With so much undone
Who lost, who won?
All rain, no sun
Don’t want to have to speak to anyone

Said this will kill if you let it somehow I forget
I should be asleep I shouldn’t be upset
Playing the victim while you’re still here
Blaming the future on things I fear
I keep blaming the future on things I fear

Waking up to gloom and routine again
You’re breathing in
That air that dries your lungs
But you kept our trust
And said do what you must to be happy
And I left with a debt that called me out
Quick to be honest with it all
So now I just sing (I just sing)
About missing this and missing that
But what will it really bring?
If we’re both square one
With so much undone
Who lost, who won?
All rain

Just a special circumstance
Where in lies the worst part I can’t accept
Coming up on Fall
Are there things we haven’t spoke on yet?
Said you won’t reset
But you and I are one and the same
Don’t want to have to feel numb
I don’t want this undone
Don’t want to have to speak to anyone
