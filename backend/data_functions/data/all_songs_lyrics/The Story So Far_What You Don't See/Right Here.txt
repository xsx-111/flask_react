Right Here Lyrics
All I really want is to stay right here right now
There’s so much more to talk about
The mind you broke and the price that it costs me now
Me now

Do you see good intent?
When you read me, you’re trying to test me
You don’t get my mindset
You only see the where and the when
Is that how your time’s spent?
Anticipate then it’s gone again
It's appeal is the lust for the things you conceal
Roll on like the spoke in your wheel
Until it breaks and you feel how I feel


When I was gone
I slept by myself
And woke up alone
It feels like a fracture
A split in the bone
No more safe time
For us to be home
Leaving this again and when
You’re in their backyards
You’re not here you can’t tie my seams
So pick out those glass shards
They don’t belong in your feet
In your feet
Head on the wall
Tell me why I feel so small
When I don’t even care at all
Head on the wall
Tell me why I feel so small
When I don’t even care at all
