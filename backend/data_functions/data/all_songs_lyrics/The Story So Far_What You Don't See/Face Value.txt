Face Value Lyrics
I let the furnace of my anger
Heat where you lay
It never burned you, it just kept the cold at bay
Write it over and over again
The same chords the same end
How many times did I offend?

Is it so hard to think like we used to?
It’s nothing I can’t prove
To my stubborn self

You play roles in my fate
Struggle and fight to relate
There’s nothing here to sedate
So I wait
And write it over and over again
The same chords the same end

Is it so hard to think like we used to?
It’s nothing I can’t prove
To my stubborn self
I can’t control you
Selfish if I do
All of the plans that you made never included me
All of the plans that you made never included me
And all of the plans that you made never included me

Is it so hard to think like we used to?
It’s nothing I can’t prove
To my stubborn self
I can’t control you
Selfish if I do
All of the plans that you made never included me7Embed
