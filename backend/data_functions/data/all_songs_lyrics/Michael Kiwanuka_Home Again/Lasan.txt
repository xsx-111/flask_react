Lasan LyricsOh, when I leave, don't you cry
When I'm dead and gone will I hear your sigh
Who will lead me along?
Oh, when l've passed, don't you cry
When I'm long and gone, will I hear your sigh
Who will lead me along?
Just you live your everyday, like you're running out of time
Say the things you say, don't leave any word behind
Try to find you something that won't fade away in time
These are things I'll always seem to say
Oh, when I'm lost, don't you cry
When I've gone away will I hear your sigh
Who will lead me along?
Oh, when I'm sleeping don't you cry
When I close my eyes will I hear your sigh?
Who will lead me along?
Just you live your everyday, like you're running out of time
Say the things you say, don't leave any word behind
Try to find you something that won't fade away in time
These are things I'll always seem to say
Try to find you something that won't fade away in time1Embed
