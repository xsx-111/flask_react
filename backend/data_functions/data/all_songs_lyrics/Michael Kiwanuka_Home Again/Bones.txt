Bones Lyrics
Honey, I've been thinkin' 'bout you
All that you do
Don't you think of me too?
Lady, where you've been for so long?
I don't mean you no wrong
Had to write you this song

Well I long to be alone with you
And if I couldn't have you I don't know
What I would do?
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (This world alone)
Cuz without you I'm just bones (Booones)

Well I dream of you so much
Love you so much but
Thoughts aren't enough
Well I speak only of you
So what else is new?
What am I to do?

Well I long to be alone with you
And if I couldn't have you I don't know
What I would do?
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (This world alone)
Cuz without you I'm just bones (Booones)
Days go more and more I see
That your love is all my soul needs
But you're gone and now I'm fallin'
Fallin' to my knees

Well I long to be alone with you
And if I couldn't have you I don't know
What I would do?
Well I long to be alone with you
And if I couldn't have you I don't know
What I would do?
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (This world alone)
Cuz without you I'm just bones (Booones)
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (This world alone)
Cuz without you I'm just bones (Booones)
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (This world alone)
Cuz without you I'm just bones2Embed
