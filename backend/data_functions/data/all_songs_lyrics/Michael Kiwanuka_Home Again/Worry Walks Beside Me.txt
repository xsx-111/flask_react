Worry Walks Beside Me LyricsWorry walks beside me every day
They say I should run but it's comin' my way
I'll be doin' fine if you leave me behind
It's coming all over under my skin
Says if I follow I will die like a king
I'll be doin' fine if you leave me behind
What will it take to believe I can run
What will it take? When will I be done?
Oh Lord, I've been trying
I find him standing here all the time
I find him trying to steal all that's mine, oh
I'll be doin' fine if you leave me behind
What will it take to believe I can run
What will it take? When will I be done?
Oh Lord, I've been trying
What will it take to be free again?
I wanna leave this behind
What will it take just to see again?
All this is making me blind
What will it take to believe I can run?
What will it take? When will I be done?
Oh Lord, I've been trying
How does it feel to be flying away?
How does it feel to believe today?
Oh Lord, I've been trying
Worry walks beside me everydayEmbed
