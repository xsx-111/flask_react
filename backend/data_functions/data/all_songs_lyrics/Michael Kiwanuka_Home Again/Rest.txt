Rest Lyrics
Close your eyes
Let them rest
I ain't in no hurry, no hurry at all
Rest your head upon my shoulder
I swear I would carry, carry you on

I won't let you go, go on hungry
I won't let you cry, without a hand to dry

Rest your hands
Leave them tender
They weren't made for working, working at all

I won't let you go, go on hungry
I won't let you cry, without a hand to dry

Rest your soul, live in peace
I won't let you worry, worry at all
I won't let you worry, worry at all
I won't let you worry, worry at all1Embed
