Ode To You LyricsI didn’t mean at your feelings
I just needed a little time
I know I didn’t say I mean it
I just needed a little time
And I know it’s something we can talk about
Oh my friend I’ll never leave you again
And I know it’s something I was wrong about
Oh my friend I’ll never leave you again
You came around when I was lonely
You came around just in time
That’s something good to show me
You showed me just in time
You told me something good to talk about
Oh my friend you know you save me again
You told me something I was wrong about
Oh my friend you know I’ll be here again
There’ll be day when I’m lost
But I know how it costs to leave our friends behind
Now I’m gonna be free
And you will be there with me
There’ll be day when I’m lost
But know how it costs to leave our friends behind
Now I’m gonna be free
And you will be there with me again
I didn’t mean at your feelings
I just needed a little timeEmbed
