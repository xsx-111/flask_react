Any Day Will Do Fine LyricsHey, listen girl
Can I get along with you?
I'm in need of your time
Any day will do fine
Hey, listen girl
An hour or two will do
Just be gentle and kind
You'd really be easing my mind
My trouble upon ya
There where you lay
But they'll never know
For I'm never sure
And your time will afford ya
Might cost, I'mma pay, ooh
They'll never know
For I'm never sure
Hey, listen girl
After this song is through
I'll be changing my ways
God knows I've seen better days
Hey, listen girl
Forgive me if I seem rude
Now your dues have been paid
Through this mess that we made
My trouble upon ya
There where you lay, ooh
But they'll never know
For I'm never sure
And your time will afford ya
It might cost, I'm gon' pay, ooh
But they'll never know
For I'm never sure, oohEmbed
