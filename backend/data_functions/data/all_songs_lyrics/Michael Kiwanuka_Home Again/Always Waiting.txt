Always Waiting LyricsMy soul is yearning and I'm longing too
See my day time, see me breaking through
My time is coming soon
So I'm waiting, I'll be waiting
For you, my friend
My load ain't burdened that I count me too
My key, my body, all the things that I do
My time is coming soon
So I'm waiting, I'll be waiting
For you, my friend
Ooh, will it stay? Ooh
Ooh, will it break for me?
A toll has taken all the song that's in me
The road they're making won't take me where I should be
My song is coming soon
So I'm waiting, I'll be waiting
Always waiting for you, my friend1Embed
