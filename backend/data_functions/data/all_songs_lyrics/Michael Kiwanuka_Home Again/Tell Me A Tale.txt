Tell Me A Tale LyricsTell me a tale that always was
Sing me a song that I'll always be in
Tell me a story that I can read
Tell me a story that I believe
Paint me a picture that I can see
Give me a touch that I can feel
Turn me around so I can be
Everything I was meant to be
Lord, I need loving
Lord, I need good, good loving
Lord, I need loving
Lord, I need good, good loving
Show me some strength that I can use
Give me a sound that I won't refuse
Tell me story that I can read
Tell me a story that I can believe
Tell me a tale that always was
Sing me a song that I'll always be in
Turn me around so I can be
Everything I was meant to be
Lord, I need loving
Lord, I need good, good loving
Lord, I need loving
Lord, I need good, good loving
Lord, I need loving
Lord, I need good, good loving
Yeah, I need loving
Lord, I need good, good loving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, oh
Tell me a tale that always was
Yeah, tell me a storyEmbed
