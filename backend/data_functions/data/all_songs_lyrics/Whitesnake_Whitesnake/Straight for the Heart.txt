Straight for the Heart LyricsI'm coming round to see you
Kicking down your door
I've got to tell you girl
I really can't take no more
'Cause I've been hearing about you
Everybody says you're front page news
Laying it down all around the town
Giving all the boys the blues
Stand and deliver in the name of love
I'm coming after you
I'll tell you want I'm gonna do
I'm going straight for the heart
Gonna drive you crazy
Straight for the heart
Gonna drive you insane
I never loved a woman
The way that I love you
I can't escape the feeling
You don't know what you're putting me through
Stand and deliver in the name of love
My heart is in your hand
So try to understand
Straight for the heart
Straight for the heart
Gonna drive you crazy
Straight for the heart
Gonna drive you insane
You got the love I dream of
The kind that costs so much
Just cover me with kisses, baby
Surrender to my touch
Stand and deliver in the name of love
My heart is in your hand, try to understand
Coming after you
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Going straight for the heart
Gonna drive you crazy
Straight for the heart
Gonna drive you insane
Straight for the heart
Gonna drive you crazy
Straight for the heart
Gonna drive you insane
Straight for the heart
Gonna drive you crazy
Gonna drive you insaneEmbed
