Bad Boys LyricsOw, ow, ow, ow
I know you, you know me
I'm the black sheep of the family
I'm in and out of trouble
I'm the talk of the town
I get wild in the street when the sun goes down
I steal around like a thief in the night
Dancing till the break of day
Bad boys
Running under cover of moonlight
Bad, bad boys
Getting wild in the street, wild in the city
I see you, you see me
Just a black street boy in society
With high-heeled women full of champagne and lies
Getting wild in the street till the hot sunrise
Stealing 'round like a thief in the night
Dancing till the break of day
Bad boys
Running under cover of moonlight
Bad, bad boys
Getting wild in the street, wild in the city
Wild in the city
Wild in the city
Bad, bad boys
Running under cover of moonlight
Bad, bad boys
Getting wild in the street, wild in the city
I know you, you know me
I'm the black sheep of the family
I'm in and out of trouble
I'm the talk of the town
I get wild in the street when the sun goes down
I don't care what the people think
I can't hear what the people say
I steal around like a thief in the night
Dancin' till the break of day
Bad, bad boys
Running under cover of moonlight
Bad, bad boys
Getting wild in the street
Bad, bad, bad boys
Running under cover of moonlight
Bad, bad boys
Getting wild in the street, wild in the city
Under cover of moonlight
Under cover of moonlight
Under cover of moonlightEmbed
