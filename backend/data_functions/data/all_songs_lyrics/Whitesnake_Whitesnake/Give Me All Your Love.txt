Give Me All Your Love LyricsWhen I first saw you, baby
You took my breath away
I knew your name was trouble
But my heart got in the way
Couldn't stop myself from reaching out
I could not turn away
I don't even know your name
I can't leave you alone
I'm running 'round in circles
Like a dog without a bone
I know the game you're playing
But baby, I just can't let go
So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all of your loving tonight
I'll work hard everyday
To love and treat you right
I'll rock you in the morning
And roll you in the night
Any way you want
I wanna prove my love for you
So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Give me all of your loving tonight
Tonight, tonight
So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Just give me all of your loving tonight
So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Give me all of your loving tonight, oh
I am blinded by your smile
I'm crazy about your walk
I shiver and I shake
When I hear your baby talk
I'm a fool for your loving, babe
Give me all your love tonight, whoo
So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Give me all of your loving tonight
Anything you want from me
So give me all your love tonight
Give me all your love tonight
I'll do anything you want
Give me all of your loving tonight
Tonight, tonightEmbed
