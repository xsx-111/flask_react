Liza LyricsShe's been around a couple years
Tasted 31 flavors
There's only one she really hates
That would be vanilla bean
The blandest one don't make her scream
And that's what she likes to hear the most
Lizas been around the block
She's currently a femme bitch top
A giant step from old louise
Now who's the one who's on the prey
She used to wear her hair short long
Determine her preference
She didn't like that dynamic
Tradingin her flannel shirts
For six inch heals, latex skirts
She even bought herself some bras
Miss terrence sellers akin
She's got more power feminine
She knows the power incites fear
And its that fear which makes her wet
She's goin to the tribe 8 show
Plenty of boychicks to choose from
Its at the Calyx of Isis
She'll find a bottom young & butch
She'll tell her "I won't hurt you much
Unless of course you want me to ..."Embed
