Whatever Didi Wants LyricsWhatever Didi wants, she's gonna get it
I wouldn't walk 500 miles, when I could fly coach
But almost anything
I wouldn't swim, across the Nile
When I could get amoebic dysentery

I would do almost anything for you
'Cause if there's anything you want
I'll probably get it
Just tell me what you need
I'll try not to forget it
You need someone to blame
I'll say I said it
Whatever Didi wants, she's gonna get it
I wouldn't climb the highest mountain
Could get a blister, but almost anything
I wouldn't throw coins in a fountain
I may be needing to make a phone call

I'd call you collect whenever I could
'Cause if there's anything you want
I'll probably get it
Just tell me what you need
I'll try not to forget it
You need someone to blame
I'll say I said it
Whatever Didi wants she's gonna get it
You are so beautiful
You are so beautiful to me
We're gonna try an' get it right
I doesn't seem, like you're a million
Miles away, no. But maybe one or two
That doesn't mean, I never loved you
I love you long time, when you're on top of me

I love you as much as anyone could
'Cause if there's anything you want
I'll probably get it
Just tell me what you need
I'll try not to forget
You need someone to blame
I'll say I said it
Whatever Didi wants, she's gonna get it
Whatever Didi wants, she's gonna get it
Whatever Didi wants, she's gonna get it
Whatever Didi wants, she's gonna get it
Whatever Didi wants, she's gonna get it
Pick it up, pick it upEmbed
