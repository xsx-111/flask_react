Love Story LyricsPartly owned tudor house
Wooden white picket fence
Mother waits for father
In a backless dress
Hardly used diaphram
Put back into it's case
A one way trip down memory lane
As she awaits
I don't wanna know
Cheat me
I don't wanna know
Children play in the yard
Mother stares at a wall
Father says he's gonna be back late
So don't wait up
About a quarter to 3
Father stares at a wall
Stained thicker than water
Who's gonna clean it up
I don't wanna know
Cheat me
I don't wanna knowEmbed
