August 8th Lyrics
Birds sing, there's not a cloud in the sky
Yeah, August 8th is a beautiful day
I see, a bunch of hippies crying
Yeah, August 8th is a beautiful day
Like waking up from a real bad dream
Suddenly everything is okay
The storm has passed, the sun is shining
Yeah, August 8th is a beautiful day

What's going on? What's going on?
Is something bumming your scene?
There's something wrong, there's something wrong
I'm not trying to be mean

The air is sweet, the summer flowers blooming
Nowhere in sight is there anything grey
Feelings of joy, are filling the street
Yeah, August 8th is a beautiful day
Like waking up from a fucked up dream
Suddenly everything's looking good
There's been no permanent damage done
Yeah, August 8th came right when it should

Poor Jeff, poor little Timmy Turtle
Staying home on such a beautiful dayEmbed
