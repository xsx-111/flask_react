Philthy Phil Philanthropist LyricsThere's something wrong with mass consumption
Why do we want what we don't need?
Alcohol burn it clean, asphalt methamphetamine
Will make it seem alright
It's gonna make it seem alright
Living in the hunger underground
Some people say I gotta problem with authority
So what if I do man
It beats relinquishing control
Philthy Phil philanthropist
You've taken when you should've give away
Philthy Phil you gave to us
We cannot repay
There's something grand about being nothing
There's something lame about being grand
Alcohol squirting gun, no hot holidays in the sun
That's me not being you, that's me not being you
Either part of the solution or the problem
Can there not be a middle ground
For just the anybody
Replace Superman with Joe ordinary
Philthy Phil philanderer
You've taken when you should've give away
Philthy Phil you gave to us
We cannot repay
Philthy Phil philanthropist
You've taken when you should've give away
Philthy Phil you gave to us
We cannot repay
We cannot repayEmbed
