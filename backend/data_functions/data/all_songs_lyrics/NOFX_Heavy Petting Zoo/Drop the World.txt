Drop the World LyricsHe won the race
The judges concluded
He was the better man
He'd come from victory
A hesitation
A one time show or place
His self would not allow
He had to be the best
He had denied
His urges cause they would have drained his strength
That battle had been
Won with side effects a few
He may have dropped the world (Dana...)
He would not let us down (... has gone away)
Away I hope she's in a better place
She aced the test
A grade above the rest
Of the class felt the curve
A 93% was not enough
To feed her fix
She needs that perfect score
The endorphin rush she loved
It would opiate her
She had denied
All allegations of her loneliness
That battle had been won
With scars still under wraps
She may have dropped the world
She would not let us down
Endorphin rush she loved
She may have dropped the worldEmbed
