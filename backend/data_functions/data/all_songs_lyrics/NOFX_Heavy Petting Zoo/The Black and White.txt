The Black and White LyricsMr. McCarthy killed the light
He didn't wake his lovely wife
He left the key inside the door
Woke on the wrong side of the bed
She can't remember what he said
But she sure knew what he had done
Little choices in a
A little town maybe a
Little man is right to be afraid
Biblic moralization
Identity frustration
Confused man cannot follow his heart
So he may be fucking her
But he's thinking about him
Catherine MacKinnon does exist
She likes to call herself a feminist
A crusader who fights the patriarch
But what she really hates is sex
Erotic images oppress
And debase women as a whole
Simple solutions created
By black and white thinking
Too bad the world not work that way
Catherine should get busy porkin'
That dolt Andrea Dworkin
I think they need a good hard fuck
Cause she may be off her back
Now she needs to get off ours
The little man sits all alone
His sexuality's been cut in stone
He don't love her
She don't really care
Two victims of the black and whiteEmbed
