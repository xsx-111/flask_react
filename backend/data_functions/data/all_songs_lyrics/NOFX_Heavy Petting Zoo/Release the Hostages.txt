Release the Hostages LyricsStop
Have a beer it's on me
Has anyone ever told you
That you look like star
Innocent at the bar
So I drink 'cause it makes me
Happier than being alone
My good friend Johnny Walker
Keeps me warm like a cunt
Seems like everybody's got
Something I have not: a reason not to die
So I say death to mister right 'cause that's not meEmbed
