Bleeding Heart Disease LyricsHow money polluted my mind
Dough what our lives are lived for
Rae just a crazy Aussie
Me the generation forges on
Fodder for corporations
Sewing our lips together
LA such a nice place to get shot
Don't forget the T it follows
Liber in the constitution
Following the part about pursuit
Of happiness the bi-product of
Colonial precious metal mine extracts
Which brings us back to dough
Today I saw a kid torture a cat
Too much leisure
Teenage Norman Rockwell
Paints it black
How did the chain get started?
More is what everyone wants
Needy is what none of us are
Cooperation died last night
Ruptured bleeding heart foresight
Me I'm just a loo
So don't expect the best you won't be
Disappointed when you take a bite
And watch the worm crawl back inside
Don't believe the fairy tales
Of million dollar happiness
Los Angeleistic lifestyles
Chardonnay
The pursuit of million dollar happiness
Happiness was killed we watched it bleed
Some say it died from hate
Some say from bleeding heart disease
How money polluted my mind
How money polluted my mindEmbed
