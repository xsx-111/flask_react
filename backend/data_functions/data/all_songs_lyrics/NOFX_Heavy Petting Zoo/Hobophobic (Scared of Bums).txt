Hobophobic (Scared of Bums) LyricsHobo!
I'm hobophobic, so what? (Ah, ah, ah)
Scared of bums
Not just because they stink bad
Not just because they're crackers
From drinking too much Lysol

Let them be
Just don't get fucking near me
Scared of bums (Ah, ah, ah)
Infested with microscopic bugs
Endocrine systematic doo-doo
Why don't they get a job?
