Freedom Lika Shopping Cart LyricsA Christian, an anarchist slash prostitute
Figures out the true meaning
Of freedom, not freedom like America
Freedom like a shopping cart
Kick back, no tense, you gotta bag of grub
Cost you about 50 cents
No fear, no fuckin' feat, malt liquor
Tastes much better on the street
Crustin', a way of life for heroines
And heroes who hitch hike the road
To Eden, not Eden like the garden state
Eden like the state of mind
Kick back, cheap thrills, you'll do anythin'
For a laugh even if it kills you
The bridge, you took it out
The ticket takers suddenly lost count
Sleeping under rays
Your teeth crumbling away
Say goodbye to all responsibility
You never wanted it man
Wasting time
Whenever you get the chance
Which happens to be all the time
Kick back, free meals, a couple times a day
You make a couple of shady deals
No work, no fuckin' pay
Cardboard condominium by the bay
Between the red and black
You're never going back
Say goodbye to all responsibility
You never wanted it manEmbed
