After the Ending LyricsPain runs through life
Pleasures' other side
Fear, some say, gives us such long lives
Leads us where we drive
Time will soon be born
It is starting at the dawn
And the world is moving towards
Things like opposites and wars
And one knows to hear birds sing
There was nothing 'til the beginning
And the water from my eyes
Is because I care who dies
Although death is transforming
There is nothing after the ending
"Everything is eternal
Nothingness does not exist
No thing has ever become nothing
And nothing has never become something
What is has always been and will always be"Embed
