God LyricsSo each day would be new
I built you to sleep
That's the idea of dying
But you'll just have to see
You can do what you want
Or so you think
But til you stop all your thoughts
You're tied to your surroundings
When the fog spreads out in the rainy season
It comes from my insides
When the thunderous lightning strikes down
You're seeing your real I
People
You blaspheme my name
But still I love you, still I love you
I love you just the same
I hear all your prayers because I'm each one of you
Creation's not something I did it's something that I do
The reason for the bad is so there'd be such thing as good
Oh I'd do anything for you, you all know I would
Be for me
Be for me
Be for me
Before me
Before me
Before me
You know that I try to repair and repay
As life goes by a thousand times it gets a little better
All is belief
All is belief
All is belief
All is belief1Embed
