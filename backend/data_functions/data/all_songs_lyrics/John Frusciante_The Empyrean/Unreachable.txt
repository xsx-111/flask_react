Unreachable LyricsAre we
Down for the same cause
We don't know what we stand for
When the moments start to crack
You do lose track where your head's at
And I am unreachable
What do you think when your head's full
We don't rely on what we get
We begin now where we aren't yet
Hey
One time, hit me where I turn white
I don't mean to be polite
Uniform
Spinning the world to the beat of my drum
Uniform
One time, hit me where I turn white
I don't mean to be polite
Uniform
Spinning the world to the beat of my drum
Uniform
Reach into the darkness for what you can find
Travel great distance in your mind
The world gets stronger as you start trying things
Turn around towards being born
Away from dying
I've run out again, there's no one on my side
We to disappear, well I know I tried
You know we tried, you know we tried
End
Shoot me
End
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Yeah yeah hey yeah
