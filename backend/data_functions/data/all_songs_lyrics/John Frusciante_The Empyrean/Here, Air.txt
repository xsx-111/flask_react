Here, Air LyricsHow can I be who I could've been?
I'd like to start over again
Angels, did I fail you with my fall?
What are we but the cause of it all
It's been a long time
Of getting out of myself
Now that I'm here I find
That what gives me life
Is all you are
It's all you have
How can I get just one more chance
I see you in pain and I wish I had
The ability to be your man
They once told me that time would come to pass
Now I know to be careful
What I don't believe
'Cause that fate came so close
But right out of my reach
What's good for you is what's good for me too
Do you hear I'm here for you now
I am here for you nowEmbed
