Song to the Siren LyricsLong afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me
Were you hare when I was fox
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing
Touch me not
Touch me not
Come back tomorrow
O my heart
O my heart shies from the sorrow
I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as troubled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers
Or should I lie with death my bride
Hear me sing
Swim to me
Swim to me
Let me unfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold youEmbed
