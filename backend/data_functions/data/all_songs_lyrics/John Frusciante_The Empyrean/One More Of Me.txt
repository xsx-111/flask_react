One More Of Me LyricsNow that the day is come
I see myself as everyone
I am what's all around me
No nothing it just cannot be
Feeling has come from the sun
Like most everything and everyone
What seems lost is free from the force
That slowly destroys us and kills all matter off
Well we don't control the chance that plays with us
And we get existence back by hurting others
When we go the other way it's ourselves we hurt
But who pushes on through eventually will see every moment's first
Every moment is first
What's gone will never come back
But it exists when you think of it
And what is anything anyway
But a series of things running through your brain
All of the fucked things you do
Are the product of what's happened to you
Whatever you create from love
Is a gift from the place which some call up above
There's only the forces of hate and love
One breaks things down and one builds them up
Yeah Hey
