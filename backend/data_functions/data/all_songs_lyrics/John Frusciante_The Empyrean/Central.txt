Central Lyrics
I'm central to nowhere
Thinking of sweeping it clean
When we choose to go we're losing more
Than just our surroundings
I've gone around the sides of this universe as it stands
Outside the limits of all existence
Where light never ends

We should be grateful to the gods
Whoever they're real to they are
I value my placement as in Hell
Remember that moment that I fell

Anything that could one day be is as real as what I'm saying
If something is nothing it must not be
Something in any possible way
Lo-lo-lose yourself in the far off worlds
That are right under your feet
Switch below with above all the way up into infinity

We should be thankful who we are
Whether we know ourselves or not
Walking alongside myself
Neither of us listens very well (no)

I'm dreading a time that is not near
As a man on a cross I have no fear
I can't believe these words I'm saying
You gotta feel your lines
You gotta feel your lines


I'm dreading a time that is not near
As a man on a cross I have no fear
I can't believe these words I'm saying
You gotta feel your lines
You gotta feel your lines
I'm dreading a time that is not near..

I'm dreading a time that is not near
As a man on a cross I have no fear
I can't believe these words I'm saying
You gotta feel your lines
You gotta feel your lines
Dreading a time that is not near
As a man on a cross I do not fear
I can't believe these words I'm saying
You gotta feel your lines
You gotta feel your lines4Embed
