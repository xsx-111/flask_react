Heaven LyricsWell I spent the night in Heaven
I wanted to figure it out by myself
I spin around the fortress
You never know the currency that we all run on
We run on
We run on
You once told me you keep a billion frequencies on your person
End the night with Channel 4
You don't see me looking you up when I'm here
We live fast, 'cause time won't last
See me freezing, like the bum I am
From where you start, there's endless information drilled into your eyes
Well, I don't need protection
When life begins, another dies, bad timing
I won't last, man that's the facts
It is a feeling that will never pass
And you know you could be taking us far
When I speak to you again through the stages of pleasure
Well I don't have my own face
So come on and be replaced
There's a future that's calling
But I don't see it coming
Yeah
No I don't have my own face
So come on and be replaced
There's a future that's calling
But I don't see coming
No I don't see it coming
No I don't see it coming
No I don't see it comingEmbed
