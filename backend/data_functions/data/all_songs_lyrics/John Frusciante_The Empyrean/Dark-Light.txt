Dark/Light LyricsRemember all you've forgotten
I can't put those thoughts away
Anything I thought's in my head to stay
Now what do we get for trying to follow to a tee
All the instructions you gave to me
Did you ever notice
That it's for you that I've lived my life
Every time I had fun you were on my mind
I've lost my perspective, I've gone off the wall
Really not sure if I'm needed here at all
Hey
This is my last shot
I'll always be less than my other selves
So I feel like I'm competing with someone else
Who I could never beat in a million years
I was made to think that we would wind up 'round here
Will we ever get together?
(In a song, in a song, in a song)
Will you ever tell everyone
('Bout right and wrong, right and wrong)
Will you let everyone in on
(The meaning of life and death)
Do you need me or are you waiting
(For my last breath)
