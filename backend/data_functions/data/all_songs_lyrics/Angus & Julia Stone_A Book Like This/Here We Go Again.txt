Here We Go Again LyricsYou know what they say about getting older
It's only a doorway away
You know what they say about getting colder
In the middle of the day
You can live in the corner of my room
And I will live somewhere between the ceiling and the wall
And if I need anything at all
I'll call out to you
That's what I'll do
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
I'll sit out on the front sofa while
Your hands they talk to me
All of this dragging around
It's not as fun as it used to be
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
All that I wanted all that I needed
All that I wanted all that I needed
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go again
Oh here we go againEmbed
