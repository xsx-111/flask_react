The Beast Lyrics
Pack up your things
Your work here is done
A slave to the beast
No mercy with time
No mercy with time

They brand you with the fire
Then push you into the sun
They want the free land to expire
They want everyone to be numb
The worlds drinking from a cup that no one wants to share
Words from the king that no one wants to hear

Don't be running, late are you on time today?
Don't be running, late are you on time today?
Don't be running, late are you on time today?
Don't be running, late are you on time today?

Retrench me because of machines
Kids trading roses for guns
Track mark under the sleeve
I can't talk I need to run
Loves thrown away the ring
Not knowing what to say
Mama won't you sing
It's like you're cut by the blade
Don't be running late are you on time today?
Don't be running late are you on time today?
Don't be running late are you on time today?
Don't be running late are you on time today?
Don't be running late are you on time today?
(Don't be running late)
Don't be running late are you on time today?
(Don't be running late)
Don't be running late are you on time today?
(Don't be running late)
Don't be running late are you on time today?
(Don't be running late)

(Don't be running late)
(Don't be running late)
(Don't be running late)
(Don't be running late)
(Don't be running late)
(Don't be running late)
(Don't be running late)Embed
