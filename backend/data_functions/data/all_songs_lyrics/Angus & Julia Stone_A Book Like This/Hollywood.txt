Hollywood LyricsI blame you Hollywood
For showing me things you never should
Show a young girl
In a cruel world
Because life's not a happy ending
I'm sure there is some
Like Johnny and June
And maybe other people too
They all would've been killed
In the sound of music
They would have found out that
Pinocchio could never tell the truth
She wouldn't made it to shore
The little mermaid
He would of married a whore from a wealthy family
After all he was royalty
Cinderella would have scrubbed those floors
Till her hands grew old and tired
And nobody would look her way
That's the way it goes today
I blame you Hollywood
For showing me things you never should
Show a young girl
In this cruel world
Because life's not a happy ending
I'm sure there are some
Like Johnny and June
And maybe other people too
And maybe other people too
And maybe other people too
And maybe other people too
And maybe other people too
And maybe other people too
Like me and youEmbed
