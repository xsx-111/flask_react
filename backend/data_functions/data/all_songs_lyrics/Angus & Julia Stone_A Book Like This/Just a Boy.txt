Just a Boy LyricsI bit my tongue in the arc of conversation
I don't know why
I don't know why
I met you once and I'd fallen for your notions
I don't know why
I don't know why
Do you believe that there's treasures in the ocean?
Did I say I'm just a boy?
One kiss from you and I'm drunk up on your potion
That big old smile is all you wore
Girl you make me want to feel
Things I've never felt before
Girl you make me want to feel
Did I say I'm just a boy?
Did I say I'm just a boy?
You can hold me to that
No lonely hands grab my suitcase full of nothing
I don't know why
I don't know why
You took me in gave me something to believe in
That big old smile is all you wore
Girl you make me want to feel
Things I've never felt before
Girl you make me want to feel
Did I say I'm just a boy?
Did I say I'm just a boy?
You can hold me to that3Embed
