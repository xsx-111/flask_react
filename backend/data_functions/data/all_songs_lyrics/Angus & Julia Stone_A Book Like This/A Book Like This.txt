A Book Like This LyricsSun lights up the day time
You light up my life
The hand that calls you forward
Is the hand that leaves me behind
And I stand on the ocean shore
Like an old black and white movie
Love is tears, love is lost, again tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight
You’ve got a book like this
To keep me alive
And if its not a rainy day
You simply don’t go outside
And you’re tired of everything
All of the girls and the boys
And you’re tired of everything
All of your precious toys
Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me goodnight
Sun lights up the daytime
You light up my life
The hand that calls you forward
Is the hand, that leaves me behind
Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonightEmbed
