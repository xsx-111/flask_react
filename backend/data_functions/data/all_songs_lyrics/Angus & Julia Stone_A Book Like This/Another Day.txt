Another Day LyricsDown by the seashore
The waves are bigger then normal
I asked you if I could flicker out
You say: "Don't think so,"
I just want you to believe
Even though I know it's impossible for me
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
Down by the seashore
I'll say it's the spray
I'm not crying
Such a little thing, anyway
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
All I wanted was for you to believe
All I wanted was for you to believe
All I wanted was for you to believe in me
All I wanted was
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to, oh
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted toEmbed
