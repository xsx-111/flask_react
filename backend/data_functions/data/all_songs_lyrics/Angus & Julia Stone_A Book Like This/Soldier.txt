Soldier LyricsI met him down by the bay
He said life is a stranger
That won't go away
He took me by surprise
And I felt for the first time
What its like to be alive
I’m a soldier
But I don’t know how to fight
I’m your best friend
But I’m scared to see you tonight
I’m the darkness
But I want to be the light
Oh how I want to be
Oh how I want to be
I met him down by the sea
Said I look like someone he knew
I said I don’t know anyone
So how could I possibly know you
He touched my hand
Finally I understand
What it means to be here with you
I’m a soldier
But I don’t know how to fight
I’m your best friend
But I’m scared to see you tonight
I’m the darkness
But I want to be the light
Oh how I want to be
Oh how I want to be
I’m a soldier
But I don’t know how to fight
I’m your best friend
But I’m scared to see you tonight
I’m the darkness
But I want to be the light
Oh how I want to be
Oh how I want to beEmbed
