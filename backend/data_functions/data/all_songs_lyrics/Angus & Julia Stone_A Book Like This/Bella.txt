Bella Lyrics(Hello)
There goes the gal
In the pretty skirt with the
Golden smile that made you feel new
Like when the marching band strolls the street
You know another years come too soon
So you took her hand and she gave a look
That sent you to the moon
And there you spoke the words of a gentleman
Can I have this dance with you?
Can I share this dance with you?
Won't you come on home?
I built us a flying machine
And we'll go where you want, we'll sail the seven seas
I hope all is well, in Daisy's dreams
There goes the gal
Yeah the pretty bird, on the golden mile that made you feel real
She took withon to the stars
She don't make no big deal
There she sits with them big old fields of daisies and rusty mills
And when the sun it shines on her hair of gold
She's beautiful
She's beautiful
Won't you come on home?
I built us a flying machine
And we'll go where you want, we'll sail the seven seas
I hope all is well in Daisy's dreams1Embed
