Horse and Cart LyricsThe moon has blocked the sun
That I haven't seen for days
It walks the street as the chimneys burn
I'll drink some beer as to find my way
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home
The streets were made for horse and cart
They talk to mine behind close doors
Stood in the rain to feel the part
This maze I stand of concrete walls
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home
Suspicious corpse without a face
The screen light's a hidden dim
This black hawk can't find its place
Through the night we swim
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way homeEmbed
