Me and My Woman LyricsI never know what kind of day it is on my battlefield of ideals
But the way she touches and the way it feels, must be just how it heals
Ah but it's got a little better since I let her sundance
I never know what time of year it is living on top of the fire
But the robin outside has to hunt and hide in the cold frosty shire
Ah but he knows just what goes in between his cold toes and his warm ears
And he's got no disguise in his eyes for his love as she nears
He spreads her a shelter
She takes the tall skies
As they helter skelter
Along the same sighs
And she wakes my days with a glad face
She fakes and says I'm a hard case
She makes and plays like a bad ace
Carrying my ways into scarred space
And she knows me well
Ah but what the hell
Only time can tell, where we're going to
Me and my woman
Me and my little woman
And the Lord speaks out and the pigpens fawn
The sword slides out and the nations mourn
The hoard strides out and the chosen spawn
The devil rides out and the heavens yawn
And he knows me well
Ah but what the hell
Only time can tell, where we're going to
Me and my woman
Me and my woman
Me and my little woman
What a lovely day
What a day to play at living
What a mess we make
What a trust we break
Not giving our wings to our children
O how we fail them
O how we nail them
Sunset my colour
And king is my name
Darkness she's my lover
And we live in shame
Too far away
From the light of the day
And so near, and so near, near
Can i break through the silence that has taken my place
On the plains of the morning that i just could not face
Asking you these questions
Telling you these lies
Enveloping directions
Developing disguise
Open to suggestions
But closed to all my eyes
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Space is just an ashtray
Flesh is my best wheel
The atmosphere's my highway
And the landscape's my next meal
I need my own Good Friday
And I'm trying my best to fix the deal
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
I am the new crowned landlord
Of all beneath my star
Queuing up for doomsday
In my homesick motor car
Born before my mother
Died before my Pa
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
Dead on arrival, right where I stand
The cuckoo, she moves through the dawn fanfare
The dew leaves the rooves in the magic air
Feel a finger running through my nightmares lair
Feel most together with my nowhere stare
And you know me well
Ah but what the hell
Only time can tell, where am I going to
Me and my woman
Me and my little woman
Me and my woman
Me and my little woman2Embed
