One Man Rock and Roll Band LyricsWelcome back, you total stranger
Welcome to the Fountainhead
Welcome back, there is no danger
You don't need your gun, man, we're already dead
Welcome home, the war is over
Welcome back, the coast is clear
Welcome home, O Johnny soldier
We treat you here just like they treat you there
We're the one man rock and roll band
On our very last one night stand
Rocking the boat and unrolling the note
On which our friend Cardinal Doomsday will land
And you tell me that Grandad was a hero
That he fought for peace and no more guns
But you know I think he must have changed his name to Nero
You see 'cause everytime he grunts, he kills his sons
And when you stood there with your mottos on your knuckles
And they were all so really pleased to see you there
Well don't you think you could have taken Grandad and his medals
And played a different game in Grosvenor Square
You know we're the one man rock and roll band
On your very last one night stand
Rocking the boat and unrolling the note
On which your friend Cardinal Doomsday can landEmbed
