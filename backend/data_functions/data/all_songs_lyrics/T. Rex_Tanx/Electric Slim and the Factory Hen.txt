Electric Slim and the Factory Hen LyricsOn the street, people call you a foxy girl
Me, I'm loose, like a golden goose, you can have my juice
Steady on soldier, watch what you're doing to my girl
Steady on soldier, watch what you're doing to my girl
Electric slim, and the factory hen man, they ain't my kind
At dead of night, like a fiery kite, you've been on my mind
Frozen feet on a winter street, man that ain't your fate
Greased in the sun, California fun, man that's more my styleEmbed
