Country Honey LyricsTake me down to the country honey
Take me down to the country honey
In a jeep that's sweet
In a jeep that's neat
Take me down to the country honey
Take me down to the sea-side baby
Take me down to the sea-side baby
In a jeep that's neat
In a jeep that's sweet
Take me down to the country honeyEmbed
