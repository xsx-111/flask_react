The Street and Babe Shadow LyricsTiger tim the tightrope walker
Tried to steal the dragons daughter
O Babe
I do mean babe
Menace lurks in houses only
Where the hearts are fat and bony
Babe
I do mean babe
Golden risks and folly's rainbow
Down the drain where all the time goes
Babe
I do mean babe
Frozen joe the ballet boxer
Chromed his toes to get his rocks off
Babe
I do mean babe
All the rats and all the peacocks
Built a ship and flew to venus
Babe
I do mean babe
Pain is meat and meat is people
Your head's a house your soul's the steeple
Babe
I do mean babe
Painted toes and purple earlobes
Life's a gas but it's such a scene though
Babe
I do mean babe
(Shake it)
I do mean babe
I could t-tell you something
I could t-tell you something
Babe
I do mean babeEmbed
