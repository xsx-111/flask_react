Highway Knees LyricsShe could have layed, could have stayed, on the highway
I could have loved her, O yes I could
Her children stayed, could have played, on the highway
I could have known them. O yes I could
On my knees I'm Begging please uh huh
She could have layed, could have stayed, on the highway
I could have loved her, O yes I could
On my knees I'm begging please uh huh
On my knees I'm begging please uh huh
On my knees I'm begging please uh huhEmbed
