Life Is Strange LyricsStrange, life is strange, life is strange
Oh life is strange
O god, life is strange
People come and people go
Some move fast and some move slow
No, no, no, no, no
O god, life is good
Some are fat and some are thin
Some don't even ask you how you've been
No, no, no, no, no
Strange, life is strange, life is strange
Oh life is strange
O god, life is good
Some are fat and some are thin
Some don't even ask you how you've been
No, no, no, no, no
O god, life is strange
Some are fast and some are slow
Some believe me don't even know
No, no, no, no, no
Strange, life is strange, life is strange
Oh my life is strangeEmbed
