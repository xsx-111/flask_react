Tenement Lady LyricsOw!
Tenement lady, stone drug mama, street hawk stone heart
Mind that swiftly falls apart
Sudden sid groove lid, sharp as the dark park, pickle pump peeper
Mind that swiftly falls apart
Count lurch hearse head, prince of the snick snacks
Got a pierced ear mind fear, of the sailors with their perfume
Molly mouse dream talk, gin house milk shake
She steals my magazines, she's a lazer lipped lover yeah!
Oh my darling there are many ways to, love you
Underneath sheets of silk I slyly peep at you
The giants and the dwarfs all call the same, Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh my darling there are many ways to view you
To me your almost like a hammer and screw
People on the street call out your name
The giants and the dwarfs all call the same, Oh yeah, oh yeah ohEmbed
