Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys LyricsCall yourself friend, and look me in the eye
I'll unstrap my knees an apologise
'Cos I'm, Left Hand Luke and the beggar boys
O yes we are
Ain't no neighbours, upon our hill
'Crept slight thigh Be-bop and old gumbo jill
But I'm, Left Hand Luke and the beggar boys
O yes we are
Ain't nobody's some-one
And it hurts deep inside
Just call us taxi mama and we'll take you for a ride
'Cos we're, Left Hand Luke and the beggar boys
O yes we are
Left hand luke and the beggar boys
O yes we are
Myxomatosis is an animal's disease
But I got so shook up mama that it ate away my knees
And I'm Left Hand Luke and the beggar boys
O yes we are
Ain't had no money lord, but it's plain to see
If you had some silver mister how much would you pay for me?
'Cos I'm, Left Hand Luke and the beggar boys
O yes we are
No one's gonna fool me babyEmbed
