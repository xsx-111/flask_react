Mister Mister LyricsMister mister mister I'm just looking for a change in my luck
Mister mister mister I'm just looking for a change in my luck
Looking for a change
Baby baby baby I'm just looking with my eye to the sky
Baby baby baby i'm just looking with my eye to the sky
With my eye to the sky
Looking, I'm gonna keep on looking babe
Keep on looking, I'm gonna keep on looking babe, for a change
Sister sister sister I'm just looking for a change in my love
Sister sister sister I'm just looking for a change in my love
Looking for a change
Looking, I'm gonna keep on looking babe
Keep on looking, I'm gonna keep on looking babe
Looking I'm gonna keep on looking babe
Keep on looking, I'm gonna keep on looking babe
