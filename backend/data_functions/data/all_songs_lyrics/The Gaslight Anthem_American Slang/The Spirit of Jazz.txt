The Spirit of Jazz LyricsThe Cool is dead, baby, go on to sleep
Rest your weary head and love a better me
And in the morning we'll start over again
That's how they do it up on the screen
See me and my baby, we would dance all night
But I don't know the steps in my baby's time
To do it like they do it for the girls uptown
I heard they light 'em up like the blues
So I'm waiting
And she's waiting
For us to remember
Was I good to you, the wife of my youth?
Not another soul could love you like my rotten bones do
So I will wait on the edges in between
These New York streets where you and I would meet
For twenty-nine years we loved that line
And I would take it easy if I had your mind
But I'm a cannonball to a house on fire
And you're slow like Motown soul
So what now, lover with your long black hair?
If I cut you open, baby, I can repair
Bandage your wounds with the salt on my tongue
And I'm the only one around here
And I'm waiting
And she's waiting
For us to recover
So was I good to you, the wife of my youth?
Not another soul could love you like my rotten bones do
So I will wait on the edges in between
These New York streets where you and I would meet
And only I can heal your wounds
Only I can heal your wounds
When you can't go on, when you can't go on
When you can't go on, when you know, hold on
Was I good to you, the wife of my youth?
Not another soul could love you like my
Was I good to you, the wife of my youth?
Not another soul could love you like my rotten bones do
So I will wait on the edges in between
And I will wait on the edges in between
And I will wait on the edges in between
These New York streets
On all these New York streets
Where you and I would meetEmbed
