Boxer LyricsGot your pride and your prose
Tucked just like a Tommy gun
Somewhere in the smoke
Just in case you need it
I know you got your pride and your prose
Tucked just like a Tommy gun
Somewhere in the smoke, just in case you need it, son
I heard it's been a ride rougher than the last one
What'd you used to say? Oh, the harder they come
But he, he swears, he's praying for a good time
And he, he said, he just doesn't miss her
And I have heard you never really lose it, do you?
Do you?
You took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
You found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
But there was something heavy holding you down
And there were whispers that were driving you crazy
And now you haunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby
And your tattooed knuckles, oh how they grind down
Try to be a man, tough just like your father
Try to settle down, more like c-calm down
Remember them songs and the reasons we were singing for
But he said he just doesn't miss her
And he, he says it's somewhere in his framework
And I have heard you never really lose it, do you?
Do you?
You took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
You found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
But there was something heavy holding you down
And there were reasons that were driving you crazy
Until you haunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby
And you can wait all night long
Until it all goes wrong
And you waste away your soul
And you can wait, wait, wait, wait
You took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
You found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
But there was something heavy holding you down
And there were whispers that were driving you crazy
Until you haunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby
Remember when I knew a boxer, babyEmbed
