Old Haunts LyricsOh Cherry Bomb, you are a mystery
Exploding sparkling quiet nights
My teenage heart pumped all my misery, baby
To fingertips that might ignite
And all along you knew my story, didn't you?
And all night long I carried yours
Your blood was mixed with wine and robbery, baby
And left us always wanting more
So don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
And god help the man who says "If you'd have known me when..."
Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts
(Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts)
Cherry Bomb, your love is surgery
Removing what you don't regard
And every breath felt like a funeral, baby
While you were packing up your car
And with the window down, I hear you're tired now
You borrowed everything and wore all your old welcomes out
Well, shame on you, my love, you sold your youth away
Memories for sinking ships that never would be saved
So don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
God help the man who says "If you'd have known me when..."
Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts
Old haunts are for forgotten ghosts
And shame, shame, shame, shame on you
You kept your mind and heart and youth just like a tomb
Shame, shame, shame, shame on you
You kept your mind and heart and youth just like a tomb
Just like a tomb
Just like a tomb
Just like a tomb
And don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
So god help the man who says "If you'd have known me when..."
Old haunts are for all those ghosts
And don't sing me your songs about the good times
Those days are gone and you should just let them go
And god help the man who says "If you'd have known me when..."
God help the man who says "If you'd have known me when..."
God help this man, oh babe if you'd have known me when
Old haunts are all we've ever knownEmbed
