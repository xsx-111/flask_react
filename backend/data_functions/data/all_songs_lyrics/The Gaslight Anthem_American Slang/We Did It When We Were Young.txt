We Did It When We Were Young LyricsDon't write me no more letters, my mailbox is full of bombs
Between you and the crooks on my block
I don't remember the good times, I wasn't there when you were kind
And my wife has some dogs in our yard
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun
We were strangers many hours and I missed you for so long
When we were lions, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned
But I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
There are no reasons to believe, I buried my faith in another plot
With your heart and your clothes when I find
That I don't feel you or recall, I'll put your bones out in the yard
For someone else to be called and called by
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun
We were strangers many hours and I missed you for so long
When we were lions, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned
But I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were youngEmbed
