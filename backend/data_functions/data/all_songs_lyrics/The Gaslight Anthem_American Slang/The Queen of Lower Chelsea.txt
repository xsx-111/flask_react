The Queen of Lower Chelsea Lyrics
Did you grow up lonesome and one of a kind?
Were your records all you had to pass the time?
Or maybe you were taken by the mysteries of New Orleans
Or the uptight rowdy girls in Lower Chelsea

And we hustle in London
But we live in the city
And we keep it down
When we take a beating
Yeah, we keep it down
With the radio on
And if you found a good man
Don't take him home

When you're working full-time
And spending all of your nights
Never dancing like you did
While the gravity hangs on all the selling points you had
Should've stayed and been the Queen of Lower Chelsea

Did you grow up a good girl
Your daddy's pride?
Did you make all the right moves
Take all the right drugs
Right on time?
American girls they want the whole world
They want every last little light in New York City
But we hustle in London and we're fast asleep
And we keep it down
When we take a beating
Yeah, we keep it down
With the radio on
And if you found a good man
Don't take him home

When you're working full-time
And spending all of your nights
Never dancing like you did
While the gravity hangs on all the selling points you had
Should've stayed and been the Queen of Lower Chelsea

Well, they say these days
Nothing comes cheap
And everything has a price
Everyone has a price
Not nothing is free
Not even me

When you're working full-time
And spending all of your nights
Never dancing like you did
While the gravity hangs on all the selling points you had
Should've stayed and been the Queen
When you're working full-time
And spending all of your nights
Never dancing like you used to
While the gravity hangs on all the selling points you had
Should've stayed and been the Queen of Lower ChelseaEmbed
