American Slang Lyrics
Look what you started
I seem to be coming out of my skin
And look what you've forgotten here
The bandages just don't keep me in

And when it was over, I woke up alone
And when it was over, I woke up alone
And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes in American Slang

Look at the damage
The fortunes came for the richer men
While we're left with gallows
Waiting for us liars to come down and hang

And when it was over, I woke up alone
And when it was over, I woke up alone
And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes in American Slang
And here's where we died that time last year
And here's where the angels and devils meet
And you can dance with the queen if you need
And she will always keep your cards close to her heart
So close to her heart before they tear you apart

And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
I called for my father but my father had died
We called for our fathers but our fathers have died
While you told us fortunes in American Slang
While you told me fortunes in American SlangEmbed
