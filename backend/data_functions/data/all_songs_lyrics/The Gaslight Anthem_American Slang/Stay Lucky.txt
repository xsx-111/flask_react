Stay Lucky LyricsIt took so long to get me back on my feet
It takes so long to find the words and the beat
And Charlie's waiting on the end of the phone
To hear you call on him to try to recapture
But them old records won't be saving your soul
And them feelings died for reasons, you know
That you've forgotten somewhere riding the train
To a place you bought out in Ronkonkoma
And it feels like all you'd have to do is step outside
Stop pacing around and waiting for some moment that might never arrive
But you're never gonna find it
Like when you were young and everybody used to call you Lucky
Nothing feels right in the winter and cold
Steam, heat, clang and the dark at your door
All the other rooms are a party tonight
And you never got an invitation
And you feel it in your bones, steady aching some more
Twenty-five years gone about an hour ago
Mama never told me there'd be days like these
Till it was much too late to recover
And it feels like all you'd have to do is step outside
Stop pacing around and waiting for some moment that might never arrive
But you're never gonna find it
When your knees, they got so weak
But it's right here in case you need it
Like when you were young and everybody used to call you Lucky
When you were young and everybody used to call you Lucky
But it feels like you just might explode inside
You've been pacing around and waiting for some moment that might never arrive at all
What you don't have, you don't need it anymore
What you don't have, you don't need it anymore
But you're never gonna find it
When your knees, they got so weak
But it's right here in case you need it
Like when you were young and everybody used to call you Lucky
When you were young, when everybody used to call you Lucky
If you're anywhere in Manhattan in the next eight days or so, let me know
Speak soon, stay luckyEmbed
