The Diamond Church Street Choir Lyrics
Now the lights go low on the avenue
And the cars pass by in the rain
The university boys and the girls fill the bars
While I'm just waiting on the light to change
And the steam heat pours from the bodies on the floor
In the basement where the Jackknives play
For the Hub City girls in the ribbons and the curls
Who know the meaning of staying out late
The know the meaning of staying out very, very late
Singing

Who does it better than we do
Them sopranos in Andy Diamond's choir
Whoa, nobody knows
I've been crazy for so long without you

Now find me beat down out in the universe
Though I'll never forget where I'm from
I might have moved away from home
And slept out there on my own
A million miles away in the storm
But the beat never leaves
And the tempo's a relief
To my aching bones, rambling all over
And if I'm gone for too long
I can always hum along
So don't you never forget what I told you
So don't you never forget what I told you
Everybody singing

Just, baby who sings the rhythm and the blues
So sad, so slow
Like I do, like I do
And oh, ain't it just like you want to
And oh, ain't it just like you always wanted to
Every night waiting
So long without you

Baby, who sings it better than we do
Them sopranos in Andy Diamond's choir
Whoa, nobody knows
I've been crazy for so long without you
Just, baby who sings the rhythm and the blues
So sad, so slow
Like I do
And just like you want toEmbed
