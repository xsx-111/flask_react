Motivational Song LyricsJohnny, Johnny get on with your life
Won't get a chance, to get on with it twice
So if fucking up feels right
Then fuck it up
Spread love and you're less likely
To step in shit when you're retracing
Share what people show you

Johnny, Johnny get on with your life
Won't get a chance, to get on with it twice
So if fucking up feels right
Then fuck it up
Spread love and you're less likely
To step in shit when you're retracing
