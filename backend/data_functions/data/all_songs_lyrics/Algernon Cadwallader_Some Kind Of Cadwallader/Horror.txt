Horror LyricsPorcelain seat reading
That keeps me up to my eyes in covers at night
But the one that scared the shit out of me
Followed Frankenstein
And the walking dead
Drake Douglas depicts
The African
Slave trade
And blunts Dracula's teeth
(Drake Douglas depicts)
Wolfman loses his wolf
The dead alive
Walk back to their graves
And crawl inside
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
And all of these
Just baby brother of
American historyEmbed
