Casual Discussion in a Dome Between Two Temples LyricsHaiku-Like
Imagination
Big bright buddha adjust
The station
I'm at this party
Gutty-what's moving to
The electric avenue
Let's engage in an
Ongoing conversation
Hopping from topic to topic
From the tropic of cancer to recess and bitches
My work's always coming home with me
More dirty dishes
More baby kittens
And sucker punchesEmbed
