The Stars LyricsMoving
Steady now
Steady now
Steady now
About one
Mile per hour
Mile per hour
Mile per hour
Upwards
Slow and steady
Slow and steady
Slow
And I've never been more
Touched by
Girls hands
Pretty little fingers
They will become the stars
The world is
A rolling stone
Simultaniously gathering and
Hunting
They will become the stars
THESE MAGIC MOMENTSEmbed
