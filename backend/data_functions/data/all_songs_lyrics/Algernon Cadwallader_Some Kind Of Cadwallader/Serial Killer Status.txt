Serial Killer Status LyricsOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
We'll always give second chances
Convinced there
May be something on the ceiling
Like sex with an old sweetheart
Try not looking at that
You old dog
You can't just get off the bus now
So cut off your feet
And like it
Because stubs make better feet
I think you'll agree
When god comes looking for your toes
This is how you achieve
This is how you achieve
This is how you achieve
