The Clock Lyrics
Time is running out for us
But you just move the hands upon the clock
You throw coins in a wishing well, wake up
You just move your hands upon the clock

It comes to you begging you to stop, wake up
But you just move your hands upon the clock
Throw coins in the wishing well for us
You make believe that you are still in charge1Embed
