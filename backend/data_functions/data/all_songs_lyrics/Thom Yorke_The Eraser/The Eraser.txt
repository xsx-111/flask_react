The Eraser Lyrics
Please excuse me but I got to ask
Are you only being nice because you want something?
My fairy tale arrow pierces
Be careful how you respond, 'cause you might end up in this song
I never gave you an encouragement
And it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

The more you try to erase me
The more, the more, the more that I appear
Oh, the more, the more
The more you try the eraser
The more, the more, the more that you appear

You know all the answers so why do you ask?
I am only being nice because I want someone, something
You're like a kitten with a ball of wool
And it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

The more you try to erase me
The more, the more, the more that I appear
Oh, the more, the more
The more I try to erase you
The more, the more, the more that you appear
No, you're wrong, you are wrong
You are wrong, you are wrong
You are wrong, you are wrong
You're wrong5Embed
