Analyse Lyrics
A self-fulfilling prophecy
Of endless possibility
In rolling reams across a screen
In algebra, in algebra
The fences that you cannot climb
The sentences that do not rhyme
In all that you can ever change
The one you're looking for

It gets you down, it gets you down
There's no spark, no light in the dark
It gets you down, it gets you down
You traveled far, what have you found?
That there's no time, there's no time
To analyse, to think things through
To make sense

Like candles in the city
They never looked so pretty
By power cuts and blackouts
Sleeping like babies

It gets you down, it gets you down
You're just playing a part, you're just playing a part
You're playing a part, playing a part
And there's no time, there's no time
To analyse, analyse
Analyse, analyse5Embed
