Atoms for Peace Lyrics
No more going to the dark side
With your flying saucer eyes
No more falling down a wormhole
That I have to pull you out
The wriggling, squiggling worm inside
Devours from the inside out
No more talk about the old days
It's time for something great

Want you to get out and make it work
So many allies, so many allies
So many allies, so many allies
So feel the love come off of them
And take me in your arms

Peel all of your layers off
I want to eat your artichoke heart
No more leaky holes in your brain
And no false starts

I want to get out and make it work
So many allies, so many allies
So many allies, so many allies
So feel the love come off of them
And take me in your arms
I want to get out and make it work
Want you to get out and make it work
I'll be ok8Embed
