Wichita Skyline Lyrics
Down at the train they go to Independence every day
But anywhere else now seems like a million miles away
And I must have been high to believe
That I would ever leave
Now I'm just a flat fine line
Like the Wichita Skyline

I rode on the airstream across the great lonesome afternoon
I wished hard enough to hurt, drove fast enough to catch the moon
But I must have been dreamin' again
'Cause there's nothing around the bend
Except for that flat fine line
The Wichita Skyline

As far as Salina I can get that good station from LaRue
I'm searching the dial while I'm scanning the sky for a patch of blue
And I watch that black clouds roll in
Chasing me back again
Back to the flat fine line
The Wichita Skyline
The Wichita Skyline
The Wichita SkylineEmbed
