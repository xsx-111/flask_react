84,000 Different Delusions Lyrics
Good love, bad love
Good love, yeah
My time your time
My time, yeah

84,000 different delusions
Take a ride in the car
84,000 different delusions

Good love, bad love
Good love, yeah
Our world, their world
Our world, yeah

84,000 different delusions
Meet me down at the bar
84,000 different delusions

Go look at the lake, please
Go look at the sky
Go look at a baby
We're all gonna die
84,000 different delusions
We don't know who we are
84,000 different delusions
We don't get very far
84,000 different delusions
Everyone is a star
84,000 different delusionsEmbed
