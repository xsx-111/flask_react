The Facts About Jimmy Lyrics
Jimmy is married and he lives down south
His wife lives somewhere colder
He sees another woman in a badlands town
And she cries upon his shoulder

Jimmy thinks that he's a helpless man
He thinks about love in a vacuum
And he won't remember that talk you had
When you were walking into the bedroom

He'll say I don't know why we met
The simple truth is always the best
C'est la vie, what's done is done
And there's somebody for everyone

Jimmy has debts and Jimmy has ties
That he can't get out from under
If you look far enough into his eyes
It'll rock you just like thunder

Jimmy broke locks and Jimmy broke bolts
Just to get himself out from under
When you feel like you're lying in a prison cell
It'll kind of make you wonder
He'll say it's destiny we met
The simple truth is always the best
Don't you see what's done is done
And there's somebody for everyone

I used to get drunk to get my spark
And it used to work just fine
And it made me wretched but it gave me heart
I miss Jimmy like I miss my wine

Oh, Jimmy as if you didn't know by now
Let me tell you a thing or two
Everybody might have someone
But everyone falls in love with you
Everyone falls in love with you
Everyone falls in love with you

He'll say you get just what you get
The simple truth is always the best
Don't you see what's done is done?
And there's somebody for everyone
Everyone
Falls in love
With you
