Nothin on Me Lyrics
Well I don't tell jokes
And I don't take notes
You been sayin' there ain't much hope
You got nothin' on me

I got friends uptown
And they don't talk down
They've been keepin' me safe and sound
We got somethin' to be

So in case you hadn't noticed
I'm all right
Not like it was before
Things used to be so hopeless
But not tonight
Tonight I'm walkin out that door

I'm not gonna cry
When wavin' goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin on me
Well it ain't that tough
To score the usual stuff
One heartache is more than enough
There ain't nothing to see, nothing

I got friends uptown
And they still come 'round
They've been keepin me safe and sound
We got somethin' to be

So don't you try to save me
With your advice
Or turn me into somebody else
'Cause I'm not crazy
And you're not nice
Baby keep it, keep it to yourself

I'm not gonna cry
And I'm wavin goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me
(No nothin' on me)
I'm not gonna cry
And I'm wavin' goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me

I'm not gonna cry
And I'm wavin goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me
