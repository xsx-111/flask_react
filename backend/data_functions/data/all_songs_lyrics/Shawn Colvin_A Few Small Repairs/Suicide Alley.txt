Suicide Alley Lyrics
Wait for me by the banshee tree
Let me be your wailing companion
Pass 'em on by, don't look 'em in the eye
Suicide Alley is callin'

You thought you were dreaming
You could wake up dead
And you'll never know what's real
All this damage is runnin' loose in your head
And it really matters to me

Oh, no, baby don't go
Walkin' down Suicide Alley
Oh, no, baby don't go
Walkin' down Suicide Alley

Downtown baby it's a million to one
You might as well name your poison
And stand in line by the exit sign
Suicide Alley is waiting

You're a loose cannonball on a sinking ship
From the belly of the beast, shot from the hip
But you don't have to be going down the dark hall
You're not tied to the chair, you're not nailed to the wall
Oh, no, baby don't go
Walkin' down Suicide Alley
Oh, no, baby don't go
Walkin' down Suicide Alley

Sitting naked by the window in the middle of the night
I can see you wearing your halo
If only in the daybreak of the dirty street light
I know baby wasn't born to follow

You know I wasn't born I was spat out at a wall
And nobody even knew my name
The sun hatched me out, cradle and all
On the corner of First and Insane

For the souls of the departed and the renegades of love
You and me we gotta be all we dreamed of
In the ruins of mischief through the ravages of time
You got a place in this world of mine

Oh, no, baby don't go
Walkin' down Suicide Alley
Oh, no, baby don't go
Walkin' down Suicide Alley
Down Suicide AlleyEmbed
