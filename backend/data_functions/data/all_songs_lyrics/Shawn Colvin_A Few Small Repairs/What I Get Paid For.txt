What I Get Paid For LyricsOkay I get it
It just took me a minute
But you said it all at the get-go
And I guess I've improved
'Cause my usual move would be to prove it right
Down on the floor
With my heart on my sleeve, I'll get even no doubt
That's what I get paid for
Start at the beginning, keep grinning and shout
That's what I get paid for
Getting up dizzy, it's okay to give up
Why kid yourself, you were gunning for glory
All attitude and honesty
But when you wind down to zero, there's things you won't face
And the buzzards start screaming
With your heart on your sleeve, you'll get even no doubt
That's what you get paid for
Start at the beginning, keep grinning and shout
That's what you get paid for
Just getting up dizzy, it's okay to give up
That's what you get paid for
You're losing your head
With my heart on my sleeve, I'll get even no doubt
That's what I get paid for
Start at the beginning, keep grinning and shout
That's what I get paid for
Getting up dizzy, it's okay to give up
That's what I get paid for
I'm losing my headEmbed
