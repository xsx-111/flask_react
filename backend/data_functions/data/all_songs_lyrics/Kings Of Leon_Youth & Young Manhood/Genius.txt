Genius Lyrics
Everybody wants to be a showman, yeah, they always got another one
Everybody thinks they got a genius, everybody got me on the run
Sometimes I think they come here just so you can say that you can
And I can't get alone in my bathroom, I need to give myself a hand
Y'all cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin', creepin' underneath my skin
Fuck you and your flashbulbs, snappin' my picture again
You drank all my whiskey, you stole all my smoke
And you're crowded all around me like I got nowhere to go

Eyes are gonna roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-goin' to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king runnin' near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, no

You keep sticking to me like a prickly porcupine
You're getting your information from the grocery checkout line
Are you through confessing of your little girl obsession
Because I was only messing and I had a little time

Eyes are goin' to roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-going to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king runnin' near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, no

Eyes are gonna roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-goin' to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king running near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, no
Eyes are gonna roll back, I'm here to kill
Time for you to go, I'm-a-goin' to spill
It isn't you fast train
I'll be the king runnin' near the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here, noEmbed
