Trani Lyrics
Dirty belly of a secret town
Cheap trick hookers are hanging out
At the bar near the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down
On everything that their momma believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
Help you feel not so strange

Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
She's all tied to a chair"
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten

All the bubbas got their heads in a nod
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are that that worm in his lap
Doesn't even know which fish that he'd like to bite tonight
Oh, tonight, tonight, tonight, oh maybe tonight

Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
She's all tied to a chair"
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Cops are on the call
Weeding out the freaks
Fingers in the dirt
He's spitting out his teeth
Spitting out his teeth


Comes home on call, isn't that the peace
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth

Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
As she's all tied to a chair"
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the ground, blowing white noise sound
Like a trani on ten
Oscillating on the
Oscillating on
Oscillating on
Oscillating on1Embed
