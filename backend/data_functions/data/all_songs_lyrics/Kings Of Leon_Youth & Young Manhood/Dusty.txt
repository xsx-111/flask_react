Dusty Lyrics
Dusty in your eyes, dirty from change
Lips of your kisses are sticking like tape
Woke you at sunrise, cold as a grave
I cut you some flowers, now don't be afraid
Now don't be afraid

I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

Home by the river, tall grassy fields
Under a Willow oak, well for to kneel
Dusty O Dusty, decision night
You'll be so pretty, all laced up in white
All laced up in white

I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine
I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

I'm lookin' for somethin'
To sink in my teeth without any cryin'
But I can't find no place or nothin'
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap and love's divineEmbed
