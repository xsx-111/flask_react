California Waiting Lyrics
Little Mona Lisa layin' by my side
"Crimson and Clover" pullin' overtime
I feel too close to be losin' touch
By giving in, what am I givin' up
Am I losing way too much?

But, hey! California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say! While you're tryin' to save me
Can I get back my lonely life?

I'm goin' so fast and I can't slow down
It's hard to get up when you're spinnin' 'round an' 'round
I'd give you the news but nothing's changed
I'd sing you a song but they blew it away
All wrapped up in this stupid ass game

But, hey! California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say! While you're tryin' to save me
Can I get back my lonely life?

Ah, hey, California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say, while you're tryna save me
Can I get back my lonely life?
But, hey! California Waitin'
Every little thing has gotta be just right
But say! While you're tryin' to save me
Can I get back my lonely life?

Can I get back my lonely life?
Can I get back, can I get back?
Can I get back my lonely life?
Can I get back, can I get back?
Can I get back my lonely life?
Can I get back, can I get back?
Can I get back my lonely life?Embed
