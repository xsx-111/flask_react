Wasted Time Lyrics
It's your life
Don't you let them tell you when to bat your eyes
You're the only one who's going to sacrifice
Makes no difference if you're right or wrong
Take that ride
But I want your little sister by your side
Maybe little later we can all collide
Do our living like a rolling stone

Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted

An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be

Show your face
Living in the shadows like you got no name
'Nough to make a little girly go insane
Be my guest to let it out tonight
It's ok
I know all about the little games you play
Shaking your apple right in my face
Only when you know that I'ma begging for a bite
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted

An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be


Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me isâ€“

I'm gonna get your mama, I'm gonna get your pa
I'm gonna tell everybody, just a what I saw
So won't you show your face (Show your face)
Your little apple shake (Show your face)
I know the love you gave (Show your face)
I know the love you take (Show your face)
An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
An innocent smile
Ah, runnin' free
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be
Baby's goin' give it like it used to be1Embed
