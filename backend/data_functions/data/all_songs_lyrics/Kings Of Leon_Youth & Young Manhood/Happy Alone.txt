Happy Alone Lyrics
On our way, so it seems
Bloomin' flowers waltz before me
Rollin' numbers, passin' time
Got to get outside the city
In the morning, all will see
Just how crazy young love can be
On our own, away again
Don't get down, my darling

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, I'm gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window, I'm on your street

Miles away, so unclear
Almost lost it in Montana
Let's pull over, have us choke
I love to watch you when you're dancing
I wonder if they ever dreamed
They would get just what we gave them
All wrapped up in being nineteen
Chasing stars that are falling
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window 'cause that's where I'll be

C'mon, Caleb!
Ow!


And when that train heads home
They're gonna be so gone, gone
You ain't never gonna see me no more
Gone, gone, you ain't nothin' to me
And when they shine them streets
They'll only find our song

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, I goin' tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window 'cause that's where I'll be
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, goin' tickle your daughter
Three o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window 'cause that's where I'll be
C'mon, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb!

I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on yourâ€”
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to meEmbed
