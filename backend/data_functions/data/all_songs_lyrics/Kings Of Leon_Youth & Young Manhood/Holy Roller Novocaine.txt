Holy Roller Novocaine Lyrics
My darlin', you look lovely
I come to lay you down
Uncover your head and submit to me
We'll make a joyful sound
I don't care if you're by yourself
Or you're all alone when you need my help
Keep that smile on your pretty face
Because you don't have much I can't take away

Don't you worry, baby, you won't feel a thing
Close your eyes, Holy Roller Novocaine

Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back

You'll be hearin' me comin'
But I can't come inside
I'll be out back in my white Cadillac
Won't you join me for a ride
We'll go up to the mountain top
Where I'll show all the goods I got
Don't look back, keep your eyes ahead
This could be the night that the moon goes red
Don't you worry baby, you won't feel a thing
Close your eyes, Holy Roller Novocaine

Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back

All the world is moanin'
And baby, so am I
I'm just giving you warnin'
And I ain't tellin' you why

Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
Lord's goin' get us back, Lord's goin' get us back
I know, I know1Embed
