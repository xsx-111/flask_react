Spiral Staircase Lyrics
Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!

Greasy haircuts, a German-Chinese girl
Going to keep y'all busy, tugging at my curl
You better get your ass together, you better walk, walk, walk
By walking we cannot run
They all came to party and there's four to every stall
Gets frustrating just pissing on this wall
Seems like there's another story banging
Around every step you fake

Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!

They all came to party and there's four to every stall
Gets frustrating just pissing on this wall
Seems like there's another story banging
Around every step you fake

Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!
Spiral staircase going down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees, we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase! Spiral staircase!

No babe, hey babe
Babe don't leave
 it, I want it
Don't you fuck my headEmbed
