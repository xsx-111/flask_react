Red Morning Light Lyrics
You know you coulda been a wonder
Takin' your circus to the sky
You couldn't take it on the tightrope
No, you had to take it on the side
You always like it undercover
Tucked in between your dirty sheets
But no one's even done nuttin' to ya
In between the hollers and the screams

And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light

You got your cozy little corner
All night you're jammin' on your feet
Hangin' out just like a street sign
And put a twenty dollar trick
I hear you're blowin' like a feather
And then they rub it in your face
Oh, once they've had all their fun hun
You're at the bottom of the cage

And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right
Ah!

Hey hey, another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
Uh hey, keep on givin' away and givin' it away (Givin' it away)
But, hey hey, you're givin' all your cinnamon away
Hey hey, you're givin' all your cinnamon away

Ah, hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right, aow! Come on
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away2Embed
