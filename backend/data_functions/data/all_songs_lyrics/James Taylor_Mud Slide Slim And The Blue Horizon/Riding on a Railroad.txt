Riding on a Railroad LyricsWe are ridin' on a railroad
Singin' someone else's song
Forever standin' by that crossroad
Take a side and step along
We are sailin' away on a river to the sea
Maybe you and me can meet again
We are ridin' on a railroad
Singin' someone else's song, sing along
Time to time, I tire of the life that I've been leadin'
Town to town, day by day
There's a man up here
He claims to have his hands upon the reins
There are chains upon his hands and he's ridin' upon a train
Oh Lord, we been ridin' on a railroad
Singin' someone else's song
Forever standin' by that crossroad
Take a side and step along
We are sailin' away on a river to the sea
Maybe you and me can meet again now
We been ridin', we been a-ridin' upon a railroad
Singin' someone else's song1Embed
