Highway Song LyricsFather, let us build a boat and sail away
There's nothing for you here
And brother, let us throw our lot out upon the sea
It's been done before
I'm thinking about a broken heart
I'm talking 'bout the break of dawn
You love me while I'm here
And you can miss me when I'm gone
Sweet misunderstanding
Won't you leave a poor boy alone
I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed
In the belly of a rolling stone
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
I had a little woman in Memphis
She wanted to be my bride
She said: ''Settle on down, traveling man
You can stay right by my side''
I tried so hard to please her
But I couldn't hold out too long
'Cause one Saturday night I was laying in bed
And I heard that highway song
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
Now one of these days that highway song
Will lose its appeal to me
I'm going to settle on down
Like a natural born man
I'm going to live my life naturally (free and easy, mmm)
Until that day the thunder's going to roll
And I notice there's a sign of rain
So I grab my bags and I pack my clothes
And I'm back on the road again
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
I'm thinking about a broken heart
I'm talking 'bout the break of dawn
You love me while I'm here
And you can miss me when I'm gone
And I said ''Sweet misunderstanding
Won't you leave a poor boy alone''
I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed
In the belly of a rolling stone
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
Here I am again, Holiday Inn
Same old four walls again
Gee, but it's fine to be back home again, whoa, now
Said, Holiday Inn, I'm on the road again1Embed
