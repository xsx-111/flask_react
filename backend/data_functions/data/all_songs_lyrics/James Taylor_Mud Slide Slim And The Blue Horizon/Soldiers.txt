Soldiers LyricsIt was just after sunrise and down by the sea
Down on the sand flats where nothing will grow
Come drumming and footsteps like out of a dream
Where the golden green waters come in
Just nine lucky soldiers had come through the night
Half of them wounded and barely alive
Just nine out of twenty was headed for home
With eleven sad stories to tell
I remember quite clearly when I got out of bed
I said, oh, good morning what a beautiful dayEmbed
