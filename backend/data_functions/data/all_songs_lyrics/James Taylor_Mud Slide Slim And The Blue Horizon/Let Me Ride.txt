Let Me Ride LyricsHand me down my golden crown and let me ride
Don't deny the highway in my soul
Jump and sing that silver thing that I feel inside yeah
Hallelujah, let that big wheel roll
It's time to give me just a little bit of old time glory
I'm talking about the coming of the sunshine story
Set this poor soul free, let it be whoa yeah
Break these bonds that hold my soul and I'm on my way
I can't help feeling there's no time to lose
I done made my mind up yesterday that I just can't stay
So hand me down my highway shoes
It's time to give me just a little bit of old time glory
Talking about the coming of the sunshine story
Set this poor soul free, let it be1Embed
