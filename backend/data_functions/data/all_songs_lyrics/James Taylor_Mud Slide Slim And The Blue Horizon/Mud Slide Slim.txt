Mud Slide Slim Lyrics
Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon
Whoa, Mud Slide, I'm depending on you
I don't know but I've been told
There's a time from time to time
I can't eat, I can't sleep
But I just might move my feet
Because there's nothing like the sound of sweet soul music
To change a young lady's mind
And there's nothing like a walk on down by the bayou
To leave the world behind, whoa
Mud Slide I'm depending upon you
Mister Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon
I've been letting the time go by
Letting the time go by
Yes, I'm letting the time go by
Letting the time go by
I'm going to cash in my hand
And pick upon a piece of land
And build myself a cabin back in the woods
Lord, it's there I'm going to stay
Until there comes a day
When this old world starts to changing for the good
Now the reason I'm smiling
Is over on an island
On a hillside in the woods where I belong
I want to thank Jimmy, Jimmy, John, Nick and Laurie
The No Jets Construction
For setting me down a homestead on the farm, whoa, ooooo
Mud Slide, I'm depending upon you
Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon
Night goes on and on, don't want to come at all
Baby, baby, baby, I know on a Haiti day
Stoney Lee Blue Borne picking on a fretless bass, yeah, yeah
Oil Slick slipping and a sliding and a slapping on
Kootcheroo! Ha ha ha, ha ha haEmbed
