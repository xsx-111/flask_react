Long Ago and Far Away LyricsLong ago, a young man sits
And plays his waitin' game
But things are not the same
It seems as in such tender dreams
Slowly passing sailing ships
And Sunday afternoon
Like people on the moon I see
Are things not meant to be
Where do those golden rainbows end?
Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love
To love is just a word I've heard
When things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me
Cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been
And what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas
And bits of broken glass
Where do your golden rainbows end?
Why is this song I sing so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love
To love to love to love
Oh no no no1Embed
