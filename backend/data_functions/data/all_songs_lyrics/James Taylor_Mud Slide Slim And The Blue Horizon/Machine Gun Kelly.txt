Machine Gun Kelly Lyrics
I'll tell you about Machine Gun Kelly
He rode along the outlaw trail
Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man
But the woman was as hard as hell

Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her run you round
Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, Machine Gun

I'll tell you about Katherine Kelly
Tired of being such small time, now
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son
Make it in the world of crime


You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly
Careful of what you do, now
If you keep listening to your old lady
Isn't no telling what'll happen to you, now
Machine Gun

The government boys they came for Machine Gun
Took the poor boy away
They stuck him in a hole in a Leavenworth prison
Where he lived until his dying day
Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her put you down
Don't let the woman make you out to be a clown, Machine Gun
Watch out, Machine GunEmbed
