Love Has Brought Me Around LyricsDon't come to me with your sorrows anymore
I don't need to know how bad you're feeling today
I declare I've had my share and I've heard it all before
It's time for me to be stealing away
Let those rain clouds roll out on the sea
Let the sun shine down on me, hey, hey
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yes, it has
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around
When my sky was full of gray and my day was full of blue
There was nothing I could do to see myself through
Now my head is full of springtime and my heart is full of you
Goodbye lonely blue, it shall all come true
Miss November, I detect a frown
Close your eyes and turn it upside down, whoa, oh
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yes, don't you know
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yeah
Now I know you know what I've got to say
Is an old cliche anyway, so they say
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, oh whoa
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yes it hasEmbed
