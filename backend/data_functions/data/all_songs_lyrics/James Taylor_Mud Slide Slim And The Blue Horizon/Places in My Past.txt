Places in My Past LyricsThere are ladies in my life, lovely ladies in these lazy days
And though I never took a wife may I say that I have loved me one or two
Of the people in my past, fading faces in a waking dream
And though they never seemed to last very long
There are faces I remember from the places in my past
I said all the dead head miles and the insincere smiles
Sometimes I can laugh and cry and I can't remember why
But I still love those good times gone by, hold on to them close or let them go, oh no
I don't know, I just seem to sing these songs
And say I'm sorry for the friends I used to knowEmbed
