Street Boy LyricsStreet boy
You've been out too long
Street boy
Ain't you got enough sense to go home
Street boy
You're gonna end up alone
You need some love and understanding
Not that dead-end life you're planning
Street boy
You go home, but you can't stay
Because something's always pulling you away
Your fast hellos and quick goodbyes
You're just a street boy
With the streetlights in your eyes
You better get yourself together
Look for something better
Street boy
You've been out too long
Street boy
Ain't you got enough sense to go home
Street boy
You're gonna end up alone
You need some love and understanding
Not that dead-end life you're planning
Street boy
Your sister says that every week
You just come home to eat and go to sleep
And you make plans you never keep
Because your mind is always in the streets
You better get yourself together
Look for something better
Street boy
You've been out too long
Street boy
Ain't you got enough sense to go home
Street boy
You're gonna end up alone
You need some love and understanding
Not that dead-end life you're planning
Street boy
There's one last word, then I'll conclude
Before you pick up and put on your attitude
Bet you'll never find or ever meet
Any street boy who's ever beat the streets
Street boy
Street boy
Street boy
Street boy
Street boy
Street boy
Sweet boyEmbed
