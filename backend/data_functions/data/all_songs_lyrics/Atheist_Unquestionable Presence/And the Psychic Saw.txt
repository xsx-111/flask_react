And the Psychic Saw Lyrics
And so the psychic saw
Meaningful ends and the thrill of it all
To be an equal of infinity divine
Searching the cosmos for erected confines

Bursting within the motherland
The excess soon will exceed demand
That I see

Man's existence is to form resistance
The timeless reluctance
The all forgotten purpose
Your spectacle of actions
Is the tell tale of my visions

Oh, now I see it clear
You wish to be relieved of all fear
Don't worry yourself
Prepare your senses
Until the knowledge commences
And so the psychic saw!
Visions!
The land and sea, beauty!
And so the psychic saw meaningful ends
Become the meaning of it all
To set the stage
For the fears that will be
To pull the curtain
For the whole world to seeEmbed
