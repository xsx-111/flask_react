Enthralled in Essence LyricsI've scaled over the walls of morality
Not quite sure what I'd find
There on the other side
Waiting in a common stance
Relieve me of my duty
As keeper of this body
Just leave me with my mind
And I assure you
I will be just fine
Tears stream from the cheek
Or a man whose body his mind does not seek
A very gruelling rendition
Of a human soul's indecision
The qualities of a finer being
Locked well within this shell
Crying out to be released
To a body that serves as well
Malformed at birth
You see what it's worth
In a mirror I ask why
Such a shame, wanting to die
In a past lifetime
I feel I've had mine
Shared with no one
Excuse me, I must go now!
Unhappy as he exits
Unhappy as he came
Enthralled in the essence
The essence of life to beEmbed
