Mother Man LyricsYou say there's freedom
Within our nature
Well I don't think you understand
Mother Earth has fallen to Mother Man
The Air, the Sea, the Grass, the Trees
The nemesis is the major
Fearless leader Mother Man
Come on take a look
At what's become
Of the existence that leads
Or so we think
That's always a popular phrase
It suits the laws written
By dear Mother Man
Those heavy hands
What man creates man will surely destroy
The rule of thumb
In the mouths of little boys
Earth spins delight
We kill everything in sight
To serve the needs
And all purple skies will bleed
And a bird flies weak
Against polluted skies
Before it dies
And nature becomes illegal
According to rules
Made by fools
Sift through the information
Everlasting hesitation
To reveal all knowing vices
All the compromising prices
Untouched by the law binders
Setting standards to remind us
That the ink has dried
Behind the goal
We wish to achieve is goneEmbed
