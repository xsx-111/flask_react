Unquestionable Presence LyricsThe fog rolls in thin here tonight
And all that is warm
Grows ice cold
All that are strong
Fill with fright
My ship has returned here tonight
Get away
Don't you touch my precious ship
Be thankful that you witnessed it at all
'Cause you can never understand
My life in space
Our visits here
Have gone untraced for years
So easy to create
A shell like you
I must leave now and return
Our presence is unquestionable
We cannot be seen for this long
Now look at what you've done
Created such a stir
If only you had kept yourself
You might have known for sure
Proof of life in outer space
Our mission is completed
Our voyage is ahead
Our data is collected
To mankind it's fed
And deeper and deeper we fall
'Cause you can never understand
My life in space
Our visits here
Have gone untraced for years
So easy to create
A shell like you
I must leave now and returnEmbed
