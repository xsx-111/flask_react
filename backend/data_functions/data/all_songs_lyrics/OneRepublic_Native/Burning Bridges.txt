Burning Bridges Lyrics
You and I were meant to be
Ain't no doubt about it
No way to hide that sort of thing
Now I’m waiting for something better
Ain’t nothing better worth imagining

I, I keep on running
I’m building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now I’ll never sing the road that I could take

Listen, I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down
I said I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down, down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on fire
You can burn my bridges down

Send this out to sea
You send it where you wanted
You can take your no for no or not at all
There’s no filling up your spaces with fictionary places
Imaginary faces they don’t work at all
I, I keep on running
I’m building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now I’ll never sing the road that I could take

Listen, I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down
I said I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down, down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on fire
Yeah you burn my bridges down

I want you to burn my bridges down, down
I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on fire, set me on fire
Set me on fire
I want you to burn my bridges down (down)
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down, down, down
Set me on fire, set me on fire22Embed
