What You Wanted Lyrics
I'll find the places where you hide
I'll be the dawn on your worst night
The only thing left in your life
I would kill for you, that's right

If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted (what you wanted)

I'll put your poison in my veins
They say the best love is insane
I'll light your fire 'til my last day
I'll let your fields burn around me, around me

If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted (what you wanted)

I'll run out of this town, my love is true
Tell me, tell me something I wouldn't do
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted

If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted15Embed
