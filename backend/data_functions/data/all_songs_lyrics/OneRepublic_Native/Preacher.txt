Preacher Lyrics
When I was a kid I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly, and I would teach you for a fee
Broke every window in my hotel heart
When I was only five years old but twelve years scarred
And I'd hear the same voice echo in my mind
It'd say, "Son, you've got an angel."
That'd chase the devil at night

When I was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God, he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those who learn to help themselves"
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

I took a little faith, and put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town full of "have" and "have nones"
And as I walked through that story-book life
I've been looking for an angel who'd chase the devil at night

When I was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
He’d talk about love, he was something like a teacher
He said, “God only helps those who learn to help themselves”
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth
Wave, put your hands up and hands down
Wave, put your hands up and hands down
Wave, put your hands up and hands down

When I was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
He’d talk about life, he was something like a teacher
He said, “God only helps those who learn to help themselves”
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth19Embed
