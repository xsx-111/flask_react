Light It Up Lyrics
Like a stone you watch it fall and let it roll out over the fields
You take your time and watch it crawl like you're the big shot symphony
But oh what would you say if I told you 'the pitch is wrong' with a smile?
I took a trip to wonderland, gonna get you nowhere by a mile

I, I could light it up for you
I, I could light it up for you
We, we ain't got a shot to lose
Put it on but fade it out, tell you what you wanna love
Acting like your favourite drug, raise a cup
We can light it up, we can light it up

I took a shot and missed the mark, well every single day I multiply
A million drums of kerosene, baby, like a hotel in the sky
I just want to see all the sparks you're trying to hide
Let's take a trip to wonderland, we can just tune this fire tonight

I, I could light it up for you
I, I could light it up for you
We, we ain't got a shot to lose
Put it on but fade it out, tell you what you wanna love
Acting like your favourite drug, raise a cup
We can light it up, we can light it up
