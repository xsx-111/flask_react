If I Lose Myself (Alesso vs OneRepublic) Lyrics
I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people
Places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight


I woke up with the sun
Thought of all of the people
Places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window tonight
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
I lose myself tonight
