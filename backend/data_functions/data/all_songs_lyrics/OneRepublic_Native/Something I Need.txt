Something I Need Lyrics
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
It woke me up right after two
I stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn’t lose my mind
And I had the week that came from hell
And yes, I know that you could tell
But you’re like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

And if you only die once
I wanna die with

You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You-hoo, you-hoo, you-hoohoohoo)
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You-hoo, you-hoo)
Last night I think I drank too much, he-ey
Yeah, call it our temporary crutch, he-ey
With broken words I tried to say
Honey don’t you be afraid
If we got nothing, we got us, yeah

And if you only die once
I wanna die with

You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You-hoo, you-hoo, you-hoohoohoo)
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You-hoo, you-hoo, you-hoohoohoo)

I know that we’re not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it to this time
This time now-ow-ow, ye-eh-eh-eah
You got something I need
Yeah, in this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once, I wanna die with you
Hey!

You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You-hoo, you-hoo, you-hoohoohoo)
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with you (You-hoo, you-hoo, you-hoohoohoo)
If we only die once (Hey)
I wanna die with–

If we only live once
I wanna live with you32Embed
