Life in Color Lyrics
I do my best to find some kind of glow
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now from the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
We see that fire from the streets of Babylon
To the road that we've been on
The kaleidoscope claims another

Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I couldn't run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color

You've seen my worst, yet you see some hope in me
The black and white sets us free, like the queen to the rook
Your decision is a sure thing
Honey yeah, a sure thing
No wonder I feel like I'm missing a heavy load
But no matter what daylight brings to us, we all know:
Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I couldn't run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
This is life in color

Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I couldn't run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
This is life in color6Embed
