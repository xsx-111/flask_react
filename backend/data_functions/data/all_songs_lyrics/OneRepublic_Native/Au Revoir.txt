Au Revoir Lyrics
Today I'm not myself
And you, you're someone else
And all these rules don't fit
And all that starts can quit
What a peculiar state we're in
What a peculiar state we're in

Let's play a game where all of the lives we lead can change
Let's play a game where nothing that we can see, the same

But we'll find other pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I could show you how many moves to checkmate, right now
We could take apart this life we're building and pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we're doing it right now, right now


But we'll find other pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I could show you how many moves to checkmate, right now
We could take apart this life we're building and pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we're doing it right now, right now10Embed
