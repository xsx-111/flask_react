Crown of Horns Lyrics"I do that rather well, don't you think?"
Capricornus Rex in tenebris
I long to feel the dark caress
Of your cloven hooves;
I seek the loving warmth of your anus
As I place my worshipful
Lips about your teats
We hate, and so we gather
By the light of the moon;
The art of veneficium...
This we learned from you...
To make them grieve in their lord
Their redeemer in flames
Fanned by the scorn of the children
Who now curse his name
Sire of sin
You embody me
Undivine...
To you we congregate;
None so vile
Your magnificent
Crown of horns
Inspires deeds maleficent
Destroy the parasite
Destroy the parasite
Destroy the parasite
Destroy Jesus Christ
They'll crawl in their perdition
The righteous will be lost
Where gutted angels lie fucked...
Beneath the funeral cross;
We'll dig them a mass grave soon
And bring to their knees
Those who would have rescinded
The laws of disease
"The children have turned"
The cherubs wail
As anticross triumphs
Where the cross has failed
Hell-spawned majesty, we eagerly
Await the advent of the
Next millennium
When you will return with a swarm from
Beyond to claim your carnal
Lost dominion1Embed
