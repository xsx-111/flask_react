Orgiastic Disembowelment LyricsYou have sinned
You will die...
You will be absorbed
No more god
Safe at last...
Embrace the abyss
The dark is warm
Comforting...
Welcome to the fold
Close your soul
Turn your heart
Learn...
Let us prey
On the weak
Feed the dark
With their flesh;
Orgiastic disembowelment
Wretched birth
Cursed by life
Now the way is shown
Happily
Suffering
Skyclad flagellants
Bask in the
Impure
Caresses of the scourge
Mortified...
There is no
Sacrifice too great
Let us prey
On the weak
Feed the dark
With their flesh;
Orgiastic disembowelment
"I am filth
Born of shit
And I am
Beloved of flies."
Abomination
In the eyes of all that is holy
We know who and what you are...
We've learned your name, we know your
Name
Resisilobus
Your only designs on the living
Are to oppress and possess;
To make them cry, to make them die
"As I arose
Heaven wept
For I am
Beloved of flies."
Moonlight bloodbath...
The gore runs as black
As their unclean hearts;
Goat cult rite
Gore-soaked virgin
In bleeding frenzy
Parts with her maker
Amidst weeping spirits
"Yeah, that's it... Go ahead and run! Run home and cry to mama!"Embed
