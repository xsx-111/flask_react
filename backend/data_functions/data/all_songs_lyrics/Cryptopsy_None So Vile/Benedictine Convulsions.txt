Benedictine Convulsions LyricsAn ominous disembowelment...
The soothsayer is blinded, such is fate;
Abomination to damn the eyes...
For the righteous, a test of faith
"We thank thee lord, for this tribulation
We sing thy praises without end;
No matter how rabid the oppressor
We shall not fail thee, though we pray for
Strength."
Ensnared in the web of the unjesus
The once-sacrosanct abbey is besieged
With the braying of the nightgoat
Benedictine friars convulse
Infernal visions flay their souls
As their bodies contort and writhe...
Capricornus nocturnum haunts them
From their torment springs its delight
Impaled on one of its many legs
A bug-eyed Mary gapes on in horror
As her only son is chewed to bits
By spiderchrist... She is flecked with gore
Caprine morturion leads the bones
Of their departed brethren
In the abbey's catacombs;
When gargoyles vomit blood
The defunct will ascend
To rend the mortal flesh
Of the brothers of the good word
And make victims of their guts
Those who are left
Of god bereft
Run amongst heads
Suspended by threads
Crosses up-ended
And frenzied bloodshed
For those who sought favour
From their saviour
"I am messiah"
The grand delusion
To hell-wracked things
