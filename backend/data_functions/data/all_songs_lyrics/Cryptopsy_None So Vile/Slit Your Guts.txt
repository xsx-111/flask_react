Slit Your Guts Lyrics
Pardon, please, the narrow
Confinement of your limbs;
Unfortunately, it's necessary
For your correction;
Shriek to your heart's
Content, if you wish;
I promise you pain and
Nightmares, in that sequence

Permit me to introduce you to
"Tuesday"...
I favor her, this pretty blade
So tall and fine;
Hatred and violence are not
Our ways, but firm we are;
Squirming is useless, so is this colon
Cry for me

Svelte is implement
Its gentle caress lets you bleed;
Its subtle curvature
Dancing, deeply slit your guts
It's for your own good;
You need guidance, I provide;
What is your pleasure? This is mine;
A welcome change!Embed
