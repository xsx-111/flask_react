Dead and Dripping LyricsMatriarchal piety disturbed at their
Vespers
Sisterly society feels the stifling whispers...
Anger of the dead-at-sea denied proper
Interment
Dumped overboard summarily, washed down
In a current
Sepulchral consideration...
Wrathful omen...
Dog removed from the casket
Dead and dripping
First stage of disintegration... Piecemeal
Decomposition
Of the indignant deceased, submerged for
What reason?
Parchedness of living throats and mouths
Has cracked some tongues
But attempts to slake their thirst (only)
Leads to soaking lungs
Hearts are heavy, minds are numb, souls
Oppressed...
Supernatural siege upon the landlocked
Dead
Baptism in netherfluids In their crypts
(but) Suffocating dryness in the catacombs
Mad at thirst, they dry
To draw sustenance
From a burial mound;
Necrophagous fails
Aridity ends lives
More wet corpses found
Watery warfare, and in its mist
The forsaken
Who cry for them, the bridges of
The flaccid god
Intone a funeral rosary...
Blessed morbid murmur
To hopefully placate the dead and
End the curse of moistureEmbed
