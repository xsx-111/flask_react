Lichmistress LyricsOur lady of seven sorrows
Mother of mourning, precious lich...
A white horse found your grave
Then it was beheaded
The funeral goat's semen
Annoints your resting place
Far below, the state you're in replenishes
My well of loss
As things from beyond watch as you rot
Beneath me
Wretchedly, I pine as I begin at once to claw
The earth
To free you from the worms, to free you
From damnation
The stake in your bosom pains me too...
Wistfully, I gaze into those empty holes
Which once were eyes
That beheld so much blood, that beheld so
Much evil...
Cyanotic lips caress the cold grey face of
One interred
Whose flesh is much too frail, whose flesh
Begins to quiver
Mistress of my flesh
Your servant longs for your kiss
To hold you once again
All pretty with blood...
Now shall all of heaven weepEmbed
