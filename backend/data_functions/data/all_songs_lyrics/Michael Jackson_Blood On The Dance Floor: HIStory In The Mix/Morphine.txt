Morphine Lyrics
He got flat, baby
Kick in the back, baby
A heart attack, baby
I need your body
A hot kiss, honey
He's just a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
So unrelyin'
I'm such a swine, baby
All down the line, daddy
I hate your kind, baby
So unreliable
A hot buzz, baby
He's one of us, baby
Another drug, baby
You so desirable

Trust in me
Trust in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine
Hoo!
They got place, baby
Kicked in the face, baby
You hate your race, baby
You're just a liar
Your every lick, baby
Your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
You soul survivor
She never cut from me
She never cut, baby
I had to work, baby
You just a rival
Always so please, daddy
Right up and leave, daddy
You're throwin' shame, daddy
So undesirable

Trust in me
Just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine
Go ‘on, babe
Relax
This won't hurt you
Before I put it in
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't cry
I won't convert you
There's no need to dismay
Close your eyes and drift away
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
He's tried
Hard to convince her
To be over what he had
Today he wants it twice as bad
Don't cry
I won't resent you
Yesterday you had his trust
Today he's taking twice as much
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
Hee-hee
Demerol
Demerol
Oh my, he's got his Demerol
Hee-hee
Ooh
Oh!
He got shit, baby
Your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
You are a liar
Is truth a game, daddy
To win the fame, baby
It's all the same, baby
You're so reliable

Trust in me
Just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine
Hoo!

You just sit around just talkin' nothin'
You're takin' morphine
Hoo!
Go ‘on, baby
You just sit around just talkin' about it
You're takin' morphine
Hoo-hoo!
Just sit around just talkin' nothin' about it
You're takin' morphine
You know what I mean?
You just sit around just talkin' about it
You're takin' morphine
Hoo-hoo!
You just sit around just talkin' nothing
And takin' morphine
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
I'm goin' down, baby Hoo!
You're talkin' morphine

Go ‘on, baby!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Morphine!
Do it!
Hoo!
He's takin' morphine
Morphine!
