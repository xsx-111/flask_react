Money (Fire Island Radio Edit) Lyrics
Die for it
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the Devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do it for the money
They don't care, they use it for the money
So you go to church, read the Holy Word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the 'Just few'
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but
If you show me the cash then I will take it
If you tell me to cry then I will fake it
If you give me your hand then I will shake it
You do anything for money

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Insurance, where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul, 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers 'cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything (Woo)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything (Hee)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
I don't think so
If you show me the man then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God then you will hell him

Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything (Hee)
Anything for money (Hoo)
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything now, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
You're dirty, you're dirty, you're dirty
You know that you're dirty, you're dirty
You know you love it, doggone, baby, anything
(Money makes the world go around)
Hoo
(Money makes the world go around)
Anything for money
Go tell it, go tell it, go, ah, go tell it to the devil

Ah, anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
I, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
I, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the DevilEmbed
