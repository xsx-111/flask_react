2 Bad (Refugee Camp Mix) Lyrics
No mercy!
This is officially a Refugee Camp Remix
Home with it

I'm right back where I wanna be
Told me that you're doing wrong
(Oh my, zippin' through)
Word out shocking all along (No!)
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nuthin for me
You are disgusting me
Yeah, yeah
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Look who just walked in the place (Refugee Camp)
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing, if you please (Wyclef)
Try to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?
You say John Forte
Like the major holiday
I met with MJ on the ranch of seven fey
Flowin' to them g six, that's how you saw them remix
Blast off a cramp while I laugh at yo re-six
T double O B A to the D
You just double A
Small town battery
Buffet
You can't eat of them floor we bend
Word like the power lunch of the four seasons
Too bad

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you hunting me
Yeah yeah
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad too bad
Look who got slapped in the face (Refugee Camp)
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standing though you're kicking me
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

You just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
You just too much for me
Eat it, eat it
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm right back where I wanna be2Embed
