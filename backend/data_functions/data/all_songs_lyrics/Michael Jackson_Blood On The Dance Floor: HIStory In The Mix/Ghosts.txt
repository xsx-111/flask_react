Ghosts Lyrics
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know This place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me

I don't understand it
Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughing and a yawning
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Hey!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling
Don't understand it!
(Gotta ghost gotta break in the walls)
Yeah yeah!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Youâ€™re just a dog gone!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Aaow!

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to scare my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy
Aaow!
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?18Embed
