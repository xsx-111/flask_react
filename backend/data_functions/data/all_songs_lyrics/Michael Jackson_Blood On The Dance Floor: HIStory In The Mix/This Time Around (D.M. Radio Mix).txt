This Time Around (D.M. Radio Mix) Lyrics
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ooh
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time, this time, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time, this time, this time, this time, this time, this time, this time around

This time around, I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out
Somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around, I'm taking no sh...
Though you really wanna get me
You really wanna get me

(He really thought he really had)
Had a hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
Control of me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really could control me
This time around, I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna get me
This time around I'm taking no sh...
Though you really wanna fix me
Somebody's out
Somebody's out to use me
They really want to use me
And they falsely accuse me
This time around, they'll take it like spit
'Cause you really can't control me
You know can't control me

(He really thought he really had)
Had a hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
A hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
Control of me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
A hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time, this time, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time, this time, this time around
This time, this time, this time around
This time around, yeah

(He really thought he really had)
Had a hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
A hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
Had a hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
A hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
Hoo
Ah, this time around, yeah
And use me, accuse me
Nobody will abuse me

(He really thought he really had)
Had a hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
A hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
They thought they really had control of me
(He really thought he really had)
Had a hold on me
(He really thought he really had)
Control of meEmbed
