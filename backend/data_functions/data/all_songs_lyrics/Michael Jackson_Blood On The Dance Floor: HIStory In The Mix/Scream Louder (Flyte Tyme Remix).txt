Scream Louder (Flyte Tyme Remix) Lyrics
Ow! Ow! Ow...
Aahh...
Hoo...
Aahh...
Hee...
Aahh...aahh...

Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Life is disgustin'
So what does it mean, damnit
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit

Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream

Tired of your tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (The story your way)
It's causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damnit

Keep changin' the rules
While you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane
With such confusion
Make me wanna scream
Now, baby
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
Schemin', baby
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh Father, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream

Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
(Stop your pressure)Embed
