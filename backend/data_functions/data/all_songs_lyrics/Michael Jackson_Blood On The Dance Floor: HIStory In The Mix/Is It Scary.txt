Is It Scary Lyrics
There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Oh, babe
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me, is it scary for you baby?
Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?
Masquerade the heart is
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me am I scary for you baby? (Hoo!)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is scary for you baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Am I scary for you? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't want to talk about it) (Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it) (Hoo!)

Is this scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby18Embed
