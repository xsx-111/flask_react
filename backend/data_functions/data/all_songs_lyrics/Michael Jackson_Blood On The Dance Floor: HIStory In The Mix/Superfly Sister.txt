Superfly Sister Lyrics
Hee-hee!
Show me
Hoo!
Oh, oh
Hee!

Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about (Oh)

He wanna do somethin' keen to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around ya, girl
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, doin' it right
He wanna jump back, half flap, doin' it right
He wanna lay you down, turn it up, shakin' it loose
He wanna fly high, nigh high, baby for you'se
He wanna motormouth, float around, baby the back
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, movin' 'round ha-ha

Love ain't what it used to be (Hee!)
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about (Oh)
Susie like to agitate
Get the boy and make him wait
Mother's preachin' Abraham
Brothers they don't give a damn (Oh)

He wanna do somethin' keen to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around ya, girl
He wanna glue it up, keep it high, deep in the night
He wanna eyeball, get hard, playin' it right
He wanna turn the key, hurt the sheets, move to the left
He wanna hot scrub, hot love, makin' it wet
He wanna give hot, jump shot, move to the left
He wanna time bar, slam dunk, ha-ha-ha

Hoo!
Keep it goin' (Hoo!)
Party down
Hoo! Hoo!

Love ain’t what it used to be (Aaow!)
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about (Oh)
Sister says she love him some (She's doin' it, she's doin' it) (Hee!)
Got his Jimmy on the run (Hoo-hee!)
Mother's preachin' Abraham (Hee!)
Brothers they don't give a damn (Oh)

(What? Ho!)

Johnny's beggin' pretty please (Keep the brother on his knees)
Keep the brother on his knees (Hoo-hee!)
Susie likes to agitate (Keep doin' it, keep doin' it) (Hee!)
Get the boy and make him wait (Oh)
Sister's marries to a hood (Hoo!) (Oh)
Saying that she got it good (Hoo!)
Holy Mary Mercy me (Hee!)
I can't believe the things I see
Thinkin' that they got it made (Hoo!)
They doin' what they used to hate
Push it in, stick it out (Keep doin' it, keep doin' it)
That ain't what it's all about (That ain’t what it's all about)
Holy Mary Mercy me (She's holy Mary, moly Mary)
I can't believe the things I see (Keep it goin' on now) (The things I see) (Hee-hee!)
Mother's preachin' Abraham (She's preachin' Abraham) (She's doin' it, she's doin' it)
Brothers they don't give a damn (Hoo! Hoo-hoooooo!) (Holy Mary moly Mary)
Sister says she loves him some (She's goin' down) (Hee!)
Got his Jimmy on the run (Got his Jimmy) (Hee-hee!)
Holy Mary Mercy me (She's holy Mary moly Mary)
I can't believe the things I see (Keep on goin') (Hee!) (Hee!)

You're doin' it
You're dirty
Keep doin' it
You're dirty
Keep nasty
You're nasty
You're doin' it
You're dirty
You're dirty
You're doin' it
You're nasty
You're doin' it

Holy Mary mercy me (Dah, hoo! Dah)
I can't believe the things I see (Dah, mmmmh, ah)
Push it in, stick it out (Stick it out)
That ain’t what it's all about9Embed
