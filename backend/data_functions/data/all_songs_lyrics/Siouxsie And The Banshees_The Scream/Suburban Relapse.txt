Suburban Relapse Lyrics
I'm sorry that I hit you but my string snapped
I'm sorry I disturbed your cat-nap
But whilst finishing a chore
I asked myself "what for"
Then something snapped
I had a relapse
A suburban relapse
A relapse
Relapse

I was washing up the dishes
Minding my own business
When my string snapped
I had a relapse
A suburban relapse
A relapse
Relapse

Should I throw things at the neighbours
Expose myself to strangers?
Kill myself or you?
Now memory gets hazy
I think I must be crazy
But my string snapped
I had a relapse
A suburban relapse
A relapse
Relapse
Now memory gets hazy
I think I must be crazy
But my string snapped
I had a relapse
A suburban relapse
A relapse
Relapse
A suburban relapse
A suburban relapse
A relapse
Relapse
Relapse
Relapse, relapse, relapse
Relapse
A relapse1Embed
