Overground Lyrics
Got to give up life in this netherworld
Going to go up to where the air is stale
And live a life of pleasantries
And mingle in the modern families

Overground from abnormality
Overboard for identity
Overground for normality
Overboard for identity

This limbo is no place
To be a digit in another space
In another crowd
I'm nameless bound

Overground from abnormality
Overboard for identity
Overground for normality
Overboard for identity

Overground, I'll be worse than me
Overground, it's clear to me
Overground, I'll be worse than me
Overground, it's clear to me
It's clear to me
Overground
Overground
I'll be worse than me
I'll be worse than me1Embed
