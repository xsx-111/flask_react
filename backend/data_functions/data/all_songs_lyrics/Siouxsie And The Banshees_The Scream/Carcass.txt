Carcass Lyrics
Someone's in cold storage seeking Heinz main-courses
Craving for a raw love
He'll hide you from the cleaver, he'll hang with you forever
Longing for a fresh meat
By hook or by crook you'll be first in his book
For an impaled affair
By hook or by crook you'll be last in his book
Of flesh, oh, so rare

Be a carcass, be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love, be limblessly in love
Be limblessly in love, limblessly in love
Be a carcass, be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love, be limblessly in love
Be limblessly in love, limblessly in love

Someone's left in cold storage thawed in Heinz main-courses
Carving for a new tin
He got you with the cleaver, he hung you up forever
Anticipating new skin
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Fiftyeighth variety
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Mother had her son for tea
Be a carcass, be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love, be limblessly in love
Be limblessly in love, limblessly in love
Be a carcass, be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love, be limblessly in love
Be limblessly in love, limblessly in love

In love with the pain
In love with the bleeding
In love with the pain that you now feel
'Cause you became a carcass, you became a carcass
Carcass, carcass
You became a carcass
Carcass, carcass
Carcass, carcass
Carcass, carcass
You became a carcass
In love with the stumps
In love with the bleeding
In love with the pain that you now feel
'Cause you became a carcass, you became a carcass
Carcass, get in your troubles but don't whine, you swine
Carcass, you became a carcassEmbed
