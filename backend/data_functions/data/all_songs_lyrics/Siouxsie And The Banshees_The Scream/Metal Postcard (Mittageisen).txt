Metal Postcard (Mittageisen) Lyrics

Reunion begins
With a glass of mercury
Television flickers
With another news bulletin
Flints light up the eyes
Of the seated family

Metal is tough, metal will sheen
Metal won't rust when oiled and cleaned
Metal is tough, metal will sheen
Metal will rule in my masterscheme

With a clockwork jerk
Pluck cogs from fob watches
For dinner on Friday
Then recoiling say excuse me
"Must go recycle
My precious machinery"

Metal is tough, metal will sheen
Metal won't rust when oiled and cleaned
Metal is tough, metal will sheen
Metal will rule in my masterscheme
It's ruling our lives
There is no hope
Thought I'd drop a line
The weather here is fine
But day and night it blares
Commanding through loudspeakers

Metal is tough, metal will sheen
Metal won't rust when oiled and cleaned
Metal is tough, metal will sheen
Metal will rule in my masterscheme
In my masterscheme
Metal is tough, metal is clean
Metal, metal, command, metal
Command, command, metal, metal
