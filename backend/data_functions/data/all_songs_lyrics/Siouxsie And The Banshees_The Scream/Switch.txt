Switch LyricsDifferent lives
In different places
Familiar problems
Same old faces
Shuffle lives
Into wrong categories
Cross the wires
And fuse humanities
Watch the muscles twitch for a brand new switch
Scientist G.P.'s
With patient guinea pigs
Curing their headaches
With drastic side-effects
With drastic side-effects
Doctor rectorates
Condescending from on high
For all hallucinators
See druggist in the sky
In the sky
Vicar experiments
But 'tis blasphemy
Dismissing thought of progress
As the mark of devilry
As the mark of devilry
Watch the muscles twitch for a brand new switch
People walk
And even talk
People listen
Then they halt
Something blows up
Won't come down
Scattered muscles twitch
Too late to switch
They're dying to switch
They're dying to switch
Switch
Switch
Watch the muscles twitch for a brand new switch
They're dying to switch
They're dying to switch
Switch
Watch the muscles twitch for a brand new switch
They're dying to switch
They're dying to switch
Switch
Switch
Switch
