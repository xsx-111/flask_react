Hong Kong Garden Lyrics
Harmful elements in the air
Cymbals crashing everywhere
Reaps the fields of rice and reeds
While the population feeds
Junk floats on polluted water
An old custom to sell your daughter
Would you like number twenty-three?
Leave your yens on the counter please

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hong Kong Garden
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hong Kong Garden
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Tourists swarm to see your face
Confucius has a puzzling grace
Disorientated you enter in
Unleashing scent of wild jasmine
Slanted eyes meet a new sunrise
A race of bodies small in size
Chicken Chow Mein and Chop Suey
Hong Kong Garden Takeaway
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hong Kong Garden
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh5Embed
