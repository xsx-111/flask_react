Make Up to Break Up Lyrics
Spots warts and blemishes
Deep receding crevices
Seem to disappear
With foundation on my face
Foundation on my face!
Shadow conjures cheekbones
Hides a nasal disgrace
A disfigured atrocity
J-j-jutting out of place
Jutting out of place

Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up, break up
Make up to break up

Girls with eyes like swimming pools
Are the ones that I despise
'Cause I need lots of color
To hide my bloodshot eyes
Hide my bloodshot eyes
Now to paint by number
Over the cavernous pit
Lots of glossy red
To hide my pale cracked lips
Hide my pale cracked lips

Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up, break up
Make up

Now comes the break up
From the make up
Just like the devil's rain
C-c-colors run insane
Colors run insane
Foundation starts to tremble
My nose a grotesque abstract
My mouth a gaping gap
My eyes are shooting blood
My face is cracking up
My face is cracking up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up to break up
Make up

My face is cracking up
My eyes are shooting blood
My mouth a gaping gap
My eyes are shooting blood
My face is cracking up
It's cracking up
My face is, my face is cracking up
My eyes are shooting blood
My face is cracking up
My eyes are shooting blood
My mouth a gaping gap
My eyes are shooting blood
My face is cracking up
It's cracking up
I thought of make up to break up
I thought of make up, I thought of break up
Because my face, my face is cracking up
My eyes are shooting blood
My mouth a gaping gap
My eyes are shooting blood
My face is cracking up
It's cracking up
Make up to break up
Make up, break up
Make up to break up
My eyes are shooting blood
My face, my face is cracking up
It's cracking up
My face is cracking up
My face is cracking up
My eyes are shooting blood
My eyes are shooting blood
My mouth a gaping gap
My eyes are shooting blood
My face is, my face is cracking upEmbed
