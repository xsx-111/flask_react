Helter Skelter Lyrics
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, I turn, and I go for a ride
When I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, I turn, go for a ride
When I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast and I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Well, you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

So look out
Helter skelter, na la la la la la la
Helter skelter, na la la la la la la
Helter skelter, na la la la la la la
Helter skelter, na la la la la la la

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, I turn, go for a ride
When I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me take you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no fucking dancer
So look out
Helter skelter, na la la la la la la
Helter skelter, na la la la la la la
Helter skelter, na la la la la la la
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
I'm coming down fast

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stopEmbed
