Steak and Black Onions Lyrics
Why don't you snuff it, then?
You plant-eating pussy
Why don't you snuff it, then?
Get out of my face
Why don't you snuff it, then?
Anyway

I don't know why you're trying to tell me what I want
Shut your mouth, just shut your mouth
I don't know why you wanna tell me what I'm eating, ah yeah
Shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
I know what I want and I don't like onions

Why don't you snuff it, then?
You plant-eating pussy1Embed
