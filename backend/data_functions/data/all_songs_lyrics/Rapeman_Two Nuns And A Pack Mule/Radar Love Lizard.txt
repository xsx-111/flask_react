Radar Love Lizard Lyrics
I'm a little lizard trapped in a man's skin

I'm always cold as shit
I'm always freezing
Got no fat on my ass
God, I wanna know why!

A rock
My ass
My heat
A rock
Get lost

Gonna get a little place
Gonna keep it real warm
Eat only raw meat
Never hear the Beastie Boys again

A rock
My ass
My heat
A rock
Get lost
This guy one time, he-he really hated me
Chased after me in the parking lot
Grabbed onto my arm
Popped right off into his hand, scared the shit outta me
No big deal, I grew another one

I'm always cold as shit
I'm shiny all over
I'm covered in weird skin
I make great cowboy boots

A rock
My ass
My heat
A rock
Get lost
My ass
My heat
A rock
Get lostEmbed
