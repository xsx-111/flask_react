Coition Ignition Mission LyricsSomebody
You'll never know since we started
They fucked the brakes when you're up in the air
Free of the world
When you're up in the air, that's good
Somebody
You'll never know since we started
You'll never know when you're up in the air
Free of the world
Go inside me, we enter black
You'll never know
Free of the world, you'll never knowEmbed
