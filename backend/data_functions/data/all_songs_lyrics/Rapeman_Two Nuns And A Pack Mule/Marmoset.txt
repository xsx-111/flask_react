Marmoset Lyrics
Red eye, red eye
Red eye, red eye
Red eye, red eye
Do the little runt

Gonna do it
I'm freezing
She's something
Everything
Get that
Look like a rat
Stop looking at me
Little marmoset

Red eye, red eye
Red eye, red eye
Red eye, red eye
Do the little runt

Gonna do it
I'm freezing
No one knows
Little marmoset
Little bastard
You look like a rat
Stop looking at me
Little marmoset

I'll do it
I'm freezing
She's something
No one knows
She'd do it
I'm freezing
No one knows
