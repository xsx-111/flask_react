Trouser Minnow Lyrics
I swear I didn't say anything
He just followed me in there
It was like, "What the?"
And he just took my shirt up
And we just, right, right there on the sink
I was so drunk, I was dizzy
And she was in the kitchen
While we were downstairs fucking, and she called me a bitch, and
I tried to tell her it was nothing

I've gotta stop drinking around men
They take advantage of me
I want all men to use me
For their only satisfaction

I'm really drunk
There's nobody over
Why don't you come by?
If you feel like it
You wanna stay up with me?
We can buy a pizza

I've gotta stop drinking around men
They just wanna bust a nut
I hate it when they're on top and
They all have little dicks
I think I'll get out of town
Where a girl can find some peace and
Maybe move to another country
Where men aren't all so sexist
Maybe if I hide in the closet
Maybe with a bottle of wine
I'll crack you on the noggin
We'll have a real wild time!
Remember what it used to be like when
When all we did was eat and fuck?
I let you shave my pussy
You let me paint your dick
You were always late for work
You said it didn't matter
Then after a while
I guess it, I guess it did start to matter

I've gotta stop drinking around men
They take advantage of me
And they all wanna use me
For their only satisfaction
I've gotta stop drinking around men
They just wanna bust a nut
I hate it when they use me
They have such little dicksEmbed
