Up Beat Lyrics
You're making me really mad if I didn't know better
I'd swear you were trying to get me
Take you apart put you back together wrong
Fucked up rusted, you're kinda fucked
Stay outta my hemisphere baby
You're gonna come up and take a look at this


All I wanna do is wreck your ass
Completely deflating my mood
As if I really needed a reason to stomp an obvious pussy like yourself
You're a waste of skin, I'm fixing to vomit
A freak and a slob like you
I bet you've got a lot of friends


Your timing really sucks
I was taking a bath
Now, I'm not dressed
I'll kick your ass
That's all right with me, I wanna shoot you anyway
Step up to the windowsill
Me and Wilma'll blow you away
If I had six inches and maybe fifty pounds
Maybe if I had Kung Fu training
You'd really have to watch your ass
I..I suppose, I suppose I'm not too threatening
Presently but...
Wait 'til I start NautilusEmbed
