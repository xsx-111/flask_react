Gonna Be More Suspicious (Peel session) LyricsFeeling low down and dirty
Just like a dog without a bone
Oh what happened to my lady
Better get her tail back home
CHORUS Gonna be suspicious, more suspicious from now on
Too much howling at Big Yeller
Too much growling at the door
Too much running round in circles
Won't be kicked around no more
CHORUS
Feeling low down and dirty
Getting me mad as hell
Getting down, getting angry
They're stealing water from my well
