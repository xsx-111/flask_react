Little Bit of Sympathy (Peel session) LyricsThe light is strong and the man is weak
And the world walks in between
So rise above on the wings of love
See and let yourself be seen
See and let yourself be seen
So fill your cup and drink it on up
For tomorrow never comes
If you wield the rod, answer to your God
But me I'll be up and gone
I'll be up and gone, gone
I'll be up and a gone
If the sea was glass and the land all gone
Would you still be a friend to me
When my time has passed, is it to much to ask
For a little bit of sympathy
Just a little bit of sympathy lord
A little bit of sympathy
A little bit of sympathy lord yeah
Little bit of sympathy
Little bit of sympathy
A little bit of sympathy
A little bit of sympathy
A little bit of sympathyEmbed
