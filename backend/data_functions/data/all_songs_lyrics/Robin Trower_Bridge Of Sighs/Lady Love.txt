Lady Love LyricsLady love, I heard a voice and it soothed me
Lady love, a simple tune and it moved me
Move me and sooth me
Leading me home
Truly for me now
Lady love
Lady love, a man's a fool to believe in
Dreams of love, passing by like the seasons
Maybe I'll wake up
Oh tell me I will
And find you there waiting
Lady love
Lady love, I need some warm and tender
Nights of love, sweet and fine to remember
Maybe tomorrow, your fever will find me
Waiting for me now
Lady love
I'll find you waiting, lady love
Find you there waiting, lady love
I'll find you waiting, lady love
Waiting, waiting lady loveEmbed
