Bridge of Sighs (Peel session) LyricsThe sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean
The sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean
Why so unforgiving, and why so cold
Been a long time crossing Bridge of Sighs
Cold wind blows
The Gods look down in anger
On this poor child
Cold wind blows
And Gods look down in anger
On this poor child
Why so unforgiving and why so cold
Been a long time crossing Bridge of SighsEmbed
