Too Rolling Stoned (Live) LyricsOh, a stitch in time
Just about saved me
From going through the same old moves
And this cat is nine
He still suffers
He's going through the same old grooves
But that stone just keeps on rolling
Bringing me some real bad news
Takers get the honey
Givers sing the blues
Too many cooks, yeah
Spoil such a good thing
I know I laughed out loud but that was then
Ain't it funny, a fool and his money
Always seemed to find was those real good friends
That stone just keeps on rolling
Bringing me some real bad news
The takers get the honey
Givers sing the blues
Well that stone keeps on rolling
Bringing me some real bad news
The takers get the honey
Givers sing the blues
A stitch in time
Helps to unfold me
Circus starts at eight so don't be late
Please be so kind not to wake me
I think I'll just sit this one out
Well, I'm too rolling stoned
I'm too rolling stoned, yeah
Like a rolling stone
Just, just, just like a rolling stone
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling stone
Yeah, too rolling stoned
Oh just like a rolling stone
Well, like a rolling stoneEmbed
