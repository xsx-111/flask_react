Day of the Eagle (Single version) LyricsI saw a light, just up ahead
But I couldn't seem to rise up from my bed
I'm not alone, and then I am
'Cause people seem to think I'm superman
But I watch for the love
I'm living in the day of the eagle
Eagle, not the dove
It's like a weight that brings me down
If I don't move, I'm on the ground
It's in my mind, it's in my soul
It's telling me the things I can't be told
It's a watch for the love
Living in the day of the eagle
Eagle, not the dove
Another day, another night
I want to love, they want to fight
I need the time, I got to be alone
I got to meet a lover on my own
But I watch for the love
Living in the day of the eagle
Eagle, not the doveEmbed
