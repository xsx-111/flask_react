About to Begin LyricsIf you stand in the light, you get the feel of the night
And the music that plays in your ears
In your head you can hear, a voice so sweet and clear
And the music that plays in your head
As it flows up from the ground
Taking all who hear that sound
Close your eyes, its about to begin
Hardly daring to breath, a new life you perceive
You try hard not to break the spell
While at once it seems both, so far and yet so close
If you reach out to touch, it will be gone
As it flows up from the ground
Taking all who hear that sound
Close your eyes, its about to begin
Close your eyes, its about to begin
Close your eyes, its about to beginEmbed
