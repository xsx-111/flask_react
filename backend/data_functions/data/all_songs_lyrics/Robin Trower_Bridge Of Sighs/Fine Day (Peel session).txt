Fine Day (Peel session) LyricsTrower-Dewar
It's a fine day
There's nothing moving in the sky
It's a fine day
Cross my heart and hope to die
Stay with me baby
The love's in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine day
It's a new day
I feel so good this morning
It's a new day
There's a promise in the dawning
Stay with me baby
The love's in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine day
(Solo)
Stay with me baby
The love's in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine day
It's a fine day
Now the story is unfolding
Oh, in his hands
In his hands our lives he's holding
Stay with me baby
The love's in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine dayEmbed
