In This Place LyricsIn this place, filled with empty space
Your love holds the key, baby sympathize with me
I need you
Before I lost, your touch of life and grace
I knew that your sweet face could always comfort me
I love you
In this place, full of empty space
Your soft and tender love will always shine for me
I love you
Now I know, what it means to have you gone
I'm down on my knees baby see by me
I love youEmbed
