The Fool and Me LyricsTraveling that wind and laugh at the crowd, mmm the fool and me
Howl at the moon baby yell out loud, the fool and me
And ohh oh, where ever we go
We keep the spirit free
Ohh nobody knows
No one but the fool and me
Stretching on out and feeling fine, the fool and me
Two fools dancing on the hands of time, yeah
The fool and me
And ohh oh, where ever we go
We keep the spirit free
Ohh nobody knows
No one but the fool and me
Running like the wind and laugh at the crowd, the fool and me
Howl at the moon yeah out loud loud, the fool and me
And ohh oh where ever we go
We keep the spirit free
Ohh nobody knows
No one but the fool and meEmbed
