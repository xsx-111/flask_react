Some More LyricsMuch greater than science fiction
Is this thing about my new affliction
Waves of pain are sweeping through me
Yet tell me who would ever believe it
Rather than believe it's 'cause you're leaving
Could cause me to suffer all this grievin'
I blame it on something that can't be explained
I said that I've got a new kind of pain
I've got headache in my heart, heartache in my head
Each and every single day
Money is spent in some sort of way
To help the doctors be absolutely certain
But for me they can't find what's hurting
When the tears that the pain brings on
Have got nothin' to do with the fact that you're gone
When the reason why I don't sleep at night
Is only because I'm trying to fight this
Headache in my heart, said I got a heartache in my headEmbed
