Friday Night, August 14th LyricsAh-ah-ah-ah-ah Ah! Hey!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Ah! Hey!
Friday night, August the 14th
Old lady luck smiled down on me
My income tax return came through
I put old 47 in the ?
I know that I probably should not
Matter of fact I probably could not
Buy all the good time meant for me
But then, Friday night, gonna be a memory
You know that the whole wide world will remember me, yeah
You find a little pussycat to come and see
Then I close my eyes and I'm free??
I know that I probably should not
Matter of fact I probably could not
Buy all the good time meant for me
Yeah!
Yeah
Friday night, August the 14th
(x4)
Well, I know that I probably should not
Matter of fact, I probably could not
Buy all the good time meant for me
Yeah!
Ah-ah-ah-ah Ah! Hey!
(x8)
Hey pussycat come and see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
