Funky Dollar Bill Lyrics
Funky dollar bill
U.S. dollar bill

You go to school to learn the rules
On how to love and live your life
But think about it twice
The pushers push, the fixers fix
The judge acquits
The junkie leads his life
For the dollar bill


You don't buy a life, you live a life
A father learns much too late
He was a-never home
He worked two jobs, never stayed at home
He had to, 'cause
His love life was gone
For the dollar bill
For the dollar bill
For the dollar bill
U.S. dollar bill
It'll buy a war
It will save a land
It pollutes this air
In the name of wealth
It'll buy you life
But not true life
The kind of life
Where the soul is harsh
For the dollar bill
