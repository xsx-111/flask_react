Grace Lyrics
Oh, can you hear, hear mercy sing
She cries to bitter hearts, end your suffering
Oh, please let go, give up your fight
Holding back your love, it never made things right
It’s gonna be ok, ok tonight, yeah

Grace, only grace
Can roll your dead heart’s stone away, yeah
Grace, only grace
Can move us to a rhythm that will change our ways

Oh, listen to love and let pride hit the ground
If joy is the armor, it can’t be broken down
But if hate is the fuel, no one will win
But when we love ‘til we’re empty
That’s when life begins


Grace, grace, come and move me
Oh, come and move me now
Grace, grace, only you can
Lift up what holds me down, yeah
Grace, only grace
Can roll your dead heart’s stone away, yeah
Grace, only grace
Can move us to a rhythm that will change our ways
Can move us to a rhythm that can change our waysEmbed
