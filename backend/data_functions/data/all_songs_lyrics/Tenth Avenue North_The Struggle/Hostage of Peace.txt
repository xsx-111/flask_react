Hostage of Peace Lyrics
Feel the silence
There's war beneath our skin
Let it begin
It's hard to fight
It's hard to lead resistance
It's our hearts we're up against

This world it keeps us
Promising freedom
We thought we could belong
But we don't belong here
Don't let us wander
To arms of another
Oh father, yours forever
Let us be a hostage of peace

We need a rescue
Need a love we can't resist
Or break our defenses
Take us captive
Take our thoughts and take control
We're losing control
Yeah!

If we're fighting
Let it be for your kingdom
If we're violent
Let it be against ourselves
Come arrest us
With your affection
Give us freedom
Make our need our only declaration

I'm your hostageEmbed
