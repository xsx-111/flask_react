No One Be Left Outside LyricsIf you're running, if you're lonely
You don't have to be the only
One to do this, do this alone
'Cause we were made in, in the image
Of a union under heaven
We will never, come apart
We were made for one another
All our sisters, all our brothers
We were meant to work here side by side
We were made to live together
Throw all our weapons down into the river
Under his grace we'll unify:
No one need be left outside
And if you're troubled, if you're weary
Lay your burdens down with me
I'll walk with you, we don't do this alone
So in our conflicts and all our gossip and
The divisions and all our prejudice
May we watch them die, just leave them behind

No one, no one, no one
No one, no one left on the outside
