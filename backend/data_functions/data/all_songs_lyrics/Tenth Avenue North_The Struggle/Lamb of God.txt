Lamb of God Lyrics
King of all the earth and every age
All creation waits for You
And trembles at Your name
Surrounded on a throne of endless praise
Fire and lightning flash from the glory of Your face
And I sing to You

You are Holy
You are worthy
You are Holy
You’re the lamb of God (2x)

How do I dare approach this Holy One
The One who was and is, was and is to come
Robed in righteousness and mystery
We have only just begun, just begun to see
So I come broken through
The blood of Your Son and I kneel before You


Blessing and honor and glory and power
To Him who sits on the throne
Blessing and honor and glory and power
Forever to our God alone
 (2x)

You are Holy, Lord
Holy, God, You’re Holy, Lord
You are Holy, LordEmbed
