Where Life Will Never Die Lyrics
Iâ€™m waking up again
In this land of shadows
My eyes are growing dim
Lured toward the gallows
So light my soul ablaze
A field on fire
Take me to that place
Of one desire

O tempted heart, come alive
I feel you burning inside
Weary soul, lift your eyes
To a city where life will never die

But the dark and immediate
They come so easy
So I keep on giving in
To the things that kill me


Dark eyes, look up
See a kingdom come
Burn within our lungs
Further up, further on
Higher
Take me higher

Oh the city, the city will never die, noEmbed
