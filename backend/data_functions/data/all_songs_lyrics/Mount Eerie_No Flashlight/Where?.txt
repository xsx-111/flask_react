Where? Lyrics"Where is Mount Eerie and how do I get there?
And how long's the walk and what should I bring?"
Mount Eerie is nowhere
Mount Eerie is playing tonight
"Where is the concert and will it be all ages?
And what time are doors?
And how much does it cost?"
The concert is nowhere
There is only one sky
"I accept the invitation
I would like to 'fulfil the pregnant night'
Where should I set my stuff up?"
Those things are not yours
And tonight you will be taken in dark armsEmbed
