No Inside, No Out LyricsBecause the pupil of my eye is a hole
There's no inside and there's no out
The world is in me
And I am in the world 
Because my teeth are the visible bones
In my mouth of invisible songs
A cave in the night is overflowing
There's no inside, there's no suffocation
Being "in the world" is having scattered ashes
A cave in the night is overflowing in songEmbed
