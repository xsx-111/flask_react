Waterfalls LyricsIn my most hopeless days
Lost in pitch black caves
There's waterfalls
And dripping stone walls
It's so perfect and amazing
So you may only naively believe
There's waterfalls and all perspectives
And when you see the light
Or go for walks at night
There's waterfalls, but you can stay dry
In the Universe
Or in the death and birth
I always wonder at each, my mother
And right before I die
Or start to tell a lie
There is a spark drowned out
In my heart's hiding place
There is a moonlit lake
And there are waterfalls on the way down thereEmbed
