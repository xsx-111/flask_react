(2 Lakes) LyricsThere were 2 lakes:
One where everyone goes
Was found on maps and was covered in boats
Was so shallow so, in it, things grow
And at one of its edges, the black cliffs rose
And down the rock, the lake's new water did pour
The second lake just beyond the cliff
Was fed by a bottomless spring
And still has never been seenEmbed
