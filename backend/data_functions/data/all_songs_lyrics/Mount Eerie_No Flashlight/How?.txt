How? LyricsHaving washed my face in a frozen stream
And having lived in guest rooms for the last 7 years
And having just doubled in size, admitting animal loving
I still must find a way
How, how do I live with the romance of the world?
How do I live with the romance: the lure of scenery?
How do I live with the romance of comfort and closed eyes?
How do I live with the romance?
And admit that this might be the world where I belong
How?
I'll sing my song in a parking lotEmbed
