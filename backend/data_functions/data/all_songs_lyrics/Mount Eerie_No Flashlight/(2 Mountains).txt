(2 Mountains) LyricsThere are 2 mountains:
One that everyone knows
Our eyes pass by it, it is so well known
I know its shape while I travel. It waits
In photos and songs of picturesque living it waits
But Bright Mountain, all day, trails a growing shadow
And the second peak appears only at night
In the dark this mountain towers and roars
Dark Mountain trails nothing and grows
Where there were skies there are ocean shadows
And we will be insideEmbed
