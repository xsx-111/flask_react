I Hold Nothing LyricsYour love
Swells and pounds me
I know nothing now that I know you
My face goes blank
My eyes go open gates
And the world can go (in them)
And the world can stay and make us wealthy
And take away
So, I hold nothing
Now that I hold nothing (now that I hold you)
There's no place to use our money where we live
The generous world suggests generous living
So we lay under low wide branches
Of the oldest tree on the dune, in the hay
Where we will stay for so long
That the careful birds will relax
And make black nests in your black hair
And walk around beneath my still feet
And we will only notice the play of the world for a moment
And let it roll on, the way the world rolls on
We will only notice the world for a moment
And let it roll on, the way the world rolls on
The world, for a moment, and let it roll on
The way the world rolls on
Through open gates
And we will only notice the play of the world
(that long moss is growing on us)
(that the wind has rewritten us)
(the give and take not stopping ever)
For only a moment
In a generous way:
I give long walks to the dogs (In a generous way, I)
I put commas and periods in songs
I give closed eyes to the day
I give peace to the long decay
(we do not need to fear dying)Embed
