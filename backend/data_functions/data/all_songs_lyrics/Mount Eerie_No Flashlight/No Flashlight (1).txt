No Flashlight (1) LyricsI can only love those dark hills because I live in the day
I can only see the mountain because I am in town
I only love night because I have only smelled it
Actually living in the night means no talking
I can only say "no flashlight" because once I forgot it
Actually living in the night means
Actually walking in the dark means to find caves in songEmbed
