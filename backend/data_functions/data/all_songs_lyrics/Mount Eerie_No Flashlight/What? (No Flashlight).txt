What? (No Flashlight) LyricsWhen I was sturdier I'd talk about how
"Certainly we all will die
We'll eat shadows, we will bury candles
Die, die, die."
When I was sturdier I thought
"So what? I am forever mountainous!"
I bravely said, "No death of any kind
Could matter to my mountain mind
Come years, come surging, I am tall!"
When I was "sturdier" I was secretly scared
And the fear was blinding
As you can see, I am no rock
Through mountain wind
What I actually am is thinning cloudsEmbed
