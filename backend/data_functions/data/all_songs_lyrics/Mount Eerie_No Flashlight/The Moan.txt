The Moan LyricsIn the night
After the bats come out
I hear your howling
I know no one and
I hold nothing (now that I know you)
This is how we howl
In the dark night on the unlit trail there's no way
Through but to crawl
Perplexed by the world around me there's no way
Through but to surrender my body completely
To you
To be eaten, to be gnawed
To fulfill the pregnant night
And then to be born in the mornings
(to be quiet)Embed
