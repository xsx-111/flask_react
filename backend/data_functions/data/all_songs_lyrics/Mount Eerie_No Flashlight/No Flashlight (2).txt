No Flashlight (2) Lyrics("MOUNT EERIE" means:
Song in parking lot/sounds in the night)
"NO FLASHLIGHT" means
"There's another world and it's inside this one."
The moon is in the lake
"NO FLASHLIGHT" means
The lake at night, At the cold bottom
There's no pool of light, no moon, no sky, no world
"NO FLASHLIGHT" means
At the bottom of the lake with opened eyes
In the mountains" with no flashlight and no friends
Knowing the world is in song and being able to hush
Turning off the light is being welcomed home
Crawling in the dark
Saying "no flashlight"
Is saying "Yes" to everything elseEmbed
