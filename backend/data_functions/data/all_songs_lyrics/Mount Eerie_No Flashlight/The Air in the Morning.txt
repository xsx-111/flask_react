The Air in the Morning LyricsThe air in the morning
(and the way that Halloween is always approaching)
Will enter the room
It will find my cheek and will wake me up roaring
With the rains come Halloween
And with the night comes the air in the morning
My costume will be myself with the night on my face
So I stand in the rain in the dark with the world unfolding
The air in the morning comes in songEmbed
