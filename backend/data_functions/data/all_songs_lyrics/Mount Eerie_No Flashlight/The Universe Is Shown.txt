The Universe Is Shown LyricsThere is no way you will get out of it
And, in this way, the universe is shown
"But I wasn't even looking for it!"
It doesn't matter. The Universe is shown
"But I had some other plans for the night!"
You are done. The Universe is shown
"But my life is long and good."
Yeah, and from now on you must fulfill the pregnant night
The Universe is shown in songEmbed
