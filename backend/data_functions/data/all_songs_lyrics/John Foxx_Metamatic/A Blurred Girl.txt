A Blurred Girl LyricsI'm taking nothing
It's not my way
It's almost summer now
This bed's been made
Some time ago a figure strolled
Along the esplanade
Changing in the mist and light
Underneath the green arcades
Chorus:
A blurred girl
A blurred girl
Are we running still?
Or are we standing still?
Are we running still?
Or are we standing still?
Standing so close
Never quite touching
Standing so close
Never quite touching
(Chorus)
Wounded in sleep again
The sequences move by me
A million miles across the room
A tearing sound of smiling
We're fixing distances on maps
And echo paths in crowds
The light from other windows
Falls across me now
(Chorus)
Standing so close
Never quite touching
Standing so close
Never quite touching (Repeat and fade)Embed
