No-One Driving LyricsSeems like you were lit inside
I feel like fog beside the shine
Figure fades away, someone takes my place
Meshing with the pictures on the pages
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one
The family's back from long ago
The voices burnt, the voices gold
Vapour trails go by, voices on the lines
Nothing to come back to, can't we fade?
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one
Someone's gone liquid in the sheets
A sudden smell of burning leaves
The old streets overgrown, there's somewhere else to go
It's just another switchback, can't we fade?
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one2Embed
