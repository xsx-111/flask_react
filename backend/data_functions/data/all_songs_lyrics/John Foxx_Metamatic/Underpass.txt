Underpass LyricsStanding in the dark
Watching you glow
Lifting a receiver
Nobody I know
Underpass
Underpass
Well, I used to remember
Now it's all gone
World War something
We were somebody's sons
Underpass
Underpass
Over all the bridges
Echoes in rows
Talking at the same time
Click click drone
Underpass
Underpass
Misty on the glass now
Rusty on the door
Here for years now
Click click drone
Click click drone
Click click drone
Click click drone
