030 LyricsMale caucasian
Pattern scarring
Domestic gestures just like mine
Kennedy hairline
Remix features
Someone pushing through my outline
Voices merging
Faces blurring
Voices blurring
Faces merging
Lieutenant 030
Lieutenant 030
X-rays match up
Sunlit concrete
Missing since 1963
File a decaying car
Buried in the sand
Empty clothing blows across a beachEmbed
