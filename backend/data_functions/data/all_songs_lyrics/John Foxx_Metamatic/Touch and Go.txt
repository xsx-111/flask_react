Touch and Go LyricsWe stepped out in the shatter light
And I watched as we blew away
Through a sea of seats
And the tangled-up streets
And the cities in a grey-blue haze
In the catalogue
All the places fold in
Underneath a daylight moon
Grey eyes, brown eyes, mad nights, red skies
Well I keep them in a jumble room
So while I am the one who waits here
We all know that it's all such a game of Touch And Go
Let's play at Touch And Go
I'm waking up in the moving windows
Going out to play the game of Touch And Go
Cause it's all so touch and go
The summer boy in his dark-blue shirt
Getting letters from Tokyo
And we're sitting in a shaky lake
Or gliding over to a girl with a broken nose
There's motorway sparks
And meetings in the park
And fires from years ago
You can watch your friends
Through this tiny lens
Then you'll know that there's no way home
So while I am the one who waits here
We all know that it's all such a game of Touch And Go
Let's play at Touch And Go
Waking up in the moving windows
Going out again to play the game of Touch And Go
Cause it's all so touch and go
Let's go
Touch
Go
Touch And Go
Touch And Go
Touch
Go
Touch And Go
Touch And Go
Oh-oh
Now it's springtime
On the moving stairway
Time to start again
And I'm wondering vaguely just whose face this is
And could we ever be friends?
Outside now it's so huge and blue
And the city windows start to glow
And the tides are soft as we're casting off
As the summer starts to show
So while I am the one who waits here
Where I like to play the game of Touch And Go
Let's play at Touch And Go
I'm waking up in the moving windows
Going out again to play the game of Touch And Go
Cause it's all so touch and go
So let's goEmbed
