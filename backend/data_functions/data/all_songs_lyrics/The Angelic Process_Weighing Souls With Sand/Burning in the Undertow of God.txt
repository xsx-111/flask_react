Burning in the Undertow of God LyricsSomeday
Someday
I'll wake to be myself again
(But) I left my soul and
I never want to try again
Never want to try again
I left my soul and
I never want to try again
Never want to try again
Never want to try again
Never want to try again
Never want to try again
Sense of me and time slips away
Could you meet before the light burns me alive?
Sense of me and time slips away
(Want to see you)
And what I fear the light has burnt awayEmbed
