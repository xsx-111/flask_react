Brand - New - Life LyricsSo bad when you went away
Nothing I could do or say
And now we are a lonely two
Sit at home and watch the tube
I've been hurt before
Sorrow knocking on my door
Pain
And so I make a brand-new-life
Fashioned out of brand-new strife
And when I hear the doorbell ring
I can never let them in to me
Pain is in me every day
When you went it came to stay
Come and be a cure for me
Make the tears come out of me
I've been hurt before
Sorrow knocking on my door
Pain
So bad when you went away
Nothing I could do or say
And when I hear the doorbell ring
I can never let them in to meEmbed
