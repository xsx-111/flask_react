Eating Noddemix LyricsStaring at the mirror on
The steamy bathroom wall
Eating a Noddemix
As the people are running
The highrise starts to fall
While she neatly wipes her lips
The reporters pick up
Their pads and pens
As they rush to the scene
And the cameras wink on the gory views
How the Editors agree
Putting on her makeup
She glances at the clock
Next she'll paint her nails
The train has collided
The driver didn't stop
As she slips onto the scales
Looking for her car keys
She finds them in her shoe
Lift the magazine from the floor
That long-ago mystery
Has revealed another clue
As she quickly shuts the door
Yeah, man, they just pulled over now
And it looks like it's gonna be an all-night job tonight, you know
If you could send a few cars, it would sure help a lot
And I should sip wine in front of the TV tonight
Because there's a program I wish you to see
I'll start making a few inquiries already
Ok, that's all for nowEmbed
