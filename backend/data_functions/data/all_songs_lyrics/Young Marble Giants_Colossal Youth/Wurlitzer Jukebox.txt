Wurlitzer Jukebox Lyrics
Parrish is dancing, his feet are a blur
Comes to a standstill
I ask him a question
He doesn't hear

Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukebox

Fingers are pointed in my direction
Words fly around me
Everyone's chanting

Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukeboxEmbed
