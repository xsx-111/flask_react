The Man Amplifier LyricsThe Man Amplifier
Has everything but desire
Is a robot when he should
Never tires, ever good
And we're singing
Parallel sympathy with you
Skin to metal overture
Take a walk, he's always near
Like a shadow, never fear
While we're singing
Like a tower in the dark
He can leave you feeling stark
While his fingers fall away
Love is climbing in his heart
So we're singing
Take a towel to his brow
Soothe the features of the proud
Lubricate the inner man
Exercise him when you can
And be singingEmbed
