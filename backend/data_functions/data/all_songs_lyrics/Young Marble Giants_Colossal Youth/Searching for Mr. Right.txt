Searching for Mr. Right LyricsSearching for Mr Right
Waiting up half the night
Feeling like I'll be dead
Before I'm old
Teaching myself to be
The Young Untold
How can I hope to be
Someone for you to see?
Blind as the Fate decrees
I will go on
Teaching myself to be
The Young Untold
Am I in vain tonight?
Lose you against the light
Who can you be
Mr Right?1Embed
