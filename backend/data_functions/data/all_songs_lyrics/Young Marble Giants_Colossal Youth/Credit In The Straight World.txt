Credit In The Straight World LyricsGo for credit in the straight world
Look a dealer in the eye
Go for credit in the real world
Won't you try?
I got some credit in the straight world
I lost a leg, I lost an eye
Go for credit in the real world
You won't die
Instant credit in the straight world
Leaving money when you die
Lots of credit in the real world
Gets you highEmbed
