Closure Lyrics
Breathe, trust, bless me and release
Climb hard or never be seen
Closed off, rescue to breathe
Just bless me

Two-sided time
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
The pain

Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me

Had to turn and lay down, your sting of disease
Phase you out, should've seen this coming
Go on confusing this soul
Hold my breath 'til you rupture

Three days aside
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
Pride
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me

Like a leech, I hold on, as if we belonged
To some precious pure dream
Cast off, you've seen what's beneath
Now fail me

Faulty closure
Faulty closure
Faulty closure
Faulty closure

Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me (No)
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me (No)
