An Evening With El Diablo Lyrics
High (high), up on you
You display (you display) good traits, though few
We found (we found) time alone will tell
This disease (this disease) keeps holding me down

Try to run (try to run) when near sleep
To imagine (to imagine) us away
He said "Come (he said come), fly around my hell"
And know this (and know this) you seem to be

Too scared to run
Too scared to run, too scared to run
Too scared! To run, too scared!

Wish I had your faults
Nothing seems to phaze you
Lies
You're much more than just human

I was high up on you
'Til the shadows began to crawl
Some say (some say) we can never know
Just how far down (just how far down) this beast has come
Too scared to run!
Too scared to run, too scared to run
Too scared! To run, too scared! To run!

Wish I had your faults
Nothing seems to phaze you
Lies
You're much more than just human

Wish I had your faults
Wish I had your faults3Embed
