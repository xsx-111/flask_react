One Lonely Visitor Lyrics
Am I alone In here?
Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here?

Knew you were here
Sister confirms suspicions
And besides the note you left on my bed
Where I held you so close

Did you think I'd forget?
Couldn't be more of a mess
For to breathe used to be another way
I'd take you in

Well it's time to wake up
And separate feelings
That I keep falling into
Each seems like good reasons
But I feel a breakdown
I don't care if it shows up
I'm praying this for you
'Til it's answered I'll say
Now it seems there's a choice
That began with a break
So today know that never again
Will i know you that way...

Well it's time to wake up
And separate feelings
That I keep falling into
Each seems like good reasons
But I'm gonna breakdown
I don't care if it shows up
I'm praying this for you
'Til it's answered I'll say

Am I alone in here? Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here? Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here? Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here? Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here? Am I alone In here?
Am I alone in here? Am I alone in here?1Embed
