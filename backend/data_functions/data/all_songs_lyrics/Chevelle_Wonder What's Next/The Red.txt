The Red Lyrics
They say 'Freak'
When you're singled out
The red
Well, it filters through

So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

Seeing red again
Seeing red again

This change
He won't contain
Slip away
To clear your mind

When asked
Who made it show
The truth
He gives in to most
So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again


So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again
[Bridge 2)
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red!

They say 'Freak'
When you're singled out
The red
It filters through20Embed
