(High) Visibility LyricsFind something mindless I can advocate
Make up the me I want to be
Then always keep a finger on the pulse
Maintain high visibility
Grubbing for any contact I can make
Then dig in deep to get ahead
Line up the prospects that I think
Will take
You know you have to use your head
And inability remains protected
The company I keep
Won't let me ever be rejected
And inability remains protected
The company I keep
Won't let me ever be rejectedEmbed
