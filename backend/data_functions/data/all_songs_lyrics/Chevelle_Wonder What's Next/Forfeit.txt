Forfeit Lyrics
Will not be shaken and jump into this and
Be persuasive, just carry on and
Make my mind up to go through this or
Be firm and sit in silence

'Cause I want to fight, I want to fight
I want to prove I'm right
I want to fight, I want to fight
So turn and forfeit

Forfeit
Forfeit
Forfeit
Forfeit

Learn from this prehistoric dance and
Refrain from talking solves our problems
Medicated could do some good or
Find a way to relate or just shut up

'Cause I want to fight, I want to fight
I want to prove I'm right
I want to fight, I want to fight
So turn and forfeit
Forfeit (forfeit, forfeit, forfeit)
Forfeit!
Forfeit!
Forfeit!
Forfeit!
Forfeit!

I want to fight, I want to fight
I want to prove I'm right
(I want to fight I want to fight, I want to prove I'm right)
I want to fight, I want to fight
So turn and forfeit
(I want to fight, I want to fight, so turn and forfeit)

So step up
So step up
And forfeit
So step up

Forfeit!
Forfeit!
Forfeit!
Forfeit!1Embed
