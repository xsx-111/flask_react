Comfortable Liar Lyrics
Broad is this sea
The salt enters the wound
My take on you is simple

So heal your fear
To heal your fear

Time spent waiting off shore
The calm before the storm
My take from you is simple

So heal your fear
To heal your fear

You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're so calm
'Cause I said wrong
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar!
