Grab Thy Hand Lyrics
Grab thy hand and walk!
Through, through
Through, through

Bring me your time
How I long for release
Shown presently
Reveals a man to repeat

God
How I long
How I long

To grab thy hand and walk!

May I! Come in!
Grab hold! Just this once
May I! Come in!
Just this once, just this once

Just this once, grab thy hand and walk!
Through, through
Through, through
Walk!
May I come in
How long, just once
Can't I come in, grab thy hand and
May I (through) come in
How long just once
Can't I (through) come in grab thy hand and
Walk (through), walk (through)
Walk (through), walk (through)Embed
