Something Got Me Started Lyrics
-I love you!
-Show me

Something got me started
You know that I will love you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you

I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)

Totally brokenhearted
Guilty of what I did to you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you
Yes, a little because
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
Come on
'I really love you'
Come on

I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)
I'd give it all up for you (Yes, I would)

Yes, I would
Yes, I would
Yes, I would
Hey!
Yes, I would
Yeah
Yes, I would
(Something got me started)
(Something got me started)
You've got to help me now
(Something got me started)
You've got to help me now
(Something got me started)
You've got to help me now
(Something got me started)
You've got to help me now, help me
(Something got me started)
I'll take it outEmbed
