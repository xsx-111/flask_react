Model LyricsLooking at yourself in the mirror baby
Telling yourself to be up this morning
Holding in your hand another mirror baby
One or two lines for confidence
Pretty little girls
Climb to the top
The raging takes her
Down down down
(lonely baby)
Eating alligator for dinner baby
A restaurant that made it to the top
Smoothies always get to pay for dinner
Baby
The food was the last thing you came for
Pretty little girls
Climb to the top
The raging takes her
Down down down
(see them fall)
(you can see them fall down)
(fall)
(fall down)
Pretty little girls
Climb to the top
The raging takes her
Down down down
(see them fall)
(look at them fall)
(you can see them)
(see them fall)
(you can see them)
(you can see them fall)
(see them)
(you can see them fall)
(it's lonely)Embed
