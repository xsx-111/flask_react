Wonderland LyricsPeople, places
Pursuing the chases
Our moments were chosen
Her senses explosion
Take your pulse and read it well
She never said you'd only get one chance
Pay your debt and bleed as well
You're living in the same circumstances
The end of an era
Our future no clearer
My people no stronger
The blame i lay on her
Wonderland, wonderland
It's beautiful
Wonderland, wonderland
It's beautiful
Take your pulse and read it well
She never said you'd only get one chance
Pay your debt and bleed as well
You're living in the same circumstances
The end of an era
Our future no clearer
My people no stronger
The blame i lay on herEmbed
