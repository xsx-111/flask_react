Weapon LyricsHere by my side, an angel
Here by my side, the devil
Never turn your back on me
Never turn your back on me again
Here by my side, it's heaven
Oooh...
Here by my side, you are destruction
Here by my side, a new colour to paint the world, ooh
Never turn your back on it
Never turn your back on it again
Here by my side, it's heaven
Careful, you be careful
Careful, you be careful
This is where the world drops off
This is where the world drops off
Careful, you be careful
And you breathe in
And you breathe out for it
Ain't it so weird
How it makes you a weapon?
And you give in
And you give out for it
Ain't it so weird
How it makes you a weapon?
Never turn your back on it
Never turn your back on it
Again
Be careful, you be careful now
Here by my side, it's heaven
Here by my side, it's heaven
Here by my side, it's heavenEmbed
