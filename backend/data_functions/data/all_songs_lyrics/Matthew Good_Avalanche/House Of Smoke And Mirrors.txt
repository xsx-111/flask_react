House Of Smoke And Mirrors LyricsThere's the house
And there's the doorway
I've been locked out
The lights are out anyway
And loosely reconditioned
To be just so refined
A last grasp at the life worth living
And we stand to choose of what's left of my lines
You can see right through me
You can see right through me
You can see right through me
Yeah, yeah
Hey, I've been thinking
Why don't we get out of here tonight?
Get in the car and just start driving
Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke
Right?
I've fallen asleep again
And when I wake up you won't be here
Don't you think I don't know I've
Don't you think I don't know I've
I've been asleep for years
Yeah, yeah
See right through me
You can see right through me
You can see right through me
Yeah, yeahEmbed
