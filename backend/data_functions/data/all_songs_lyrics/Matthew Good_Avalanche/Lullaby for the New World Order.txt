Lullaby for the New World Order LyricsI've a favour to ask, maybe this is a bad time
You know, whenever you ask, there's never a good time
How do you take your heart out of it?
How can you take your heart our of this?
How do you stop once you've started?
Somebody gave you a choice
And all you do is abuse it
If God he gave you a voice
Then use it
Here's something to ask if these are the bad times
'Cause whenever you ask why, it's never the good times
How will we get ourselves out of it?
How can you take your heart out of this?
How do you stop once you've started?
Somebody gave you a choice
And all you do is abuse it
If God he gave you a voice
Then use it
Just a lullaby
For the new world order
Just a lullaby
For the new world
For the new world
And how do you stop once you've started?
Somebody gave you a choice
And all you do is abuse it
If God he gave you a voice
Then use it
Just a lullaby
For the new world order
Just a lullaby
For the new world
For the new world
For the new world
Just a lullaby
For the new world
For the new worldEmbed
