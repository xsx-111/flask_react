Pledge of Allegiance LyricsThis is a commercial for my army and my navy
This is a rehearsal for all the empty promises I will be
And I won't let you down, I won't let you down
And I won't let you down, done letting you down
Two, three, four
This is a commercial for freedom while freedom is in Hades
This is a rehearsal of incoherent double talk and maybes
And it won't let you down, it won't let you down
It won't let you down, done letting you down
It's okay to be their disappointment, baby
It's okay to fly the flag
It's okay to be my disappointment, baby
It's okay to fly the flag
This is a commercial for my army and my navy
This is a rehearsal for all the empty promises I will be
And I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, done letting you down
Two, three, fourEmbed
