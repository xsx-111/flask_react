Bright End of Nowhere LyricsHere's the bright end of nowhere
Here's the result of all our days
Used to lay on the roof and drink beer
And try and count up all the ways
That you could waste away
Looking back it seemed so simple
But having done it, I couldn't say
The lights are out, baby
And I'm a mouse
The lights are out, baby
So hear me out
The lights are out, baby
And I'm a mouse
So here's the bright end of nowhere
Here's the commercial of all our days
Go on vacations and drink beer
And try and forget all the ways
We let ourselves get away
Looking back it seemed so simple
But having done it, it's not the same
The lights are out, baby
And I'm a mouse
The lights are out, baby
So hear me out
The lights are out, baby
And I'm a mouseEmbed
