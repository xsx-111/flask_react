While We Were Hunting Rabbits LyricsBuy in, it'll shut you up
Try it, it should shut you up
We've brought someone in to shut you up
It's a life's work
While we were hunting rabbits
I came upon a clear
The sky, it's stars like fortune
Drilled me
'Til now I was a soldier
'Til now I dealt in fear
These years of cloak and dagger
Have left us disappeared
And I dance
And I sing
And I'm a monkey in a-
A long line, a long line
Buy in, it'll shut you up
Try it, it should shut you up
They've brought someone in to shut you up
And it's getting to be a lot of work
While we were hunting rabbits
I came upon a clear
The sky, it's stars like fortune
Drilled me
'Til now I was a soldier
'Til now I dealt in fear
These years of cloak and dagger
Have left us disappeared
And I dance
And I sing
And I'm a monkey in a
A long line of kings
And we dance
And we sing
And we're all monkeys in a
A long line, long line
I'm just a boat on the ocean
And I'm just a ship lost at sea
I'm a boat on the ocean
And I'm just a ship lost at sea
I'm a boat on the ocean
And I'm just a ship lost at sea
I'm just a boat on the ocean
I'm just a ship lost at seaEmbed
