Song for the Girl LyricsThis lightning's fine
She picks up these tired parts of mine
Who's carrying you tonight?
She carries me, all of mine
Up again, down again, out of your head
When she's beside you, you're nearly not so dead
Up again, down again, put of your head
When she's beside you, you're always at your best
This lightning's fine
She picks up these tired parts of mine
Who's carrying you tonight?
Every now and then, baby, ain't it good to be alive?
Up again, down again, out of your head
When she's beside you, you're nearly not so dead
Up again, down again, out of your head
When she's beside you, you're always at your best
So a song for the girl
Up again, down again, out of your head
Out of your head
Out of your head
Out of your head
Up again, down again, out of your headEmbed
