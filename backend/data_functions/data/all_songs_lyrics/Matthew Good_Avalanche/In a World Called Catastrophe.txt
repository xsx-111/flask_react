In a World Called Catastrophe LyricsHere it comes and there it goes
Another day of decomposing light
In a world called catastrophe
My native tongue is blasphemy
So that's the one I'll write
And baby can you feel it?
Don't it make you want to lay down
And close your eyes?
Remember how we started
'Cause since then, I'm a waste
Since then I'm a fool
Since then I'm a dog
In a world called catastrophe
Since then I'm a waste
Here it comes and there it goes
Another day of getting up to fight
In a world called catastrophe
My native tongue is blasphemy
So it's the one I'll write
And baby can you hear it?
Don't it make you want to wake up
And open your eyes?
Remember how we started
'Cause since then, I'm a waste
Since then I'm a fool
Since then I'm a dog
In a world called catastrophe
Since then I'm a wasteEmbed
