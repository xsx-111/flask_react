Avalanche LyricsOne foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot back to counter it
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot back to counter it
One foot in front of the other
One foot back to counter it
On days like these
You've got to find it in some other way
It's all or nothing, baby
Avalanche, start inside of me
Avalanche, down through the trees
Avalanche, start inside of me
Avalanche, hell down through the trees
If everyone's a casualty
Then take your time there ain't no trouble
If the weather's fine and we're feeling crazy
There's always drinks and dancing in the rubble
I'm spinning and you're spinning
The world's spinning and we're laughing
And I'm charming, the devil's charming
And we're ruined but we're building
And I'm selling and you're counting
The world's stopping but we keep going
And we're ruthless and we're cunning
And I'm heir to it all
I'm heir to it all
I'm heir to it all
I'm heir to it all
I'm heir to it all
I'm heir to--
On days like these
You've gotta find it in some other way
It's all or nothing, baby
Yeah
Avalanche, start inside of me
Avalanche, down through the trees
Avalanche, start inside of me
Avalanche, hell down through the trees
This key is to your kingdom
This key is to your heart
Neither one is a doorway
But both of them a part
So one foot in front of the otherEmbed
