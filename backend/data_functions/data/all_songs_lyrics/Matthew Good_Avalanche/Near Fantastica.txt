Near Fantastica LyricsThe pink pills are for your sanity
The pink pills are for your sanity
The pink pills are for your sanity
We are buried in the Earth because we can't beat gravity
You are still here and so made to figure
You are an important part of the computer
Born of the sea, blink, the sea is dead
Falls out of me, these sockets in my head
Everyone's a captain, baby, ship of fools
Drowning while they're telling you
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
Dream the dream of your attrition
The nameless name of your condition
It will be needing you a little while longer
You are an important part of the computer
And after this mission it will let you go
Help you to forget everything and everyone you know
In a world of captains, baby, ship of fools
Don't you know they're lying when they're telling you
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
Can't fear fear, fear is the mind killer
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alright
It's been alrightEmbed
