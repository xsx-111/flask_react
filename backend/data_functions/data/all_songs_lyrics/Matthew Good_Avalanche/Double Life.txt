Double Life LyricsHow now are you gone awry?
How now are we back here tonight?
That's all there is
Roll the dice
This is all there is
Roll the dice
That's all there is
Roll the dice
This is all there is
How now baby, is a little bit enough of it
When you live a double life?
How now baby, is a little bit enough of it
When you live a double life?
How now are you going to bite
Both hands, both hands
That's all there is
Roll the dice
This is all there is
How now baby, is a little bit enough of it
When you live a double life?
How now baby, is a little bit enough of it
When you live a double life?
Well I knew but I've forgotten
'Cause everyone keeps asking
How come they feel so terrible
If terrible's in fashion?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeahEmbed
