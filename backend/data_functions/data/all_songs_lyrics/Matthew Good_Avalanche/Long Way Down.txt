Long Way Down LyricsToday I'm leaving
This bullshit one-horse town
Full of Cowboys and Indians
Who only have balls when there's a camera around
Where the girls they move to you
When money gets thrown around
Even happiness is using you
Maybe you'll figure that out
Maybe you'll figure that out
Maybe you'll figure that out
It's a long way down
You know it's a damn shame the sun don't shine underground
Maybe that's where it's been
Maybe that's where I've been
Maybe that's where it's been
A long way down
So today I'm leaving
This bullshit circus town
Do you ever get the feeling
There ain't no hole when you're not around?
Where the world it moves to you
When the money gets spread around
Even happiness is using you
Maybe you'll figure that out
Maybe you'll figure that out
It's a long way down
You know it's a damn shame the sun don't shine underground
Maybe that's where it's been
Maybe that's where I've been
Maybe that's where it's been
A long way down
Long way down
Long way downEmbed
