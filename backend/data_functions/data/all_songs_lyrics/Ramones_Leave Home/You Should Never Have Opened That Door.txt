You Should Never Have Opened That Door Lyrics
Mama, where's your little daughter?
She's here, right here on the altar
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never going to see her no more
You don't know what I can do with this axe
Chop off your head, so you better relax

You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)
You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)

Mama, where's your little daughter?
She's here, right here on the altar
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never going to see her no more
You don't know what I can do with this axe
Chop off your head, so you better relax

You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)
You should never have opened that door (open that door)
Now you're never going to see her no more (open that door)
(Open that door)1Embed
