Carbona Not Glue Lyrics
Wondering what I'm doing tonight
I've been in the closet and I feel alright
Ran out of Carbona, Mom threw out the glue
Ran out of paint and roach spray too
It's TV's fault why I am this way
Mom and pop wanna put me away
From the early morning movie to the late, late show
After it's over, nowhere to go

And I'm not sorry for the things I do
My brain is stuck from shooting glue
I'm not sorry for the things I do
Do
Carbona, not glue
Carbona, not glue

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Wondering what I'm doing tonight
I've been in the closet and I feel alright
Ran out of Carbona, Mom threw out the glue
Ran out of paint and roach spray too
It's TV's fault why I am this way
Mom and pop wanna put me away
From the early morning movie to the late, late show
After it's over, nowhere to go
Carbona, not glue (Hey)
Carbona, not glue (Hey)
Carbona, not glue (Hey)
Carbona, not glue (Hey)
Carbona, not glue (Hey)
Carbona, not glue (Hey)
Carbona, not glue (Hey)Embed
