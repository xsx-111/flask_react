Glad to See You Go Lyrics
Going to take a chance on her
One bullet in the cylinder
And in a moment of passion
Get the glory like Charles Manson
Going to smile, I'm gonna laugh
You're going to get a blood bath
And in a moment of passion
Get the glory like Charles Manson

Got to go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye

Now I know the score
I don't need you anymore
Don't want you 'cause you're a bore

I need somebody good
I need a miracle
Should I take a chance on her?
One bullet in the cylinder
Going to smile, I'm going to laugh
They're going to want my autograph
And in a moment of passion
Get the glory like Charles Manson
Got to go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye

Go go go go goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye (Go go go go goodbye)
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
Goodbye
(Glad to see you go go go go goodbye)
