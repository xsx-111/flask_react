Suzy Is a Headbanger Lyrics
Ooh-wee, do it one more time for me
Ooh-wee, do it one more time for me

Can't stop, stop that girl, there she goes again
I really, really love to watch her, watch her headbangin'

Suzy is a headbanger, her mother is a geek
Do it one more time for me, ooh-ooh-wee
Ooh-ooh-wee

Ooh-wee, do it one more time for me
Ooh-wee, do it one more time for me

Can't stop, stop that girl, there she goes again
I really, really love to watch her, watch her headbangin'

Suzy is a headbanger, her mother is a geek
Do it one more time for me, ooh-ooh-wee
Ooh-ooh-wee
Headbangin', headbangin'
Headbangin', headbangin'
Headbangin', headbangin'
Headbangin'Embed
