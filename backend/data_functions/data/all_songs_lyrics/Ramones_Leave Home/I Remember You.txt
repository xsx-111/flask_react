I Remember You Lyrics
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh

I remember lying awake at night
And thinking just of you
But things don't last forever
And somehow baby
They never really do
They never really do

I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh

I remember lying awake at night
And thinking just of you
But things don't last forever
And somehow baby
They never really do
They never really do
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh

I remember lying awake at night
And thinking just of you
But things don't last forever
And somehow baby
They never really do
They never really do

I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh1Embed
