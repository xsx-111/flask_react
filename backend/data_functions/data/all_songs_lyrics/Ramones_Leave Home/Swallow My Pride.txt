Swallow My Pride Lyrics
Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
Things were looking grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride

Loose lips sink ships, they say
But isn't it always that way?

Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah

Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
Things were looking grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride

Going to have a real cool time
And everything's going to be real fine

Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah

Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
Things were looking grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride

Going to have a real cool time
And everything's going to be real fine

Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah1Embed
