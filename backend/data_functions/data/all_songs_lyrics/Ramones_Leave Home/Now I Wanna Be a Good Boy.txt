Now I Wanna Be a Good Boy Lyrics
Now I want to be a good boy
I don't want to be bad
Now I want to run away from home
Now I want to be on my own

I just want to be a good boy
I don't want to be bad
Now I want to run away from home
Now I want to be settled on

Now I want to be a good boy
I don't want to be bad
Now I want to run away from home
Now I want to be all alone

Now I want to be a good boy
I don't want to be bad
Now I want to run away from home
Now I want to be on my ownEmbed
