Commando Lyrics
(One, two, three, four)

They do their best, do what they can
To get them ready for Vietnam
From old Hanoi to East Berlin
Commando, involved again
They do their best, do what they can
To get them ready for Vietnam

First rule is
The laws of Germany
Second rule is
Be nice to mommy
Third rule is
Don't talk to commies
Fourth rule is
Eat kosher salamis

They do their best, do what they can
To get them ready for Vietnam
From old Hanoi to East Berlin
Commando, involved again
They do their best, do what they can
To get them ready for Vietnam
First rule is
The laws of Germany
Second rule is
Be nice to Mommy
Third rule is
Don't talk to commies
Fourth rule is
Eat kosher salamis4Embed
