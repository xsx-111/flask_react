Oh, Oh, I Love Her So Lyrics
I met her at the Burger King, we fell in love by the soda machine
So we took the car downtown, the kids were hanging out all around
Then we went down to Coney Island, on the coaster and around again
And no one's gonna ever tear us apart
'Cause she's my sweetheart
All right, oh yeah

Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so, oh oh
Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so, oh oh

Hanging out on a night like this
I'm going to give her a great big kiss
I'm going to make her mine
And everything's going to be real fine

I met her at the Burger King, we fell in love by the soda machine
So we took the car downtown, the kids were hanging out all around
Then we went down to Coney Island, on the coaster and around again
And no one's gonna ever tear us apart
'Cause she's my sweetheart
All right, oh yeah
Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so, oh oh
Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so
Oh oh I love her so, oh ohEmbed
