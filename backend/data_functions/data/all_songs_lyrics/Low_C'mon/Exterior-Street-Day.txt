Exterior-Street-Day Lyrics
I saw your picture and I don’t know where it stops
You stand in the parking lot, kickin' up rocks
And I'm, I'm being a general shrew
Makin' a face, givin' in too
Your sister never had another normal year
Your little brother had a terrible fear
And I know you're never comin' back from the dead
I saw your friends at your building and they all said:

Oh-ay-oh, oh ay-oh
We could all see it comin’ along
Nobody could get through...

And when they sent you back to Boston
Your best friend called, she said "Stephanie lost some"
But it, it was nothing compared to this, no...
I thought I caught 'em underestimating everything
I was exhausted from investigating every single modicum
Of bitterness and nothing less than levitating
Every day’s a dime a dozen, everyone’s a wolf in waiting

You know you make it so hard on yourself
You are the ghost of 18
I recognize it, 'cause I do the same thing
Isn’t that what everybody knows?
I don’t know anybody else that could give up so much so fast
You were still so when the dirty old drunks pass
Let it go, let it go...

You always want to know
If I hear where you go
But I don’t hear anything anymore...
Oh-ay-oh, oh ay-oh
Oh-ay-oh, oh ay-oh
Oh-ay-oh, oh-ay-oh
Oh-ay-oh, oh-ay-ohEmbed
