When They Fight, They Fight Lyrics
When they fight, they fight
And when they come home at night, they sing
"I love you, baby"
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Was it too much too soon?
Or too little too late?
He got the message she left on his car in the rain
And then the words, they come to you
Driving away
You just can't let it go

And when they fight, they fight
And when they come home at night, they say
"I love you, baby"
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

And when it all comes crashing down
What can you do?
To find what you're looking for
And then the words, they'll come to you
Driving through the rain
But they'll be no one there to say them to anyway

And when they fight, they fight
And when they come home at night, they say
"I love you, baby"
And when they fight, they fight (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And when they come home at night, they say
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) "I love you, baby"
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh5Embed
