Bobby Beale Lyrics
He saw her stealing from the liquor store
It wasn't that he hadn't noticed her before
He's decided he's got all he needs
She's got many drug abusers in her family tree
She finds herself not knowing where to start
He finds himself not knowing how to park a car
She says she read about it on TV
Do any of your other lovers drink as much as me?

They laugh aloud, they scream and shout, and carry on and keep the neighbors up till dawn
And in the mirror, she will make a funny face and act like nothing's going on

He feels as though they're in a fairy tale
She tells him stories of the time she spent in jail
She put some extra in his lemonade
He doesn't know the code to let her in the gate
Please don't make me do it, Bobby Beale
They want so bad to tell each other how they feel
She throws her birthday party for herself
He knows enough to knock before he rings the bell
 x2
They laugh aloud, they scream and shout, and carry on and keep the neighbors up till dawn (neighbors up till dawn)
And in the mirror, she will make a funny face and act like nothing's going on (nothings going on)Embed
