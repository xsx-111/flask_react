Nobody Could Change Your Mind Lyrics
When you wear your black sunglasses
Nobody could change your mind
You are up for the snitch of the century
Nobody could change your mind
I never bought the connection
The connection is made, couldn't you say?
But we could all see it coming along
Nobody could change your mind

I have to wonder what you say to yourself
I have to wonder what you're saying to me
I sat up in my bed when they called me up and said
They saw you walking on the Boulevard Saint-Denis (And you were)
Making a face, you were stabbing at the sidewalk
You got somebody to give you the time
But we could all see it coming along
Nobody could change your mind

There was a message from your sister and Christina to me
Nobody could change your mind
They said you really don't need those glasses to see
Nobody could change your mind
And that you never will admit when your decisions are wrong
Nobody could change your mind
But we could all see it coming along
Nobody could change your mind

You should see if you can remember any numbers at all
Nobody could change your mind
Before the haze sets in and there's no one to call
Nobody could change your mind
And you've been keeping up appearances for ever so long
Nobody could change your mind
But we could all see it coming along
Nobody could change your mind

Nobody could change your mind
Nobody could change your mind
Nobody could change your mind
But we could all see it coming along
Nobody could change your mind...Embed
