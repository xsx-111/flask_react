Wildlife Sculpture Lyrics
The first time tunnel vision sets in
Beware the signs of hyperventilation
Beware the dangers of living alone
Be sure to hide scars from future generations

Don't let your old friends overestimate your demise
You can't miss it when you look in their eyes
Don't be your own, don't be your own (it's all the same)
We don't scissor, we don't separate

The second time I was making up for past mistakes
And I said, 'Next time, put me on the good side'
 we could be riding the brakes
And I suggest I'm giving all I could hide

I see the way they come when you call
Our backs are not against the wall
Don't be your own, don't be your own (it's all the same)
We don't scissor, we don't separate
 x8
Don't be your own, don't be your own...Embed
