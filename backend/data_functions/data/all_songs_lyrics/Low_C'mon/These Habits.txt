These Habits Lyrics
You see somebody standing next to you
You come and go like fashion comes across
And when the solitude gets to you
Get yourself to Pensacola and wash yourself off

There is nothing worse than waiting around
You can tell from looking at me that these habits are so far down

I saw the two of us playing cards in the dark
I said, 'I guess I must be here'
And when I offer an apology back
My sister says I'm insincere

There is nothing worse than waiting around
You can tell from looking at me that these habits are so far down
There is nothing worse than waiting around
You can see from looking at me that these habits are so far down...Embed
