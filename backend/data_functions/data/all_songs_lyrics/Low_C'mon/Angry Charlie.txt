Angry Charlie Lyrics
I heard you laughing
I knew you thought you could hide
It was a sound, ringing out from the back of the line
Your heart's not broken
But your feelings, they show
There's a mark left behind when you walk in the snow

Your little Tina
Is she still alive?
Now that you've seen her
Are you still surprised?

Now, if we made it
They caught me cheating again
It's the one in the red that you keep on the shelf
It's overrated
We'll pretend we're just friends
If you won't sing it with me, then I'll sing by myself

Your little Tina
Is she still alive?
Now that you've seen her
Are you still surprised?
Good luck with teacher
Now you know what they're like
In love with Tina, you know
Well, now that you know her
Long time, no see her
In a parallel life
Long time, no see...Embed
