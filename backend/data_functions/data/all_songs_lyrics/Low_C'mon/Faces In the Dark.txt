Faces In the Dark Lyrics
I take some comfort in losing my memory
(Oh wait, oh, don't you let me down)
Then I get it back and I said, "So this is what they mean?"
(Oh wait, oh, don't you get around)
They don't say that don't make it hard...

Everybody's making faces in the dark
Don't stop struggling, that's what sets you apart
It's the ghost of inhibition, that's what's breaking your heart
Everybody, everybody's making faces in the dark

I understood inhibition I was listening to
(They don't give up, they don't give in)
It's the middle of the summer and I got nothing to do
(Somebody get out, somebody get in)
I only miss my own city park...

(Everybody) Everybody's making faces in the dark
(Don't stop struggling) Don't stop struggling, that's what sets you apart
(Ghost of inhibition starts) It's the ghost of inhibition, that's what's breaking your heart
Everybody, everybody's making faces in the dark
And you let yourself see
You're making a mess of it all
And Esteban, your sister, and me
We're all right
There is a perception of a regular thing
You have been covering up all the things you won't let anyone see
Though you're really close by, you won't see me
I got a double in the city that's burying me tonight

So how is it that the memory's still so clear?
(They don't let up, whatever they know)
And you can't sell it back so pretty while it's here
(They don't get out, wherever they go)
They get sad and it tempts and they start...

(Everybody) Everybody's making faces in the dark
(Don't stop struggling) Don't stop struggling, that's what sets you apart
(Ghost of inhibition starts) It's the ghost of inhibition, that's what's breaking your heart
Everybody, everybody's making faces in the dark

Everybody...
Don't stop struggling...
Ghost of inhibition starts...
Everybody...
Don't stop struggling...
Ghost of inhibition starts...Embed
