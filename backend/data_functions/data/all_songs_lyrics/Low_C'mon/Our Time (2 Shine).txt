Our Time (2 Shine) Lyrics
Is that your girl? She tries so very hard
When it gets late at night, does she not wonder where you are?

And in the future, there'll be cars that fly
And I'll bet that she'll have found another guy
And she will look at you...

Is that your girl? She laughs just like the rest
She dresses nice at night, she's got those jewels across her chest
But she will make you sorry
This time of night, you'll see that she's already found another you

You got the message, riding late at night
Was getting dark but you can still make out the line
You'll be back soon...
