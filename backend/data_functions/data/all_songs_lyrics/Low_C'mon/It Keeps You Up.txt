It Keeps You Up Lyrics
You are the first in your me parade
You're getting older, they stay the same
Your funny look and your jealous eyes
They can't relate to a thing you say

When all in all is all we are
May not get you very far

It keeps you up at night
How did they buy their way into you?

We heard you first on the radio
You complicate the material
How can it be that we'd get there first?
It was a lie, it was a lie just to say the words

When your grass is painted green
You'll get the taste of what we mean

It keeps you up at night
They sleep inside your living room
You give 'em just another diamond at the vision time when it's over you...

We still remember things you said
When your face was turning red
All in all is what we are
May not get you very far...1Embed
