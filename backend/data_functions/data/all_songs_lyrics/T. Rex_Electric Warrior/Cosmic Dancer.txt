Cosmic Dancer Lyrics
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was out
I was dancing when I was out

I danced myself right out the womb
I danced myself right out the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
I danced myself right out the womb

I was dancing when I was eight
I was dancing when I was eight
Is it strange to dance so late?
Is it strange to dance so late?

I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
I danced myself into the tomb

Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man? (Oh)
What's it like to be a loon?
I liken it to a balloon
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
I danced myself out of the womb
I danced myself out of the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
I danced myself into the tomb
But then again
Once more
I danced myself out of the womb
I danced myself out of the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
I danced myself out of the womb
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)6Embed
