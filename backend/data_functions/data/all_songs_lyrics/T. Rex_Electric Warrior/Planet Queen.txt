Planet Queen Lyrics
Planet queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head like an exploder
The planet queen
The world's the same
I am to blame
She used my head like a revolver
The world's the same

Well, it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer, take me away
Give me your daughter
Well, it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer, take me away
Give me your daughter

Dragon head
Machine of lead
Cadillac King, dancer in the midnight
Dragon head
Planet queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head like a revolver
The world's the same
Well, it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer, take me away
Give me your daughter
Well, it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer, take me away
Give me your daughter

Dragon head
Machine of lead
Cadillac King, dancer in the midnight
Dragon head
Planet queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head like a revolver
The planet queen, yeah

Well, it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer, take me away
Give me your daughter
Well, it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer, take me away
Give me your daughter (Daughter)
Well, it's all right
Love is what you want
The flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter (Daughter, daughter)
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughter
Give me your daughterEmbed
