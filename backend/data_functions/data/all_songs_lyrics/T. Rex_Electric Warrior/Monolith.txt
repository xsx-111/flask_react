Monolith Lyrics
The throne of time
Is a kingly
A kingly thing
From whence you know
We all do begin
And dressed as you are, girl
In your fashions of fate
Baby it's too late
Shallow are the actions
Of the children of men
Fogged was their vision
Since the ages began
And lost like a lion
In the canyons of smoke
Girl it's no joke, oh no

It's no joke, oh no
Shallow are the actions
Of the children of men
But it is no joke, oh no, oh no

The throne of time
Is a kingly, a kingly thing
From whence you know
We all do begin
And dressed as you are girl
In your fashions of fate
Baby it's too late, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
But it's too late, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh1Embed
