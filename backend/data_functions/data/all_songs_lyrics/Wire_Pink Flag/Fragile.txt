Fragile Lyrics
Tears fall in slivers, you broke my shades
The light's too bright, let me bury my heart
Filter emotions of green, cowardice gives blue
A restricted view, let me open my heart

I have a fleeting love, scorching when it lands
Fragile
Needing precious hands
Fragile, fragile
Fragile

You eat my energy, give me more rope
Nail in the wall, let me hang my heart
Hang my heart

I have a fleeting love, scorching when it lands
Fragile
Needing precious hands
Fragile, fragile
