Champs Lyrics
The taste of champions
The pace, the pace
The speed, the need
The need to seed
The chance to die

Another dead, don't cry
Another dead, don't cry
You've still got speed
You'll maybe bleed
But there's less time

More speed than before
Less time than before
You're rich, not poor
What are you doing it for?
Want more, want more

Another dead, don't cry
Another dead, don't cry
You've still got speed
To feed from speed
Doing it all the timeEmbed
