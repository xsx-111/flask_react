Straight Line Lyrics
My mind is unwilling and your flesh is so weak
Do my movements betray the secrets I think?
I always stand by walls and try to humour fools

Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?

Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one-dimensional boy1Embed
