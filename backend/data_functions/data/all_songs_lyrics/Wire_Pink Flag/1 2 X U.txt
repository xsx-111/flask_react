1 2 X U Lyrics
Alright, here it is... again
And it's called
1-2-X-U!
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man, yeah!
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Smoking a fag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man, yeah!
I've got you in a corner, I've got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, got you in a corner
Got you in a cottage, got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, oh no, no, no
