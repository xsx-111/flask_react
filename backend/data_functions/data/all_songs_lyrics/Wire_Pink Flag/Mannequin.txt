Mannequin Lyrics
Well, you're a waste of space
No natural grace
You're so bloody thin
You don't even begin

To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
You just don't interest me

Well, you're an energy void
A black hole to avoid
No style, no heart
You don't even start

To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
You just don't interest me
Oh, come on

You're a disgrace!
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Last time, now
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?1Embed
