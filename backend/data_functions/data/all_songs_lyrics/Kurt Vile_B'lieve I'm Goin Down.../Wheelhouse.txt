Wheelhouse Lyrics
Sometimes I talk too much but I gotta get it out
But I don’t wanna talk, I only wanna listen
My baby talks soft, my ears are always ringing now
Humming a sad song when I’m alone
But you gotta be alone to figure things out sometimes
Be alone, when even in a crowd of friends and not so
Sometimes of whom you just can’t distinguish but
Thank god for the former, yeah

Some bow down a hundred times a day or more
To find a way, to get back down to the temple one day
Find the temple, to bask in the glory of
Roll around on a floor of furry carpet then
Sleep soundly for the first time in forever and
Breathing deep inside

There’s a desert down below the earth’s core
A hidden staircase in the house that you reside in
A little something from the cupboard over there
A little medicine, it’s a medication situation

Some bow down a hundred times a day or more
To find a way, to get back down to the temple one day
Find the temple, to bask in the glory of
Roll around on a floor of furry carpet then
Sleep soundly for the first time in forever and
Breathing deep inside1Embed
