Stand Inside Lyrics
Don’t talk to me
Just walk to me
Understand
Sure I’m your man
Do what I can
But don’t stand by my side
Stand inside

That’s my good girl
My whole world
Turning on the couch
Close that cute mouth
And kiss me

Like all the pretty things you see outside
Imma gonna make you satisfied
All the silly things inside my mind
Imma gonna make you satisfied
Imma gonna pick on my guitar
Baby 'til we fill the fruit jar
We gonna live in a house together
With me on the couch and my guitar, singing
“Oh my god I love you, I love you”
And if I’m not dead
North Country, your Scarborough faded
Every window everywhere I go
You spy on me
Keep me unlonely

Like all the pretty things you see outside
Imma gonna make you satisfied, and
All the silly things inside my mind
Imma gonna make you satisfied
Imma gonna pick on my guitar
Baby 'til we fill the fruit jar
We gonna live in a house together
With me on the couch and my guitar, singing
“Oh my god, I love ya, I love ya”Embed
