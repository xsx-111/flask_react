Wild Imagination Lyrics
I’m looking at you
But it’s only a picture so I take that back
But it ain’t really a picture
It’s just an image on a screen
You can imagine if I was though, right?
Just like I can imagine you can imagine it, can’t you?
I got a wild imagination

Give it some time 
Give ya some time 

I’m laughing out loud
So much it appears that I’m crying babe, yes
Come out on the porch, mama
I’ll tell you about my past
There’s believers and lovers
And druggers and dreamers
And drunkards and schemers
And I’m afraid that I am feeling much too many feelings
Simultaneously, at such a rapid clip
