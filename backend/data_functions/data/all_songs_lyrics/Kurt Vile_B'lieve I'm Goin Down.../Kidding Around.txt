Kidding Around LyricsWalking on the straight and narrow
Straight between your eyes comes an arrow
Blood all over the house you reside in
But it's all an illusion
On vacation at the seashore
By the bay but far away
Inside your mind has been unkind
It brings along your brain you think
What's the meaning of this song
And what's this piece of wood
I don't care it sounds so pretty
It's change is so sublime
What was the meaning of that last line
But I'm just kidding around over here
Oooooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooooo
Ain't it funny when others try to tell you what you're trying to do
But I'm all ears, clearly, have you not been listening to my pretty song
Walking on the straight and narrow
Straight between your eyes comes an arrow
Blood all over the house you reside in
But it's all an illusion
Walking on the rocky brawlway
Forget what I was trying to say
Now I know one way to kill me
Way to go KV
Hey can I hear me?
But I'm just kidding around over here
Oooooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooooo
OoooooooooooooooEmbed
