Life Like This Lyrics
Wanna live, wanna live, live a life like mine
Well I been doin’ it, baby all the time
To do so you gotta roll with the punches
Jump from the sweetest to the toughest of tough love
Maybe you think I’m a talking tube
Baby try playing, that’s all I really ever wanna do
You didn’t hear me right, oh yeah

That’s right I wanna live, live
A life like this, yeah
You wish

Wanna live, wanna live
A life like mine
Ay baby, well, get in line
Ready to take a life test
What it is, is it is the best
Maybe you don’t hear me talking strange
Well, hang on you better wait
Maybe you didn’t hear me right
Well it’s up and down and out of sight
Do you got what it takes?
Well, I think you might

Wanna live, wanna live
A life like mine
Well I been doin’ it, baby all the time
To do so you gotta roll with the punches
Jump from the sweetest to the toughest of tough love
Maybe you don’t hear me talking strange
Well hold on, you better wait
Maybe you must think that I’m talking crooked
Well, that’s all good
Wanna live, wanna live
A life like some
Young and dumb and full of
“come on over to my house - there’s a party goin’ on here” all the time
Wanna live, wanna live
A life like mine
Eh, you wish
Eh, you wish
Eh, you wish
Eh, you wish
Wanna live, wanna live
Live a life like mine
Well I been doin’ it, baby all the time
To do so you gotta roll with the punches
Jump from the sweetest to the toughest of tough love
Well it’s up and down and out of sight
Have you got what it takes?
Well, I think you mightEmbed
