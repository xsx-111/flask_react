Pretty Pimpin Lyrics
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom

I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
But it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around, and I said
"Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"

All he ever wanted
Was to be someone in life that was just like
All I want is to just have fun
Live my life like a son of a gun
I could be one thousand miles away
But still mean what I say

Then I woke up one morning
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to not comb some stranger’s hair
Never was my style
But I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
'Cause it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around, and I said
“Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?”
But he was sporting all my clothes
I gotta say, pretty pimpin'

All he ever wanted was to be a man
But he was always
A little too cute to be admitted under "marbles lost"
He was always a thousand miles away
While still standing in front of your face

Then he woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
Then laughed and said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom

And I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
'Cause it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around, and I said
“Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?”
But he was sporting all my clothes
I gotta say, pretty pimpin'
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror20Embed
