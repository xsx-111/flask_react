Dust Bunnies LyricsYou may think that it's funny now
That I got a headache like a shop vac coughin' dust bunnies
It's hard to see when it's all red
And all you hear are just white noises
This little one, she's a delicate creature
No safety features to hold her down
Girl, you've been runnin' on all cylinders
Pull in the yard and cut it hard
But no they won't find us lying down on the ground
And it ain't at the bar where I am or you are
We'll take a puff on a cigarette, see what we get
An invigorating fix and a black lung
Don't know much about history and
Don't know much about the shape I'm in
There ain't no manual to our minds
We're always lookin', baby, all the time
But no we won't find it rollin' around on the ground
And it ain't at the bar where I am, where you are
I took a puff on the cigarette, saw what I get
An invigorating fix and a black lung
You think you're tired? Put your face in my place
We swap faces and I see you're tired
It's hard to think with a squashed brain and
Let's hope that don't leave a permanent stain
How can you talk over all that racket?
What's there to feel but totally whacked?
But we don't got time to wallow around in it
Though it don't look so far away from where we are
I wanna put out the cigarette, leave it behind
Hold you real close, take you by the hand
We'll walk away
Walk awayEmbed
