Lost My Head There Lyrics
Lost my head there
Lost my head there
Lost my head there
Lost my head there
I don’t wanna sit around, walk around today
I’d much rather levitate

I was buggin' out 'bout a couple-two-three things
Picked up my microphone and started to sing
I was feeling worse than the words come out
Fell on some keys, and this song walked outta me

Lost my head
Yes, that's how we like it there
Lost my head there
I don’t wanna talk about it, yell about it, oh no
Me, I just wanna sing about it

Lost my head there for a second
Had a little funky psychosis - oh sweet relief!
I don’t wanna sit around and walk around at all today
So I gone went ahead and just levitated
Lost my head there, whoops!
Lost my head there again
Didn’t wanna mess around, look around at all of it
But then I did thoughEmbed
