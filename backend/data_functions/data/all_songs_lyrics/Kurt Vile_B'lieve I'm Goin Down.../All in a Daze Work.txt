All in a Daze Work Lyrics
Chinese charms and well-tanked in Burbank
Strumming unsuccessfully but moreso just pressin' keys and
Hey Jack of diamonds all jack of horse
Hey man I believe I'm floating and off course of course
Guess I got my mind well twisted didn’t I, well…

All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a… all in a… all in a daze work

She come flying through like a traveling gypsy show tornado
Leaving us lying there bleedin’
Cut wide open, hearts broken
Guess I got my mind well twisted didn’t I, well…
Chorus
All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a daze work, and
All in a… all in a… all in a daze workEmbed
