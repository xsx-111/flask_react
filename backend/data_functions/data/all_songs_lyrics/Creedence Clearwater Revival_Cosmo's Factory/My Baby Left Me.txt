My Baby Left Me Lyrics
Yes, my baby left me, never said a word
Was it something I done, something that she heard?
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me, never said a word

But I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me and never said goodbye
Help, little boy

Well now, one of these mornings, Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and, baby, Daddy will I know
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me and never said a word

Lord, I stand at my window, wring my hands and moan
All I know is that is one I love is gone
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me and never said goodbye

My baby even left me, never said goodbyeEmbed
