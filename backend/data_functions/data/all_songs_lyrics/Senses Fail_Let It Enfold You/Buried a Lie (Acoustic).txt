Buried a Lie (Acoustic) Lyrics

Rest in peace girl, your death is such a shame
The paper said a bullet got in your way
But I call foul play, possible poisoning
I had to bring you in for questioning

I went to your grave, dug up your body
Brought it to my house where you lay

So let's play doctor, babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case for me

I headed downtown to show what I had found
It's not a suicide it's a crime
I have a witness, extremely evident
There had to be someone else present

At the time of death, poison's in stomach
How could she pull it if she's dead?
So let's play doctor, babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case
We need a scalpel now
Under white lights you lay
We've got to hurry up
Before the flesh decays away, away

I'll catch the murderer
And send him away
I'll get the evidence
From your last day
Your last day, your last day

So let's play doctor, babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case
We need a scalpel now
Under white lights you lay
We've got to hurry up
Before the flesh decays awayEmbed
