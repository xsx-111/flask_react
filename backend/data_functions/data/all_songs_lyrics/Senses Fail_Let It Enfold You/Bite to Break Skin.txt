Bite to Break Skin Lyrics
So let me take this medicine
To quench my love for violent things
My swan song will
Be like a bullet laced in anger
As the razor cuts the soft spot on your heel
Each breath is getting slower
This war is getting harder to fight by myself
Sick waves of bitter fashion
Ripped down the shield that I have
Tears rain from above

Do you see the life I lead?
So follow me into the sun
And I will bleed the poisons dry

These bayonet scars never cease
To blind the light shed from the beast
And all we do is hate
Eyes shot from constant visions
Angels are rendered useless
Good has lost it's heart

Do you see the life I lead?
So follow me into the sun
And I will bleed the poisons dry
For you
For you

For you
For you
For you

Bite to break skin, don't give the secret
My stoic face, beaten with passion
The phoenix will die inside the fire storm
I am the son, follow my footsteps
Bite to break skin, don't give the secret
My stoic face, beaten with passion
The phoenix will die inside the fire storm
I am the son, follow my footsteps6Embed
