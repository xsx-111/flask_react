Choke on This Lyrics
Half smoked cigarettes and you're the trash that infests my sheets
Can't make a wife out of a whore, don't want your skin on me

And you're, you're addicted to the drug of lust
Detoxing the cold sweat of shame, and I love your pain

I'd give you these roses now but I'm left in the thorns
I'd rather hurt someone than hurt myself
I'll dispose of you like a lighter out of fuel
I'll lose you somewhere on a dusty shelf

So this love's been worn down like songs on a tape
The sex has lost all of it's fun like gum loses taste

And you're, you're addicted to the drug of lust
Detoxing the cold sweat of shame, and I love your pain

I'd give you these roses now but I'm left in the thorns
I'd rather hurt someone than hurt myself
I'll dispose of you like a lighter out of fuel
I'll lose you somewhere on a shelf
I'm here lying in your bed babe
Remember what you said to me?
"You can be my James Dean, I'll be your sweet queen."
I said that you were my first
But you weren't even close now
Like a frame in a movie you're just one of many
Can you grant me one last wish?
Play russian roulette as we kiss
I'll be your cheap novelty
Blow your brains out on me

I'd give you these roses now but I'm left in the thorns
I'd rather hurt someone than hurt myself
I'll dispose of you like a lighter out of fuel
I'll lose you somewhere on the shelf6Embed
