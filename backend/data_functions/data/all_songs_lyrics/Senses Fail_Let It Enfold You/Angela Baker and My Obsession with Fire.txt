Angela Baker and My Obsession with Fire Lyrics
I won't forget the day that, that I came to
And I started thinking that there's more
Than just perfect prom queens and silver spoons
And all I ever wanted was someone to

Knock me back to the bliss of ignorance
Because I feel like running head first into traffic

And so I'm here to say
That thoughts in bed with pain

I won't forget the day that, that I found God
In a kitchen knife now and on my arm
So paint the pale white floor with, with my red life
And tell myself this pain is the pain I love

As I swallow the pills of happiness
And you watch me fall like New York in an earthquake

And so I'm here to say
That thoughts in bed with pain
I stand outside my pretty house
I light a match to start the fire
I call the cops to let 'em know
It's 22 Walthery Ave
I thought I wanted this
I thought I wanted this
I'm here to say
I said I wanted some more attention
I thought I wanted a story ending
I love the pain, I hate the pain
I just give in

I love the pain, I hate the pain
I think that the truth is I'm scared
I think that I'm just scared to live
I think that the truth is I'm scared
I think that the truth is I'm everything that I hate1Embed
