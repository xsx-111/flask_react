Tie Her Down Lyrics
So love me gently with a chainsaw
And take the glass against your wrists
You know I am your worst nightmare
Oh how you love my bloody kiss
But it's time to die
You're worth more dead

Tell me your fantasies
I'll make you believe
That I really care
I'll look into your eyes
I'll tell you all my lies
As I take you slow

So love me gently with a chainsaw
I'll leave you like your father did
And I'll bite your lip so fucking, so hard
And watch the innocence just drip
Down your chest
And into my mouth

Tell me your fantasies
I'll make you believe
That I really care
I'll look into your eyes
I'll tell you all my lies
As I take you slow
So take your tears and go away
So take your tears and go away
A bitter ending from a slow decay
So take your tears and go away
And I'll sit here with a smile and a match

The lies, she cried, the heartache
The lies, she cried, the heartache
The lies, she cried, the heartache
The lies, she cried, the heartache4Embed
