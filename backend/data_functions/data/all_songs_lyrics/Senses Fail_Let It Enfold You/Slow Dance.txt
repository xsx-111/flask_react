Slow Dance Lyrics
If you pull too hard
Then the string will break
And if you leave it slack
Then the string won't hold

So how can we find ourselves
Trapped in our own private hells
Where we just scream but no one can hear?
X marks the spot where the dig begins
The treasure is found within
The broken hearts that are soaked with fear

Fill the glass to the brim
And it will spill out
And keep on sharpening the knife
Sharpened it well
It will be so blunt

So how can we find ourselves
Trapped in our own private hells
Where we just scream but no one can hear?
X marks the spot where the dig begins
The treasure is found within
The broken hearts that are soaked with fear
So be at one with all your life
So how can we find ourselves
Trapped in our own private hells
Where we just scream but no one can hear?
So how can we find ourselves?
Trapped in our own private hells
Where we just scream but no one can hear
X marks the spot where the dig begins
The treasure is found within
The broken hearts that are soaked with fear
Don't try too hard to understand
Or you'll miss the, miss the point at hand2Embed
