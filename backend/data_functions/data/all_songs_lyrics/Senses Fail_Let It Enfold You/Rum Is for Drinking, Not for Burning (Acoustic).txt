Rum Is for Drinking, Not for Burning (Acoustic) Lyrics
This captain goes down with the ship
All hands on deck, stand hip to hip
I shout the order, "Shoot to kill"
I'm dressed to thrill, I'm dressed to thrill
And all my enemies I want their eyes to see
Their captain walk the plank
Destroy them rank by rank

Sail with me into the setting sun
The battle has been won
But war has just begun
And as we grow, emotion starts to die
We need to find a way just to keep our desire alive

Now set the sails to quarter mast
We'll jump the ship, we'll sink them fast
Men follow me to victory
Red as the sea, red as the sea
And to the cannon's roar
Their bodies dance ashore
A pirate's life for me
I won't go quietly


And to my damsel in distress
You've made a mess of your new dress
You've made a mess of your new dress
You've made a mess
