Martini Kiss Lyrics
There's poison in my drinking glass
Don't stop, just sip it down
And in a swirling masquerade of sound
My body hits the ground
I'm beautiful when I'm asleep
Martini kisses land
On my blistered bloody scarlet lips
The bottle's in my hand

Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away

I'll speak in riddles so you can understand
I'll draw in pencil so you can trace with pen
So in love with me like sand to wet feet
I'll write both our names into the wet concrete

We're glistening like silver spoons
Beneath the summer night
Oh, can you smell the subtle hint of frost
As the flowers start to cry?
The autumn winds are bringing graves
To all the emerald trees
They're so beautiful in their dismay
The colors slowly bleed
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away

I'll speak in riddles so you can understand
I'll draw in pencil so you can trace with pen
So in love with me like sand to wet feet
I'll write both our names into the wet concrete

The pawns will fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
The king's at his checkmate
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
And I sit here with a sick grin
Choking as I laugh until I die

Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away2Embed
