God Bless The Child Lyrics
Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible says
And it still is news

My Mama may have and my Papa may have
But God bless the child who's got his own
Who's got his own

Now the rich get rich
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade

My Mama may have and my Papa may have
But God bless the child who's got his own
Who's got his own

Woah!
Money, you have lots of friends
Hanging around your door
But when it's gone and the spending ends
You don't come hanging 'round no more
Rich relations give crust of bread and such
You can help yourself but don't take too much
My Mama may have and my Papa may have
But God bless the child who's got his own
Who's got his ownEmbed
