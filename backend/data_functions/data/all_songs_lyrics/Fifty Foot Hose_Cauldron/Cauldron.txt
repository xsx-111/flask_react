Cauldron Lyrics
Cauldron of sorrows
Burning and bubbling
Boiling and burning
Senses breathing
Conscience seething
Shoulder shrugging
Seekers shoving
Seeking something forgotten

Steaming
Searing
Sounds slither
Sordid
Sultry

Simmer
Shouting
Shrieking
Sharing

Softly
Subtle

Synthetic sorrow
Selfish sorrow

Something
Sad
Seeming
Cauldron of sorrows
Burning and bubbling
Boiling and burning
Senses scalding
Intentions falter
Burning alters
Alters burning
Sacrificing
Sympathizing
Synthesizing
Cauterizing
Cauldron rising
Structure melting
Blending with its own creation...

Fearing
Hearing
Sounds of death
Smelling
Felling rounds of lead
Drilling
Filling
Martyr's head
Sending
Rending
Desire
Degradation
Infiltration
Sorrow's nation
Tomorrow's elation
Today's fascination
Tomorrow's sorrow
Today's sorrow
Sadistic sorrow
Synthetic sorrow
Selfish sorrow
Cauldron
Cauldron
Cauldron of sorrows
Melting tomorrows
By being todayEmbed
