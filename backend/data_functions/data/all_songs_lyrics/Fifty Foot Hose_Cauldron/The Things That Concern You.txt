The Things That Concern You LyricsI love you
I love you
I love you, you
Please love me too
I love you
I love you
I love you, you
Please love me too
The things that I do, now
They don't concern you, now
I'm just trying to free my mind
Please don't be setting
In front of me regretting
Things that I do
Don't please you
My thoughts are so complicated
But I don't want to trade them
Please don't think
I want your mind
I'm just tryin' to be kind, now
Please keep communication clear
I won't hurt you
So please don't fear
The things that I do
They don't concern you, now
I'm just trying to free my mind

The things that I do, now
They don't concern you, now
I'm just trying to free my mind
I love you
I love you
I love you, you
Please love me too
I love you
I love you
I love you, you
Please love me too
