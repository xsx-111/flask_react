If Not This Time Lyrics
Since time forgot
To turn the lock
And let me enter
My soul is deft
And trained in theft
So I will slither
Under, through, around the cracks
Tiny seams, no door locks

If not this time
Maybe the next

Since light neglected
To be reflected
And let me see
My soul has glasses
Perceives the passes
That should wither
Piercing through, around the haze
Pillared clouds drift away

If not this time
Maybe the next

Since love's rejection
Destroyed perception
And left me free
My soul eroded
My brain imploded
Down to cinders
Growing new senses to feel
Seeing, hearing all that is real

If not this time
Maybe never...1Embed
