Red The Sign Post LyricsRed the signpost in the snow
What direction do we go
What is right, What is wrong
There is no sleeping all night long
Gather the patriots, like days of old
Have no regrets soon the bodies are cold
Red on left, red on right
I'll get this cauldron for the fight
Pick a side, don't be wrong
There is no sleeping all night long
Gather the patriots, like days of old
Have no regrets soon the bodies are cold
Red the color, blood on the wall
I do this cauldron for the fall
Shield is heavy sword is long
There is no sleeping all night long
Gather the patriots, like days of old
Have no regrets soon the bodies are coldEmbed
