Rose LyricsSet in plastic for all to see
But not so drastic as it should be
And even though it lay exposed
No one may ever
No one may ever
No one may ever, smell the rose
Ooh wah wah wah wah
Ooh wah wah wah wah
Set in bodies of glass and steel
You may envision but cannot feel
And in the tank it looks exposed
No one may ever
No one may ever
No one may ever, smell the rose
Hiding, from your senses
At least, the ones that count
Hiding, to protect you
As lust and desire
I lay exposed
In one sense
Your mind rejects the rest
From a draining may not be the best
Under filters of polar glass
It may not glitter but let it pass
And even though it lay exposed
No one may ever
No one may ever
No one may ever, smell the roseEmbed
