Down in the Park Lyrics
Down in the park where the machmen
Meet the machines and play Kill by Numbers
Down in the park with a friend called Five
I was in a car crash or was it the war?
But I've never been quite the same
Little white lies like I was there

Come to Zom-Zom's, a place to eat
Like it was built in one day
You can watch the humans trying to run
Oh look, there's a rape machine
I'd go outside if it'd look the other way
You wouldn't believe the things they do

Down in the park
Where the chant is death, death, death
Until sun cries morning
Down in the park with friends of mine
We are not lovers, we are not romantics
We are here to serve you
A different face but the words never change5Embed
