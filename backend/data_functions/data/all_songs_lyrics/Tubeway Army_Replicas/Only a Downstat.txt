Only a Downstat LyricsOnly a downstat, personality problem
He would say things like "I love you" and cry real tears
Met him in some place like a home for old mothers
Where the cure is always death but no one ever leaves
He wore a number seven badge on his collar
He would show it with pride and say, "It means I can feel"
He'd bribe the warders to send letters to someone
Who didn't even know his name but said she'd read them anyway
Plus seven deviant writes poetry for people
Who deny he's alive and said, "I'll mention that name"
A violator of the law of no feelings
They should be put in the chair until their eyes dilate
If you have reasons, I might sell you my time
I'll leave it under the stairs in a body of mine
Old memories are slowly fading out of me
We are the unknowns, we are all you need1Embed
