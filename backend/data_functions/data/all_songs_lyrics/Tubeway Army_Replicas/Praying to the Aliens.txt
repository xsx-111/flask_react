Praying to the Aliens LyricsSlowly the thought, "There is no one to replace"
Came into view and he began to cry
Now only boys that love only boys
The perfect picture of a boy/girl age
I'm praying to the aliens
I'm praying to the aliens
Grey overcoat and he could be anyone
A random poll check, "Do you ever think of women?"
They broke him down into a torn old queen
Living somewhere between dead and dying
Well, I'm praying to the aliens
I'm praying to the aliens
There are no more, do you begin to see?
The corner of my eye could give me away
Isn't it strange how times change?
I can't imagine living any other way
I'm praying to the aliens
I'm praying to the aliens
I'm praying to the aliens
I'm praying to the aliens1Embed
