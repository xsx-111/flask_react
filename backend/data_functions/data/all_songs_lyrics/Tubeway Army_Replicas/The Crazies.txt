The Crazies LyricsHere in my room, where the paint dries like your face
I'm still confusing love with need
Tonight at 10, I'll cry for a while
They'll get me for sure, it's just a question of time
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
Some things I do, I feel so ashamed
But I have run out of points of view
The man is a thinker who thought that he died
Just sits in the corner looking somewhat surprised
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
I only exterminate in my spare time
I fight the machine for the passers by
I know I'm wrong, but what makes you right?
The simple solution is to end it all
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
We're the crazies
We're the crazies1Embed
