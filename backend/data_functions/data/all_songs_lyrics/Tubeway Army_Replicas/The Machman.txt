The Machman LyricsI saw him turn on like a machine in the park
Saying, "Please come with me", but you've been there before
I saw him whir away into the night
Like a nightmare on wheels saying, "Never again"
I'd give it all up for you
I'd even be a number just for you
The strangest living boy you could ever wish to see
"That's me"
Yellowed newspapers tell the story of someone
"Do you know this man?", tomorrow the cure
Only police ever see night time for real
Turn on the light and cry, "No more, no more"
I was standing outside your door
Waiting for the grey men to go
When my mind turned on me with a vengeance I had never known
My own
Everyone heard the voice on the radio
Saying, "Why move around and waste my time?"
There are no independents anymore
The tape is a circle but who really cares?
I saw you behind the wall
I even heard you laugh at me
You disgust me tonight with your answer to something new
That's you1Embed
