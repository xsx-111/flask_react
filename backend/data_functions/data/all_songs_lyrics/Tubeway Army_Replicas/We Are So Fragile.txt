We Are So Fragile LyricsWe are so fragile
Advertising lies that are whiter than yours
We are so fragile
They could give us a war just to keep us amused
We are so fragile
I could stay here inside and say it's all been done
We are so fragile
Just pretend I never tried, I'll leave it up to you
We are still so young
And it must be wrong but I'd do it all the same
We are really so shy
There's nothing I can do except believe in you
We could always go home
But everyone says this is the place to be
We are so unnatural
But you wouldn't understand, you only deal with men1Embed
