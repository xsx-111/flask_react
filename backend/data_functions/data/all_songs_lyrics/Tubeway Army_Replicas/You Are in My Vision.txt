You Are in My Vision LyricsFade to scenes of violence like a TV screen but silent
Where the victims are all paid by the hour
Staring at the ceiling as she gyrates all around me
I am trying to forget she's done this all before
Far too many people for a quiet night with myself
Oh, I could be anyone tonight
Focus on a feeling I've detected while I'm sleeping
Sing a chorus of "On Broadway" and deny it all
You are in my vision
I can't turn my face
You are in my vision
I can't move my eyes
You are in my vision
I can't move at all
You are in my vision
Delicate bodies that decay beneath their clothing
Play cards in an empty house in Paris
The wreckage of a hero lies broken in a corner
And everyone pretends they like to live that way
You are in my vision
I can't turn my face
You are in my vision
I can't move my eyes
You are in my vision
I can't move at all
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
I can't turn my face
You are in my vision
I can't move my eyes
You are in my vision
I can't move at all
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
You are in my vision
You are in my vision1Embed
