Love Affair With Life Lyrics
You play a love affair with life
You stay and dance with every night
The moments from dawn to dusk
You chase
I am lost now
Where do I stand
In the race?
You play to empty eyes in crowded bars
I can't believe we've come this far yet got nowhere
What is there left for me in this?
Every time you play is your first kiss

I'm not a pass-time
I'm not your pass-time
Don't play around with me

You can't play me
I'm not a melody
Don't play 'round with me
Don't play 'round with me
'Cause I'm not a pass-time
I'm not your pass-time
Don't play around with me

You can't play me
I'm not a melody
I'm not a melody
I'm not a melody

You can't play me
I'm not a melodyEmbed
