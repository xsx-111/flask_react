Hi Friend! Lyrics
Are you receiving? Can you feel me?
The information that you're seeking
A sensation that is sneaking
Has you reaching for the ceiling
There's no fighting, the igniting
This reciting is inviting

All systems go out on the floor, this is what you came here for
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
All systems go out on the floor, this is what you came here for

Your mind is open, your thoughts are flying
To the bounce that's amplifying
Taking form as you're complying
Grab the notion, carry on replying
Adopt tension, embrace mention
True ascension, feeds retention

All systems go out on the floor, this is what you came here for
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
All systems go out on the floor, this is what you came here for
Are you receiving? Can you feel me?
The information that you're seeking
A sensation that is sneaking
Has you reaching for the ceiling
There's no fighting, the igniting
This reciting is inviting

All systems go out on the floor, this is what you came here for
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
