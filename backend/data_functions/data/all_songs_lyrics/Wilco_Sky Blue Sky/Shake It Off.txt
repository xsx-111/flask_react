Shake It Off Lyrics
Sunlight angles on
A wooden floor at dawn
A ceiling fan is on
Chopping up my dreams
What is left of them
I take to sleep again
Where I dare pretend
I'm more than I seem
Tears get triggered
Yours remind me
Of the ice melting in my glass
Finally full again
So
I listen for
Your lips to break apart
Into words

It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
When I'm awake enough
I'm going to shake it off
Shake it off
Hotels hold me
Thoughts arousing
So many hearts
Beating in one place
Like a giant
Beast with many souls
No
Just a body
Full of holes

It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
It definitely starts to spoil my heart
Somewhere there's a war
Sometimes there is art
When I'm awake enough
I'm going to shake it off
Shake it offEmbed
