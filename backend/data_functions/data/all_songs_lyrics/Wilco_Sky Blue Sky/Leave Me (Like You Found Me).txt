Leave Me (Like You Found Me) LyricsThat's when I knew you
You might be lonely too
That's what I wished for
Somebody just like you
To tell me what to do, honestly
And leave me like you found me
Can you believe it
I'm somebody just like you
Content with being blue, honestly
Leave me like you found me
I sit on the couch alone
Where you sit when I'm not home
And I feel so close to you
And down the city streets
People are climbing the trees
They're finally up off their knees
Honestly
You leave me like you found me
Can you leave me like you found meEmbed
