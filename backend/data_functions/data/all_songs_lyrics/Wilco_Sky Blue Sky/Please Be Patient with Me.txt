Please Be Patient with Me Lyrics
I should warn you
When I'm not well
I can't tell
Oh, there's nothing I can do
To make this easier for you

You're going to need to be patient with me

I'm this apple, this happening stone
When I'm alone
Oh, but my blessings get so blurred
At the sound of your words

Iâ€™m gonna need you to be patient with me

How can I warn you when my tongue turns to dust
Like we've discussed
It doesn't mean that I don't care
It means I'm partially there

You're going to need to be patient with meEmbed
