Walken Lyrics
I'm walking
All by myself
I was talking to myself about you
What am I going to do

I was singing
This song about you
I was thinking about singing
This song for you

The more I think about it
The more I know it's true
The more I think about it
The more I'm sure it's you
Honey I think you're just right
You're just right

I was walking
Like I said by myself
I was talking
To myself about you
Like I always do
