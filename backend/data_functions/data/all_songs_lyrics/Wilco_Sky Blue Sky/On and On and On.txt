On and On and On Lyrics
On and on and on we'll stay together yeah
On and on and on we'll be together yeah
You and I will try to stay together yeah
On and on and on we'll be together yeah

Please don't cry we're designed to die
Don't deny what's inside
On and on and on we'll stay together yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on

One day we'll disappear together in a dream
However short or long our lives are going to be
I will live in you or you will live in me
Until we disappear together in a dream

Please don't cry we're designed to die
You can't deny even the gentlest tide
On and on and on we'll be together yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on
We're going to try
Please don't cry
This world of words and meanings makes you feel
Outside
Something that you feel already
Deep inside
You've denied
Go ahead and cry

On and on and on we'll stay together yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on
You and I will stay together yeah
You and I will try to make it better yeah3Embed
