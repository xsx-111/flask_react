Curse of the Pharaohs Lyrics
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep

Well, don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

Now if you're breaking the seals
And disturbing the peace
Then you're starting up a curse
Bringing evil disease

Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

And the curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Or just destroying your future
Making it all shady
So don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on youEmbed
