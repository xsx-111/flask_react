Melissa Lyrics
I'm kneeling in front of the altar
Satan's cross upon the wall
Strange emptiness, a crystal ball between two candles
Melissa has entered another life

Melissa, you were mine
Melissa, you were the light

She was a witch
Why did they take you away?

Melissa, you were the queen of the night
Melissa, you were my light

I swear revenge on the priest
The priest must die
He must die in the name of Hell

Melissa, can you hear me?
Melissa, are you there?
Nothing is left outside at the stake
They've taken her away from me
(I think Melissa's still with us)2Embed
