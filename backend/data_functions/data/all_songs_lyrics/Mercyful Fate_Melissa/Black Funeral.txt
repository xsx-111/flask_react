Black Funeral Lyrics
Bring the black box to the altar
Now raise your hands and do the sign
All hail Satan, yes hail Satan
Lay down your swords, the evil star

It's a black funeral
She was a victim of my coven

Open the black box on the altar
Her blood is still hot, so let it out
Oh hail Satan, yes hail Satan
Now drink it, now drink, drink, forget that whore

It's a black funeral
She was a victim of my covenEmbed
