At the Sound of the Demon Bell Lyrics
Halloween is the night
The legend says the ghost will rise
On Halloween they can't redeem
A restless soul from an ancient scene
At the sound of the demon bell
Yes, everything will turn to Hell
Rise, rise, rise
It's Halloween
Rise The ghost will rise

Reconciled with the powers of darkness
He'll uncover a saint
You won't believe... See for yourself

I hear a bell
A sound from Hell, the demon bell
I see a lighting shadow in between the graves
Swinging his sword of hate towards the gates of Heaven
"Beelzebub, Astaroth
Bring me the Devil"
And as he says these words I can't believe my eyes
Upon a burning cross
The Lord Jesus, Satan's above
It must be a shame
To see the Lord falling again

Now rise, reconcile with the powers of darkness
Uncover a saint
You better believe or see for yourself1Embed
