Into the Coven Lyrics
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me
And meet our high priestess

Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross
And go to the middle of the ring

Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Now crush it
Crush the cross!

Suck the blood
From this unholy knife
Say after me:
My soul belongs to Satan
Now, now you're into my coven
You are Lucifer's child
Into the coven
Lucifer's childEmbed
