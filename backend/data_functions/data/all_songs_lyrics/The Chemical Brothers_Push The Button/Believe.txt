I needed to believe in something
I need you to believe in something
I needed to believe something
I need you to believe in something
I needed to believe
I needed to believe

I needed to believe in something
I need you to believe in something
I needed to believe something
I need you to believe in something
I needed to believe
I needed to believe

I needed to believe
I needed to believe
Oh

I'm moving in between
Can you feel me in between?
I'm moving in between
Can you feel me in between?
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I needed to believe
