Left Right Lyrics
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right
All my soldiers march (left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right)
All my people march (left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right)
All my soldiers march (left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right)
All my soldiers march with me (left, right, left, right)
All my soldiers march with me (left, right, left, right)
All my soldiers march with me (left, right, left, right)
All my soldiers march with me

He laid on his back, his firearms by his side
Hearin no sound, just watchin the fireworks in the sky
I walk by look down he still smiling 'cause he's done fightin'
A fallen soldier, now his war's over
Don't matter which side is wrong or right
Some innocent lives will be lost on the battlefield tonight
So hungry to kill, only his death can curb his appetite
Live ammo hit the flesh and it feels so right
I've embellished my life, now God please tell me is this what death's like?
, kept his innocence, heavy hearted spouse
Clingin on to anything intimate she can find around the house
What's the difference between Bush and Saddam?
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Osama Bin Laden or Idi Amin
Fidel Castro, it seems to me they on the same team
They hate only lead to innocent blood streams
If it's so important for us to fight for mankind
Well I don't see none of they kinfolk out there on the front line
And I'm a soldier
Right here hip-hop with my guns by my side
Ready to ride till I die and I'm a soldier
And you can see it in my eyes, even when the man dies
They say a soldier never cries and I'm a soldier
Until the day they take my life
All my soldiers march with me (left, right)
All my soldiers match with me (left, right)
I thought I told ya, this is the story of a soldier

Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Satnd up
Stand up
US, stand up
UK, stand up
France, stand up
Spain and Portugal, Germany stand up
Slovakia, stand up
China, stand up
Palestine, Kosovo, Ghetto World, stand up
This is a live nigga PSA
From the one and only ghetto bullhorn
Come to warn you: there's a war going on outside
And you can't run, you can't hide

Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left
All my soldiers march
Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left
All my people march
Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left
Ghetto funk march
Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left
Whole world march!
Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left
All my soldiers march
Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left
All my people march
Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left
Left, right, move, left, right, move, left, right, move, left1Embed
