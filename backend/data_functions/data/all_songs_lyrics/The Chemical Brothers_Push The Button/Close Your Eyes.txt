Close Your Eyes Lyrics
In your eyes I can see that you're cracking up
In your eyes I can see that you've had enough
And it pains my head
In your eyes I can see that you're cracking up
In your eyes I can see that you fell in love
And it pains my head

(What if all that was)
In your eyes I can see that you're cracking up
And it pains my head
(What if all that was)
In your eyes I can see that you fell in love
And it pains my head
What if all that was (In your eyes I can see)
Coming to me
And it pains my head
What if all that was (In your eyes I can see)
Coming to me
And it pains my head

I'm in this love I'm in
I'm in this love, I'm in this love
I'm in this love I'm in
I'm in this love, I'm in this love
Should I walk, should I wait (Till I'm ready you're on, until I'm ready you're on now)
Will I find...love is in the hands, I don't know your name
(Till I'm ready you're on, until I'm ready you're on now)
Should I walk, should I wait (Till I'm ready you're on, until I'm ready you're on now)
Will I find...love is in the hands, I don't know your name
(Till I'm ready you're on, until I'm ready you're on now)
