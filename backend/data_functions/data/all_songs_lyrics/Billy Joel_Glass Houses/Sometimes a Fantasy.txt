Sometimes a Fantasy Lyrics
Oh, I didn't want to do it, but I got too lonely
Mmm, I had to call you up in the middle of the night
I know it's awful hard to try to make love long distance (ah, ah, ah)
But I really needed stimulation
Though it was only my imagination

It's just a fantasy (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not the real thing (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's just a fantasy (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not the real thing (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Sometimes a fantasy (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Is all you need, oh

When am I gonna take control, get ahold of my emotions?
Why does it only seem to hit me in the middle of the night?
You told me there's a number I can always dial for assistance (ah, ah, ah)
I don't want to deal with outside action
Only you can give me satisfaction

It's just a fantasy (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not the real thing (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's just a fantasy (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not the real thing (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Sometimes a fantasy (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is all you need, oh
1:48 - 2:15

Oh, sure it would be better if I had you here to hold me
Be better baby, but believe me, it's the next best thing
I'm sure there's many times you've wanted me to hear your secrets
Don't be afraid to say the words that'll move me
Anytime you want to tell them to me

It's just a fantasy (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not the real thing (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's just a fantasy (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's not the real thing (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Sometimes a fantasy (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is all you need

It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)
It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)
It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)
It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)
It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)
It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
Ah!
I've got blisters on my blisters!Embed
