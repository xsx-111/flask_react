In My Room LyricsIn my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Each day's just like the last
For I lived in the past
In my room
Where every night is the same
I play a dangerous game
I keep pretending he's late
And I sit and I wait
Over there is the picture
We took when he made me his bride
Over there is the chair where
He held me whenever I cried
Over there by the window
The flowers he left
Have all died
In my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit at I stare at the wall
Hating how lonely I've grown
All alone
In my roomEmbed
