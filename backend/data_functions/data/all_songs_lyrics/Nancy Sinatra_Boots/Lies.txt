Lies LyricsLies, lies
You're telling me that you'll be true
Lies, lies
That's all I ever get from you
Tears, tears
I shed a million tears for you
Tears, tears
And now you're loving somebody new
Someday I'm gonna be happy
I don't know when just now
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
You think that you're such a smart boy
And I'll believe what you say
Who do you think you are boy'
To lead me on this way-way
Lies, lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
I'm gonna make you sad someday
Someday you're gonna be lonely
And you won't find me around
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
Someday I'm gonna be happy
I don't know when just now
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
You think that you're such a smart boy
And I'll believe what you say
Who do you think you are boy'
To lead me on this way-way
Lies, lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
I'm gonna make you sad someday
Someday you're gonna be lonely
And you won't find me around
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
Lies, you're breaking my heart
Man you're breaking my heartEmbed
