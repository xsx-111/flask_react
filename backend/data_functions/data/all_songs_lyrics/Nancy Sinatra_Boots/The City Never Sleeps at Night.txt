The City Never Sleeps at Night LyricsOld men, young men
Preachers saying "Amen"
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come the city never sleeps at night?
Red cars, blue cars
Payment overdue cars
Cops with indigestion
Millionaires and some bums
How come the city never sleeps at night?
The city never sleeps at night
Short girls, tall girls
Happy that they're all girls
Walking with tonightâ€™s love
Holding hands and then some
How come the city never sleeps at night?
Good guys, bad guys
Winning-placed and show guys
Losers with their hands out
Pigeons begging breadcrumbs
How come the city never sleeps at night?
The city never sleeps at night
Long nights, short nights
Big hellos and goodnights
Dreams and conversation
Not a single ho-hum
How come the city never sleeps at night?
Old men, young men
Preachers saying "Amen"
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come the city never sleeps at night?1Embed
