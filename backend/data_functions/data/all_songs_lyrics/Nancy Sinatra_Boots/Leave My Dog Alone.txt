Leave My Dog Alone LyricsOoh, people, won't you leave my dog alone
People, won't you leave my dog alone
All he ever did was wag his tail
People why did you have
To throw my dog in jail ?
People, won't you leave my dog alone
Hey, people, won't you leave my cat alone
People, won't you leave my cat alone
He never said a bad word
No, not him !
Why to throw him in the river
People, he can't swim
Ooh! People, won't you leave my cat alone
Now, people, won't you leave this girl alone
I said, people, won't you leave this girl alone
I know exactly where it's at for me
Just let me be the way I wanna be, yea
People, won't you leave this girl aloneEmbed
