I Move Around LyricsI've seen the Golden Gate at San Francisco Bay
I've seen the Empire State and walked down old Broadway
I've seen those Northern Lights in some Alaskan town
Since I saw you with her I move, I move around
I've seen a movie star at Hollywood and Vine
I've seen the Zanzibar and heard the Big Ben chime
I've seen the Eiffel and I've been in new Cape Town
Since I saw you with her I move, yeah, I move around
I've seen a matador in Barcelona cry
I've seen old Singapore, the bridge on River Kwai
I've seen the Mardi Gras and been in one-horse towns
Since I saw you with her I move, Baby I move around
I keep movin' around
I keep on movin' aroundEmbed
