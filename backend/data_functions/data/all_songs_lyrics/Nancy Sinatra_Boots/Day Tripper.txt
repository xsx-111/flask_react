For taking the easy way out, now

He took me half the way there
He's a big teaser
He took me half the way there, now
He was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

He only played one night stands
I tried to please him
He only played one night stands, now
He was a day tripper
Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found outEmbed
