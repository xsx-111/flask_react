Terrible Certainty LyricsDie!
Slowly you're dying
From this contagious disease
Once you're infected there's no hope of a cure
Your passing is a sure thing
Your thoughts are empty and hopeless
Nothing is left for you now
Having to live with this terrible certainty
Praying is all you can do
It's vicious and crippling
And slowly your life will end
But how long will it take
To save us from the plague?
With fatal convulsions
The plague is reaching for us
God knows... What will it take
To save us from the plague?
Contracted by blood
The virus can be in all of us
You're one of it's victims, but then thousands more
And they will not be the last
So many civilizations before
The mighty, the proud and the brave
The poor, the rich - indiscriminate
Soon they will end in the grave
It's vicious and crippling
And slowly your life will end
But how long will it take
To save us from the plague?
With fatal convulsions
The plague is reaching for us
God knows... What will it take
To save us from the plague?
It's vicious and crippling
And slowly your life will end
But how long will it take
To save us from the plague?
With fatal convulsions
The plague is reaching for us
God knows... What will it take
To save us from the plague?Embed
