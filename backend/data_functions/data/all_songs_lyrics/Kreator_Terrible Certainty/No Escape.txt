No Escape LyricsTreacherous without compassion
You sought expression through them all
Sadistic and perverted urges
Dictated they had to fall
Spent your youth in reformatories
Where you're hate grew day by day
Molested and subjugated
Satisfying them in their way
Victim of your drives
Personification of insanity
No escape 
You can't control the instincts inside
Never, there is no escape
You feel no guilt for what you've done
You never thought it was a crime
Following you're nature
There was never malice meant that time
Can't understand the hate against you
Can't they see that you were right?
You must obey those powerful feelings
Coming from inside
Victim of your drives
Personification of insanity
No escape i
You can't control the instincts inside
Never, there is no escape
Let me live my own life
Leave me be, let me satisfy my drives
I don't care what they feel
When I was young no-one ever cared about me
Treacherous without compassion
You sought expression through them all
Sadistic and perverted urges
Dictated they had to fall
It makes no difference who you...
It won't change - you will see
So many lives lost, psychopath
Cured you'll never beEmbed
