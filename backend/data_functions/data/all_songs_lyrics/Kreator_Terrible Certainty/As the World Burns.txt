As the World Burns LyricsThe war is here
The future stops
Existence ends
Apocalypse will take our lives
One by one
As cities fall
As cultures die
As hope for survival
Turns into nothingness for us

Await your fate
You know there is nothing to save us now
Mankind never learns
Controlled by violent brains
The population has to pay
Doomsday has returned
As the world burns
Try to run, try to scream
It's too late
Megatons of death await to explode
To clear away
Fire and Pain
Now the time has come to destroy the planet Earth
Await your fate
You know there is nothing to save us now
Mankind never learns
Controlled by violent brains
The population has to pay
Doomsday has returned
As the world burns

Await your fate
You know there is nothing to save us now
Mankind never learns
Controlled by violent brains
The population has to pay
Doomsday has returned
As the world burnsEmbed
