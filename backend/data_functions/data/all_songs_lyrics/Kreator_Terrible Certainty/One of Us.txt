One of Us LyricsSee the sun for the last time
Remember - make your will before you come to this place
Choose your weapons and I'll take mine
Me or you, no-one knows, we stare into death's face
Hit him right between the eyes
Only one of us will leave this place alone
One of us!
One of us!
Beg for mercy and I'll spit at you
Say goodbye to everything and everyone you loved
A violent death is what you have to face
I'm here to terminate, your soul will rise above
Hit him right between the eyes
Only one of us will leave this place alone
One of us!
One of us!
Now take ten steps and turn
Today there's no return
You've got only one try
Today one of us will die
Sweat is running down your neck
As you wait for my attack
Your final minute draws near
You won't feel pain as you die
Hit him right between the eyes
Only one of us will leave this place alone
One of us!
One of us!
I'm the one who leaves this place alive (see above...)Embed
