Toxic Trace LyricsPesticide in torrents, how fast it flows
Total pollution the earth can't stand much longer
Chemical industry brings new diseases
The fear of self-destruction is growing stronger
Nuclear waste in an uncontrolled deluge
Reduces the earth to an airless planet
Reformation lies far away
Now is your only chance to save it

Contamination in every place
Condemn the human race
Everything will decay
Broken down by toxic trace
New plagues have come and soon there'll be more
Apocalypse not for the first time
Suppression is alive and that's for sure
Everyone will be annihilated
Enforcement of the last eclipse
Can't ignore predictions from the past
Ignore the warnings of ancient Prophets
Every minute of your life could be your last

Contamination in every place
Condemn the human race
Everything will decay
Broken down by toxic trace
Metamorphoses of the earth to a lifeless desert
Voracity for richness, ruin of Mankind
Craving more and more, to the world's Requiem
This is the earth's last century
Now depravation from things that count
To make an easier life for me
Total confusions for the non-believers
Who ignore the writings on the wall
Times of suffering for everyone
No-one can hide from reality
Social injustice will be no more
Without exception, devastate all
Times have changed from the past to now
The earth is mankind's subject
Perfect creation stands over all
Experimenting with lethal objects
Domination, submission, demand for more
De-humanizes the brains of the rulers
What gives them the right to menace us all
This time will come but then it will be too late

Contamination in every place
Condemn the human race
Everything will decay
Broken down by toxic traceEmbed
