Crazy = Genius Lyrics
You can set yourself on fire (Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire,(Hey!)

She said, "At night, in my dreams
You dance on a tightrope of weird
Oh, but when I wake up
You're so normal that you just disappear
You're so straight like commuters
With briefcases towing the line
There's no residue of a torturer
Inside of your eyes"

She said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson"
Said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Brian Wilson"

And I said
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)
I'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
(Hey!)

She said, "Darlin', you know
How the wine plays tricks on my tongue
But you don't seem to change
When you stuff all of your feelings with drugs"
Other boys you may have dated
Serrated your heart with a slice
But the cut of your love never hurts
Baby, it's a sweet butter knife

She said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson"
Said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Dennis Wilson"

And I said
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)
I'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
(Hey!)

You can set yourself on fire (Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire

And I said
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)
I'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...

You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
(Hey!)30Embed
