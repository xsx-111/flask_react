House of Memories Lyrics
Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid, the deeper that I go
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place, in your house of memories

Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

I think of you from time to time more than I thought I would
You were just too kind and I was too young to know
That's all that really matters, I was a fool
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me
Then will you remember me in the same way as I remember you?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories
(Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
In your house of memories
(Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
Promise me a place36Embed
