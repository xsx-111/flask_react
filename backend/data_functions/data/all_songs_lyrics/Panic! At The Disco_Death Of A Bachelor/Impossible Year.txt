Impossible Year Lyrics
There's no sunshine, this impossible year
Only black days and sky grey and clouds full of fear
And storms full of sorrow that won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons, this impossible year
There's no good times, this impossible year
Just a beachfront of bad blood and a coast that's unclear
All the guests at the party, they're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude, this impossible year
There's no you and me, this impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak and gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow,  the scar's souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise, this impossible year
There's never air to breathe, there's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on past the dream...
There's no sunshine...
There's no you and me...
There's no good times...
This impossible year...14Embed
