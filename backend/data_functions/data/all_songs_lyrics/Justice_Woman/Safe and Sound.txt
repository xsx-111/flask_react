Safe and Sound Lyrics
Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound
Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound1Embed
