Fire Lyrics
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
The golden key that opens any door
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
The golden key that opens any door

Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
The golden key that opens any door
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
The golden key that opens any door

It sets the world on fire, fire
It sets the world on fire, fire; feeling the fever taking over
(Lovers need no reason)

Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
The golden key that opens any door

It sets the world on fire, fire
It sets the world on fire, fire; feeling the fever taking over
It sets the world on fire, fire
It sets the world on fire, fire; feeling the fever taking over
Fire

Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Lovers need no reason, lovers need no season
The golden key that opens any door

It sets the world on fire, fire
It sets the world on fire, fire
Fire, it sets the world on fire, fire
Fire, feeling the fever taking over
It sets the world on fire, fire
It sets the world on fire, fire; feeling the fever taking overEmbed
