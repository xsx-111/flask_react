All Souls Night Lyrics
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Bonfires dot the rolling hillsides
Figures dance around and around
To drums that pulse out echoes of darkness
Moving to the pagan sound
Somewhere in a hidden memory
Images float before my eyes
Of fragrant nights of straw and of bonfires
Dancing 'til the next sunrise

I can see the lights in the distance
Trembling in the dark cloak of night
Candles and lanterns are dancing, dancing
A waltz on All Souls Night

Figures of cornstalks bend in the shadows
Held up tall as the flames leap high
The green knight holds the holly bush
To mark where the old year passes by
I can see the lights in the distance
Trembling in the dark cloak of night
Candles and lanterns are dancing, dancing
A waltz on All Souls Night

Bonfires dot the rolling hillsides
Figures dance around and around
To drums that pulse out echoes of darkness
Moving to the pagan sound
Standing on the bridge that crosses
The river that goes out to the sea
The wind is full of a thousand voices
They pass by the bridge and me

I can see the lights in the distance
Trembling in the dark cloak of night
Candles and lanterns are dancing, dancing
A waltz on All Souls Night
I can see the lights in the distance
Trembling in the dark cloak of night
Candles and lanterns are dancing, dancing
A waltz on All Souls Night
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ahEmbed
