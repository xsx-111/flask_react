I Wanna Pick You Up Lyrics
I love to pick you up
Because you're still a baby to me
Cribs and cradles and bottles and toys
Are part of the joys they bring
I want to wash your face
And change your clothes and button your shoes
Walk you around and wrestle with you
Then I'm going to make you sing
In the morning I could wake you up
Feed you breakfast from a little cup

I want to pick you up
Rock you back and forth and make you smile
I want to hold you close for a while

I want to tickle your feet
Drop you in your little tub
Wash your body and shampoo your hair
Be careful not to sting your eyes
When it's night I'll put you in your bed
And I'll bend and kiss you on your head

I want to pick you up
Rock you back and forth and make you smile
I want to hold you close for a while
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt butt
She's going to sleep be quiet
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt
She's going to sleep (Little baby go to sleep)Embed
