Good Time Lyrics
My girlfriend Betty she's always ready
To help me in any way
She'll do my cooking she's always looking
For ways she can make my day
And when I'm looking at her the sound of pitter patter
On rainy days like today
Could get you feeling warmer
And you know what-a that can lead to

Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might go up in smoke now but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time

My girlfriend Penny, she's kind of skinny
And so she needs her falsies on
She don't like cooking but she's so good looking
I miss her when she's gone
And when she gets to dancing I feel just like romancing
Especially when we're dancing close
She'll do the dirty boogie
And that's when I go up in smoke
Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might end up in tears now but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time

Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo uh
Wo wo wo
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
Wo wo wo

Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
But just a few hours with nothin', whoa, what do we care
Let's have a good time

Good time
Oh good time
Oh good time
Goooooood tiiiiiiiiime
