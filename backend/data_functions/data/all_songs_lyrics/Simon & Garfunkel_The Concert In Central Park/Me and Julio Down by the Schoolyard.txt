Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard LyricsThe mama pajama rolled outta bed and she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout, and they started the investigation
And it's against the law, it was against the law
What the mama saw, it was against the law
The mama looked down and spit on the ground ev'ry time my name gets mentioned
The papa said "oy, if I ever get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of Detention"
Well, I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm on my way, I'm takin' my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
See you, Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard
See you, Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard
In a couple of days they come and take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest comes to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm on my way, I'm takin' my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye Rosie, the queen of Corona
See you, Me And Julio Down By the Schoolyard
See you, Me And Julio Down By the Schoolyard
See you, Me And Julio Down By the SchoolyardEmbed
