Kodachrome/Maybellene LyricsWhen I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder I can think at all
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
Everything looks better in black and white
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Leave your boy so far from home
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coup de Ville
A Cadillac rollin' on the open road
But nothing will outrace my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
Bumper to bumper and side by side
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
The heat cooled down, the motor cooled down
That's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac sittin' like a ton of lead
Hundred and ten half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's standin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do1Embed
