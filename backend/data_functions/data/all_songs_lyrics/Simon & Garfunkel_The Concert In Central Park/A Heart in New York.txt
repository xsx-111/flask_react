A Heart in New York LyricsNew York
To that tall skyline I come
Flyin' in from London
To your door
New York
Lookin' down on Central Park
Where they say you should not wander after dark
New York
Like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me
There's a heart
A heart that lives in New York
A heart in New York, a rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in New York, the love in her eyes
An open door and a friend for the night
New York
You've got money on your mind
And my words don't make a dime's worth of difference
So here's to you New YorkEmbed
