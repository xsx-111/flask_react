American Tune LyricsMany's the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
And I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
But it's all right, it's all right
I'm just weary to my bones
Still, you don't expect to be
Bright and Bon Vivant
So far away from home
So far away from home
I don't know a soul who's not been battered
Don't have a friend who feels at ease
Don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to its knees
But it's all right, all right
We've lived so well so long
Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on
I wonder what went wrong
I can't help it
I wonder what went wrong
And I dreamed I was flying
I dreamed my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down on me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was dying
And far above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty
Drifting away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying
We come on a ship we call the Mayflower
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come at the age's most uncertain hour
And sing the American tune
But it's all right, its all right
You can't be forever blessed
Still, tomorrow's gonna be another working day
And I'm trying to get some rest
That's all, I'm trying to get some restEmbed
