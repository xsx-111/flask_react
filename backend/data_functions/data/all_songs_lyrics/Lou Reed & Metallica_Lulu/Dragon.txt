Dragon Lyrics
You don’t actually care
You don’t actually care
You don’t actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You’re not really there, hallucination
I thought you were listening, hallucination
I thought you were listening, hallucination
I understand you think you’re above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair
They run through your hair, hallucination, hallucination

Oh, you think you’re so special
That there’s no law meant for you!
You come and go like the goddess you are
We’re mere mortals below!
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below
Are meant to be peons!
Are meant to be servants!
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with
Poor pitiful creature

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we’re a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you’re able?
Red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature

To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshipers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body!
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you!
And you have no meaning
You don’t even see us!
You were never caring!
You go do what you do!
You do it for you, no one exists with you!
You’re way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you, thinking of you
Is another way of dying!
Is another way of dying!

I am clawing your chest
Until your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples ’til I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring, way above caring
In your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox
I’m doomed, I’m swearing, waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture, your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?
The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?

You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve!
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring!
My caring for you!
My caring for you!
You’re way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying!
You're way above caring!
Oblivious to caring!
Oblivious to caring!
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner, it’s true
The winner in heartbreak!
The winner in caring!
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing!

Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
Your heart on your fucking sleeve
My caring for you

We were meant to be peons
We’re meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants
Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh you’re so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are!
The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling, feeling
Ah, ah, ah!
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected

An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you

You think I’m a book or a table
You can rest your fucking feet on
When you’re able
The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal, we love you haughty
Oblivious to caring!
Oblivious to caring!
Caring
Caring
Oh my dear
Oh my dear!
Oh my dear!
Oblivious to caring...
Are we really dead now?!
Are we both dead now?!
