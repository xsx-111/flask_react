Brandenburg Gate Lyrics
I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh, wouldn't it be lovely

Small town girl
Small town girl
Small town girl
Small town girl

I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
Small town girl
I was feeling snappy
Perhaps I’d been napping
And I had just ate
Small town girl
A following heart
Can tear you apart
On a midnight to 8 shift
Small town girl
A graveyard romance
Can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe
Small town girl
Small town girl
Small town girl
Ah, small town girl
Small town girl

Feeling happy
When my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
Small town girl
I dreamt of breezes
Going through the trees and
Stars were still illumed
Small town girl
I have three hearts
That I keep apart
Trying to relate
Small town girl
To normal feelings
And the nighttime reelings
And some absynths drunk so late

My small town girl
I'm just a small town girl
Small town girl
Small town girl
The cook got drunk
And all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
Small town girl
But me, I am happy
Cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
Small town girl
I'm just a small town girl
Who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight
Small town girl
Small town girl
Straight up to illusion
And fantasy’s fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
Small town girl

I'm just a small town girl
Who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate
Small town girl
I'm just a small town girl
Giving life a whirl
Looking at the
Small town girl
Brandenburg Ga-a-a-a-a-a-te
I'm just a small town girl
Small town girl
Small town girl, yeah yeah
Small town girl
I'm just a small town girl
Small town girl1Embed
