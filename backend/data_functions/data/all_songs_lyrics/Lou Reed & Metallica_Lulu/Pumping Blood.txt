Pumping Blood Lyrics
Pumping blood, pumping blood
Pumping blood, pumping blood
Pumping blood, pumping blood
Pumping blood, pumping blood

If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away
A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass, a little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump, off the thing
The blood that I’m pumping away
Like bees over the air
Off the pump, off the thing
The blood that I’m pumping away

Off the pump, off the thing
The blood that I’m pumping away
If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas, and I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river?
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart!
As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river?
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart!
If I’m pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me
And my coagulating heart?
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood
C'mon James!

Would you top me off?
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy?
While you yell out, “mercy”?
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me?
Use a knife on me?
Be shocked at the boldness, the coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump in the manic confusion of love?

Supreme violation, supreme violation
“Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you!”
“Oh, Jack I beseech you!”
Supreme violation
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom, the tea room, the kitchen, with her knives splayed
I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man’s dick
Blood spurting from me!
“Oh Jack, Jack I beseech…!”
“Jack, I beseech you, I beseech…!”
In the end it was an ordinary heart
“Oh Jack I beseech you!”
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart!
In the end, in the end
In the end it was an ordinary heart
“Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you!”
Supreme violation... Oh
“Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you!”
I call out your name!
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom, the tea room, the kitchen, and knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man’s dick
Blood spurting from me!
Blood spurting from me!
“Oh Jack"
"Oh Jack I beseech you”
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end it was an ordinary heart
