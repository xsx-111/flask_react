Cheat on Me Lyrics

Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me

I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don’t love any of them

Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me, why
Why do I cheat on me, why
Come on!
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me

You have your feelings I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take
Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me?
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me

Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I piss my dreams?
That's because that's what it is
I have the drive, I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope?
Your love means zero to me
I’m a passionate-less wave upon the sea
Passionate-less wave upon the sea

Why, why, why do you cheat on me
Why, why, why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself?
Well, I got nobody else!
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat on me?
WHY?! Do I cheat on myself?
Well, well, well, I really have nobody else
Why do you cheat
Why do you cheat on me
Why do you cheat, cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
Why do I cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
Why do I cheat on myself
Why, why, why do you cheat, cheat on me
Well, I got nobody else!
Why do I cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
Why do you cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Your love means zero to me
Ah, your love means zero to me
Why do I cheat on me?
Why do I cheat on myself?
Cheat on, why do I cheat on ya?
I really got nobody else
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me?
I’m only young once!
I want to taste it all and have fun!
I have no real feelings in my soul!
Where most have passion I got a hole!
I really got nobody else
I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
Why do I cheat on me
You say you love me, I know it’s true
But I, I, I don’t love you

Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
Why do I cheat on me
Passionate-less wave
Why do I cheat on me
Your love means zero
Your love means zero
Your love means zero to meEmbed
