Junior Dad Lyrics
Would you come to me if I was half drowning?
An arm above the last wave?
Would you come to me? Would you pull me up?
Would the effort really hurt you?
Is it unfair to ask you, to help pull me up?

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and saviour, pull me up by my hair?
Now would you kiss me, on my lips?

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening
Now shoots out its tiresome message
Won’t you pull me up?
Scalding, my dead father has the motor and he's driving
Towards an island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or – oh, state of grace
Would you pull me up?
Would you drop the mental bullet?
Would you pull me by the arm up?
Would you still kiss my lips?
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad, psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
