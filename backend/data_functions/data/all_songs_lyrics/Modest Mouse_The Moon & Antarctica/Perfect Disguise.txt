Perfect Disguise Lyrics
Well, you've got the perfect disguise and you're looking okay
From the bottom of the best of the worst, well, what can I say?

'Cause you cocked your head to shoot me down
And I don't give a damn about you or this town no more
No, but I know the score

Need me to fall down so you can climb up
Some fool-ass ladder, well, good luck
I hope, I hope there's something better up there

'Cause you cocked your head to shoot me down
And I don't give a damn about you or this town no more
No, 'cause I know the score

Broke my back
Broke my back
Broke my back3Embed
