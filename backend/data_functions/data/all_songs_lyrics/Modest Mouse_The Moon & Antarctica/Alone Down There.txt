Alone Down There Lyrics
How do, how do you do?
My name is You
Flies, they all gather 'round me and you too
You can't see anything well
You ask me what size it is, not what I sell
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
The flies, they all gather 'round me and you too

Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone

But the devil's apprentice, he gave me some credit
He fed me a line and I'll probably regret it
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone

Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
