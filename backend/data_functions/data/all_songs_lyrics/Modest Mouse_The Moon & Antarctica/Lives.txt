Lives Lyrics
Everyone's afraid of their own life
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?
No one really knows the ones they love
If you knew everything they thought
I bet that you would wish that they'd just shut up

Well, you were the dull sound of sharp math when you were alive
No one's going to play the harp when you die
And if I had a nickel for every damn dime
I’d have half the time, do you mind?

Everyone's afraid of their own lives
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?
Am I right? Am I right? Am I right?
Am I right? Am I right? Am I right?

And it’s our lives
It's hard to remember, it’s hard to remember we're alive
For the first time
It's hard to remember, it’s hard to remember we're alive
For the last time
It's hard to remember, it’s hard to remember to live
Before you die
It's hard to remember, it’s hard to remember that our lives
Are such a short time
It's hard to remember, it’s hard to remember when it takes
Such a long time
It's hard to remember
It’s hard to remember
My mom’s God is a woman, and my mom, she is a witch
I like this
My hell comes from inside, comes from inside myself
Why fight this?

Everyone's afraid of their own life
If you could be anything you want
I bet you'd be disappointed, am I right?4Embed
