The Stars Are Projectors Lyrics
In the last second of life
They're gonna show you how
How they run this show
Sure, run it into the ground
In the last second of your life
They're gonna show you how
How they run this show
They run it into the ground

In the last second of life
They'll show you how
They run this show
Sure, run it into the ground
In the last second of life
They're gonna show you how

And the stars are projectors, yeah
Projectin' our lives down to this planet Earth
And the stars are projectors, yeah
Projectin' our minds down to this planet Earth
Everyone wants a double feature
They wanna be their own damn teacher, and how?
All the stars are projectors, yeah
Projectin' our lives down to this planet Earth
It's all about moderate climates
You gotta be cold and be hot for sure
And it's all about the moderate climates
You wanna be blessed and be cursed for sure

And the stars are projectors, yeah
Projectin' our lives down to this planet Earth
And the stars are projectors, yeah
Projectin' our lives down to this planet Earth
Everyone wants a double feature
They wanna be their own damn teacher, and how?
All the stars are projectors, yeah
Projectin' our minds down to this planet Earth

You've got the harder part
You've got the kinder heart, and it's true
I've got the easy part
I've got the harder heart, ain't that true?
Well, right wing, left wing, chicken wing
It's built on findin' the easier ways through
God is a woman and the woman is
An animal, that animal's man, and that's you
Was there a need for creation?
That was hidden in a math equation that asks this:
Where do circles begin?
Where do circles begin?
