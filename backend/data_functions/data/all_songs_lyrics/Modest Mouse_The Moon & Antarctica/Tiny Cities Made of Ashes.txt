Tiny Cities Made of Ashes Lyrics
We're goin' down the road
Towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm gonna hit you on the face
I'm gonna punch you in your glasses, oh no
I just got a message that said
"Yeah, Hell has frozen over"
I got a phone call from the Lord sayin'
"Hey, boy, get a sweater, right now"

So we're drinkin', drinkin', drinkin', drinkin'
Coca, Coca Cola
I can feel it rollin' right on down
Oh, right on down my throat
And as we're headed down the road
Towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm gonna get dressed up in plastic
Gonna shake hands with the masses
Oh no!

Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
We're goin' down the road
Towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm goin' to hit you on the face
I'm goin' to punch you in your glasses
I'm wearin' myself a T-shirt
That says "The world is my ashtray"
Our hearts pump dust
And our hair's all gray
And I just got a message that says
"Yeah, hell has frozen over"
I got a phone call from the Lord sayin'
"Hey, boy, get a sweater, right now!"

Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
Does anybody know a way?

We're drinkin', drinkin', drinkin', drinkin'
Coca, Coca Cola
I can feel it rollin' right on down
Oh, right on down my throat
And as we're headed down the road
Towards tiny cities made of ashes
I'm gonna lay down in the spa
Where they coat you in molasses, right now!
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?
Does anybody know a way?
