A Different City Lyrics
I wanna live in the city with no friends and family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
I wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV

Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bars, someone smart said nothin' at all
I'm watching TV, I guess that's a solution
They gave me a receipt that said "I didn't buy nothin'"
So rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
My eyes rolled around, all around on the carpet
Oh, hit the deck, it's the decal man
Standin' upside down and talkin' out of his pants

I wanna live in the city with no friends and family
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV
I wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV

Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bars, someone smart said nothin' at all
I'm watching TV, I guess that's a solution
They gave me a receipt that said "I didn't buy nothin'"
So rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
My eyes rolled around, all around on the carpet
Oh, hit the deck, it's the decal man
Standin' upside down and talkin' out of his pants
Through the cracks in the wall, slow motion for all
Left holding the ball and a part for your car2Embed
