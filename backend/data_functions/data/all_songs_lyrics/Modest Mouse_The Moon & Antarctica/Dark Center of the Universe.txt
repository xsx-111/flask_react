Dark Center of the Universe Lyrics
I might disintegrate into the thin air if you'd like
I'm not the dark center of the universe like you thought
And I might disintegrate into the thin air if you'd like
And I'm not the dark center of the universe like you thought

Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm real damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over

Well, God said something but didn't mean it
Everyone's life ends but no one ever completes it
Dry or wet ice, they both melt and you're equally cheated

Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm real damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over

Well an endless ocean landing on an endless desert
Well it's funny as hell, but no one laughs when they get there
If you can't see the thin air then why the hell should you care?
Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm real damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over

Well I'm sure you tell me you got nothing to say
But our voices shook hands the other day
If you can't see the thin air then what the hell is in the way?

I might disintegrate into the thin air if you'd like
And I'm not the dark center of the universe like you thought

Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm real damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over

Well an endless ocean landing on an endless desert
Well it's funny as hell, but no one laughs when they get there
If you can't see the thin air then why the hell should you care?

Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm real damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over
Well, God said something but didn't mean it
Everyone's life ends but no one ever completes it
Dry or wet ice, they both melt and you're equally cheated

Well, it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm real damn sure that anyone can
Equally, easily fuck you over

Well I'm sure you tell me you got nothing to say
But our voices shook hands the other day
If you can't see the thin air then what the hell is in the way?1Embed
