Wild Packs of Family Dogs Lyrics
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin' through the yard one day
My father got his gun, shot it up, they ran away, okay
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin' through the yard
And as my own dog ran away with them
I didn't say much of anything at all
Didn't say much of anything at all
Didn't say much of anything at all

A wild pack of family dogs came runnin' through the yard
As my little sister played, the dogs took her away
And I guess she was eaten up, okay, yeah, she was eaten up, okay
My mother's cryin' blood dust now
My mother's cryin' blood dust now
Mother's cryin' blood dust now

My dad he quit his job today
Well, I guess he was fired but that's okay
And I'm sittin' outside by my mud lake
Waitin' for the pack to take me away
Right after I die
The dogs start floating up towards the glowing sky
Now they'll receive their reward
Now they will receive their reward
Yeah, they will receive their rewards2Embed
