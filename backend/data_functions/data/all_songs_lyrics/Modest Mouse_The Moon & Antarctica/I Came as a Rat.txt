I Came as a Rat Lyrics
Well, I ain't sure, but I've been told he's baking cakes inside our souls
Stayed awake, took a nap, got myself my bottles back
I'm breaking them out on the street, walking around in my bare feet
I do not need you to tell me that I am not a cat

I caught a ride, we caught some air, he's never gonna cut his hair
It takes more time to make a fake, we night swam down in the lake
And washed the dirt off our intentions
Prattled on about bad inventions

I came as ice, I came as a whore
I came as advice that came too sure
I came as gold, I came as crap
I came clean and I came as a rat
It takes a long time but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you

Well, I don't know, but I been told
You'll never die when you'll never grow old
Hey-oh yo, hey-oh yo, hey-oh yo
Hey-oh hey-o-o-o-o-oh!
I came as a call, I came as flat
I came too soon so I came back
I came as flowers, I came as nice
I came as dirt and I came as a surprise
It takes a long time, but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you

I don't know, but I been told
You'll never die when you'll never grow old
Hey-oh yo, hey-oh yo, hey-oh yo
Hey-oh hey-o-o-o-o-oh!
Hey-oh yo, hey-oh yo, hey-oh yo
Hey-oh hey-o-o-o-o-oh!Embed
