Life Like Weeds Lyrics
In this life like weeds, you're just a rock to me
You're just a rock to me, you're just a rock to me
And in this life like weeds, you're just a rock to me
In this life like weeds, and in this life like weeds

I could have told you all that I love you
And in the places you go, you'll see the place where you're from
I could have told you all that I love you
And in the faces you meet, you'll see the place where you'll die
I could have told you all that I love you
And on the day that you die, you'll see the people you met
I could have told you all that I love you
And in the faces you see, you'll see just who you've been
(I wish I could have told you all)

In this life like weeds
In this life like weeds
Eyes need us to see
Hearts need us to bleed
In this life like weeds
You're a rock to me
I know where you're from
But where do you belong?
In this life like weeds
You're the dirt I breathe
In this life like weeds
You're a rock to me

In this life like weeds
In this life like weeds
I know where you're from
But where do you belong?
In this life like weeds
Eyes need us to see
Hearts need us to bleed
In this life like weeds
In this life like weeds
You're the dirt I breathe

All this talkin' all the time, and the air fills up
Up, up, until there's nothin' left to breathe
And you think you feel almost everything
And we know in there that our hearts
Are just made out of strings to be pulled
Strings to be pulled
So you think you've figured out everything?
But we know in there that our minds
Are just made out of strings to be pulled
Strings to be pulled
All this talkin' all the time, and the air fills up
Up, up, until there's nothin' left to breathe
Up, until there's nothin' left to speak
Up, until the better parts of space
