Sugarlight Lyrics
Sugarlight, we're addicts
Why do you think we came?
He's pasting gold leeches on my arm

We sharpen up our teeth
White sugar, he speaks French
Memorizing torsos
He's open-throated

In the corner
Hands arrive at hands
My arm is tied off, waiting
To burn it down

Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light

Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric lightEmbed
