Delta 88 (Demo Version) (Bonus Track) LyricsWe're gonna go to Cannery Row
We're gonna go to Cannery Row
We're gonna stay at the Bates Motel
We're gonna get John Perkins out
We're gonna go to Cannery Row
We're gonna stay at the Bates Motel
We're gonna get John Perkins out
We're gonna go to Cannery Row

Cannery Row where the bums all gone
Cannery Row where the bums all gone
Excuse me sir, ?
Look out love ?
Then nowhere to go on Cannery Row
Nowhere to go on Cannery Row
Main street bread and ?
Just by ?
Sayin' nothin' to do on Cannery Row
It's Cannery Row and there nowhere to go
?
Bums are back and they're .
