The Unheard Music Lyrics
Friends warehouse pain
Attack their own kind
A thousand kids bury their parents

There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio

We set the trash on fire
And watch outside the door
Men come up the pavement under the marquee

There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio
Friends warehouse pain
Attack their own kind
A thousand kids bury their parents

There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio1Embed
