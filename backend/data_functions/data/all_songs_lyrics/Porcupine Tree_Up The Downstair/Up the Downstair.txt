Up the Downstair Lyrics
Sleep until the colours dissolve
Leave the dream to rain-soak forever
In blessed moments viewed from trains of half-truths
Monuments burn into moments
Up into other worlds, other ascensions
Without deep sorrow to endure
Monuments burn into moments
Up into other worlds, other ascensions
Without deep sorrow to endure
Black Sunday of sleep
Open for small angel escapes
Moved by buildings to tears
They weep in the rain
Am I at home?
Am I in heaven?
Gentle architecture
Black Sunday of sleep
Open for small angel escapes
Moved by buildings to tears
They weep in the rainEmbed
