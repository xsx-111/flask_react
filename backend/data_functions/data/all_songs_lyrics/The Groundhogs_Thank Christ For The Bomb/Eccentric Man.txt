Eccentric Man LyricsMy chest is a 36
My overcoat is full of poison
My trousers end six inches from the ground
Three inches from my shoes
Tied up with a piece of string and
Held together with free spoon glue
Call me an eccentric man
I don't believe I am
Call me an eccentric man
I don't believe I am
My bed is a park bench
And my sheet and blankets are newspaper pages
The people think I'm crazy
But I know I'm wiser than all the sages
'Cos I have money they think that I'm a fool for doing what I do, but I know it's right
Call me an eccentric man
I don't believe I am
Call me an eccentric man
I don't believe I am
If ever I want to
I could have the comfort of my country home
But until that time
I'm quite content to have
Walls made of bridge stones
A carpet of moss, a ceiling of sky
And a brown rat for a watch dog
Call me an eccentric man
I don't believe I am
Call me an eccentric man
I don't believe I amEmbed
