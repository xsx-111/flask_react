Status People LyricsI closed my front door today
I won't be opening it up for a while
I left the key with friends
I said "Make yourself at home and live in style"
All I had was a set of clothes
That would have to last for quite a long time
I'm leaving now
All the brass and silver can collect some grime
My money in the bank I'll give most away
To friends and servants who will lose their pay
They can be rich for a short time
Realise some ambitions and start to climb
I'll be glad to say goodbye
To status people who are just a lie
I left them behind when I walked out the door
I'll never see them anymoreEmbed
