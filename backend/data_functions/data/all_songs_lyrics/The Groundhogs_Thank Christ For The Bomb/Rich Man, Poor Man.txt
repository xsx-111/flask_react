Rich Man, Poor Man LyricsYou can be the rich man, I'll be the poor man
Cross section of mankind
You can have society, I'll take nature
Combined with peace of mind
I've had my fill of upper class living
If I take more I'll explode
Won't have to bother about earning a living
When I get on the road
It may take time to get accustomed
To want things and not have the price
But there must always be a first time
That's when you break the ice
And I've decided on this action
And I know I won't think twice
You can be the rich man, I'll be the poor man
Cross section of mankind
You can have society, I'll take nature
Combined with peace of mindEmbed
