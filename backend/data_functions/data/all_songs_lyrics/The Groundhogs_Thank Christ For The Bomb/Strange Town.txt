Strange Town LyricsThis is a strange town, people here round don't have no fun
I've been here two years, I've been lookin' round but I ain't found none
It seems that all they care about is pointin' people out
Saying stupid things like, "get the lice out your hair"
I don't believe these people, spend all their time walkin' round lookin' so glum
They think that life is for workin' to secure their pension when retirement come
Ah, but they don't realise, it's right before their eyes
Life is for livin', right now before you die
This is a strange town, people here round don't have no fun
I've been here two years, I've been lookin' round but I ain't found none
It seems that all they care about is pointin' people out
Saying stupid things like, "get the lice out your hair"Embed
