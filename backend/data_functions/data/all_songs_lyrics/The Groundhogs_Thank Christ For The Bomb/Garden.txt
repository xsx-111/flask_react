Garden LyricsMy garden is all overgrown and the weeds are creeping up on my home
Grass has grown over two foot high and the trees are blocking out the sky
French windows won't open any more from the moss that's grown outside the door
Hundred birds are nesting in the trees, looks like a wild-life sanctuary
BREAK
But I'm not going to cut a single blade of grass, my garden will look just like the distant past
Before the days of agricultural land, before the time when pebbles turned to sand
When I leave this house I'm going to stay, I'm forsaking my comforts to live another way
Get my clothes from heaps, my food from bins, my water from ponds and have tramps for all my friends
BREAK
