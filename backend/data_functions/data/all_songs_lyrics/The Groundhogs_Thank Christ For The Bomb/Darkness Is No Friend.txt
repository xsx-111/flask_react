Darkness Is No Friend LyricsShafts of sunlight
Stealing in my room
Through the window-pane
Look like spotlight
Pointing out the gloom
And despair that it contains
But I would not
Shut out the sunlight
For darkness is no friend
Shafts of moonlight
Lighting up the floor
Nearly all bare boards
Few pieces of carpet
And nothing more
All I can afford
But I would not
Shut out the moonlight
For darkness is no friend
It's so easy to shut your eyes
To block out the things that you despise
Just as easy for the dark of night
To blot out the daylight
Things that aren't right
It's so easy to shut your eyes
To block out the things that you despise
Just as easy for the dark of night
To blot out the daylight
Things that aren't right
Shafts of sunlight
Stealing in my room
Through the window-pane
Look like spotlight
Pointing out the gloom
And despair that it contains
But I would not
Shut out the sunlight
For darkness is no friendEmbed
