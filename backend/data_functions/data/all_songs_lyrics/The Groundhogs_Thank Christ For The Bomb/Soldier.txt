Soldier LyricsSoldier, fix your bayonet before the enemy come
'Cos you won't have time, when they start to climb the hill, y'know
Soldier, when you see 8,000 climbin' up on you
Don't see them as men, just see them as enemies of the king, y'know
Soldier, Don't think of runnin', your death is just as sure
If you don't face it now, you'll face it anyhow in front of the squad, y'know
Soldier, stand firm in your trenches, don't let them break the line
Because these dirty Hun are all bastard whore'sons not fit to live, don't you knowEmbed
