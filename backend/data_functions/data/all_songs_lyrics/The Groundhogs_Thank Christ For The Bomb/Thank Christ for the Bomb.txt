Thank Christ for the Bomb LyricsIn 1914 a war began
A million soldiers lent a hand
Weren't many planes to give support
Hand to hand was the way they fought
Young men were called up for the cause
For king and country and the cross
In their naivete they thought
It was for the glory, so they'd been taught
In 1939 once again
There came the sound of marching men
Occupying European land
All the way to North French sands
But, in the final year of that war
Two big bangs settled the score
Against Japan, who'd joined the fight
The rising sun didn't look so bright
Since that day it's been stalemate
Everyone's scared to obliterate
So it seems for peace we can thank the bomb
So I say thank Christ for the bomb
So I say thank Christ for the bomb
So I say thank Christ for the bombEmbed
