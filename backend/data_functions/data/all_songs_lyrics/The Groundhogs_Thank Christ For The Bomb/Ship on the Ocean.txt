Ship on the Ocean LyricsI'm like a ship on the ocean that's rolling from side to side
But I'm not drunk I'm just dissatisfied
It's not my body but my mind I can't control
I have everything I need but still... I want more
I've done everything that I've ever set out to do
I become so well known that they've put me in who's who
But I've reached the limit and I don't know what to do
If I can't go no further I'll have to go back... to being poorEmbed
