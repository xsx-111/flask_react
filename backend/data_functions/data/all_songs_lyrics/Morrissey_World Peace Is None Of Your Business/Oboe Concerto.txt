Oboe Concerto Lyrics"And he spoke with his voice
While he was talking
With his mouth"
Oboe concerto
All the best ones are dead
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
Oboe concerto
All I do is drink to absent friends
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
The older generation
Have tried, sighed and died
Which pushes me to
Their place in the queue
Round, rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes roundEmbed
