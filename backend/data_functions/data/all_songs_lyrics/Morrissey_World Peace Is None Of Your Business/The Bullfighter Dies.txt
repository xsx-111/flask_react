The Bullfighter Dies LyricsMad in Madrid
Ill in Seville
Lonely in Barcelona
Then someone told you
And you cheered
"Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
And nobody cries
Nobody cries
Because we all want the bull to survive"
Gaga in MÃ¡laga
No mercy in Murcia
Mental in Valencia
Then someone tells you
And you cheer
"Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
And nobody cries
Nobody cries
Because we all want the bull to survive"Embed
