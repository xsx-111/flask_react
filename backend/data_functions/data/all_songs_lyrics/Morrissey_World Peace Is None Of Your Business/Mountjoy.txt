Mountjoy LyricsThe Joy brings many things
It cannot bring you joy
Sons of mothers huddled here
Men and boys
1850 swung the doors
And human sewage swept inside
Where victims speak in whines
And where the hardened cried
I was sent here by a three-foot half-wit in a wig
I took his insults on the chin
And never did I flinch
A swagger hides the fear in here
By this rule we breathe
And there is no one on this earth
That I'd feel sad to leave
You see
We all lose
We all lose
What those in power do to you
Reminds us at a glance
How humans hate each others guts
And show it given the chance
We never say aloud the things
That we say in our prayers
'Cos no one cares
Many executed here
By the awful lawfully good
But the only thing that makes me cry
Is when I see the sky
Brenden Behan's laughter rings
For what he had or hadn't done
For he knew then
As I know know
That for each and every one of us
We all lose
Rich or poor
We all lose
Rich or poor
We all loseEmbed
