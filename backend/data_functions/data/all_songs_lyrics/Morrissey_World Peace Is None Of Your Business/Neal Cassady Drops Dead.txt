Neal Cassady Drops Dead LyricsNeal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's tears shampoo his beard
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's lips tighten and thin
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's hosed down in a barn
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" becomes a growl
Everyone has babies
Babies full of rabies
Rabies full of scabies
Scarlett has a fever
Ringlets full of ringworm
Angel of distemper
The little fella has got Rubella
Nipper full of fungus
Junior full of gangrene
Minor's melanoma
Tyke full of grippe
Whipper snapper's scurvy
Urchin made of acne
Get that thing away from me
Victim?
Or life’s adventurer?
Which of the two are you?
