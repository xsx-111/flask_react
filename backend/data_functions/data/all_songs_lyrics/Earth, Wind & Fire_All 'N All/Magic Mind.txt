Magic Mind LyricsHey, we heard the news
That someone's cryin' the blues
'Cause words still go unsaid
As hungry minds are never fed
Take a chance as you dance in romance
In a trance to advance and expand
Got a dime and a rhyme, brilliant mind
Still inclined in your prime to design
For man's great strength to meet
Another trembling heart's defeat
Is read between the lines
When change of mind is hard to find
The blossoms that you reap
From binding challenges complete
And wisdom's gentle rain
Immensely crowns the brain
Take a chance as you dance in romance
In a trance to advance and expand
Moving soon upper room
Paid your dues, 'cause you're through feelin' blue
Take a chance as you dance in romance
In a trance to advance and expand
Got a dime and a rhyme, brilliant mind
Still inclined in your prime to design
Moving soon upper room
Paid your dues, 'cause you're through feelin' blueEmbed
