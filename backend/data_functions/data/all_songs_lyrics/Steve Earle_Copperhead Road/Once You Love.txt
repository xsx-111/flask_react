Once You Love Lyrics
A long time ago, there lived a man
He had the world in the palm of his hand
Sultans and kings beat a path to his door
Had everything, but still wanted more
One day in spring came a lady so fair
He'd never looked on a beauty so rare
But he didn't trust her, so he locked her away
His gold lost its luster when love died that day

Once you love, once you trust it
Once you give, your soul is bare
One false move and you know you're busted
Once you love, you care

Well, I knew an old man who lived all alone
In a sad little house at the end of the road
He sat on his front porch in an old rocking chair
And everyone swore he'd gone crazy down there
But no one comes near, so how could they know?
He lost someone dear to him once long ago
He remembers the laughter and still tastes the tears
He still calls her name out after all of these years
Once you love, once you trust it
Once you give, your soul is bare
One false move and you know you're busted
Once you love, you care

You keep it all inside
You can run, but you can't hide
When you think it's safe outside
Look behind you, love will find you

Once you love, once you trust it
Once you give, your soul is bare
One false move and you know you're busted
Once you love, you care

Once you trust it
Once you care
Once you trust it
Once you care
Once you trust it
Once you care
Once you trust it
Once you careEmbed
