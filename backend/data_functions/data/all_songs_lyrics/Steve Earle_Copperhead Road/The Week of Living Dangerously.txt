The Week of Living Dangerously Lyrics
Well I got out of work and I headed for the neighborhood beer joint
I sat around and had a beer with the boys like I always do
Well I didn't have nothing to say anyway, there ain't no point
There's something about a Monday that always makes me blue

Well it was well after dark so I knew my wife and kids were waiting
And I guess I took a left where I generally take a right
Well I filled her up with gas and checked the oil at the Texaco station
I threw the car seat in a dumpster and I headed out into the night

Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
There's something about a Monday
That always makes me blue

Well I headed south on 35, hellbent for vinyl
I hadn't never had her up past 55 before
Well something about that little red line always looked so final
Buddy, you'd be surprised how fast a Chevrolet truck can go

Now down in Mexico, they've got a little place called Boystown
Where a man's still a man if you know what I'm talking about
Well I walked into the Cadillac bar and I laid my cash down
I said, "There's plenty more where that came from" and the lights went out
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
There's something about a Monday
That always makes me blue

Well I woke up in a county jail across the line in Laredo
I had a headache and a deputy staring at me through the door
He said, "How you got across that river alive, I don't know
But your wife just made your bail, so now you're really dead for sure"

Now my wife, she called my boss and she lied and so I got my job back
And the boys down at the plant whisper and stare at me
Well my wife can find a lot of little jobs to keep me on the right track
That's a small price to pay for a week of living dangerously

Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
There's something about a Monday
That always makes me blueEmbed
