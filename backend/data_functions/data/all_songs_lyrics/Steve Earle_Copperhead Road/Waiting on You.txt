Waiting on You Lyrics
Here comes the night, day brings no light
For wrong or right, I'm here waiting on you
Words cut too deep, old ghosts won't sleep
They'll never keep me from waiting on you

Breathing out, breathing in
Holding out, giving in
Doing with or without
For a lifetime, just a lifetime

I can't let go, I wait for you
Till hell goes cold, I wait for you
You're all I know and I wait for you

Breathing out, breathing in
Holding out, giving in
Doing with or without
Waiting on you

I don't show it all, I walk on, walk tall
Behind this wall, I'm still waiting on you
Breathing out, breathing in
Holding out, giving in
Doing with or without
For a lifetime, just a lifetime

I can't let go, I wait for you
Till hell goes cold, I wait for you
You're all I know and I wait for you
I can't let go, I wait for you
Till hell goes cold, I wait for you
You're all I know and I wait for you
I can't let go, I wait for you
Till hell goes cold, I wait for you
You're all I know and I wait for youEmbed
