Little Sister Lyrics(Greg Trooper version - from We Don't Dance)
I don't care what you do to me
I don't care what you do to me
I don't care what you do to me
But won't you let my little sister be
Now you can tie me up an torture me
You can hang me from a willow tree
You can jail me for eternity
But won't you let my little sister be
She's afraid of the dark
She prays for the morning light
She's as free as a bird
And her wings are spread and ready for flight
She knows nothing at all
About you and your emotional plight
But she heard you making noises
In the hallway late last night
If you got to have something to show
And you've got to take it down below
And you're sure that one of us must go
Take me and leave my sister aloneEmbed
