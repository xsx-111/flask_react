You Belong to Me Lyrics
Lately I've been feeling a little uneasy
So I run straight home to you
It's been cold as hell and you just can't tell
What a girl might do
I made a whole lot of promises, baby
But none of my dreams came true
And it's you that paid
And I'm so afraid that I'm losing you

But you belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Me, baby, me

Now your mama said
You could do better than me
Baby, I know that's true
You believed me instead
Every word I said and I did too
Now every day's a little bit harder out there
No matter what I do
Well I could carry the world
On my shoulders, girl
Long as I got you
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Me, baby, me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Me, baby, me

Well my shining armor is rusted and worn
There's a heart inside here entrusted and sworn to you
Just tell me, baby, what I need to do
I can win you over again, if you want me to

You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Me, baby, me

Well my shining armor is rusted and worn
There's a heart inside here entrusted and sworn to you
Just tell me, baby, what I need to do
I can win you over again, if you want me to
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Me, baby, meEmbed
