Nothing but a Child Lyrics
Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out across the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they traveled day and night
And precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when they came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And this miracle they prized was nothing but a child

And nothing but a child could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
So once again we all can be children for a while

Now all around the world, in every little town
Every day is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awes to find another chance allowed


Nothing but a little baby
Nothing but a childEmbed
