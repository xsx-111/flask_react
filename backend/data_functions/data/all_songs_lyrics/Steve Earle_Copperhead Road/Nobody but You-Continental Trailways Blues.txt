Nobody but You/Continental Trailways Blues LyricsWell, I'm sittin' in the depot long before the break of day
I just bought my ticket, lord I hope the bus ain't late
I'll have a cup of coffee and a sandwich from the microwave
Now I'm gonna see my baby if it's the last thing I ever do
Got this sittin' in the station sick and tired of waitin'
Continental Trailways blues
Well rollin' out for Houston, man we're finally rollin' now
Try to get some sleep and listen to that highway sound
I guess we must have stopped in every single little town
Now I've bought myself a copy of the Natchez, Mississippi news
With the just pulled out of lake Charles rollin' into Sulphur
Continental Trailways blues
Now, we're rollin' into Houston, don't them city lights look fine
Headed for the pay phone, hangin' onto my last dime
Well, she says she's got a new man, son, it's been a long, long time
She left me standin' by the highway with the rain runnin' through my shoes
With the sittin' by the road side wishin' I was inside continental Trailways blues
I got the wishin' I was downtown waitin' on a Greyhound
