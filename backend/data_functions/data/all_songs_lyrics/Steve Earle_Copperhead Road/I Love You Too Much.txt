I Love You Too Much Lyrics
Ooh pretty baby, what you doing to me?
The way your kisses burn right through me
I don't think I can last much longer
I get weaker and my love gets stronger
I don't think that my heart can take it
One little slip of a word might break it
Well, believe me, baby, this ain't no crush
I think maybe I love you too much

Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby
Baby, I love you too much
Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby
Baby, I love you too much

I tell myself that this ain't no big thing
Then you give another little tug on that heartstring
Well, you cut me, darling, and I'm still bleeding
Just touch me, baby, that's all I'm needing
You must think that I'm easy, don't you?
'Cause I've got scars that I've never shown you
Well, every inch of me burns for your touch
I think maybe I love you too much
Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby
Baby, I love you too much
Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby
Baby, I love you too muchEmbed
