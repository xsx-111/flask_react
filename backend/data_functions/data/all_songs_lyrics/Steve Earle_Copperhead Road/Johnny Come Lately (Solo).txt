Johnny Come Lately (Solo) LyricsI'm an American, boys, I've come a long way
I was born and bred in the USA
So listen up close, I've got something to say
Boys, I'm buying this round
Well it took a little while but we're in this fight
And we ain't going home until we've done what's right
We're going to drink Camden Town dry tonight
If I have to spend my last pound
When I first got to London it was pouring down rain
Met a little girl in the field canteen
Painted her name on the nose of my plane
Six more missions, I'm gone
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might
Then the warden came around yelling "shut out the lights"
Death raining out of the London night
We made love until dawn
But when Johnny come lately, comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waiting at the station down in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home
My P-47 is a pretty good ship
And she took a round coming cross the Channel last trip
I was thinking about my baby and letting her rip
Always got me through so far
Well they can ship me all over this great big world
Never find nothing like my North End girl
I'm taking her home with me one day, Sir
Soon as we win this war
But when Johnny come lately, comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waiting at the station down in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home
Now my granddaddy sang me this song
Told me about London when the Blitz was on
How he married Grandma and brought her back home
A hero throughout his land
Now I'm standing on a runway in San Diego
A couple purple hearts and I move a little slow
There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows
About a place called Vietnam
But when Johnny come lately, comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waiting at the station down in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching homeEmbed
