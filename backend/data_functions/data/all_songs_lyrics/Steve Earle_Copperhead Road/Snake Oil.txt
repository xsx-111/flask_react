Snake Oil LyricsOne
Two
Three
Four
Pass me that can o' oil there
Oh, I like that echo
It goes right through my head, just like it
I had that happen once but
It's chemically induced
One, two
One, two, three, four
Ladies and gentlemen, attention please
Come in close so everyone can see
I got a tale to tell, a listen don't cost a dime
If you believe that, we're going to get along just fine
Now I've been travelin' all around
I heard trouble's come to your town
I got a little somethin'
Guaranteed to ease your mind
It's called Snake Oil, y'all
It's been around for a long, long time
Well, your crops will burn, if it don't rain soon
Ain't seen a drop since the tenth of June
Well, I can open up the sky
People have no fear
If you ain't impressed yet
Tell me what you want to hear
Well, you lost your farm so you moved to town
You get a job, they shut the factory down
Now you sit around all day long feeling sad and blue
You need Snake Oil, y'all
To tell you what I'm going to do
Step right up!
I can heal the sick and I can mend the lame
And the blind shall see again, it's all the same
Well, ain't your President good to you?
Knocked 'em dead in Libya, Grenada too
Now he's taking his show a little further down the line
Between me and him, people
You're going to get along just fine
It's called Snake Oil y'all
Snake Oil y'all, Snake Oil y'all
Called Snake Oil y'all
It's called Snake Oil y'all
It's been around for a long, long timeEmbed
