San Antonio Girl Lyrics
Since I first saw you, I've been thinking about you
And now I'm out here on the highway going crazy without you
I can't help but want you, girl, you're young and pretty
But somehow I can't see you up in New York City now

I'm gonna leave you alone in your own little world
Won't you be my San Antonio girl?
Be my San Antonio girl
Be my, be my, be my San Antonio girl

Now I know you've heard the story about the life in the fast lane
What they didn't tell you is you come home on a slow train
I'd just as soon remember you the way that I found you
Dancing by yourself with the stars all around you

I'm gonna leave you alone in your own little world
Won't you be my San Antonio girl?
Be my San Antonio girl
Be my, be my, be my San Antonio girl

Hey now won't you, won't you be my San Antonio girl?Embed
