My Baby Worships Me LyricsLet me tell you â€˜bout the girl of mine
Got her walkin' down th'assembly line
She bring the paycheck home to me
My baby, she worships me
She like the way I walk
She like the way I talk
That woman can't let me be
My baby, she worships me
Go tell her, she pays the bill
She make the payment on my Coupe de Ville
She leave a 20 for me every day
My baby, she pays my way
She like the way I walk
She like the way I talk
That woman can't let me be
My baby, she worships me
My baby, she treat me right
We ain't never been in a fight
Once she caught me with her best friend Sue
She just giggled, say "Ain't he cute?"
She like the way I walk
She like the way I talk
That woman can't let me be
My baby, she worships me
My baby, she worships meEmbed
