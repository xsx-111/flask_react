Aqua Lyrics
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me about it
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me – never again

I don't feel anything
All sensation is closed to me
I saw you put the needle in
I can still see
Everything

Don't touch me
Don't talk to me about it
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me – never again

Take me to a quiet place
Throw me in the water
Watch the bubbles surface as
I'm slowly sinking under

Don't touch me
Don't talk to me about it
Don't talk to me
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me – never again
Never again, never again
Never again, never again
Never again
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me about it
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me – never again
Never again, never again
Never again, never again
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me about it
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me – never again
Never again, never again
Never again, never again
Never again
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me about it
Don't talk to me
Don't touch me
Don't talk to me – never againEmbed
