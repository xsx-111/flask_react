You Take Some Lentils and You Take Some Rice Lyrics
And the dream is running
Hungry when...
And he comes, he comes to this little hut, and he knocks on the door
A little woman comes out
He says, "Do you have anything for me?"
And the lady says, "You know, look, I don't have any food already made, but here is some lentils and here is some rice, please cook them yourself and I can, you know, help you"
And he comes, he comes to this little hut, and he knocks on the door
A little woman comes out
He says, "Do you have anything for me?"
See he takes his little pot and he puts his lentils and his rice in there and he puts some water
And the lady says, "You know, look, I don't have any food already made, but here is some lentils and here is some rice, please cook them yourself and I can, you know, help you"
It's, it's a very, very simple
You know, I can help you that way
And finally he's ready and he takes and he sits and with a little plate he made out of the leaves
See he takes his little pot and he puts his lentils and his rice in there and he puts some water in there and starts cooking and it takes a long time, the wood's really wet and smoking, and it's, it's a very, very agonizing
And finally he's ready and he takes and he puts it on a plate he has made out of the leavesEmbed
