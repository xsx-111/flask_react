Fame Lyrics
Fame!
Fame, fame makes a man take things over
Fame, fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame! Fame! Fame!
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame! Fame! Fame!
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame! Fame! Fame! Fame!

"Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to, crime
Fame!
Fame! Fame! Fame! Fame!
Fame! Fame!

Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame! Fame!
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame! Fame!
Bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain
Fame! Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!
Fame!Embed
