Here Comes the Rain Again  Lyrics
Thank you!

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

Baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Baby, walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion (Oooooh)
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
Baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do (Oooooh, yeah!)
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Oooooh, yeah!Embed
