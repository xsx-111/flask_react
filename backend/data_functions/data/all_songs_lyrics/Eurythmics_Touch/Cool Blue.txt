Cool Blue Lyrics
Blue – the colour suits you
Cool blue
How will you stay this way for ever?
Blue again
It's a lasting chill
To keep you cold as winter

How can I forget you?
I'm never gonna give you up
How can I forget you, baby?
I'm never gonna give you up

Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again

Blue – the colour fools you
Cool blue
I'll never stay the way for ever

How can I forget you?
I'm never gonna give you up
How can I forget you, baby?
I'm never gonna give you up
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again

How could she fall for a boy like that?
How could she fall for a boy like that?
How could she fall for a boy like that?
How could she fall for a boy like that?

Blue – the colour suits you
Cool blue
Blue – the colour fools you
Blue again
Blue
Cool blue
How will you stay this way for ever?

How can I forget you, baby?
I'm never gonna give you up
How can I forget you, baby?
I'm never gonna give you up
How can I forget you, baby?
I'm never gonna give you up
How can I forget you, baby?
I'm never gonna give you upEmbed
