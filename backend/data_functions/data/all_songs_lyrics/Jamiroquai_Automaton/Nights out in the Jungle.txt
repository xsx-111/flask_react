Nights out in the Jungle Lyrics
Jungle

Rich kids in their supercars
Plastic gangsters, washed up movie stars
Angels in their stripper wear
Baby, I'm so wasted, I don't care

Nights out in the jungle
Always bring me down
Nights out in the jungle
You’ll be seeing us around
Nights out in the jungle
Gonna get that habit straight
Nights out in the jungle
I’m so early when I’m late

Painted ladies gigolos
Cracked up from their head down to their toes
It’s all up-town chic and downtown fear
Eyeline smeared with help me someone tears
Drag queens in their limousines
Sometimes this jungle makes me wanna scream
Nights out in the jungle
Nights out in the jungle
Nights out in the jungle
Nights out in the jungle

Rich kids in their supercars
Plastic gangsters, washed up movie stars
It’s all up-town chic and down-town fear
Eyeline smeared with someone tears
Angels in their stripper wear
Baby, I’m so wasted, I don’t care

Nights out in the jungle
In the jungle, nights out in the jungle
Nights out in the jungle
In the jungle
Nights out in the jungle
Nights out in the jungle
Nights out in the jungle
Nights out in the jungleEmbed
