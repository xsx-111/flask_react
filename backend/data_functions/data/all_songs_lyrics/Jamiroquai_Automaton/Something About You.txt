Something About You Lyrics
Something, baby, about you
That I can’t let go of since that night
Something, baby, about you
That was feeling right
Right, all night
Some things you don’t think you’re missing
‘Til you know you want them back so much
Dancin' something like I used to do with you

I got to say I still think about
All the things we did
I couldn’t find a way to work it out
I didn’t know how to give
It’s so tragic
To lose that magic
And now I’m alone
I see your smile in every dream
My heart is stone. baby
Why’d I have to be so mean?
Feel like dancin'
Feel like dancin'
Takin' chances

Something, baby, about you
That I can’t let go of since that night
Something, baby, about you
That was feeling right
Right, all night
Some things you don’t think you’re missing
‘Til you know you want them back so much
Dancin' something like I used to do with you
I remember
We were freaks out on the beach
Like Nebuchadnezzar
Sweet love from dusk to dawn
‘Til the sky ran out of stars yeah
Feel like dancing
Feel like dancing
You’re like candy crush
Two hits I was addicted to ya
Baby, gets a rush
Thinkin' of these night manoeuvres
Feel like dancing
Feel like dancing
Takin' chances

Something, baby, about you
That I can’t let go of since that night
Something, baby, about you
That was feeling right
Right, all night
Some things you don’t think you’re missing
‘Til you know you want them back so much
Dancin' something like I used to do with you
I had sixteen days of your magic
When you took me on a crazy trip
Still underneath it couldn’t be more tragic
Everything was hidden in your kiss
Something about you
Something like I used to do with you
Something about you
Something like I used to do with you
Something about you
Something like I used to do with you
Got to say
Something about you
Something like I used to do with you
Got to say
All night it’s
All night it’s
All night it’s1Embed
