Summer Girl Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, yeah, alright
That summer girl, she keeps me dreamin'

While every heart is flutterin’
She walks the street outside
Sets every pulse a-racin’
They’re looking, she don’t mind
Summer girl
Oh that summer girl
And she don’t care for money
‘Cause she got all she needs
Got legs like liquid honey
Eyes the colour of the sea
Oh that summer girl
You know
While every wolf is whistling
And every dog’s a fool
She knows they're so bereft
Of everything she thinks is cool
Summer girl
Oh that summer girl
And I’ve got a midnight crisis
It’s taking over me
No tricks for sweet seduction
No stealing fantasies
From summer girl
No diamonds or pearls
Summer girl
Feels like I’m in love again
Oh that summer girl
I want that summer girl
Summer girl
You wander past my window
I need you summer girl
I want you in my world

She sips her limoncello
All dressed in gabardine
It’s gonna take a special fellow
To melt that icy queen
Summer girl
Oh that summer girl
No jetset interlopers
Gonna move in quick
No billion dollar playboys
‘Cause she won’t miss a trick
Summer girl
Summer girl
She likes to talk politics

Summer girl
Feels like I'm in love again
Oh, that summer girl
(Oh, that summer)
I want that summer girl
(Oh, that summer)
Summer girl, I didn’t think I’d want you so
No, no, no
Summer girl
Hell I need you in my world
(Summer girl get down with me)
Baby, summer girl
You got the flow I want inside my life
Oh, that summer girl
How am I gonna live without you?
(You're the magic that I need)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Summer girl
Feels like I’m in love again
Oh that summer girl
Oh that summer
I want that summer girl
Oh that summer
Summer girl
You wander past my window
I need you summer girl
I want you in my world
Summer girl
Ooh, yeah, alright
Summer girl, ooh, yeah1Embed
