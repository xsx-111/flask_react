Hot Property Lyrics
You know that she’s hot property
That girl is hot hot hot hot property
Oh baby, she’s hot property
My baby’s hot hot hot hot property

I couldn’t tell you why
I couldn’t give you answers
What I know is this
Baby, she’s a dancer
Don’t you ever cross the line
She can be deadly very dangerous
Her mind’s a razor blade
And now she knows she got it made because
She just killed a man

You know that she’s hot property
That girl is hot hot hot hot property
She keeps me on top, good to me
My baby’s hot hot hot hot property

Some girls they think they might get a leg over her
But she’s ooh got so much to spare
Don’t ever think she doesn’t pack of piece
That’s fully greased
Don’t you dare
She my life blood night nurse killer in a tight skirt
45’ what you want
You better handle her with kid gloves
Handle her with kid gloves
She’s hot property
That girl is hot hot hot hot property
I like her a lot, the world can see
My baby’s hot hot hot hot property

I’ve got myself a little piece of hot property
Hot property
Hot property
Hot property
Hey baby, you’re are a steely eyed missile man
(She works all night)
(She works all night)
(She works all night)
She’s hot

You know that she’s hot, she’s hot property
That girl is hot hot hot hot property
She keeps me on top, so good to me
My baby’s hot hot hot hot property

(That girl is so hot)
(That girl is so hot)
(That girl is so hot)1Embed
