Carla Lyrics
Baby, you know I’ll always tell you straight
Make sure you’re well equipped to navigate
The world and its lies
So, baby, don’t cry
I love the way you are my open book
I see your innocence in every look
You’re my sunshine
I feel music in your love

When I hold you in my arms, I feel your soft breath
See you close your eyes and watch your head rest
Right next to mine
I feel the rhythm of your precious little heart
Makes up for when I’ve had mine pulled apart
Now I’ve tried to give you a much better start
In this life

Carla
Look what you’ve done to me
You’ve made my life complete
Carla
I’d give you anything
My light my world I bring
So many roads I knew that I could choose
All my mistakes I only made for you
I hope you realize
When you look in my eyes
Sweet child, you know that I’m your daddy kool
Nobody’s ever gonna treat you like a fool
Oh, you’re my sunbeam child
Try not to be wild (like daddy)

Your smile you can turn the tears I had to gold dust
I’m the only one you know you can trust
I’m always there
When I hold your little hand, I get a sweet rush
Nothing’s ever gonna come between us
I’m always there don’t you be scared, baby

Carla
I want the world to see
How much you mean to me
Carla
No one can ever know
The way you make me glow
I’d give you anything
My light, my world I bring
Look what you’ve done to me
You’ve made my life complete
Carla, Carla
Carla, Carla
Carla, Carla
Carla, Carla
Babe, did you know you’re doing this?
Babe, did you know you’re doing this?
Look what you’ve done to me
You’ve made my life complete
Look what you’ve done to me
You’ve made my life complete
