Nice and Spicy LyricsCome on baby, let me take you dancing
Hit it baby, you know where I like
Can’t you help me, do that extra favor
You're nice and spicy, sure it’s feeling right
I’m sure you're wrong, they’re here tonight
Lay on me baby one more time
Get my kicks, I’m feeling slick
Knowing you can never be a crime
Can you see my face, I’m in hyperspace
Baby I can’t get you off my brain
Watch me now, you’ll see how
Life is nice and spicy once again
It’s not a problem, you can’t make me linger
I take you driving, got you in the car
I talked to you last week, want you to be my lady
I got your sunshine, I might want your star
I’m sure you're wrong, they’re here tonight
Lay on me baby one more time
Get my kicks, I’m feeling slick
Knowing you can never be a crime
Can you see my face, I’m in hyperspace
Baby I can’t get you off my brain
Watch me now, you’ll see how
Well you know my memories are hazy
But I know you drive me crazy (you're nice and spicy)
Gonna help myself to fast lust
'Cause I might not be able to get it twice
I’ve been thinking about you
You're nice and spicy, it’s true
I’ve been thinking about you
You're nice and spicy, it’s true
Nice and nice and nice and spicy
Nice and nice and nice and spicy
Nice and nice and nice and spicy
Life is nice and spicy
I’m sure you're wrong, they’re here tonight
Lay on me baby one more time
Get my kicks, I’m feeling slick
Knowing you can never be a crime
Can you see my face, I’m in hyperspace
Baby I can’t get you off my brain
Watch me now, you’ll see how
Life is nice and spicy once again
Life is nice and spicy
Life is nice and spicy
Life is nice and spicyEmbed
