Automaton Lyrics
(Automaton)
Am I love?
Every heart is beating
I'm all love
Can't you feel me feeling?
Take my hand (automaton)
Cold like a junkie (automaton)
I'm an ice cold man (automaton)
(I'm an ice cold man)
(Automaton)
Why am I crying for you?

All this love I felt for you
Has gone away to another place (It's a digital life)
I put my faith in a digital world
Where they've given me
Eyes without a face
I steal the moon on silver nights
Remind myself I am someone
My soul is null and void tonight
I'm automaton (I'm automaton)

I'm so tough
Can't you see me running?
See, I can touch
Can you feel me coming?
I see the world
And cry for freedom
These metal eyes, they can't disguise
The fact that I
Need something to believe in
But then I'm dying for you
I said goodbye to the world I knew
And took off into inner space (It's a digital life)
Weren't you the ones who promised me
A very different place?
I power up, get my program set
And tilt my head toward the sun
Inside I know, I'm null and void
I'm automaton

Automaton
Automaton
Automaton
Automaton
Hey, you got me down underground
Gettin' holed up in my cyber lounge
As if I had time to break that down
(Automaton)
Whatever you can do I can override it
Got a million ways to synthesize it
Digital android, I can fight it
Fi-fi-fight it out
Automaton (It's a digital life)
Automaton (Digital life)
Automaton (A digital life)
Automaton
Feel like a man who fell to Earth
But this is not where I belong
They rule my life from a metal box
That's windowless
And I wonder where it all goes wrong
Maybe this dream will stay alive
But can the madness be undone?
Am I the new intelligence?

I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
It's a digital life
It's a digital life
You know I need something I can hold onto, hold onto
(You were all I knew)
(I'm automaton)
I need something
I can hold onto, hold onto
(This was all I knew)
(I'm automaton)9Embed
