Vitamin Lyrics
Never get the chance to dip so far inside your mind
But I know you’ll believe me
I never get the chance to do the things I really like
Instead you always tease me
I’m thinking all the time I used to wanna be with you
But now that things are changing
Somehow you can make me red and then you make me blue
You see what I’ve been facing
Some people find a way to do it
Some people really find a way to choose it
I’ve been thinking

Girl, you know I wanna get it through
Gonna keep the flow
I don’t need no vitamin
Get some funk and love in your life, girl
Is this what sweet lovers have to choose?
Gonna keep the flow
I don’t need no vitamin

I’m thinking all the time I used to wanna be with you
But I know now it ain’t workin’
I’m talking to the birds and bees about it and they all agree
They can see I’m hurtin’
I’ve got, telepathic, Instamatic
Memories of you that I’ve been keeping
I don’t need no vitamin
Don’t blink, baby, 'til I’m gone
(Are you listening? All you listen in, are you listening?)

Girl, you know I wanna get it through
Gonna keep the flow
I don’t need no vitamin
Get some funk and love in your life, girl
Is this what sweet lovers have to choose
Gonna keep the flow
I don’t need no vitamin
Get some funk and love in your life, girl

Girl, you know I wanna get it through
Gonna keep the flow
Get some funk and love in your life, girl
Girl, you know I wanna get it through
I don’t need no vitamin
You've got that magic touch
You've got that magic touch
You've got that magic touch
You've got that magic touch
You've got that magic touch...Embed
