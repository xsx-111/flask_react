Secret Door Lyrics
Turn out the lights
Feed the fire
'Til my soul breaks free
My heart is high
As the waves above me

Don't need to understand
Too lost to lose
Don't fight my tears
'Cause they feel so good

And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back
Through the same secret door

Look past the end
It's a dream
As it's always been
All life lives on
If we've ever loved it
And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back
Through the same secret door

I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back
Through the same secret door3Embed
