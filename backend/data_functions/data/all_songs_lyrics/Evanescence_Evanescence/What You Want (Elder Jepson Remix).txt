What You Want (Elder Jepson Remix) LyricsDo what you, what you want
Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
(Do what you, what you want)
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through
(Do what you, what you want)
Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
(Do what you, what you want)
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through
Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through
Do what you, what you want
You don't have to lay your life down
(It isn't over)
Do what you, what you want
Till you find what you're looking for
(Got to remember who you really are)
Every heart in my hands
Like a pale reflection
Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
Do what you, what you want
Your world’s closing in on you now (It isn’t over)
Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)
There's still time
Close your eyes
Only love will guide you home
Tear down the walls and free your soul
Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be way to learn forgiveness
Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through
Hello, hello, it's only me
Infecting everything you love
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
Do what you, what you want!
Do what you, what you want!Embed
