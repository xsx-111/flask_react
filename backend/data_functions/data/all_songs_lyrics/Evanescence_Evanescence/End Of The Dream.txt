End Of The Dream Lyrics
I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
And I remember why I know this place
I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me

As much as it hurts
Ain’t it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart 'til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

I’m not afraid
I pushed through the pain
And I’m on fire
I remember how to breathe again

As much as it hurts
Ain’t it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart 'til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?
I will find a way
Even without wings
Follow your heart
'Til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Follow your heart
'Til it bleeds
And we’ve come to the end of the dream3Embed
