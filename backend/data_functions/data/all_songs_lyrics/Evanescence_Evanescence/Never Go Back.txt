Never Go Back Lyrics
Everything is so dark and I know there's something wrong
But I can't turn the light on
In that split second change when you knew we couldn't hold on
I realized I live to love you

Save yourself, don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known
Sleeps beneath the waves, but I remember

I won't give up on you, I can feel you in my heart
Just show me the way, I don't belong here
Alone
I can still see your face where it's burned into my mind
I die every time I close my eyes, you're always there

Save yourself, don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known
Sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning, without your love
I am lost and I can never go back home
All across the ocean
We are calling, calling
Are you there?
Nothing left for me till I find you because it's
All gone
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning
Without your love
I am lost and I can never go back
I can never go back home4Embed
