Strange Fruit LyricsSouthern trees
Bearing strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
And blood at the roots
Black bodies
Swinging in the Southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin'
From the poplar trees
Pastoral scene
Of the gallant south
Them big, bulging eyes
And the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia
Clean and fresh
Then, the sudden smell
Of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit
For the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the leaves to drop
Here is
Strange and bitter crop24Embed
