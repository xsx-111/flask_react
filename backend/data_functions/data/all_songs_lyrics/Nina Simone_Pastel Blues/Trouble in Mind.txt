Trouble in Mind LyricsTrouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some day
Trouble in mind, it's true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much
Trouble in my life before
I'm all alone at midnight
And my lamp is burnin' low
Ain't never had so much
Trouble in my life before
I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
Let the 2: 19 train
Ease my troubled mind
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some day
I'm gonna lay, lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
Let the 2: 19 train
Ease my troubled mind
Say, trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
My back door some day
I'm gonna lay on my head
On some lonesome railroad line
Let the 2: 19 train
Ease my troubled mind
Trouble in mind, yes, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some day
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some day
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some day
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some day
Oh boy, 'cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some dayEmbed
