Tell Me More and More and Then Some LyricsI want more, more and then some
Daddy you know what I want to hear
I want some more and then some
That I love you only dear
I want some more and then some
Of how you feel and then
When you done told me a million times how you love me
And you through
Start right back in again
I've made the same mistake
I know the awful ache
Of a little heart that's been double-crossed
The waiting's been so long, so long
It's hard to be believin'
I thought I missed my guess
I thought happiness for me was lost
I want more, some more, some more, and then some
You know how I love that stuff
But from now on
To doomsday
But I never no no no
I never will get enoughEmbed
