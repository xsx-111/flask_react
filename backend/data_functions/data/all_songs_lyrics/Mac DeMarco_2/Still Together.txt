Still Together Lyrics
In time she'll see that her and me
Were meant to be, together
And time will pass, it may go fast
But we'll still be together
And where I go she's at my side, half of my life, together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

Together
Together

I've had my share, it's just not fair
That we should be together
But if it's fine, that I've done my time
Let's walk the line together
And when she's low, I'll always know
We'll always go together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above, together

Together
Together
Together
Together
Mac: Kiki. Kiki? Hey. Time for bed. You're sleeping! Let's go. Ready?
Kiki: I have a bruise there
Mac: Yeah, you got a little indentation from the glasses that you fell asleep with on your face. I love you10Embed
