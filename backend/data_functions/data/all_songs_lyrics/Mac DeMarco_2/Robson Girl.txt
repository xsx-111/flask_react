Robson Girl Lyrics
Maybe when we're older
We can try this over
Lovin' on the sidelines
Another one of my kind

Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy

No one else's shoulder
I felt, could be colder
Lovin' on the sidelines
Just one street on my mind
(AH!)

Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
That's a wrap8Embed
