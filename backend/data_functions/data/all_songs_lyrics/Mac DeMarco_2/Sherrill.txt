Sherrill LyricsGetting hard to remember, getting hard to recall
Getting laid off and pushed out and it ain't my baby's fault
So if you go, don't cry, I'll be right there at your side
Sherrill, Sherrill
Getting laid on the lifeline, getting tired, time for bed
And there's no use getting worked up, I'll remember all you said
And if you go, don't cry, I'll be right there at your side
Sherrill, Sherrill, Sherrill, Sherrill1Embed
