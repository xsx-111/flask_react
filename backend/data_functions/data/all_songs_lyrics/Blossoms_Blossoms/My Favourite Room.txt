My Favourite Room Lyrics
My friends tell me that I'm stupid
And I should be alone
Without you, it's no fun
And I don't think I'm thinking straight
And I don't think I wanna wait
Alone, without you
With you, how do I feel
With you, you make it so real

When you were mine, you were so kind
But you went and changed your mind
And now I don't know what I should do with you

You would tell me everyday
That I'm all yours and it's okay
But no, you don't know
You tell me you know you did wrong
You tell me that I belong with you
In my favourite room
With you, how do I feel
With you, you make it so real
When you were mine, you were so kind
But you went and changed your mind
Did you think how might I feel
Did you think how might I feel, oh no
You're gonna get it girl
With you, I don't know how I feel
With you, you're gonna get it girl

If you were mine
I'd treat you so kind
But if you find another lover
I picture me pleasantly
And I'll hold you in my favourite room5Embed
