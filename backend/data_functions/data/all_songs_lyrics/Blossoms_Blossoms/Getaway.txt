Getaway Lyrics
Your room, I leave, white door open for me
Dead leaves upon the grass
I walked myself clean through seventy dreams
We broke like a paper seam
But when it breaks don't cry
I'll always hold someplace for you

I'm over you, you're under me
This is the last time, don't say it's the last time
Call me up, you've got me choking up
If we're in love, tonight we can get away

Too soon, I'll wait, they say 'boy you should know
This will never work out'
But you say 'you're my best friend, boy you should know
What if forever works out?'
Then if it works let's try
I'll always hold someplace for you

I'm over you, you're under me
This is the last time, don't say it's the last time
Call me up, you've got me choking up
If we're in love, tonight we can get away
You say how could I, I say 'it's a long time coming'
You say 'can we try?', I say 'it's a waste of time loving'

I'm over you, you're under me
This is the last time, don't say it's the last time
Call me up, you've got me choking up
If we're in love, tonight we can get away

(Tonight we can get away)
Tonight we can get away
(Tonight we can get away)
Tonight we can get away
(Tonight we can get away)
Tonight we can get away4Embed
