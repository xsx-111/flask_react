At Most a Kiss Lyrics
I wrote to fear, he disappeared
At most a kiss this time
I'll be your boy, I'll pocket the earth
Into the abyss we'll climb
At most a kiss this time

Is it on?
Someone said that you'd left town
But I've been holding on too long
Someone said that 'boy she's gone'
If it's on then I'm yours so let me know

She worded her man 'let's elope to Japan
Between rosemary wild we'll hide'
I thought I was your boy, the earth's on hold
A pocket of storm I'll find
At most a kiss this time

Is it on?
Someone said that you'd left town
But I've been holding on too long
Someone said that 'boy she's gone'
If it's on then I'm yours so let me know
I was thinking you were always mine
We watched the skies fall down
We'll carry on when worlds divide
This heart it beats but it makes no sound

Is it on?
Someone said that you'd left town
But I've been holding on too long
Someone said that 'boy she's gone'
If it's on then I'm yours so let me know

At most a kiss
At most a kiss
At most a kiss
