Blow Lyrics
The cold road is all I know
The old road is where she blows
The cold road is all I know
The old road is where she blows
This girl never cried for love

The last time I asked you why
The last time she saw me cry
The last time I asked you why
The last time she saw me cry
This girl never shy for her love

And it's everywhere she goes
I don't know if it's love that you want
All the love I want
Yeah she blows
Yeah she blows
Yeah she blows
Oh, she blows

The cold road is all I know
The old road is where she blows
The cold road is all I know
The old road is where she blows
This girl never cried for her love
x2
And it's everywhere she goes
I don't know if it's love that you want
All the love I want
Yeah she blows
Yeah she blows
Yeah she blows
Oh, she blows3Embed
