Honey Sweet Lyrics
I'm out, will she love me?
I'm still seeing honey sweet
You shout 'don't you leave me'
'Don't you leave this incomplete'

I wanna know if this road
Belongs to my eyes and only mine

Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet, honey sweet

I'm out, I heard a heavy creek
Behind my window, honey sweet
There's no doubt you still love me
You'd still love this incomplete

I wanna know if this road
Belongs to my eyes and only mine
Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet, honey sweet

Teardrops stain skies of thunder
Autumn pain, change my number
I've seen you two about
And talk about rebounding

Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet
Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet

Honey sweet
Honey sweet
Honey sweet
Honey sweet
