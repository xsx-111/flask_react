Deep Grass Lyrics
I just can't keep my mind off you
But I don't know why
It seems to make it worse at night
I heard you nearby, let's fly
Back to the sound of rain
That you love, you love
I keep myself awake at night
Thinking of ways to make it right

I don't really think we tried
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe they're right
You don't ever see my side
While the pain still remains
I loved you in vain

A morning wind began
A wandering mind
That needs to keep a check on you
I'll hate what I find, I need time
To heal this heart
Unspoken, broken
I keep myself awake at night
Thinking of ways to make it right
But I don't really think we tried
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe they're right
You don't ever see my side
While the pain still remains
I loved you in vain
I'll give you my last piece of mind
Cos' maybe this time give me a sign
To the deep grass we'll hide
While the pain still remains
I loved you in vain

Still I wonder
So kiss me under
Moon-lit thunder
Stay a little longer

But I don't really think we tried
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe they're right
You don't ever see my side
While the pain still remains
I loved you in vain
I'll give you my last piece of mind
Cos' maybe this time give me a sign
To the deep grass we'll hide
While the pain still remains
I loved you in vain2Embed
