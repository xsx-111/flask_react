Texia Lyrics
Black tattered eyes, she's dressed in white
Cold afternoons left in my mind
We walked, I talked it through with you
It's just no use, our love won't bind

Don't be fooled by her lipstick gaze
Veils of cool shelter times she strayed
For days I made it through

I'm running out of the dark with you
With you, I'm running out of the dark
With you, with you, with you

For the thousandth time, the fountain floods
Watch skies align then leave me numb
You call, I've fallen like the fool
You know I am, but I never knew

I'm fooled by her lipstick gaze
Veils of cool shelter times she strayed
For days I made it through
I'm running out of the dark with you
With you, I'm running out of the dark
With you, with you, with you

Like storms in evening rain
We'll watch it fall apart
We'll watch it fall apart

I'm running out of the dark with you
With you, I'm running out of the dark
With you, with you
I'm running out of the dark with you
With you, I'm running out of the dark
With you, with you
With you2Embed
