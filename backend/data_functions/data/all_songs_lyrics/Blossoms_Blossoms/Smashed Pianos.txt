Smashed Pianos Lyrics
I wish I didn't care like I do
It feels like I'm losing you too
I wish I didn't stare like I do
But I might be over you soon

I wish I didn't care like I do
It always brought me back to you too
I wish I didn't stare like I do
Can you send me someone new soon?

Let's think it through
I'll still think of you
But I can't switch off and on like you do
I think it's something I need to work on
And if we're through
I'll still think of you
But I can't switch off and on like you do
We crash like smashed pianos

I wish I didn't care like I do
It feels like I'm losing you too
I wish I didn't stare like I do
But I might be over you soon
Let's think it through
I'll still think of you
But I can't switch off and on like you do
I think it's something I need to work on
And if we're through
I'll still think of you
But I can't switch off and on like you do
We crash like smashed pianos
Let's think it through
I'll still think of you
But I can't switch off and on like you do
I think it's something I need to work on
And if we're through
I'll still think of you
But I can't switch off and on like you do
We crash like smashed pianos

In the room I found you
Fallen stars and tears I want you
Many mornings, salley gardens
Smashed pianos
Smashed pianos
Smashed pianos
