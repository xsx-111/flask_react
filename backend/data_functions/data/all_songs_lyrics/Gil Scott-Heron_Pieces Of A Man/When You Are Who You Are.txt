When You Are Who You Are Lyrics
You always go out of your way to impress me
Don't you know by now, ain't no need to impress me?
I'm impressed every time you smile
When I feel like you mean to smile
â€˜Cause you can be so very beautiful
When you are who you are

Every morning, when you wake up
You put on a new disguise
How long did you think it would take me to realize?
Girl, the things you were ain't real
You never tell me just how you feel
Girl, you could be so very beautiful
When you are who you are

People never seem to want to be themselves
So they end up running in circles confused
Yes, confused, just like everyone else

Come on, Norberto

Every morning, when you wake up, you put on a new disguise
Just how long did you think it would take me to realize?
That the things you were ain't real
You never tell me just how you feel
When you could be so very beautiful
If you are who you are
Yeah, when you are who you
Are, yeah, oh, when you are who you
Are, yeah, oh, when you are who you
Are, yeah, when you are who you are
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Oh, when you are who you
Are, yeah, oh, when you are who you
Are, yeah, oh, when you are who you
Are, yeah, oh, when you are who you are2Embed
