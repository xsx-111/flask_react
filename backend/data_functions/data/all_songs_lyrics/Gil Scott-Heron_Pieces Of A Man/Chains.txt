Chains LyricsBlack & Blues - “Chains”


The first thing that you noticed in the morning
Is that there’s not a cloud in the sky
And, Lord, you can’t help, you can’t help but remember
Your woman, oh, how she cried all night
How much longer can this go on?
You pushed me past the point of being strong
I got to get away, oh yeah, from these chains
I got to get away, yeah, away from these chains

Standing over yonder is the driver.  You know he’ll
Be there every morning, cracking the whip
Cracking the whip in his hand, and my
Back, my back is bent from dawn until
Sunset.  I don’t know
How much more of this, more of this I
Can stand.  Lord
Every day, somebody new holding me down
Brothers and sisters, what is this Hell on Earth I
Have found?  I got to
Get away, got to get away from these
Chains.  I got to get
Away, yeah, away from
These chains
Chains, yeah.  Off these
Chains, yeah.  Pull off these
Chains, yeah.  Off these
Chains, yeah.  Pull off these
Chains, yeah1Embed
