Lady Day and John Coltrane Lyrics
Ever feel kind of down and out
You don't know just what to do?
Living all of your days in darkness
Let the sun shine through
Ever feel that somehow, somewhere
You lost your way?
And if you don't get-a help quick
You won't make it through the day?

Could you call on Lady Day?
Could you call on John Coltrane?
Now, ‘cause they'll, they'll wash your troubles
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles away!

Plastic people with plastic minds
Are on their way to plastic homes
No beginning, there ain't no ending
Just on and on and on and on and on
It's all because they're so afraid to say that they're alone
Until our hero rides in, rides in on his saxophone

Could you call on Lady Day?
Could you call on John Coltrane?
Now, ‘cause they'll, they'll wash your troubles
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles away!
All right

Ever feel kind of down and out
You don't know just what to do?
Living all of your days in darkness
Let the sun shine through
Ever feel that somehow, somewhere
You lost your way?
And if you don't get-a help quick
You won't make it through the day?

Could you call on Lady Day?
And could you call on John Coltrane?
Now, ‘cause they'll, they'll wash your troubles
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles away
They'll wash your troubles away
They'll wash your troubles away
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles, your troubles away
Yeah, they'll wash your troubles away
They'll wash your troubles away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...2Embed
