Save the Children Lyrics
If you're driving through the country on a lazy afternoon
Or you're watching your children playing after school
They seem to be so unaware of... I know, I know
The things that they’ll soon have to take care of

We've got to do something, yeah, to save the children
Soon it will be their turns to try and save the world
Right now, they seem to play such a small part of
The things that they’ll soon be right at the heart of

My little Tommy, he said he wants to be a fireman
And little Mary, she said she got to teach school
If we know all we say we know about the problems, oh
Why can't we do something to try and solve them?


We've got to do something, yeah, to save the children
Soon it will be their turns to try and save the world
We've got to do something, yeah, to save the children
To save the children.  To save the children1Embed
