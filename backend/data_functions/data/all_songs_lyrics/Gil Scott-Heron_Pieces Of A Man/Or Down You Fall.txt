Or Down You Fall Lyrics
I sail on in my paper ship
The sea is made of fire
I ride my horse of nuts and bolts
We’re made to never tire
The world is just a simple circle
I've got to keep on turning
Yeah.  I've got to keep on turning
'Til I fall

Down to the top of a mountain
Inside a hollow stone
I’ll pretend that I'm an iron man, yes
Instead of flesh and bone
The world is just a simple circle
And it keep on turning
Yeah.  And it keep on turning
You've got to

Go away.  I can't stand to see your face
‘Cause you've seen the weakest me
And now you know I'm only human
Instead of all the things I'd like to be
The world is just a simple circle
You've got to keep on turning
Yeah.  You've got to keep on turning
Or down you fall1Embed
