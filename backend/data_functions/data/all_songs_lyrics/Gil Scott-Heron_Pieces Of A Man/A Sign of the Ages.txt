A Sign of the Ages Lyrics
It's a sign of the ages, markings on my mind
Man at the crossroads at odds with an angry sky
There can be no salvation, there can be no rest
Until all old customs are put to the test

The gods are all angry
You hear from the breeze
As night slams like a hammer
Yeah, and you drop to your knees
The questions can't be answered
You're always haunted by the past
The world's full of children
Who grew up too fast

Yeah, but where can you run?
Since there ain't no world of your own
And you know that no one will ever miss you, yeah, yeah
Yeah, when you're finally gone
So you cry like a baby, a baby
Or you go out and get high
But there ain't no peace on Earth, man
Maybe peace when you die, yeah1Embed
