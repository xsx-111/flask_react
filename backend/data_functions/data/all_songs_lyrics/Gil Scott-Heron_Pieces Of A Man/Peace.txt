Peace Lyrics
Word comes up so many, many times
Seems I hear it every day
You know it’s always on my mind
As I struggle to find my way
But I can’t remember half the pain
Things to set my mind at ease
‘Cause I know we’re out here just searching
Struggling, struggling as I am for peace
Echoes, echoes of another world
This world of ours always torn by wars
And it makes you sit down and ask yourself:
Just what am I living for?
And, in the darkness or the dawn
I get down on my knees
Asking the heavens up above me:
Where can a man find peace?  I want
To know: is it a dove flying somewhere over Asia?
Or my brothers losing their lives in the streets?
Or in the shelter of my woman’s arms?  Want to know
Where, where can a man find peace?
It seems that thunder rules my life
Every day, every day, and every sleepless night
And I’ll say, “Tell me.”  Can anybody tell me please?
Which way is the road to peace?  I want
To know: where can a man find peace?
Tell me: where, where can a man find peace?  Tell me:
Which way is the road to peace?
Tell me, tell me1Embed
