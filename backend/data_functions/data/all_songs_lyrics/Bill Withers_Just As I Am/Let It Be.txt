Let It Be Lyrics
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking the words of wisdom, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah-ha, yeah
And in my hour of darkness
She is a-standing right in front of me
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Lord, let it be

Yeah, let it be, oh, let it be
Lord, let it be, Lord, let it be, ah-ha
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah

And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah-ha
And though they may be parted
There is a-still a chance that they might see
There will be an answer, let it be
Lord, let it be, ah
Let it be, let it be
Lord, let it be, Lord, let it be, ah-ha
There will be an answer, let it be
Lord, let it be, let it be, ah
Let it be, let it beEmbed
