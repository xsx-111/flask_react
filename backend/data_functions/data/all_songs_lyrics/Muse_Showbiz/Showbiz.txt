Showbiz Lyrics
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self-destruction
Pushing us into self-destruction

And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams

Trying to please you for too long
Trying to please you for too long
In visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow

And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
And forcing my darkest soul to unfold
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self-destruction!
And pushing us into self-destruction!

And they make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
