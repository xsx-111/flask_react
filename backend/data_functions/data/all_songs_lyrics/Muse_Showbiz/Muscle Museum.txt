Muscle Museum Lyrics
She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time, so
Look the other way
You will wait until it's over
To reveal what you'd never shown her
Too little much too late

Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give?
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own

I have played in every toilet
But you still want to spoil it
To prove I've made a big mistake
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give?
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own

And I'll do it all by myself
And you'll never make it12Embed
