Cave Lyrics
Leave me alone, it's nothing serious
I'll do it myself
It's got nought to do with you
And there's nothing that you could do

You can see it and you can almost hear it too
You can almost taste it
It's nought to do with you
And it's still nothing that you can do

So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away

Please close your ears
And try to look away
So you never hear a single word I say
And don't ever come my way

Leave me alone, it's nothing serious
I'll do it myself
It's got nought to do with you
And there's still nothing that you could do
So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
And arrest me for my mistakes2Embed
