Spiral Static Lyrics
Who's ever known
How much to moan and groan
And quiver inside?
He needs to give you
Everything you need
Is it enough?

You're running out of time
As it grows in your mind
Feel broken inside, you'll feel

Sigh, static moans
A storm growing strong
And it's coming my way
Still she gives you everything you need
Is it enough?

You're running out of time
As it grows in your mind
Feel broken inside, you'll feel

And I'll feel broken inside, you'll feel3Embed
