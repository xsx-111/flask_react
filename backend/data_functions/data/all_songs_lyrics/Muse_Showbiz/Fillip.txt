Fillip Lyrics
It's happening soon, it's happening soon
Its scent has been blowing in my direction
To me it is new, to me it is new
And it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

It's got to be here, it's got to be there
It's got to be now or I'll lose forever
To me it is strange, this feeling is strange
But it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

Accuse me
Trust me, I never knew
That you were the one
You were the one
And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you

And it's gonna be
Our last memory
And it's led me on
And on to you
