Sunburn Lyrics
Come waste your millions here
Secretly, she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow

She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons
Make no mistakes

Come let the truth be shared
No one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cries

She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons
Make no mistakes
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame15Embed
