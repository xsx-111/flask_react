Falling Down Lyrics
I'm falling down and 15,000 people scream
They were all begging for your dream
I'm falling down, 5,000 houses burning down, yeah
No one is gonna save this town

Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't here, no it wasn't here

I was calling your name
But you would never hear me sing
You wouldn't let me begin
So I'm crawling away
'Cause you broke my heart in two, yeah
No, I will not forget you

Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no

Falling away, you never see me fall
No, I could not forget you
Falling down, a thousand houses burning down
No one is gonna save this town, yeah
Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no

Falling down, now the world is upside down, yeah
I'm heading straight for the clouds3Embed
