If My Heart Were a Ball It Would Roll Uphill LyricsDid you ever fall in love
Did you ever fall in love
Did you ever fall in love
Did you ever dream of falling
If my heart were a ball
It would roll uphill
We are alone in the world
We must do what we feel we should
We are told what is right
Need hurts within us
We can see sense
We can feel what feels right
And so often
All these things are not at all the same
They're not at all the same
If my heart were a ball
It would roll uphill
If my heart were a ball
It would roll uphill
Did you ever dream of running
And find you couldn't move
Did you ever dream of running
Running scared
Ankle deep in glue
With the monster after you
And it's catching up
Monsters catching up
And it's catchin' up and you're going nowhere
And you're slowin' up and you can't wake up
And it's catchin' up
And you're going nowhere wake up wake up
You're falling..
If my heart were a ball
It would roll uphill
Did you ever see a shadow
Cast against your bedroom wall
Crooked shadow in the lamplight
Ten feet tall
Did you ever dream of falling
And find you couldn't move
Did you give up
And discover that you haven't given up
Did you ever dream of falling
Did you ever fall in love
Hard ball dream love now roll
Fall clown stain truth space time
Race give black white all one
Church state God fast as I could cry
Laugh hide feel no clouds will
To win sweet seed you me
Hard ball dream love now roll
Fall clown stain truth space time
Never do that, never do that
Will to win, will to win, never do that
Give black white all one wild
Church state now roll
Fall clown stain truth space time
Race fruit
Give
Never do that
If my heart were a ball it would roll uphill
All one insane wild sweet heart
Wild rose
Did you ever fall in love? ..Embed
