Desperation Breeds... LyricsBeekeeper sing of your frustration
In this litigious breeze
Of accidental pollination
In this era without bees
Without bees, without bees
We keep breeding desperation
In this era of thieves
Who keep stealing respiration
From the tenderest of trees, trees
This peculiar incantation
I'm sure you heard it before
Instead of breeding desperation
Make me a pallet on your floor
On your floor, on your floor...1Embed
