Near Death Experience Experience Lyrics
You used to be like toffee between the kitten's teeth
You used to build arid shelters out of sticks and leaves
And spend the whole day underneath
You used to be like copper, pliable but strong
You used to smile and nod, say "you're right"
Be polite when you know that everybody's wrong
Know that everybody's wrong
Know that everybody's wrong
Know that everybody's wrong
So you dare the plane to crash
Redeem the miles for cash when it starts to dive
And we'll dance like cancer survivors
Like we're grateful simply to be alive

Dare the plane to crash, redeem the miles for cash
And we'll dance like cancer survivors
Like your prognosis was that you should've died
No, there's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong when it starts to down
And we'll dance like cancer survivors
Like we're grateful simply to be alive
No, there's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong when it starts to down
And we'll dance like cancer survivorsEmbed
