Sound is a wave like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
Pushing and pulling from shore to shore
Biggest melody you never heard before
What if I were the night sky
What if I were the night sky
Here's my lullaby
My lullaby to leave by
Lullaby to leave by
If I were the night
What if we hadn't been born at the same time
What if you were 75 and I were 9
Would I come visit you
Bring you cookies in an old folks home
Would you be there alone
And when the late summer lightning fires off in your arms
Will I remember to breathe
No I never will
And if I could convince you that I mean you no harm
Just want to show you how not to need
If I were the night sky
Here's my lullaby
My lullaby to leave by
If I were the night
What if we hadn't been each other at the same time
Would you tell me all the stories from when you're young
And in your prime
Would I rock you to sleep
Would you tell all the secrets you don't need to keep
Would I still miss you
Or would you then have been mine
Sound is a wave like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violinEmbed
