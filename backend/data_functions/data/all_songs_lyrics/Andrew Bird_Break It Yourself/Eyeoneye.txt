Eyeoneye LyricsGo ahead and congratulate yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is yours
When the eye that eyes itself is your eye
And the ear that hears itself is too near
Then you're getting too close to your source
You've done the impossible now
You took yourself apart
Made yourself invulnerable
No one can break your heart
So you break it yourself
Bringing your own
Break it yourself
Go ahead and reionize yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is your hand
And you go ahead and wring it out
And you go ahead and stretch it out
And you go ahead and wear it inside out
Day trip in the desert makes this
Boy and girl too wise
Through a raging wall of sand that's
One hundred stories high
So you reionionionize
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneyeoneye
All this time it took to realize
That you could use some help
Bringing your heart breaking the shell
Bringing your heart breaking the shell
Go ahead and defibrillate yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is yours
And you go ahead and wring it out
You go ahead and stretch it out
You go ahead and wear it inside out
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneye
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneye2Embed
