I woke with a start
Crying bullets, beating heart
To hear all God's creatures
Roaring again
Not a cricket was creaking
Or a floorboard was squeaking
And all the world was snoring again
There’s a hole in the ocean floor
There’s a hole in the ocean floor
Stop it bleeding alone
I woke with a start
Crying bullets, beating heart
To hear all God’s creatures
Roaring again…Embed
