Your Love Is Stranger Than Mine Lyrics
Can't you see?
All of the things that I'm trying to say
Are inside of me
I never thought I'd be feeling this way
But I think you've known all the time
Your love is stranger than mine

Seeing you
I can't believe in a love that won't leave
I don't want you to
Be anyone that you don't wanna be
But I think you've known all the time
Your love is stranger than mine

If you are the one
To make it, to break it
If you are the one
Won't you stay with me?

One more time
Getting a feeling afraid that I might be
Out of line
Telling myself there's a chance that you
Could be someone I've known all the time
Your love is stranger than mine
If you are the one
To make it, to break it
If you are the one
Won't you stay with me?

(Your love is stranger)
(Than mine)
(Your love is stranger)
(Than mine)
(Your love is stranger)
(Than mine)1Embed
