Wait LyricsYou're looking nervous at the dealer
Money goes like sand
Slipping through your hands
You're leaving everything behind you
Wave it all goodbye
I can hear you cry
Wait - don't think about it
Wait - it's never too late
Wait - don't worry 'bout it
Wait - leave it all to fate
Wait
Oh no this game is like a nightmare
There can be no doubt
Luck has dealt me out
I'm only searching for the right time
Money on the line
I can hear you cryEmbed
