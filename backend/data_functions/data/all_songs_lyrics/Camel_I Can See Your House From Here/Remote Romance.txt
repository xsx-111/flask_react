Remote Romance LyricsIt's automatic
There's too much static
Ooh your signal's fading
Down goes my rating
Ooh your signal's fading
Remote - remote
Romance - romance
Rush-button passion
I won't repeat it
I won't repeat it
I won't repeat (ha ha ha)
Wait a minute
Wait a minute but...
It's just a sequence
It makes no real sense
It's just a sequence
It makes no real sense
It's automatic
There's too much statix
Can't get no feed-back
I'm on the wrong track
Wait a minute
It don't make a lot of sense
Just a sequence
It makes no real sense2Embed
