Hymn to Her Lyrics

Look to the mirror
I can tell no lies
Time drawing nearer
Still I wonder why

You are the giver
Me I never try
Now we're together
Still I wonder why


Please can you tell me
When you're by my side
And when my eyes see
Will I wonder why

If you are with me
I can only try
To find the answer
In the words that ask the question
Why don't we know
And why don't it show
I wanna find out
Try let it all out




Why don't we know
And why don't it show
I wanna find out
Why
Why
