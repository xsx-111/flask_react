Who We Are Lyrics

Hotel rooms, sleep eludes me
In this strange life I lead
Occasional friends, likewise lovers
Never wanting what I need
If you could be
Here close to me
I know
Oh

Love
We were meant for each other
We will help one another
And it won't really matter at all
Who we are



Wake-up calls in the morning
The empty night fades away
You're still there, I'm still faking
Words I always meant to say
If you could be
Here, we would see
I know
Oh

Love
We were meant for each other
We will help one another
And it won't really matter at all
Who we are


Love
We were meant for each other
We will help one another
And it won't really matter
At all
Who we are


Love
We will live for each other
We will help one another
And it won't really matter
At all
Who we are
Who we are
Who we areEmbed
