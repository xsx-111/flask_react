Neon Magic LyricsNeon magic, a playground for the noise
Got the boys feeling tough, acting rough
Looking for trouble?
You better mind your tongue
Having fun much too much
Chasing cars, hit and run
They try their hardest
To stand out in the crowd, talking loud
Neon girls carrousels
Show off their colours
For some local fame
That's the name (of their) game
Acting cool, out of school
You're the sameEmbed
