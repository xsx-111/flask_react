All Over the World Lyrics
Hey babe
How ya doing?
Can I be your boy?

A pet at my side
God in the sky
Snow falling down
Freeze my body to the ground
I can't ride
But one more time
I will ride
All over the world
Washed over the side
Top of the sky
Slow diver down
Two feet land on a different ground
You can't live easily
You can't even speak
But all of them speak

All over the world 
I will meet you over there
I am
Going to meet you over there

Washed over the side
Top of the sky
Slow diver down
Two feet land on a different ground
You can't live easily
You can't even speak
Fish all of them speak
All over the world
A plain with no herd
Not even a bird
When one side is hot
The other side of the moon is not
It's just like a ride
Maybe sometime
They'll make it a ride

All over the world  
I will meet you over there
I am, I am
Going to meet you over there

Time is an arrangement
Time is an arranger
I am a derangement

All my thoughts
All I am are my thoughts
All my thoughts
I am all what I'm taught

Better call the ranger
Got a train derailment
Better call the ranger

All I'm taught
All I am are my thoughts
All my thoughts
All I am are my thoughts
What I'm not2Embed
