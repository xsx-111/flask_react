Velouria Lyrics
Hold my head
We'll trampoline
Finally through the roof (finally through the roof)
On to somewhere near
And far in time

Velouria
Her covering
Traveling career (traveling career)
She can really move
Oh velveteen

My Velouria, my Velouria
Even I'll adore ya, my Velouria
Even I'll adore ya, my Velouria
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Say to me
Where have you been
Finally through the roof (finally through the roof)
And how does lemur skin
Reflect the sea?
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the tides of the summer
Every summer, every summer
Every
My Velouria, my Velouria

Forever green
I know she's here
In California (California)
I can see the tears
Of Shasta sheen

My Velouria, my Velouria (V-E-L-O-U-R-I-A)
Even I'll adore ya, my Velouria (V-E-L-O-U-R-I-A)
Even I'll adore ya, my Velouria (V-E-L-O-U-R-I-A)
Even I'll adore ya, my Velouria (V-E-L-O-U-R-I-A)
Even I'll adore ya, my Velouria (V-E-L-O-U-R-I-A)
