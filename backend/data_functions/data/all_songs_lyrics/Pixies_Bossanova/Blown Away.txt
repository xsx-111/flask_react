Blown Away Lyrics
Now the sun is burning
In deepest space
That's the way things are
Through a storm I called you
It fell each day
I didn't get so far

My words get blown away

My lips are moving
If you touch my face
Did you hear my screams?
While we were sleeping
I tried to say
Even in my dreams

My words get blown away

Now the sun is burning
In deepest space
I didn't get so farEmbed
