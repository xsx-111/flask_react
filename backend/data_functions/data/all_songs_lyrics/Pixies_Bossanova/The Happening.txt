The Happening Lyrics
They got a ranch they call
Number Fifty-One
They got a ranch they call
Number Fifty-One
You can't see it at all
Unless you're flying by
Just sitting there square
Baking in the sun

Beneath the sky, sky, sky, sky

They're gonna put it down
Right on the strip
They're gonna put it down
On the Vegas strip
They're gonna put it down
Then step outside
Into the lights
Right out of that ship

Saying hi, hi, hi, hi
I was driving doing nothing on the shores of Great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air, I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myself and I forgot about the brake
I forgot about all laws and I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9 and all across the Amy band
Across the road they were turning around and headed south with me
It got so crowded on the road I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud, it seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills
Then I heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
They were getting interviewed by some good man whose name was Bill
I'm almost there to Vegas where they're putting on a show
They've come so far, I've lived this long at least
I must just go and say hello1Embed
