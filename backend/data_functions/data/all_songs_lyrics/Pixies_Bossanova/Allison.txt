Allison Lyrics
From distant star
To this here bar
The me, the you
Where are we now?
Hooray the blues
Of everyone

Allison

Keeps a smile
Around a while
He took no fright
And jettisoned
We'll go tonight
To hear him tell
"oh well"

Allison
Allison

And when the planet hit the sun
I saw the face of Allison
Allison
