Down to the Well Lyrics
Betty always knows
Betty always tells
She laughing desperately
She said it felt like a river inside her bones
When she went down to the well
I'm gonna be with her
She is gonna take me there
Lead me by my hand
Her body a rocking chair for my soul
When we go down to the well

I can hardly wait, baby
I can hardly wait
'til we go down to the well
Down to the well

Been thinking to myself
And if a life's not long
What matter does it make
If there'll be favorite songs playing in my head
When we go down to the well

I can hardly wait, baby
I can hardly wait
'til we go down to the well
Down to the wellEmbed
