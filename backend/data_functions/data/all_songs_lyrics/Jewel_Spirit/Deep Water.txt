Deep Water Lyrics
You find yourself falling down
Your hopes in the sky
But your heart like grape gum on the ground
And you try to find yourself
In the abstractions of religion
And the cruelty of everyone else
And you wake up to realize
Your standard of living somehow got stuck on survive

When you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
And when you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well, it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love

You realize your only friends
Has never been yourself or anyone who cared in the end
That's when everything fades or falls away
'Cause the chains which once held us are only the chains which we've made

When you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
And when you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well, it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love, love, love
It's nothing without love
We've compromised our pride
And sacrificed our health
We must demand more not from each other
But more from ourselves

'Cause when you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
And when you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well, it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love, love, love
It's nothing without love
It's nothing without love

Nothing without love, without love
Nothing without love, without love
Nothing without love, without love
Nothing without love, without love
Nothing without love, without love
Nothing without love, without loveEmbed
