Innocence Maintained Lyrics
Ophelia drowned in the water
Crushed by her own weight
And Hitler loved little blue-eyed boys
And it drove him to hate
Birds always grow silent before the night descends
'Cause nature has a funny way of breaking what does not bend

A hero's torso built of steel and novocaine
His heart a bitter beat inside a bloodless frame
There was a hole inside his soul
A manicure couldn't fill
So he found himself a whore to love
While daisies choked on the windowsill

We've made houses for hatred
It's time we made a place where
People's souls may be seen and made safe
Be careful with each other these fragile flames
Innocence can't be lost
It just needs to be maintained

In a small town in Ohio, two boys are filled with violence
And darkness spreads its legs for hate and ignorance
We are given to a God to put our faith therein
But to be forgiven, we must first believe in sin
We've made houses for hatred
It's time we made a place where
People's souls may be seen and made safe
Be careful with each other these fragile flames
For innocence can't be lost
It just needs to be maintained

I want to live bravely and love without fear
I want to always feel the wings of Grace near
We all will be Christed when we hear ourselves say
We are that to which we pray

We've made houses for hatred
It's time we made a place where
People's souls may be seen and made safe
Be careful with each other these fragile flames
We've made houses for hatred
It's time we made a place where
People's souls may be seen and made safe
Be careful with each other these fragile flames
For innocence can't be lost
It just needs to be maintainedEmbed
