Down So Long Lyrics
Sun sets 'cross the ocean
I'm a thousand miles from anywhere
My pocketbook and my heart both just got stolen
And that sun act like she don't even care
Wind blows cold when you reach the top
It feels like someone's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe
I got a plastic Jesus and a cordless telephone for every corner of my room
Got everybody but you telling me what to do

But I've been down so long
Oh, it can't be longer still
I been down so long
That the end must be drawin' near

Looked to everybody but me to answer my prayers
'Til I saw an angel in a bathroom
Who said she saw no one worth saving anywhere
Blind man on the corner said it's simple
Like flipping a coin
Don't matter what side it lands on
If it's someone else's dime

But I've been down so long
Oh, it can't be longer still
I've been down so long
That the end must be drawin' near
I take a trip, I catch a train, I catch a plane
I got a ticket in my hand
And then a fat man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand

But we've been down so long
Oh, it can't be longer still
We've been down so long
The end must be...
Oh, I know the end must be...
Oh, I know the end must be drawin' nearEmbed
