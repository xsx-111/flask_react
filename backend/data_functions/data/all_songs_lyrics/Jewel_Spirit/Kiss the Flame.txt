Kiss the Flame Lyrics
Please, love, let's make no impartial vow
Let all fall away - that's not crucial now
I want a brave love
One that makes me weak in the knees
I want a crazy, crazy love
One that makes me come undone at the seams

I'm tired of all these pilgrims, these Puritans, these thieves
Of all the unbelievers who whittle love down at the knees
Let these swift roads destroy themselves
Let the world fall into its sleep
For we shall be spared, we shall be left standing
To face what's left of concrete and honey

Kiss the flame
Let's run with the hunted; the untamed
Kiss the flame
Embrace the faceless; the unnamed
Kiss the flame

There are nightmares on the sidewalk; there are jokes on TV
There are people selling thoughtless with such casualty
And wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Where have all the brave men gone?
Show me one man who knows his own heart
To him, I shall belong
Kiss the flame
Let's run with the hunted; the untamed
Kiss the flame
Embrace the faceless; the unnamed
Kiss the flame
Kiss the flame
Kiss the flame
Oh-oh

Please, love, let's make no impartial vowEmbed
