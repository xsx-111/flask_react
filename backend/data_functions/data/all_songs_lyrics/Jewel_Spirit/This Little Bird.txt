This Little Bird LyricsThere's a little bird
Somebody sent
Down to the earth to
Live on the wind
Blowing on the wind
She sleeps on the wind
This little bird
Little bird
Light and fragile
And feathered sky-blue
Thin and graceful
The sun shining through
She flies so high
Up in the sky
Way out of reach
Of human eyes
Light and fragile
And feathered sky-blue
Thin and graceful
The sun shining through
She flies so high
Up in the sky
Way out of reach
Of human eyes
Light and fragile
She's feathered sky-blue
Thin and graceful
The sun shining through
And the only time
She touches ground
Is when that little bird
Little bird
Is when that little bird
Little bird
Is when that little bird
DiesEmbed
