Enter From the East Lyrics
I went out a-wandering
Beneath an unknown sky
The heavens all shook violently
He caught my eye
Strange fruit fell
It struck me to the core
My heart became a single flame
I wanted nothing more

Stranger, enter from the east
Stranger, step inside this place
Oh, and own me

The clock became a bullet hole
Cruel and unkind
It hurt me with it's second hand
Alone another night

Stranger, enter from the east
Stranger, step inside this place

Blue, is that you?
Well, don't bother knocking on my door this time
Blue, go be true for someone else
There's no room inside this heart of mine
My heart has four empty rooms
Three wait for lightning and one waits for you
I must have you all to myself
Feel the full weight of your skin
I'll hollow out my insides
To place you in

Stranger, enter from the east
Stranger, step inside this place
Oh, and own me
Own meEmbed
