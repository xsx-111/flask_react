Do You Lyrics
Hey, you say you like the way
The cowboys tip their hats and say
"How's it goin', ma'am?"
But you're never quite clear
If their glares are sincere
Or really only just second hand
To you, it's all roses
It's a lavender haze
The man is a marvel
It's a shame about his brains
But that's okay, you say
"He's got straight teeth
And it's good sex"

You look to the sky
You look to the man
You claim innocence
And not to understand
Or do you?
Do you?

There's a big man wearing a white suit
And patent leather shoes
He wants to take his monkeys
To see the kids at the zoo
'Cause the gypsy on the corner said
"Hey, mister, you can't lose"
And it's your first day at the track
You feel that heat on your back
We all want to find a way
To beat the system
Find some rhythm in the madness
Get down on your knees and pray
Say, "I'll do whatever you want, God
Just let me have my way"
Well, will you?
Will you?

Come on all you merry men
Rally your cry
Dance with the devil
For tomorrow we'll surely
Hey, hey, blow the men down

You with all your cigarettes
And cool stares
Filled with blank glares
And loaded regrets
Just like the girls today
With nothing to say
No more pigtails and pony rides
They're sophisticated
They sip on lattes and have their eyes
On a bigger prize
We shake our fists and say
"Well, good golly, we're mad
That God kills children
With our very own hands"
We claim innocence
And not to understand
Or do we?
Do we?

Come on all you merry men
Rally your cry
Dance with the devil
For tomorrow we'll surely
Hey, hey, blow the men down
Blow the men down
Hey, heyEmbed
