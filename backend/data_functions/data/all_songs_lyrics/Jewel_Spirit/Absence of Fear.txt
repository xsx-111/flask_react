Absence of Fear Lyrics
Inside my skin
There is this space
It twists and turns
It bleeds and aches
Inside my heart
There's an empty room
It's waiting for lightning
It's waiting for you

And I am wanting
I am needing you
To be here
Inside the absence of fear

Muscle and sinew
Velvet and stone
This vessel is haunted
It creaks and moans
My bones call to you
In a separate skin
I make myself translucent
To let you in, boy
I am wanting
And I am needing you
To be here
Inside the absence of fear

There is this hunger
This restlessness inside of me
And it knows that you're no stranger
You're my gravity
My hands will adore you
Through all darkness aim
They will lay you out in moonlight
And reinvent your name

For I am wanting
And I am needing you
To be here
I need you near
Inside the absence of fearEmbed
