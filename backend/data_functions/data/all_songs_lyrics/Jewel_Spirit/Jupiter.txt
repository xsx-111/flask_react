Jupiter Lyrics
Venus DeMilo
In her half-baked shell
Understood the nature of love very well
She said, "A good love is delicious
You can't get enough too soon
It makes you so crazy
You wanna swallow the moon"

Oh-oh, oh-oh, Jupiter
Oh-oh, oh-oh, be still, my little heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh, love is a flame
Neither timid nor tame

Take these stars from my crown
Let the years fall down
Lay me out in firelight
Let my skin feel the night
Fasten me to your side
And say it'll be soon
You make me so crazy, baby
Could swallow the moon

My hands are two travelers
They've crossed oceans and lands
But they are too small
On the continent of your skin
And wandering, wandering
I could spend my life
Traveling the length of your body each night
Oh-oh, oh-oh, Jupiter
Oh-oh, oh-oh, be still, my little heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh, love is a flame
Neither timid nor tame

Take these stars from my crown
Let the years fall down
Lay me out in firelight
Let my skin feel the night
Fasten me to your side
And say it'll be soon
You make me so crazy, baby
Could swallow the moon
Swallow the moon

Oh-oh, oh-oh, Jupiter
Oh-oh, oh-oh, be still, my little heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh, love is a flame
Neither timid nor tame

Take these stars from my crown
Let the years fall down
Lay me out in firelight
Let my skin feel the night
Fasten me to your side
And say it'll be soon
You make me so crazy, baby
Could swallow the moon
Swallow the moon
Swallow the moon
Swallow the moonEmbed
