Fat Boy LyricsFat boy
Goes to the pool
Sees his reflection
Doesn't know what to do
He feels little inside
And filed with pride
Oh, fragile flame
When no one sees the same
Fat boy
Goes about his day
Trying to think of funny
Things to say
Like, "This is just a game I play,"
And "I like me this way."
Oh, fragile flame
When no one feels the same
Hush, sleep
Don't think
Just eat
You're Daddy's little boy
You're Momma's pride and joy
You know they love ya
But not because they hold ya
And fat boy says
"Wouldn't it be nice?
If I could melt myself like ice
Or outrun my skin
And just be pure wind?"
Oh, fragile flame
Sometimes I feel the sameEmbed
