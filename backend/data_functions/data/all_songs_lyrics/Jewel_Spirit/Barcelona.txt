Barcelona LyricsBarcelona
Where the winds all blew
The churches don't have windows
But the graveyards do
Me and my shadow
Are wrestling again
Look out stranger
There's a dark cloud moving in
But if you could hear
The voice in my heart
It would tell you
I'm afraid I am alone
Won't somebody please
Hold me, release me
Show me the meaning of mercy?
Let me loose
Fly, let me fly
Let me fly
Super paranoid
I'm blending, I'm blurring
I'm bleeding
Into the scenery
Loving someone else
Is always so much easier
But I hold myself hostage
In the mirror
But if you could hear
The voice in my heart
It would tell you
I'm tired of feeling this way
God, won't you please
Hold me, release me
Show me the meaning of mercy?
Let me loose
Fly, let me fly
Let me fly
And I won't be held down
I won't be held back
I will lead with my faith
The red light
Has been following me
But don't worry mother
It's no longer my gravity
Hold me, release me
Show me the meaning of mercy
Let me fly
Let me fly
Let me flyEmbed
