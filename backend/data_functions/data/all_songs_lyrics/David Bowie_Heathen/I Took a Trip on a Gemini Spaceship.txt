I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spaceship Lyrics
I took a trip On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue

Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream

I took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue
You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me in the moonlight

I took a trip
In a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took
I took a walk in space
Boy, I really felt blue

Well, I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
Yes what did I do
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
Thought about you1Embed
