Sunday Lyrics
Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes

Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
(In your fear)
In your fear
(Seek only peace)
Of what we have become
(In your fear, seek only love)
Take to the fire
(In your fear)
Now we must burn
(Seek only peace)
All that we are
(In your fear, seek only love)
Rise together
(In your fear)
Through these clouds
(In your fear)
As on wings
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials
Lord, will be remembered

Everything has changed1Embed
