Shadow Man Lyrics
There's a man back a-ways
Who believes at where he is
And there's a girl
Up ahead who says she knows

And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
For the guy who can't be seen
He's the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand

Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man

You can call him Joe, you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
For the Shadow Man is really you

Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrow
Of what you did today
You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
The Shadow Man is waiting up ahead
Shadow man
Is waiting up ahead
Is waiting up ahead2Embed
