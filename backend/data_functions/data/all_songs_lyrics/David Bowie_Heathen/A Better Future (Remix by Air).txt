A Better Future (Remix by Air) LyricsFrom factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving
Woohoo
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
(I demand a better future)
When we talk
We talk to you
When we walk
We walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving
Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain, and all this sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
Give my children sunny smiles
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
(I demand a better future)Embed
