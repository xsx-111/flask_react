Gates Lyrics
I am the pain that beats through your temples
Every morning when you wake up
I am the boy with alcohol poisoning
From all the parties Chris was throwing
That summer that they took us in
Like every other American
For getting drunk round the back of the Lions' Club
Waiting for the shitty bands to finish up
And some kids played hacky sack while the others just got high

It's not hard to fall for a waitress
When you both smoke, smoke the same cigarettes
You'll get seated as diner's lovers
She'll get the check as friends for the better
You'll carve your names into the Paupack cliffs
Just to read them when you get old enough to know
That happiness is just a moment

So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back
So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back
And they will make examples out of us
Like when they caught you in the CVS parking lot
But I fed the liars, I fed the liars
I fed the liars everything I got, everything I got
In my cabinet brain of canned thoughts
It was everything I got, oh everything I got
In my cabinet brain, in my cabinet brain

So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back
So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back

So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
I don't need it, you can take it back2Embed
