Good Things LyricsI've been having a horrible time
Pulling myself together
I've been closing my eyes to find
The old, familiar failures
I've been having a horrible time
Pulling myself together
I've been closing my eyes to find
Why all good things should fall apart
Why all good things should fall apart
Why all good things should fall apart
Why all good things should fall apart
I've been having a horrible time
Pulling myself together
I've been closing my eyes to find
Why all good things should fall apart
Why all good things should fall apart
Why all good things should fall apart
Why all good things should fall apart
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Like when we would take rides
In your American muscle car
I felt American for once in my life
I never felt it again
So all good things should fall apart
So all good things should fall apart
So all good things should fall apart
So all good things should fall apartEmbed
