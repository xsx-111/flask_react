Casey Lyrics
Well, I sat and thought about you
On the long ride back to Philly
From the way that you'd wear your hair
From the way that you'd laugh when you drank too much
Before the plug was pulled, the fires burned out
And all the parties grew bored
You waited tables and I waited for your shift breaks

And Gin and Casey
Used to dance inside of me
And I bet I sound like a broken record
Every time I open my mouth
I want to wander around the city with you again
Like when you waited tables
And I waited for your shift breaks

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Oh, every evening
Me and Casey
Used to get high and listen to our boredom
'Cause it was so much easier
'Cause it was so much easier
Than dealing with everything
So Casey, Casey, Casey
Just tell me when you're ready, I'm all packed to go
To search for that old place we found forever ago
We could take my car 'cause she's still got the spirit
We could live, we could live, we could live
And no longer just have to hear it

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Oh, every evening
Me and Casey
Used to get high and listen to our boredom
'Cause it was so much easier
'Cause it was so much easier
Than dealing with everything
'Cause it was so much easier
Than dealing with everything
'Cause it was so much easier
Than dealing with everythingEmbed
