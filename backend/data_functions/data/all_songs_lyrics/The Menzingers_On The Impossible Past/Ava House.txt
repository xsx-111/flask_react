Ava House LyricsAva, are you trying to get high?
I hope the floor holds this time
We'll dance in subtle romance together
While we're making our time
While we're making our time
While we make our time
I saw the knife, now I'm leaning forwards
Straight city light cut me down to size
The bums are scheming on their Tall Boys
I can hardly open my eyes
Ava are you trying to get high?
I hope the floor holds this time
We'll dance in subtle romance together
While we're making our time
While we're making our time
While we make our time
I saw the knife, now I'm leaning forwards
I'm two wheels barreling down your way
You can't touch us, we're untouchable
Lament the beginnings that we celebrate
Never afraid, we're fearless together
The rest, they're waiting their lives away
Gold has us slurring and pissing out windows
Enemies are so far away
We're alive
Celebrate
Ava, are you trying to get high?
I hope the floor holds this time
We'll dance in subtle romance together
While we're making our time
While we're making our time
While we're making our timeEmbed
