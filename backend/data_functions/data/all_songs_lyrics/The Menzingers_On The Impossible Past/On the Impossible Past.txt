On the Impossible Past Lyrics
We took rides in your American muscle car
I felt American, we shared our smokes
I held the wheel while you drank and drove
Our plans were miserable

And then we crashed your car
Your American muscle car
Into a ditch on Sawmill Road
There was ice on all the roads
We always dreamt of having nice things
Having nice thingsEmbed
