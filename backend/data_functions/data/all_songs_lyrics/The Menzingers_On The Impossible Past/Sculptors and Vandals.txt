Sculptors and Vandals Lyrics
I remember, when you came around
I was younger
Burning statues to the ground
Now I'm older and tired
I no longer see the differences

I remember the taste of the fruit
Disremember all we knew
Said we wanted to be interesting
Then we fell asleep

These days you'll find me where the nectar's plenty
Looks are cheap and the talk is heavy
Where liars lie to themselves
Liars lie to themselves
I remember

You said, "Sometimes I need you around"
And you said that my conveniences are so convenient
You said you wanted to be interesting
Then you fell asleep
These days you'll find me where the nectar's plenty
Looks are cheap and the talk is heavy
Liars lie to themselves
Liars lie to themselves

Walk home single, seeing double (x4)Embed
