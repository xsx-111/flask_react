Sun Hotel LyricsI remember you well at the Sun Hotel
Where we were waiting impatiently
For a decent night's sleep
It's like I've landed in the rubble of my past life
And I never seem to board a return flight
From the shame, the fear, the guilt that's tough to mention
The kind that always pry your eyelids open
And I'm pretty sure this corner of the world
Is the loneliest corner in the whole world
Maybe it's me or the bartender
This Budweiser or the other customers
When all eyes are glued on the 6 o'clock news
For another fire and another impending deer season
I will leave you alone
And you will leave me alone
I remember you well at the Sun Hotel
Where we were waiting impatiently
For a decent night's sleep
I remember you well at the Sun Hotel
Where we were running out of money
Where we were grinding down our teethEmbed
