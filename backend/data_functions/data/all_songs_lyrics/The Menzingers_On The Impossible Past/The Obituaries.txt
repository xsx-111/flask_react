The Obituaries Lyrics
We stumbled and stared at the carnival lights
That lit up New York City
From a rooftop in Brooklyn
That was covered in bad graffiti
And then I let a thousand splinters
Pierce right through my spoiled liver
Whatever that was left of it

Cause I cursed my lonely memory
With picture-perfect imagery
Maybe I'm not dying
I'm just living in decaying cities
But I'm still healthy, I'm still fine
I've been spending all my time
Reading the obituaries

But I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it

Cause I am the shadow of the waxwing, slain
I felt the false azure from window panes
I am just freaking out, yeah I'll be fine
But I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know itEmbed
