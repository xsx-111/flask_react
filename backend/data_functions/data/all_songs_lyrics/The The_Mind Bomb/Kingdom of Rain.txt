Kingdom of Rain Lyrics
Tell me what you're thinking baby
Your heart's beating faster than mine
And I know something's going on in your life
Your life... your life
You were the girl I wanted to cry with
You were the girl I wanted to die with
And you were the boy who turned into the man
Broke my heart and let go off my hand

Our bed is empty, the fire is out
And all the love we've got to give has all spurted out
There's no more blood and no more pain
In our kingdom of rain

You think you know about life
You think you know about love
But when you put your hands inside me
It doesn't even feel like I'm being touched
You were the boy I wanted to cry with
You were the boy I wanted to die with
You've moved further from my side, year by year
While still making love dutifully sincere
But as silent as the car lights that move across this room
As cold as our bodies silhouetted by the moon
And I would lie awake and wonder
Is it just me or this the way love is supposed to be?

Tell me what you told him baby
My heart's beating out of time with my mind
And I know something's going wrong in our lives
I just wanted somebody to caress, this damsel in distress
I just wanted somebody to undress, this damsel in distress
I just wanted somebody to bless, this damsel in distress
I just wanted somebody to possess, this young girl

Our bed is empty, the fire is out
And all the love we've got to give has all spurted out
Our bed is empty, the fire is out
And all the love we've got to give has all spurted out
Our bed is empty, the fire is out
And all the love we've got to give has all spurted out
There's no more blood and no more pain
In our kingdom of rainEmbed
