Good Morning Beautiful Lyrics
Satellite, oh, satellite
Who sits upon our skies
How deep do you see when you spy into our lives?

I know that God lives in everybody's souls
And the only devil in your world
Lives in the human heart

So now ask yourself
What is human
And what is truth
Ask yourself
Whose voice is it that whispers unto you
From the cellars of your homes
From the tops of your city roofs
Ask yourself
Whose voice is it that whispers unto you

Who is it?
That turns your blood into spirit and your spirit into blood
Who is it?
That can reach down from above
And set yours souls ablaze with love
Or fill you with the insanity of violence and it's brother lust
Who is it?
Whose words have been twisted beyond recognition
In order to build your planet Earth's religions
Who is it?
Who could make your little armies of the left
And your little armies of the right
Light up your skies tonight

Now some of you may live
And some of you may die
But remember
That nothing in your world can kill you inside
For he is thinking of you
In your great cities of great solitude
Oh children you've still got a lot to fuckin' learn
The only path to heaven is via hell

Good morning beautiful
Good morning beautiful
Good morning beautiful
Good bye worldEmbed
