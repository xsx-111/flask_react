August & September LyricsSuddenly last summer
I started going out of my head
In a tiny hotel room
Lying naked on a bed
I knew what you were doing, and I knew what you'd done
Your life with me was ending, your new life had begun
But I was cursing your name, and I was cursing that room
And I was praying for the strength to stop loving you
I started writing you the letter
Which turned into the book
I was gonna reach across the ocean
And force you to look
But what kind of man was I?
Who would sacrifice your happiness to satisfy his pride
What kind of man was I?
Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind
Then you came back to me and I went down on one knee
With a glint in my eyes and a rose between my teeth
And I pushed out my tongue for you to see
That I'd been dying of a thirst for your company
Then you quenched my loneliness with your tears
And our clothes fell away as we rolled back the years
But we couldn't deny it because we could not admit it
If our love was too strong to die
Or we were just too weak to kill it
Was our love too strong to die?
Or were we just too weak to kill it?
Every moment in that room
I closed my eyes in prayer
Every moment I awoke
I clenched my teeth in prayer
What kind of man was I?
Who would sacrify your happiness to satisfy his pride
What kind of man was I?
Who would delay your destiny to appease his tiny mind
Who could delay your destiny to appease his aching swollen pride
Who could delay your destiny to appease his screaming little mind
You're mineEmbed
