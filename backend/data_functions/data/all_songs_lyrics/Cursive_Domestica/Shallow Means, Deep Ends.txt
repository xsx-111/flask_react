Shallow Means, Deep Ends Lyrics
Swimming at night
We've dug this hole
The water's fine
I wonder how far down it goes
Down it goes
Down it goes

The stars above
Have lost their shine
And so, my love
Departs our sight

The unending plains
Project a void
Where lovers gawk
In pantomime
So let me up!

Shallow means, deep ends
When the regret sinks in
Pressure erupts
Which way is up?
Swimming at night
We've finally hit, hit

We've finally hit bottom!

Swallowing promises back into our lungs
Losing direction of our affections
All right!

Shallow means, deep ends
When the regret sinks in
Pressure erupts
Which way is up?

Down it goes
Down it goesEmbed
