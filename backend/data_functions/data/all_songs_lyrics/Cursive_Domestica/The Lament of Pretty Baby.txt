The Lament of Pretty Baby Lyrics
I saw something I was not supposed to see
A ghostly memory that keeps on haunting me
The kitchen door was open a crack
So naively we peeked inside

Oh, darling sister, have they hurt you
Have they hurt you? Uh-huh
Oh, Pretty Baby, they won't touch you
They won't touch you again
We will fix this incident

I don't want to be seen as a pretty thing
'Cause it's the pretty things
That we're always breaking
And now she whispers into the mirror: "I'm broken"

Oh doctor, doctor, can you fix me
Can you fix me? Uh-huh
Oh Pretty Baby, you're so naive
But it comes off so cute
We don't want to fix you
We love you just the way you are
The butterfly pinned to the page
The nightingale locked in the cage
Won't you sing for me?
Sing for me, uh-huh
Yeah, we love you just the way you are
Crushed 'neath fashion magazines
Trampled by circus pony dreams
Won't you kiss me?
Won't you kiss me, uh-huh?

Oh please, mister, can't you fix me?
Can't you fix me? Uh-huh
Someone, anyone, won't you fix me?
Won't you fix me? Uh-huh
Oh, someone, please, the moon has raped me
I can feel it inside me
Oh, Mama, please let someone fix me!
Let them fix me, uh-huh
Let them fix me, uh-huh

So cry yourself to sleep
Cry yourself to sleep
I am strong, and you are weak
Wait, you are strong, and I am weak
Fuck, just cry yourself to sleep, uh-huhEmbed
