The Game of Who Needs Who The Worst Lyrics
A little bit closer, I know you're not bashful
There, now that's not so bad, is it?
So what was that secret?
What did that prick whisper to you?
Was it playful and flirty or degrading and dirty?
I know you like it both ways
So what did he say
To make you so goddamn defiant?
So fucking triumphant?

Relations, in direct competition
Domination
The players, disguised as the lovers
The best friend
A game of who needs who the worst


A little bit closer, your lipstick is smudged, dear
Here, let me wipe that smirk off

A secret
But you couldn't keep it
So secret
Relations, without hesitation
Or social tact

As it occurred, it occurred to me
Who needs who?
Who needs who?

A little bit closer
