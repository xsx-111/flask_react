The Radiator Hums Lyrics
Dinner's getting cold
You haven't touched a thing
So what's it gonna be?
I can hold out much longer than you
When it's steady, I'm just acting out my roles
When you're ready, I'll be walking out that door
And don't call me Pretty Baby anymore
Oh, foolish worker bee
I'm your fucking queen
Uh-huh

I threw out the phone to try to get through to you
The lines are down, drowned by the hum of the radiator
This house is the hole that you could never fill
With rose-blossomed bouquets
Vanities and love seats

Sad little boy
I know you get confused
But everyone goes through
These trials of self-truth and self-abuse
When you're selfless, you're so hard not to adore
When you're selfish, I just love you even more
I want to help you, but you've got to say the words
"I want to be cured"
Drowned
Deep in this hole
We've dug for ourselves
Throw me in
Headfirst, submerged in this great depression
Impoverished
And impotent
And don't call me Pretty Baby!
I threw out the phone to try to get through to you
(The radiator hums)
The lines are down, drowned by the hum of the radiator
()
This house is the hole that you could never fill
With shattered dinner plates
That's how we'll communicate
Hey, Pretty Baby, are you ready for bed?1Embed
