The Casualty Lyrics
The night has fallen down the staircase
And I, for one, have felt its bruises
Equilbrium, inebriated
Our social graces have been displaced

As we sink deeper into the drink
The volume increases
Night time resurrects fault lines
Silent wars rumble somewhere below
The surfaces versus
The surfaces versus
The shoe is dropped, lungs explode
Shards of words of a shattered voice
And there's still a hole where the phone was thrown

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

The moon is rising, a revolution
I close my eyes, and the room is spinning
You're screaming, "Sweetie, the moon has raped me
It has left its seeds like a tomb inside me
So I must learn to abort these feelings
This romance is bleeding"
Night time triggers the land mines
Bedroom wounds, lovers like brigadiers
Marching two by two
Marching two by two
A soldier's down
Flood gates burst
I've said things I wish you'd never heard
Like, "There's still a hole
Where the phone was thrown"

It's growing as we speak
And it's sucking us both in
A vacuum of sorrow
To swallow up the day2Embed
