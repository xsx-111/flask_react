Making Friends and Acquaintances Lyrics
Loose-lipped secrets
I've seen those birdies chirping
Another promise perched on their fragile branches
Cradle and all

We all hide a diary beneath some mattress
And someone has slept in my bed
Sometimes I get so naked I sing like a canary
And I scream out what I shouldn't scream

Some lies last a lifetime
They keep our diaries hidden
They don't let the whispers slip
Between the cracks of the bathroom stalls
Or be written on the bathroom walls

But still I can hear those dirty birds chirp away
It's a song I know by heart
Sometimes I resent making friends and acquaintances
It's a thin veil between us

Between the bed springs and the mattress
I keep my secrets
The ones I can't keep
The ones you
Took from me
The ones you scattered with your wings
It was nice to meet you
It was nice to meet you
It was nice to meet youEmbed
