The Night I Lost the Will to Fight Lyrics
I need a catalyst
To rekindle the flame
That once burned within these fists
Where defeat remains

The night has fallen down the staircase

I need a catalyst
To rekindle the flame
That once burned within these fists
Where defeat remains
One February night
We screamed our agonies
And I swear I tried to care
I tried
I tried

But the icicles hung down like prison bars

I need a catalyst
To rekindle the flame
That once burned within these fists
Where defeat remains
One February night
We screamed our agonies
And I swear I tried to care
I tried
I tried
I lost the will to fight
The will to fight
(I lost the will to fight)
(I lost the will to fight)
(I lost it, I lost it)
(I lost the will to fight)
Fight!Embed
