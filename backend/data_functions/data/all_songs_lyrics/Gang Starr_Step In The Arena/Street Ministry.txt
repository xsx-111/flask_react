Street Ministry Lyrics
Presenting you with alternative music
'Cause, yo, the struggle is tough
And we must learn to live through it
Pleasure and pain, pain and pleasure
Gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure
Not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
Out to a brother or sister who is keeping the faith
And trying hard to get it straight
The time is crucial so I think we must congregate
Let's have a meeting of the minds
Before we all fall and get left far behind
Finding a way is important
Map out a plan, take a stand, you can work it
The future's all in your hands and
So of yourself, yeah, you should be demanding
We're all responsible for whatever outcome
That's why I speak over beats for my income
Knowledge is key and if you ask what is it, G
It's just a form of my style of street ministry
