Personal Property Lyrics
She's a gold-plated lover
Twenty-four carat cool
She can walk on water
Yeah she can walk in my room
She's a one man woman
And it's a one man race
She's got a kiss like fire
She burns the lips right off my face
It's finder's keepers, loser's going to weep
She's personal property
Sealed and stamped, money in the bank
She's private, for my eyes only

She's personal property
Personal property
Personal service, personal touch
Exclusively mine, thank you so much
She's a heart stopping, brain thudding
Blood pumping, knee trembling
Spine crushing, tongue tying
Personal property

Yeah, and she belongs to me
She won't fall for nothing
She's much more than cute
Don't mind you window shopping, that's all right
But you ain't going to taste
My forbidden fruit
Adios, au revoir, wiedersehen, goodbye
She's personal property
Off limits, out of bounds, under lock and key
Confidential, for my eyes only

Now I don't mind you guys checking her out
You can whistle like a wolf or you can mess around
But let me tell you the secret of the sweet life
If you want to stay healthy, man take my advice
You better hit the road, Jack and don't come back
You could be king of the jungle
Or you could swing in the rain
But she don't need no monkey, not my babe
Because I'm her Tarzan and she's my Jane

She's personal property
Personal property
Personal service, personal touch
Exclusively mine
Personal property, she's off limits
Personal property, out of bounds
Personal property, under lock and key
Personal property, yeah
She's a heart stopping, brain thudding
Blood pumping, knee trembling
Spine crushing, tongue tying
And she's mine
And she belongs to meEmbed
