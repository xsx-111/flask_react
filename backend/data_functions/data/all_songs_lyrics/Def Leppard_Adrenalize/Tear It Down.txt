Tear It Down Lyrics
You got the look of a howling wolf
I like it
The kind of eyes that could start a fire
Yes, I like it
A streetwise dynamo, I switch you on
And I watch you go
A thrill to touch, you're so hot
I'm coming for you ready or not

I'm getting ready - Living on the edge of a dream
I'm getting ready - Oh, switch on your loving machine

Tear it down - There's got to be a better way
Tear it down - I can't wait another day
Tear it down - There's got to be a better way
Tear it down - If only you could stay
All night long

I'm on fire, you're all ice
Once too much is twice as nice
Get tough, fools luck
One bite and I'm hooked
A black cat with a silver tongue
A quick lick and you're gone
One kiss, it hots up
Too close ain't close enough
