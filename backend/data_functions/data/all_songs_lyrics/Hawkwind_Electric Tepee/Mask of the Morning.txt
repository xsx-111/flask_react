Mask of the Morning LyricsIn the cold grey-mask of morning I cry out
But you don't hear the sound that I shout
And you don't see me through the tears you've shed
All you hear are the voices in your head
In the dream-world that you've found will one
Day drag you down
The mirror of illusion reflects the smile
The world from your back door seems so wide
The house, so tiny it is from inside
A box that you're still living in
I cannot see for why
You think you've found perception's doors, they
Open to a lieEmbed
