Right to Decide LyricsI'm a digital citizen safe in my room
I've got my video to relieve the gloom
My mind's on a circuit with the nudes on the screen
Life's a no-go area it's so obscene
You can't do this, you can't do that
You can't go forward and you can't go back
You can't do this, you can't do that
You can't go forward and you can't go back
I'm a plugged-in person, I'm a TV fan
But there's so many things that I don't understand
Why do you want to steal our TV, it's not real
It's a viewing game
You can't do this, you can't do that
You can't go forward and you can't go back
You can't do this, you can't do that
You can't go forward and you can't go back
I'm a digital citizen safe in my room
I've got my video to relieve the gloom
My mind's on a circuit with the nudes on the screen
Life's a no-go area it's so obscene
You can't do this, you can't do that
You can't go forward and you can't go back
You can't do this, you can't do that
You can't go forward and you can't go back
You can't do this, you can't do that
You can't go forward and you can't go backEmbed
