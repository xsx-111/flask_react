L.S.D. LyricsBy mere existence, we are elite
Without a body, we are complete
There is no master, we are alone
There is an answer, where we have flown
By mere existence, we are elite
Without a body, we are complete
There is no Master, we are alone
There is an answer, where we have flown
"Hello ? hello ? hello?
..........goodbye"Embed
