Crawl Back (Under My Stone) Lyrics
This time you hurt me, ou really did it this time, you did
Did you count your fingers after shaking my hand, God forbid?
Riff raff crawling from the slums
Right there in front of all your chums
I swear by the pricking of my thumbs
I'll make your day
And melt away

I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
But you won't have to stand next to me
You won't have to introduce me
You won't have to think about, talk about, care about me
I'll crawl back

I've got a nerve just showing my face, don't you think?
Scruffy little likes ought to know their place, don't you think?
Old boy, sorry to intrude
Damn shame, pretty bloody rude
I should be horsewhipped and sued
Then go quietly
My tail between my knees
I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
But you won't have to stand next to me
You won't have to introduce me
You won't have to think about, talk about, care about me
I'll crawl back

I want to be middle class
Floors and ceilings made of glass
I just want to be, I just want to be free

You had me in a second, you had it all reckoned, you did
You guessed my game and my name, rank and number, you did
Somehow I gave myself away
Some code, some word I didn't say
I missed one line in the play
And the trap shut tight
And you did me all right

I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
I'll crawl back (Crawl back) under my stone
But you won't have to stand next to me
You won't have to introduce me
You won't have to think about, talk about, care about
You won't have to ask about, fuss about, discuss about
You won't have to mind about, swear about, forget about me
I'll crawl back (Crawl back)
I'll crawl back (Crawl back)
I'll crawl back (Crawl back)
I'll crawl back (Crawl back)
Ooh, I'll crawl back
I'll crawl back
I'll crawl back
I'll crawl backEmbed
