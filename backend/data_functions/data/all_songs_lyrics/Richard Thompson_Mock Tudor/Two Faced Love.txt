Two Faced Love LyricsTwo-faced love, will make me doubt my mind
Two-faced love, will keep me paralysed
Two-faced love, I pace the room at night
Why can't I get you off my mind
Oh I try to dull my feelings down
In every bar in every town
But your eyes follow me around
Why can't I get you off my mind
Face the music, face the facts
Different sides of different tracks
Had my feet on holy ground
Then I helter-skelter down
Confused, or being used
Two-faced love, two-faced love
It feels so wrong it must be right
Two-faced love, two-faced love
Why can't I get you off my mind
Oh, I don't like your thin skin
And I don't like the places you've been
I don't like the mood that you're in
Why can't I get you off my mind
If I read the signals right
I might be your slave tonight
Pardon my naive caress
Tender fits with tenderness
Uncouth to tell the truth
Two-faced love, two-faced love
Feels so wrong it must be right
Two-faced love, two-faced love
Why can't I get you off my mind
Oh you don't make my blood run cold
And you don't fit my jelly mold
Don't come up for air when you're digging for gold
Why can't I get you off my mind
Why can't I get you off my mind
It feels so wrong it must be right
Feels so wrong it must be rightEmbed
