Walking the Long Miles Home Lyrics
O the last bus has gone
Or maybe I'm wrong
It just doesn't exist
And the words that flew
Between me and you
I must be crossed off your list

So I'm walking the long miles home
I don't mind losing you
In fact I feel better each step of the way
In the dark I rehearse all the right things to say
I'll be home, I'll be sober by break of day
Walking the long miles home

Not a soul is around
As I put more ground
Between me and you
And the whole town's asleep
Or maybe they're deep
In the old voulez-vous

So I'm walking the long miles home
And I don't mind losing you
Got the moon there for company each step of the way
And the rhythm in my shoes keep the blues away
When you ride Shanks's pony you don't have to pay
Walking the long miles home
O the party was grand
But I hadn't quite planned
On staying so long
And while you accused me
The hours confused me
And my friends had all gone

So I'm walking the long miles home
And I don't mind losing you
And there's nobody out but the cop on the beat
He's snoring so loud that he don't hear my feet
I just laugh to myself and move off down the street
Walking the long miles home
I'm walking the long miles home
O I'm walking the long miles homeEmbed
