Sights and Sounds of London Town Lyrics
Oh Gillian, she's a Doncaster lass
Trains it down on the quarter past
Friday night leaves the kids at home
And struts her stuff on the Euston Road

Saying "Do you want some company darling?
Do you want some company now?
My place, your place or no place
I could use the extra cash anyhow"

That's the sights and sounds of London Town
The sights and sounds of London Town
The sights and sounds of London Town

Oh Jean-Paul, he come over from Toulouse
They told him that London was the golden goose
Never got his hands on enough to eat
He never did get his arse up off the street
Wanted to be a rap DJ
They took his pulse then they turned him away
Under the radar of your fellow man
With all that charisma it ain't worth a damn
Saying "Lend me your shoes till Monday
Oh brother can you lend me a comb
I can wash dishes all night long
I just need my fare back home"

That's the sights and sounds of London Town
The sights and sounds of London Town
The sights and sounds of London Town

Well Jackie, she tried just about everything
She tried to dance, she tried to sing
Too many doors slammed in your face
It leaves a nasty aftertaste
You scramble around for a little bit of cash
Ease the pain with Mister Flash
Saint Annes Court is the rendezvous
For those who share your point of view

Saying "This is the last time you will see me
Never again, no way
One more time, I'll never ask you again
I've just got to get through today"
Well that's the sights and sounds of London Town
The sights and sounds of London Town
The sights and sounds of London Town

Oh Mickey, he sleeps every two or three days
Runs through Soho like a rat through a maze
A little blackmail here, a sting on the side
Enough to get started on the next enterprise
Dresses expensive but that's just a crutch
Like his word or his handshake, it doesn't mean much
Depends on his kickback from the middle man
And whatever he can beat out of Sally Ann

Saying "Lucky I'm the one you ran into
Oh lucky I've taken a shine
Lucky I'm needing a partner
Fifty-fifty right down the line"

Oh that's the sights and sounds of London Town
The sights and sounds of London Town
The sight and sounds of London TownEmbed
