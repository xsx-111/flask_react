Dry My Tears And Move On LyricsIf you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
If you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
You treated me just good enough until now
But if you're tired of me I'll get over you somehow
Oh, if you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
If you don't need me there's someone else who needs me out there
She's kind and tender and one day I'll find her I swear
So set me free while I've still got time
Don't try to hide your shame, dear, from my eyes
Oh, if you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
Faded love
As if you need a reason
Am I out of your dreams
Or just out of season
Oh the flame of love
Oh you wouldn't understand
You hide it in your heart
You don't hold it in your hand
If you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
If you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
My suits got creases and my shoes have got shine
Let me know soon I'll find a better use for my time
Oh if you don't want me
If you don't want me
Oh, if you don't want me I'll dry my tears and move on
I'll dry my tears and move on
I'll dry my tears and move onEmbed
