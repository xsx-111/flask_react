Sibella LyricsOh some girls hold the ace, the deuce, the trey
X-ray the deck to see what's coming
Marie Antoinette she smiled that way
Easy to smile when the luck is running
Like a myth you rode in from the west
From the go you had my button pressed
Did the tea-time of your soul
Make you long for wilder days?
Did you never let Jack Kerouac
Wash over you in waves?
Sibella, we don't make sense together
But my heart's with you
Sibella, I found myself
Strange but true, strange but true
Some say you can learn a lot from books
Thrill right to second-hand living
Life is just as deadly as it looks
But fiction is more forgiving
You took chances well within your means
Salon hair and creases in your jeans
All those lonely winters long
Did you really think it through
Did you really ache for me like I really ached for you
Sibella, we don't make sense together
But my heart's with you
Sibella, I found myself
Strange but true, strange but true
Sibella, we don't make sense together
But my heart's with you
Sibella, I found myself
Strange but true, strange but true
Strange but true, strange but true
Strange but trueEmbed
