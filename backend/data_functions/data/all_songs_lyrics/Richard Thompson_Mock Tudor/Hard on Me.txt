Hard on Me Lyrics
Hard on me, hard on me
Why do you grind me small?
Hard on me, hard on me
At every fence I fall
I bite my rage
I stop my breath
I shake my cage
I swim with emptiness

Hard on me, hard on me
Like they were hard on you
Hard on me, hard on me
So I can stumble too
My circuits seize
My senses jam
I don't know who to please
Trapped inside the wicker man

You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me

Hard on me, hard on me
Why do you grind me small?
Hard on me, hard on me
At every fence I fall
Unzip my heart
Unbraid my veins
Unstitch my wantonness
And loosen up my reins
Before I dare
Go on that hill
In dumb despair
Unfreeze my will
You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me
You're so hard on me

Well you're so hard on meEmbed
