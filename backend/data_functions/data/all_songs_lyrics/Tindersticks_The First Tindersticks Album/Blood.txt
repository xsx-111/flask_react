Blood LyricsWas there once something so pure
That left me whole and precious?
But now, broken, wondering
Why this new ingredient?
Everything I crave I become
Everything I left forgotten
Everything I love I become
'Cause that's what happens when you reach the bottom
Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken lives
Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken lives
There's an ugly crowd here beside me
They specialize in violations
Once they numbered only a handful
Grew out of the ashes of what we had good
There'll be another awkward scene tonight
As we choose to ignore the obvious
Quickly averting our eyes
When we see what there is left of
Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken lives
Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken lives
Our love hangs here beside us
From its feet, twitching, desperate
The juice that splashes our white boots
Now they're matted and confused
There'll be another ugly scene tonight
As we refuse to accept the obvious
We panic and jump up and down
Trying to suck those last breaths
Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken lives
Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken livesEmbed
