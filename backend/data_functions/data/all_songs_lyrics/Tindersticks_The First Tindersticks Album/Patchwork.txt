Patchwork LyricsI know it's wrong
I know it's selfish
It's such a short life
With so little time
You know this pattern
A patchwork of any direction
Cobbled together
In odd shape and size
Take my hand, we'll walk through this together
But my hand gets sweaty
You somehow slip away
I try to call you, but I don't call too loud, no
I try to look, I never looked that hard
Cos this blue's a swirling ocean
The green, the ambition
The red is the guilt
There's a lot of red
I know it's wrong
I know it's selfish
It's such a short life
So little time
I try to call you, but I don't call too loud, no
I try to look, I never looked that hard
Cos this blue's a swirling ocean
The green, the ambition
The red is the guilt
There's a lot of red
The yellow is my sunshine
Comes out on odd occasion
Barely enough to keep you aroundEmbed
