Drunk Tank LyricsOkay 1, 2, 3, 4
How are you doing tonight? Pull the blankets tight
The drunks shout outside your window light scrapes across your wall
Think of me it never goes away, think of me I know it never goes away
How are you doing tonight? I don't wanna fight
Just walked these miles to be passing by
Just to say that I'm okay for you to see the state of me
I know I said we'd better get home to bed
And I was the one I always stayed out so late
Always forgiving my inconsideration, it's a different story
When you can never go home again, I'm home, home again
My hands came back today finally set themselves free
No more fists on the end of my arms just these hands, trembling
Think of me it never goes away, think of me the way I used to be
I know I said we'd better get home to bed
And I was the one I always stayed out so late
Always forgiving my inconsideration, it's a different story
When you can never go home again, I'm home, home againEmbed
