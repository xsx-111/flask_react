The Not Knowing LyricsHey, I've been wondering
Where you go so late at night
And hey, I've been hoping
You'll be thinking of me no matter what the time
And hey, I'm not listening
When you tell me there's no more words to say
In your voice, hesitation
You quickly light a cigarette and turn away
I'm not crying, up inside I'm smiling
Seen that look in your eye
Jump in your stare
It's a feeling I never saw leaving
Well it's something I don't deserve to have, oh no
The not knowing is easy
And the suspecting, that's okay
Just don't tell me for certain
That our love's gone away
It's gone away
And hey, I've been wondering
Where you go so late at night
And hey, I've been hoping
You'd be thinking of me no matter what the time
And hey, as our love's flown away
Over the hills on a seagull's wing
Our ideas were like kids in a playground
Now I'm waiting for the bell that never rings
The not knowing is easy
And the suspecting, that's okay
Just don't tell me for certain
That our love's gone away
It's gone away
The not knowing is easy
And the suspecting, that's okay
Just don't tell me for certain
That our love's gone away
It's gone awayEmbed
