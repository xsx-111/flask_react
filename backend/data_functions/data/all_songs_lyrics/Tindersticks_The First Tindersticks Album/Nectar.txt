Nectar LyricsMy letters sit on your window-sill
Yellowed by the sun
Written that time our love was in its prime
They just ran off my pen
My pen is broken now
Couldn't eat a thing
Couldn't sit next to you
For all this sorrow the joy brings
It only shows me the truth
Changing
So I fretted at you, to swallow the pill
That's getting bitterer every day
All that joy couldn't help the boys
But we look so ...
Just like burning up the crockery
With your fire we melt our joy
Pour in the sorrow this joy brings
Took away the doubt from me
Changing
My letters sit on your window-sill
Yellowed by the sun
Written that time our love was in its prime
They just ran off my pen
I can't write them now
I can't eat a thing
Couldn't sit next to you
All this sorrow the joy brings
It only shows me the truth
Changing
I'm changing
Changing
Changing
