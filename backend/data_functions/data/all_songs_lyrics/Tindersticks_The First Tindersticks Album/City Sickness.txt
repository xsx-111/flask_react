City Sickness LyricsI'm crawling, I don't know where to or from
The centre of things from where everything stems
Is not where I belong
I have this city's sickness growing inside me
So this is where I ran for freedom
Where a man may not be free

I have these hands beating with love for you
And you're not here to touch
I sent you away, what else can I do
When I need something that much, that much
I'm hurting babe, in this city there's no place for love
It's just used to make people feel better
That's not like us
I got this sickness as I got off the train
Now it chips away at my heart
Until nothing remains

I'm okay afterwards
Afterwards lasts for minutes only
I'm okay during
You kinda fill up my mind
It's just the befores that last forever
It's just the befores, they just fuck my mind
