Marbles LyricsHer hair cut, she looked pudgy and made-up
In that dress growing ever tighter
We were saddened the lengths she had gone to
To appear more attractive
In the process losing something
We never knew but still missed
You knew you were lost as soon as you saw her
You saw your life as a series of complicated dance steps
Impossible to learn, they had to come naturally
Together you squirmed and wriggled
And I could only jerk along behind
They're going to hurt you
They always will
She was now with me inside of you
And I could only stare wide-eyed
As everything closed in around the three of us
Things you never saw, talking of the power and rescue
The blood rushing through our bodies
And it was good
They're going to hurt you
They always will
She opened the door with face bruised and swollen
Before we knew, pushed, falling down curved stairs
Our message lost and our plans forgotten
Surrounded by men in suits and black shiny shoes
Moving in, kicking, stamping
Blank expressionless faces
A handful of marbles thrown at a dustbin
Then release, then release
They're going to hurt you
They always will
(In a Northern town there were amazing rows of standing stones arranged on the southern slope)
They got out in the last few seconds of consciousness
(Look for their inscriptions one day, the most distant ocean plains, those who make the desert island)
I saw you in a tin bath, red water
(Were the ones who went to Washington to do their laundry
They wanted to see the mysterious hurricane)
I never believed in you, or what you pretended to stand for
(But we don't actually want to see the shipwrecked)
I just had to go
(They came)Embed
