Milky Teeth LyricsWell you know I'm a kisser
I wanted you for that mouth
Hey you know I'm a listener
I loved you for what came out
It's your mind and your body
That makes me feel so dirty
And it's my mouth
What comes out
What comes out
You say you love me when I'm sleeping
It's the sleep of the innocent
But in my sleep, I'm still faking
If you could only see what that meant
You think my body is clean now
It's stretching out in your tub
But the more you soak me
The more I wonder what comes off
And what comes out
Yeah those teeth, they look so milky
You would trust them with your neck
Like a kitten and it's mother
Just secure you and fear no fall
These teeth, they'll break you
As they close around your scruff
You look my way, your smile opens
And I wonder about what comes out
What comes out
What comes out
What comes out
What comes outEmbed
