Tyed LyricsThe sheet that was cut, caught the blood, was opened
The sheet that was cut, caught the blood, was opened and dried
The sheet that was cut and caught the blood was opened and dried and stretched out
The sheet that was cut and caught the blood was opened, dried and stretched out, hung on the wallEmbed
