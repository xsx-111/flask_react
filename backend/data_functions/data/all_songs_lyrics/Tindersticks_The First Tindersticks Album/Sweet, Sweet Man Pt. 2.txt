Sweet, Sweet Man Pt. 2 LyricsI lay awake that night, listening to her breathing
Thinking how strange it would be
If I awoke and she wasn't there
I could feel myself, feel myself changing
No longer me, I was only a part of her
She said "oh a sweet-sweet man like you
What can I do for you?"
I said "a sweet sweet man like me
I can only bring you misery"Embed
