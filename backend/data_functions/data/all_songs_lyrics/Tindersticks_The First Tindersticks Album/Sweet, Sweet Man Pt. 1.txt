Sweet, Sweet Man Pt. 1 LyricsShe sang for me, her heart on her tongue
She sang so pretty
She danced for me, her heart on her hips
She danced so fine
She said "oh, a sweet sweet man like you
What can I do for you?"
I said "a sweet sweet man like me
I can only bring you misery"
I lay awake that night, listening to her breathing
Thinking how strange it would be
If I awoke and she wasn't there
I could feel myself, feel myself changing
No longer me, I was only a part of her
I said "a sweet sweet man like me
I can only bring you misery"
So they put me down, back where I started from
But where I started seems so high
I start to climbEmbed
