Her LyricsScared of my shadow
Afraid of myself
Never thought I could be so shallow
Resort to playing the man
It's a thin line that I walked for her
A thin line that I walk
Between myself and what I have to do
The action and the thought
Oh her, her her her her
It's her
Oh her, her her her her
Feel like I've been dancing
The lights have finally come on
I'm just waiting for my eyes adjusting
To see how ugly I've become
She asked me for no promises
I made them to myself
I've given myself no choices now
Seen the only way out
Oh her, her her her her
It's her
Oh her, her her her her
She tied back her hair
Wrapped the band round
Pulled off her rings
And dropped them in a jar
I'm not there
Not waving my arms round
Not guiding her through
This blockade round my heart
It's her
Oh her, her her her herEmbed
