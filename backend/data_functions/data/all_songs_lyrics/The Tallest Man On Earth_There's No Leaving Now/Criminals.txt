Criminals LyricsWell there were days when you thought you would just go under
And the weekends that you never understood
When you flew from the bar only seventeen
You didn't bleed and no one ever thought you would
And there where straights and lines and every sorts of options
To stay away from broken mirrors in your friends
But the summer was strung with some mighty thread
And no law would never wait around no bend
(Chorus)
Come see the hiding in rain, come see the stillness in all them ones
Come see the loveable strain of someone diving for all you know
Come see the strain of a reeling tribe
Come meet the criminals, of this Napoleon ride
And there were the nights when you thought we would just surrender
To the stories of the miracles of gulls
When you flew from your sheets where your hours gone
You never sleep and no one ever thought you would
Come see the hiding in rain, come see the stillness in all them ones
Come see the loveable strain of someone diving for all you know
Come see the strain of a reeling tribe
Come meet the criminals, of this Napoleon ride
There are illusions and then just not even wanting
To walk around a shiny peak of snow
What a picture that is to be saved for us
How it's standing like it's just for us to know
(Chorus Variation)
There was a time in my life when I was carried by all of you
Now I run like a man still don't know what I dive into
Come see the strain of a reeling tribe
Come meet the criminals, of this Napoleon ride1Embed
