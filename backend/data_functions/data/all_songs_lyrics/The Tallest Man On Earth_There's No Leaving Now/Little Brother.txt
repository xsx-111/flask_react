Little Brother LyricsWhy are you thinking again, Little brother
When you know there’s a story for every wrong
Well I won’t be around in the morning
Can only pray there’s no harm in me moving on
To my trials and your unknown
Now there’s a legion of wolves in the forest
And what might have been lost it is there I know
Where the crazy old names, loving owners
I feel useless when I have to face alone
All your trials and my unknown
If you could just walk on by
With signs just flying around
And if this storm was just the motion
Of your kid just trying out
If he could only lose these miles
Now there’s a terrible light on the shading
Where you threw your insanities on a wall
I can see where the dog hits the summer
I said I believe you, forever, but you said don’t
It’s a trial for all that grows
If you could just walk on by
With signs just flying around
And if this storm was just the motion
Of your kid just trying out
If he could only lose these miles
Why are you drinking again, Little Brother
When your rambling’s the hard part of loving you
You say the creek and that fog wants to drown you
But there are deeper of wells where we’re going to
There’s no drought in this unknown
If you could just walk on by
With signs just flying around
And if this storm was just the motion
Of your kid just trying out
If he could only lose these miles
With your memories lost on a hillside
And a wind takes you further and forward now
Your world is a kite in the weather
Gently tied to your hand that is pointing out
There’s a sky in this unknown
If you could just walk on by
With signs just flying around
And if this storm was just the motion
Of your kid just trying out
If he could only lose these miles1Embed
