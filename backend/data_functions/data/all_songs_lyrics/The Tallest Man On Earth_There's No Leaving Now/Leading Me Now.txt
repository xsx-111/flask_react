Leading Me Now LyricsBy the eyes of the very young
It’s a sudden good attack
On our weakness, my horse and I
Carry anger forth and back
But we’ll make it somehow
You have all what’s mine
And you are leading me now
On the gallop to mother’s field
We would lose our breath and fight
And you give me the look of thorns
We give liars every night
But I get you somehow
Leave the reins inside
You are leading me now
And every time we wonder
What we left back in your hearts
Could you see we’re dreaming
Though our minds just fall apart
To the site where I flew from you
When your pace just scared me blind
We will come back and joke of days
When I sold you to the unkind
We will end up somehow
With a peaceful mind
And you are leading me now
And every time we wonder
What we left back in your hearts
Could you see we’re dreaming
Though our minds just fall apart
But we will end up somehow
With a peaceful mind
And you are leading me nowEmbed
