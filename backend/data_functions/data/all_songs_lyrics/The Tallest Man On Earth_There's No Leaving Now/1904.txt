1904 LyricsWell some they say it’s not even funny
And there you stand, not even trying
They say it is in line with the aging
Sometimes noise is just your mind
But the lesson is vague and the lightning
Shows a deer with her mind on the moor
And now something with the sun is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904
And as I lower down I hear it’s a message
And it’s 1902 just telling people to get out
And if there was a just a way I could tell them
It’s been long, but you are right
And the singing is slow and so quiet
Like the sound when you sweep off the floor
And now something with the dirt is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904
And when the night is young
But the bridge is up
Something passing by our shore
And the only one you can tell it to
Well it's the only one that ever knows
And since one rock was made to go through my window
Here is something so strange and something louder than before
And you’re living with no light or direction but damn precise
And now you know
When believing is hard but you go now
And you feel what you drag across the floor
Because something with these trails are just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904
And when the night is young
But the bridge is up
Something passing by our shore
And the only one you will tell it to
Well it's the only one who'll ever know
And some will say it’s not even healthy
But body is young and mind is sure
That something is alright with your thinking
Because they shook the earth in 19041Embed
