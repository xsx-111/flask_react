Revelation Blues Lyrics
I was more than just a coward
I was handsome too
I felt nothing when your flood came down
Holding fines that made me wonder
If the lights were wrong
With my hands that never touched no ground
When your talent is in numbers
Of the many times you're gone
I could lie I don't give up forgiving
But sometimes it's just roses
Dying too young

As I'm fencing up the hours
In the fields of red
While you think I'm on a loveless stray
In the letters from the lovers
In the land gone wrong
Explanations always written late
When your talent curse the framing
All the crying you heard sung
I could lie I don't care 'bout what's missing
But sometimes it's just roses
Dying too young
Your train of thoughts is always passing here
With its falling paint, and its broken gears
It’s the damn revelation blues when you see the path
And you know you won’t be the last
Oh Lord
Oh Lord

I was more than just a terror, I was crying too
But you showed me in the gusts between
That a wind is sometimes broken, and its flying path
That's no meaning, nor a ghost within
When your talent is in hiding
That your feeling is always wrong
I always want to bring you something
But sometimes it's just roses
Dying too young

When your talent is in hiding
That your feeling's always wrong
And I always want to bring you something
But sometimes they're just roses
Dying too young2Embed
