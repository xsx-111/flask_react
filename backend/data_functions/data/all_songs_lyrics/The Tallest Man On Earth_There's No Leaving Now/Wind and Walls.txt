Wind and Walls Lyrics‘All is well in order’ is what you thought you heard them say
So you drifted off to see what’s not in yourself
Light is turning slowly will it lay out on the plains?
No more nights of what you wrote back then
No relief of no rain
Singing songs of rivers tied to accidents within
Telling people lies of lions, treasures and kings
Nothing is more revealing than the dancer and the doubt
Waving to forget what’s never gone, always there, never right
In all these riots of broken sounds
Like the last voice you heard
When you drowned
Oh lord
This is wind and walls and weathered leaves and tearing sails
Minnows in your pockets when the rapid’s on trails
This is not the future but I sense it’s right up there
Just another hour, another pass, another day anywhere
And all these riots of broken sounds
And you sleep on the track
Every night
Oh lord
We don’t know if your treasure is safe
Where will you be when they find you son?
And you know they’re always following me
So when I get there you trust me son, and just leave
I’ll catch up
This is where you’re passionate of seasons and their strength
This is where you breathe and walk and know they will end
Light is turning slowly to the hand upon your chest
So lay it on the plains where there is time, there is love, there is rest
From all these riots of broken sounds
You sleep on tracks
Every night
Oh lord
We don’t know if your treasure is safe
Where will you be when they find you son?
And you know they’re always following me
I’ll be your best when the silence comesEmbed
