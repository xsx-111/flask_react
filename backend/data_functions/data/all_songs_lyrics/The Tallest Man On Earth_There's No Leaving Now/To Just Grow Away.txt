To Just Grow Away LyricsWe’re melting ruby hearts
A confusing trade
To burn the ore
To shape a blade
Then to swing it low
Beginners fate
To lose a skin
To just grow away
Like a rain, to help a river
But a river so hard to please
But I’ve grown to see the diamonds
You’ve thrown in just for me
We spent so many nights
Just gathering stones
The silver tears
Old sapphire bones
All the copper leaves
Then dreamt, now true
Look how they find their path
To cut right through
Like a rain, to help a river
But a river so hard to please
But I’ve grown to see the diamonds
You’ve thrown in just for me
Look when your hopeless child will figure
There are moments when hope’s not
Only real when flagging far down a road
With an armful broken arrows
And no hand free for the bow
Your kid will lose a battle
But you always
Will let him go
I lose my wish to drown
And aimless flee
What you’ve thrown to lose
Is still right here with meEmbed
