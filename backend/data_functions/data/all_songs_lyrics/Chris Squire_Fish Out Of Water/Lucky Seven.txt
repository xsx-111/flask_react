Lucky Seven LyricsIn the shadows of the fading light
Nothing in sight, nothing in mind
Nothing gained when you're feeling restrained
The more you look, the more you'll find
Take a bite from the apple of life's
Not as bad, as it's right, as it's right
And I think you could be
Lucky tonight
By the fates that drive us on
Upon the sea we swiftly sail
In the wake of the carnival trail
The more we try, the less we fail
You and I, the more we strive
In our search for truth, love
And honesty could be
Lucky tonight
From the trees by the silvery sands
To the ice of the golden midnight lands
Runs a thread of the tears that are shed
With laughter on the other hand
Keeping up with the plans and the schemes
Chasing dreams, hard to tell what it means
But I think we could be
Lucky tonightEmbed
