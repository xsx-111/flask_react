Silently Falling LyricsSilently falling down
Bringing hope of future to the children
Fills the air with a magic sound
Giving light to sight that cannot see
Hopefully, hopefully
Don't believe in miracles
But I do believe in love
Don't advise you to stick to rules
But there ain't no need to push and shove
Or in the end you'll reflect the pool
Reaching for the sky above
I know there's something
But I don't know how long
It's taking in coming
But I still sing the song
All of the pieces fit
But the puzzle carries on
Silently circling around
Giving scope to our imagination
Stills the sea, restores the crown
Breathing life to life that could not be
Hopefully, eventually
Silently falling
Falling down, down, downEmbed
