Safe (Canon Song) LyricsWhen your saviour lets you down
Who will mind
When your lover turns around
You will find
Joy in the morning
Love in the stars
Peace and understanding
Standing right beside you when you're walking down the street
Walk in time
Standing beside you
To shelter your hearts
Like a ship in a harbour
Blown in by the storms that surround us and you will be
Safely where
Nothing can ground us and you will be
Safe with me
When you face the doors of doubt
Have no fear
When the changes come about
I'll be near
I'll be waiting beside you
To shelter your hearts
Like a ship in a harbour
Blown in by the storms that surround us and you will be
Safe with meEmbed
