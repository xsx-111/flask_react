You By My Side LyricsYou know I love you
I can't be without you
When I'm alone, I still feel this way about you
Everything's clear
Here is here
And everything is as it appears to be so
Here am I dreaming
I stand by myself
Look and it's easy to see
That I'm not the only one reaching
For a new kind of wealth
Reaching with nothing to hide
And you by my side
You know we love you
We can't be without you
When we're at home, we still feel this way about you
Everything's clear
Here is here
And everything is as it appears to be so
Here we are dreaming
We stand by ourselves
Look and it's easy to see
That we're not the only ones reaching
For a new kind of wealth
Reaching with nothing to hide
And you on our sideEmbed
