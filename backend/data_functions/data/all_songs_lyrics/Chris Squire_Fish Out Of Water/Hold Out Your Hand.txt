Hold Out Your Hand LyricsYou can feel it coming
With the morning light
And you know the feeling's
Gonna make you feel all right
Almost close enough to
Hold out your hand
Span the distance, store resistance
To attack is to retreat
All you've got to do is
Hold out your hand
For the treasures of the universe
Are lying at your feet
You can hide it, lose it
But it's always found
You can laugh it off
But it always comes back on you, so true
True is true enough to
Hold out your hand
Forward motion, life promotion
To reverse is to repeat
All you've got to do is
Hold out your hand
For the treasures of the universe
Are lying at your feet
Hold out your hand
Span the distance, store resistance
To attack is to retreat
Almost close enough to
Hold out your hand
For the treasures of the universe
Are lying at your feetEmbed
