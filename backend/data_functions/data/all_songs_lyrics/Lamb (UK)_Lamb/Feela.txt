Feela LyricsYou saw me crying but you didn't want to look
You heard me hurting but you didn't want to listen
This could have been something
This could have been really something
Tell me something more
Tell me something more worth living for
You felt me wanting but you didn't want to give
You sensed me sinking but you really couldn't save me
This could have been something
This could have been really something
Tell me something more
Tell me something more worth living for
People come and go it's just the way of the world
Love just ebbs and flows what's left for us to rely on
This could have been something
This could have been really something
Tell me something more
Tell me something more worth living forEmbed
