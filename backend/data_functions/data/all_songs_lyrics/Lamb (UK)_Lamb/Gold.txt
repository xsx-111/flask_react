Gold LyricsStay with me forever and a day if I could be near you
For a lifetime I'd never want for anything
Hearing your voice is like icicles down my spine
And touching your warm skin
Starts electric storms
Through my mind
You put a strength in me
I knew something was missing
Just take me everywhere you go
This girl's in heaven
Feeling this way about someone like you
Couldn't be clearer, or dearer, or so overdue
So sure so pure
So much what I was looking for
Here are you filling up my life
My life
You put a strength in me
I knew something was missing
Just take me everywhere you go
This girl's in heaven
Life is light in everything about you
When you're as one, everything I touch is gold
Couldn't be in a better place to be
Than just around you
No, no, no, no, no, no
You put a strength in me
I knew something was missing
Just take me everywhere you go
You put a strength in me
I knew something was missing
Just take me everywhere you go
This girl's in heaven1Embed
