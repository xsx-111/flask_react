Trans Fatty Acid Lyrics
No one said it would be easy
Did anyone tell you the road would be straight and long?
Relax your mind and give it all to me
'Cause you know and I know our love is strong enough

To weather the rain (To weather the rain)
To weather the snow (To weather the snow)
To weather the storm (To weather the storm)
To weather the rain (To weather the rain)
To weather the snow (To weather the snow)
To weather the storm (To weather the storm)

Often I see fear in your eyes
And sometimes I know your heart is full of little arrows
But trust in me and no one can do you wrong
'Cause I know and you know our love is strong enough

To weather the rain (To weather the rain)
To weather the snow (To weather the snow)
To weather the storm (To weather the storm)
To weather the rain (To weather the rain)
To weather the snow (To weather the snow)
To weather the storm (To weather the storm)
To weather the rain (To weather the rain)
To weather the snow (To weather the snow)
To weather the storm (To weather the storm)
To weather the rain (To weather the rain)
To weather the snow (To weather the snow)
To weather the storm (To weather the storm)Embed
