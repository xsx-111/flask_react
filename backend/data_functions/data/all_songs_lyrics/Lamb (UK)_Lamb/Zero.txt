Zero LyricsThere's no one here today
'Cause someone took the light away
There's nothing in my heart
Don't think I could even start to explain
I can't stand the pain
Of losing something so much a part of me
Though in reality
You were hardly there in my heart
You were everything, everything
You were everything, everything
In these few hours
A breath of summertime has turned to winter rain
In such little time
All my hope has gone
Will it ever be the same?
All I ever wanted was to see your face
To see a little smile from my little one
And let you know, and let you know'
You were everything
Everything
You were everything
Everything
Babe I did all I could
Just to give you life
I'd have done anything
Just to give you life
Life
Life
Life
Out there in the dark
Your little spirit
Is lost without a home
Oh don't be afraid
I'm thinking of you
No you'll never be alone
Someday, somehow
When the time is right
May an angel smile upon me and give you life
To give you life
I'd give everything, everything
I'd give everything, everything
To give you life
To give you life
To give you life
I'd give everything
I'd give everything
I'd give everything
I'd give everythingEmbed
