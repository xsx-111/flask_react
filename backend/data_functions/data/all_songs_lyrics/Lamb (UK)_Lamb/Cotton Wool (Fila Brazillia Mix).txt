Cotton Wool (Fila Brazillia Mix) LyricsHere's my love
Step inside
Let me warm you up
By the fire in my heart
Step inside
Close the door
On the wind of fear
Brewing up behind you
You could stay here
Make your home here
Hide away here
I could wrap you up in cotton wool
Here's somewhere you could let your love run free
And give your soul a resting place
Finding someone is like finding yourself a home
If the key fits, just open the door
Cause you're never gonna spend a lonely day here
Come and watch your fear fly away
And you'll never hunger for a greener side than here
Gonna wrap you up in cotton wool and save you
And save you
Where's your love
Let me in
To find the warm fire
That I know is there inside you
Let me in, it's cold outside
And I'll grow there
Find that place deep down inside you
You could hold me
And protect me from all harm
You could love me
You could wrap me up
And I could stay there
Make my home there
Hide away there
You could wrap me up in cotton wool
