Lusty LyricsAll alone
In this heat
My thoughts
Start to wander
I'm lonesome in this world
My hands start to long for
Your skin
My mouth starts to long for your kiss
Your kiss
And the sun burns my skin
But it's outside and in, it's burning
Only you can soothe me
Come cool me down
I want you in my reach
Oh, the things I'd do to you
I touch you when I close my eyes
And the sun burns my skin
But it's outside and in, I'm burning
Only you can soothe me
Come cool me down
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooooooooooooooh
Ooo-ooo-oooo-ooooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooooooooooooooh
Ooh hooooh hoo
And the sun burns my skin
But it's outside and in, I'm burning
Only you can soothe me
Come cool me down
Oh! the sun burns my skin
But it's outside and in, I'm burning
Only you can soothe me
Come cool me downEmbed
