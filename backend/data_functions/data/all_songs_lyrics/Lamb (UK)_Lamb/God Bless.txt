God Bless LyricsYou're gonna feel the wind at your heels you know
You're gonna feel a sparkle in your step
Everything will touch you in a different way
Let it come, soon come, let it come
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel lighter than the air above
Let me breathe it into you
Let me breathe it into you
Let me breathe it into you
Here's to happiness
God bless the day
That made my feel this way
An angel's smiling on everything we do
Let them try to stop this good thing growing
'Cause there's no dark cloud
Gonna leave a shadow on there
Gotta keep it strong
Keep it true
Keep it strong
I'm gonna build you up
And build you up
Keep this natural thing
Keep this precious thing
Gotta keep it going on and growing strong
Here's to happiness
God bless the day that made me feel this way
Here's to happiness
God bless the day that made me feel this way, feel this way
Here's to happiness
God bless the day
That made me feel this way
Feel this way
Heere's to happiness
God bless the day that made me
Feel this way
Feel this way
Gotta keep this natural thing
Gotta keep this precious thing
Gotta keep this natural thing
Gotta keep this precious thing
And I'm gonna keep it going on
And growing strong
Here's to happiness
God bless the day that made me feel this way, feel this way
Here's to happiness
God bless the day that made me feel this way
Feel this way
Feel this way
Here here here here's to happiness
Here here here's to happiness
Here here here here's to happiness
To happiness
