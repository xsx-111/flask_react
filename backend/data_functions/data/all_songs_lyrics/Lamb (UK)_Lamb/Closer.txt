Closer LyricsThings change yet so much stays the same
Life's just a dream we have of reality
Love's strength enhances what we have
And then it strips us of our sanity
He'd say: I know what I want
Still I stay
Growing strong
Every day
Closer to you
It's strange
But somehow obvious
That what we want the most
We must let go
Your head is freer still than mine
And not so cluttered with morality
Loveless dying
Still I stay
Growing strong
Every day
Closer to you
Hold me back the simple fact is
Closer to you
One sexy can't perplex me now
Memories cloud our minds
Invading too much time
We build our very own cages
Blame's of no significance
In love it's of no relevance to life
This very moment
I'm trying every day
To live each moment new
And free my heart in stages
He'd say: I know what I want
So I stay
Growing strong
Every day
Closer to you
Closer to you
They hope and pray and die for men
Still I stay
Growing strong
Every day
Closer to you
Closer to you
Closer to you
Whose gonna be the one to save
You from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
Please oh baby please
You beg you want you say
You got to get some caught
Up in the charm that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere
To run
Just another fish to fit the
Worm on the hook of my line
Yeah I keep many females
Longing for a chance to win my heart
With S E X and plentyEmbed
