Paper Lace LyricsI heard you're suffering
Come be a wild thing
Come run with Jackie, me, and this lady
The stupid house you made fell away like paper lace
Come run with Jackie, me, and this lady
And when you're done crying to everyone
You can go back to your good home
She will be tired, but she'll be glad
When you go back to your good home
Paper burns and paper fades
Paper crumples into ugly shapes
Come run with Jackie, me, and this lady
And when you're done crying to everyone
You will go back to your good home
She will be tired, but she'll be glad
When you go back to your good home
And when she's done dancing with everyone
She will go back to your good home
She will be tired from loving everyone
But she'll be glad that you're back home
But for now, until you're home, you ride with us
There was no way you could have known about the things she didn't know she couldn't trust
Oh, sanctuary oh, sanctuary
Oh for now, until you're home, you ride with us
(Sanctuary, oh sanctuary, oh sanctuary)
There was no way you could have known about the things she didn't know she couldn't trust
(Oh, sanctuary, oh sanctuary, oh sanctuary)
Oh, sanctuary oh, sanctuary
Oh what's in the world, what's in the world?
What's in the hearts of pretty girls?
There's nothing left inside the room you filled with lion skins and laurels
Those were good ideas, but they weren't diamonds and pearls1Embed
