You Go On Ahead (Trumpet Trumpet II) LyricsYou go on ahead, for awhile
I would like to follow you awhile
You go on ahead for awhile
I would like to just follow you awhile
And I'd like to watch the white flash of your heels
As they take turns breaking the desert heat
To beckon me in languages I've never learned
And I'd like to have you navigate two hills
Where no musicians live and on the way decide
What mendings of your will you're willing to forgive
And I'd like to think the actors never banded
And I'd like to throw this trumpet down and go on empty handed
And I'd like to think I am not one of them but I know I am
So I'd like to just follow you awhile
You go on ahead for awhile
I would like to just follow you awhile
And you go on ahead for awhile
I would like to just follow you awhile
When me and the boys were out
We killed a thousand butterflies
So I put their wings into my mouth and
Said a prayer for our safe arrival
And then a big black car crossed our path
And I wondered whether or not that shit was empty
You go
See the sirens and the lizards lick their tongues behind the stage
See the actor keep their ritual to keep them all at bay
He would like to come home naked without war paint on his face
And appear before you, virgin white if virgins are still chaste
So when you've got to wait
And you've got to wait (x4)
And you've got to wait for me
And I'll appear before you virgin white if virgins are still chaste
Then I'd like to just follow you awhile
And if there are two eyes in my head
There are four season in a year
And reflections on the water of a burning yellow sphere
And the days add up to weeks, add up to months
And add up...
And if there are two eyes in my head
There are four season in a year
And reflections on the water of a burning yellow sphere
And the days add up to weeks, add up to months
And add up to years...
And if reflections on the water
Sometime look like burning tears
We can watch them changing shape
Without pushing off the pierEmbed
