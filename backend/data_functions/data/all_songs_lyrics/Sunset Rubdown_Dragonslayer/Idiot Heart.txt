Idiot Heart LyricsStay away from open windows
And put the telephone down
Can you run as fast as this house will fall
When the alarm bell sounds?
No, I was never much of a dancer
But I know enough to know you've got to move your idiot body around
And you can't, can't settle down
Until the idiot in your blood settles down
So move around
Oh, move around
Oh, move around
Oh, move around
Oh, move around
Oh, move around
If I found you in this city
They called it paradise
I'd say, "I love you, but I hate this city
And I'm no prize"
You want to walk around like you own the joint
The way that Icarus thought he might own the sky
I said, "You can't, can't settle down
Until the Icarus in your blood, in your blood drowns"
Oh no, you can't, can't settle down
Until the Icarus in your blood, in your blood drowns
I said if I was a horse, I would throw up the reins if I was you
So look at you go (into the fire-star)
Oh, look at you go (you are a meteor)
Oh, look at you go
Oh, look at you go (into the fire-star)
Oh, look at you go (you are a meteor)
Oh, look at you go
So look at you go (into the fire-star)
Oh, look at you go (you are a meteor)
Oh, look at you go
Oh, look at you go (into the fire-star, you are a meteor)
Look at you go
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
But it's an idiot heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
And you know your heart
But you can't, can't settle down, down, down
Oh no, you can't can't settle down, down, down
So just move around, move around
Move around, move around
(I hope that you died) Oh move around
(In a decent pair of shoes) oh move around
(You've got a lot of long walking to do) Oh move around
(Where you're going to) move around
I hope that you died
In a decent pair of shoes
You've got a lot of long walking to do
Where you're going to
I hope that you died
In a decent pair of shoes
You've got a lot of long walking to do
Where you're going to
And, oh, youEmbed
