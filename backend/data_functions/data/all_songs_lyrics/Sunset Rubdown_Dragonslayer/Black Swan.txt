Black Swan LyricsThere was a black swan outside the palace it was appointed by the king
And people took it as a sign that he needed more time but you said, "I ain't afraid of no blackbird"
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
There was a rumor of a ghost in the bedroom hanging in and around the bed
But by the time the moon rose you has taken off your clothes and had the pillow under your head
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
There was the face you saw above you in the fever of a hot black dream
But it was made out of paper and glue, and you were hoping for something a little more realistic, you were hoping for the head of the queen
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
My heart is a kingdom where the king is a heart, and my heart is king, my heart is king
And my heart is a kingdom where the king is a heart, and my heart is king, the king of hearts
There was the matador who said he would have you, if you could only give it up and walk away
He has carved out an avenue for you, from the palace to the palisades
But now it's half destroyed, and you are half destroyed
I see you running down a washed out road, I see you running between the dream and the void
My heart is a kingdom where the king is a heart, and my heart is king, the king of hearts
There was a rumor of a ghost in the bedroom hanging in and around the bed
But by the time the moon rose, you has taken off your clothes and had the pillow under your head
You got mascara all over your bed sheets, you got mascara all over your clothes!
You got mascara making broken-hearted shapes on your face, and you have yet to see the ghost
My heart is a kingdom where the king is a heart, and my heart is king, the king of heartsEmbed
