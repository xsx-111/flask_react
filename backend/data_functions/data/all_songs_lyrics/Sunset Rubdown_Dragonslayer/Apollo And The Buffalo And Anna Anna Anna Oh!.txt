Apollo And The Buffalo And Anna Anna Anna Oh! Lyrics
The buffalo have given up on the world
And Apollo? Apollo is kissing all the valley girls
We climbed up the cross on the mountain on New Year's Eve
It was just god, the blizzard, the dream-weaver and me
My god, I miss the way we used to be

So here's a photograph for you to hold
It's my picture right before I got old
It's a picture of a buffalo that we rode into extinction
That was the crime we committed in the night
That was the crime we committed in the night

Apollo, I heard your sister is equated with the moon
But I think your sister is just another runaround Sue
Say, where have you been, where have you been, Erato?
Where have you been, where have you been, Erato?
Because it's been a long time since we sat around the willow tree fire
Where Anna played guitar and the rest of us fell in love
That was back before she changed her name
Will we ever find our way into Cassandra's gaze again?
Like the days before Anna changed her name

Well, here's a photograph for you to hold
It's my picture right before I got old
It's a picture of a buffalo that we rode into extinction
That was the crime we committed in the night
That was the crime we committed in the night
So here's a photograph for you to hold
It's my picture right before I got old
It's a picture of the prize
You hunter, you hunter, you hunter, oh, you hunter
You hunter, you hunter, you hunter, oh, you hunter
You hunter, you hunter, you hunter, oh, you hunter, oh
Anna, Anna, Anna, oh! Why'd you change your name?
Anna, Anna, Anna, oh! Why'd you change your name?
Anna, Anna, Anna, oh! Why'd you change your name?
Anna, Anna, Anna, oh! Why'd you change your name?
Anna, Anna, Anna, oh! Why'd you change your name?
Anna, Anna, Anna, oh! Why'd you change your name?Embed
