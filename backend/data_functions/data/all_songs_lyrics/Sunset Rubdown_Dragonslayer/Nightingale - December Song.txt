Nightingale / December Song LyricsSo let me hammer this point home
I see us all as lonely fires
That have burned alive as long as we remember
But like all fireworks and all sunsets
We all burn in different ways
You are a fast explosion
And I am the embers
And though your flames are quick and mean
They will not last the year
But expire like a sudden falling star
That only nightingales had seen before
Migrating to southern jungles
And in this way you will come find me in December
He said he'd like to move to Nashville to master the guitar
Where he would live a single day the way I live a single year
He covered his body in mud
Went hunting for the sun
Then went swimming in a lake of holy water
Oh, you are too hot for me
I am too slow for you
You are a vast explosion
And I am the embers
You need the one who slowly burns
And burns to stay alive
And in this way you will come find me in December
Oh, oh, oh
So let me hammer this point home
I see us all as lonely fires
That have burned alive as long as we remember
But like all sacrificial virgins
We all burn in different ways
You are a vast explosion
And I am the embers
And though your flames are quick and mean
They will not last the year
But expire like a sudden shooting star
That only nightingales had seen before
Transforming into bluebirds
And in this way you will come find me in DecemberEmbed
