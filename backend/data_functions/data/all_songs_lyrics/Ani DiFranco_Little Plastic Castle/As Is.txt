As Is Lyrics
You can't hide behind social graces
So don't try, be all touchy, feely
Cause you lie in my face of all places
But I got no problem with that really
What bugs me is that you believe what you're saying
What bothers me, that you don't know how you feel
What scares me, that while you're telling me stories
You actually believe that they are real

And I've got no illusions about you, guess what I never did
When I said, when I said, "I'll take it", I meant, I meant as is
As is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is

Just give up and admit you're an asshole
You would be in some good company
And I think you'd find that your friends would forgive you
Or maybe I am just speaking for me
Cause when I look around, I think this, this is good enough
And I try to laugh, whatever life brings
Cause when I look down I just miss all the good stuff
When I look up, I just trip over things
And I've got no illusions about you, guess what I never did
When I say, when I say, "I'll take it" I mean, I mean as is
As is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as is, as isEmbed
