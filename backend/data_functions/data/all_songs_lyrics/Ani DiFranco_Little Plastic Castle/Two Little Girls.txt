Two Little Girls Lyrics
You were fresh off the boat from Virginia,
I had a year in New York City under my belt,
We met in a dream when we were both 19
I remember where we were standing
I remember how it felt
Two little girls growing out of their training bras,
This little girl breaks furniture, this little girl breaks laws
Two girls together
Just a little less alone
This little girl cried "wee wee wee" all the way home.
(Home)

We were always half crazy, now look at you, baby
You make about as much sense as a nursery rhyme,
And love is a piano dropped from a four story window
And you were in the wrong place at the wrong time
And I don't like your girlfriend, yeah, I blame her
Never seen one of your lovers do you so much harm
And I loved you first and you know I would prefer
If she didn't empty her syringes into your arm
(Arm)

Now here comes little naked me padding up to the bathroom door
To find little naked you slumped on the bathroom floor
So I guess I'll just stand here with my back against the wall,
While you distill your whole life down to a 9-1-1 call
So now you bring me your bruises
So I can "oh" and "ah" at the display
Maybe I'm supposed to make one of my famous jokes that makes everything okay
Or maybe I'm supposed to be the handsome prince who rides up and unties your hands,
Or maybe I'm supposed to be the furrow-browed friend who thinks she understands

Now here comes little naked me padding up to the bathroom door
To find little naked you slumped on the bathroom floor
So I guess I'll just stand here with my back against the wall
While you distill your whole life down to a 9-1-1 call1Embed
