Independence Day LyricsWe drove the car to the top of the parking ramp
4th of july
Sat out on the hood with a couple of warm beers
And watched the fire works explode in the sky
And there was an exodus of birds in the trees
Cuz they didn't know that we were only pretending
And the people all looked up and looked pleased
And the birds flew around like the whole world was ending
I don't think war is noble
And i don't like to think that love is like war
But I've got a big hot cherry bomb
And i wanna slip it through the mail slot
Of your front door
And now you can't leave me here
I've got your back now
You'd better have mine
Cuz you say the coast is clear
But you say that all the time
So many sheep i quit counting
Sleepless and embarassed
About the way that i feel
Trying to make mole hills out of mountains
Building base camp at the bottom
Of a really big deal
Did i ever tell you how i stopped eating
When you stopped calling me
I was cramped up
And shitting rivers for weeks
And pretending that i was finally free
And you can't leave me here
Yeah now that your back
You better stay this time
Cuz you say the coast is clear
But you say that all the time
I drove the car to the top of the parking ramp
4th of july
I planted my dusty boots on the bumper
Sat out on the hood
And looked up at the skyEmbed
