Swan Dive LyricsCradling the softest, warmest part of you in my hand
Feels like a little baby bird fallen from the nest
I think that your body is something i understand
I think that i'm happy, i think that i'm blessed
I've got a lack of inhibition
I've got a loss of perspective
I've had a little bit to drink
And it's making me think
That i can jump ship and swim
That the ocean will hold me
That there's got to be more
Than this boat i'm in
'cuz they can call me crazy if i fail
All the chance that i need
Is one-in-a-million
And they can call me brilliant
If i succeed
Gravity is nothing to me, moving at the speed of sound
I'm just going to get my feet wet
Until i drown
And i teeter between tired
And really, really tired
Im wiped and im wired but i guess its just as well
Because i built my own empire
Out of car tires and chicken wire
And i'm queen of my own compost heap
And i'm getting used to the smell
And i've got a lack of information
But i got a little revelation
And i'm climbing up on the railing
Trying not to look down
I'm going to do my best swan dive
Into shark-infested waters
I'm gonna pull out my tampon
And start splashing around
'cuz i don't care if they eat me alive
I've got better things to do than survive
I've got a memory of your warm skin in my hand
And i've got a vision of blue sky and dry land
I'm cradling the hardest, heaviest part of me in my hands
The ship is pitching and heaving, our limbs are bobbing and weaving
And i think this is what i understand
I just need a couple vaccinations for my far-away vacation
I'm going to go ahead boldly because a little bird told me
That jumping is easy, that falling is fun
Right up 'til you hit the sidewalk, shivering, stunned
And they can call me crazy if i fail
All the chance that i need
Is one-in-a-million
And they can call me brilliant
If i succeed
Gravity is nothing to me
Moving at the speed of sound
I'm just gonna get my feet wet
Until i drown...Embed
