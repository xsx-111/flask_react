Little Plastic Castle LyricsIn a coffee shop in a city
Which is every coffee shop
In every city
On a day which is every day
I picked up a magazine
Which is every magazine
Read a story then I forgot it right away
And they say goldfish have no memory
I guess their lives are much like mine
And the little plastic castle
Is a surprise every time
And it's hard to say if they're happy
But they don't seem much to mind
From the shape of your shaved head
I recognized your silhouette
As you walked out of the sun and sat down
And the sight of your sleepy smile eclipsed all the other people
As they paused to sneer at the two girls from out of town
And I said, "Look at you this morning
You are by far the cutest
But be careful getting coffee
I think these people want to shoot us
Or maybe there's some kind of local competition here
To see who can be the rudest"
People talk about my image
Like i come in two dimensions
Like lipstick is a sign of my decling mind
Like what I happen to be wearing
The day that someone takes a picture
Is my new statement for all womankind
And i wish they could see us now
In leather bras and rubber shorts
Like some ridiculous new team uniform
For some ridiculous new sport
Quick someone call the girl police
And file a report
In a coffee shop in a city
Which is every coffee shop
In every city
On a day which is every dayEmbed
