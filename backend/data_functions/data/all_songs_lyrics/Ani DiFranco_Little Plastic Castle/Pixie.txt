Pixie LyricsI'm a pixie
I'm a paper doll
I'm a cartoon
I'm a chipper cheerful free for all
And i light up a room
I'm the color me happy girl
Miss live and let live
And when they're out for blood
I always
(give)
The man behind the counter looks like he's got
A half a dozen places he'd rather be
And furthermore it looks like he's prepared
To take it all out on me
Buddy, i don't really care what your problem is
Just don't make it mine
Come on kids, let's all hold hands
And pretend we're having a good time
Maybe you don't like your job
Maybe you didn't get enough sleep
Well, nobody likes their job
Nobody got enough sleep
Maybe you just had
The worst day of your life
But, you know, there's no escape
And there's no excuse
So just suck up
Suck up
Suck up and be nice
Be nice (repeated)
All the privilaged white kids on tv
Playing at death
Banishing their cold cuts
With their ghostly makeup
And their heroin breath
And all the little fishes are flapping wildly
On their hooks
While all the top critics find great meaning
In the telephone book
And the little emperor he has no clothes
So he can't come out to play
And besides which life is suffering
And he likes it that way
And the little guy is not so friendly
But you know life has been cruel
So wipe that smile off your face, baby
And try to be cool
Maybe you don't like your job
Maybe you didn't get enough sleep
Well, nobody likes their job
And nobody got enough sleep
Maybe you just had
The worst day of your life
But, you know, there's no escape
There's no excuse
So just suck up and be nice
Be nice (repeated)
Yeah, i would like to perfect the art
Of being studiously aloof
Like life is just a boring chore
And i am living proof
I could join forces with an army
Or early hipsters
But then i guess i'd be out of a job
So i guess that's out of the picture
Cuz i am a pixie
I am a paper doll
I'm a cartoon
I'm a chipper cheerful free for all
And i light up a room
I'm the color me happy girl
Miss live and let live
And when they're out for blood
I always (give)Embed
