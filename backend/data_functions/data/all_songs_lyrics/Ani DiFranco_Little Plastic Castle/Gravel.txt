Gravel LyricsI heard the sound of your bike
As your wheels hit the gravel
Then your engine in the driveway
Cutting off
And i pushed through the screen door
And i stood out on the porch
Thinking fight, fight, fight
At all costs
But instead i let you in
Just like i've always done
And i sat you down and offered you a beer
And across the kitchen table
I fired several rounds
But you were still sitting there
When the smoke cleared
And you came crawling back
To say that you wanna
Make good in the end
And oh, oh
Let me count the ways
That i abhor you
And you were never a good lay
And you were never a good friend
But, oh, oh, what else can i say...
I adore you
All i need is my leather
One t-shirt and two socks
I'll keep my hands warm
In your pockets
And you can use the engine block
And we'll ride out to california
With my arms around your chest
And i'll pretend that this is real
'cuz this is what i like best
And you've been juggling two women
Like a stupid circus clown
Telling us both we are the one
And maybe you can keep me from ever being happy
But you're not gonna stop me from having fun
So let's go before i change my mind
I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind
'cuz i am bigger than everything that came before
And you were never very kind
And you let me way down every time
But oh, oh, oh what can i say...
I adore you
I heard the sound of your bike
As your wheels hit the gravel
Then your engine in the driveway
Cutting offEmbed
