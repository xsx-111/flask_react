Glasshouse LyricsSitting in my glasshouse
While your ghost is sleeping down the hall
Watching the little birds fly
Kamikaze missions into the walls
Think i'm gonna stay in today
Sit on my couch and watch them fall
(drums)
Life just keeps getting harder
Keeps getting harder to hide
Darker it is around me
Easier it is to see inside
And outside the glass
The whole world is magnified
And it's half an inch
From here to the other side
(chorus)
Guess that push has come to this
So i guess this must be shove
But before you throw those stones at me
Tell me what's your house made of
If you think you know what i'm doing wrong
You're going to have to get in line
For the purposes of this song
Lets just say i'm doing fine
Sure, i'm doing fine
Trapped in my glasshouse
Crowd has been gathering since dawn
Make a pot of coffee
While catastrophe awaits me out on the lawn
Think i'm going to stay in today
Pretend like i don't know what's going on
I guess that push has come to this
So i guess this must be shove
But before you throw those stones at me
Tell me what's your house made of
And before you'll know what i'm doing wrong
You're going to have to get in line
So for the purposes of this song
Lets just say i'm doing fine
Sure, i'm doing fine
Sitting in my glass house
Sitting in my glass houseEmbed
