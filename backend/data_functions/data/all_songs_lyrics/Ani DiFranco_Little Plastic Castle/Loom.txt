Loom LyricsYou always got those dark sunglasses
Covering half your face
But if you promise to take them off
Promise i won't squander your gaze
I will be picturesque
I will be nice
I won't do anything you can't tell your own wife
I will think before i act
I will think twice
Just let me see your eyes
Each time we've spoke, put in our tokens, ridden the tilt-a-whirl
And i was giggling and dizzy
Flirting like a 12 year old girl
The carnival of you and me was coming to town
Watch how we spin and spin and then fall down
Now we just say hello and head for firmer ground
You are the one-way glass
That watches me
Standing in line at the bank
I always looks into your glasses
Like a cat looks into a fish tank
But all i could ever see
Was the specter of me reflected
I want a monument of a friendship
That we never had erected
I wanted to take up lots of room
I wanted to loom
You always got those dark sunglasses
Between us when we talk
But after the party is over
If you wanna take a walk
We could just look around
Not do nothing wrong
Just try to be at least as brave as our songs
I will bring my heart
I will bring my face
You name the time and placeEmbed
