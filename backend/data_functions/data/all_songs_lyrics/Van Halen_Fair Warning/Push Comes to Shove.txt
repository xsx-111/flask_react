Push Comes to Shove LyricsDoes it seem cold in here to you?
What's there to do tonight, anything?
Give me another cigarette
Is there anything left in that bottle?
Yeah, give it here
Some people live apart;
They break your heart so damn easy
And then one night in stunning victory
She decides and you agree, she's leaving
Will you ever be the same?
Will you ever be the same?
That's when push comes to shove
I believe it was inevitable
That's when push comes to shove
Could this be the one that got away?
I get the message
Guess I knew it all along
Say you're a stranger
Here in paradise, you fool
Seems like forty days and forty nights
Since someone used my first name
Including you
Will you ever be the same?
Is this the one that got away?
Push, shove, push, shove
Now I'm ahead of the game
Driving me insane
It's a small change
Ooh, I'm just a pushover
Over and overEmbed
