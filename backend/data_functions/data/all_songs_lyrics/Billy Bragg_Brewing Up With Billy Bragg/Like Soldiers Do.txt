Like Soldiers Do LyricsBlues eyes fighting the grey eyes fighting the tears
Armed to the teeth for a war of words
Reaching all the years
I advanced across a poppy field
I saw the gleam as you raised your shield
And love screamed down
With the sun behind its back
Our Fathers were all soldiers
Shall we be soldiers too
Fighting and falling like soldiers do
Nothing is clear in this tactical unclear war
I can't be bothered to find out
What we are fighting for
No one can win this war of the senses
I see no reason to drop my defences
So stand fast my emotions
Rally round my shaking heart
Our Fathers were all soldiers
Shall we be soldiers too
Fighting and falling like soldiers do
Blue eyes fighting the grey eyes fighting the tears
Armed to the teeth for a war of words
Reaching all the years
I advanced across a poppy field
I saw the gleam as you raised your shield
And love screamed down
With the sun behind its back
I knew once again I was under attack
So stand fast my emotions
Rally round my shaking heart
Our Fathers were all soldiers
Shall we be soldiers too
Fighting and falling like soldiers
Fighting and falling like soldiers
Fighting and falling like soldiers doEmbed
