This Guitar Says Sorry LyricsSandra met Raymond at the Race Relations
Much to the dismay of her family and friends
The love that we have is so important
The time that it takes to make a baby
Can be the time it takes to make a cup of tea
The love that we have is so important
He still goes dancing and she still cuts hair
They put the baby into Council care
The love that we have is so importantEmbed
