You Got the Power LyricsI'm leaving you, darling
And I won't be back
I found something better
Somewhere down the track
Oh, oh, I need you, darling
You've got the power
You've got the power of love
In your hands
You've got the power of love
To make me understand
Oh, oh, I want you to try me
You've got the power
I told you, darling
That I would stand by your side
Remember the days that you made me cry
But, oh, my darling, oh, my little darling
You've got the power of love
You've got the power of love
We belong together
And I know, I know we love each other
We belong together
And, darling, you know I don't
Have to look no further cause
You've got the power
I need you, darling (in your hands)
Oh, yes you have
You've got the power to love
To make me understand
You've got the power
You've got the power
You've got the powerEmbed
