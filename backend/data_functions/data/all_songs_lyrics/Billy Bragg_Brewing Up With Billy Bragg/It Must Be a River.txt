It Must Be a River LyricsSomething starts swimming inside of me
At the sound of your name
And the pressure on my lips
I'm falling, falling
It must be a river
'Cause it swept me away
It must be a river
'Cause it swept me away
Something starts swimming inside of me
At the sound of your name
And the water on fire
I'm falling, falling
It must be a river
'Cause it swept me away
It must be a river
'Cause it swept me away
Something starts swimming inside of me
At the sound of your voice
And the waterfall's walling
I'm drowning, drowning
It must be a river
'Cause it swept me away
It must be a river
'Cause it swept me away
It must be a river
'Cause it swept me away
It must be a river
It swept me awayEmbed
