Love Gets Dangerous Lyrics
The love of a woman
The fear of the phone
A secret message to a happy home
I've never been so scared
I never knew you cared

Love gets dangerous
Love gets dangerous

There's a fear that comes from being in danger
Being in love with a total stranger
Putting our futures in jeopardy
When love is a secret, fear is the key

When we meet in the street
My terror is complete


Like a drug that threatens to take my life
Lust is a cancer, love is a vice
When she holds me I understand
Respect and fear go hand in hand
No need to act tough
It scares me just enough
