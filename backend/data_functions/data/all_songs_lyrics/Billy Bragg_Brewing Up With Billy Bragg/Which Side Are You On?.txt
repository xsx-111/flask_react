Which Side Are You On? LyricsThis government had an idea
And parliament made it law
It seems like it's illegal
To fight for the union anymore
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?
We set out to join the picket line
For together we cannot fail
We got stopped by police at the county line
They said, "Go home boys or you're going to jail"
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?
It's hard to explain to a crying child
Why her Daddy can't go back
So the family suffer but it hurts me more
To hear a scab say, "Sod you, Jack"
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?
I'm bound to follow my conscience
And do whatever I can
But it'll take much more than the union law
To knock the fight out of a working man
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?
Which side are you on, boys?
Which side are you on?Embed
