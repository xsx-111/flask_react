Kiss Me Goodbye LyricsI used to belong here
Be safe from the world here
Share wine and believe
You'd share yours forever
Time passes to past tense
I walked past the sealed ends
Pretended I was king
With my back turned on the faithful
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me out of your eye
Shooting star
Let the clouds pass you by
These scents here are yours now
Mine's blown out but somehow
I wish they'd return
Just can't find a way how
Never becomes always
If you miss all these warnings
I sure missed them all
Dragged you with me falling
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me out of your eye
Shooting star
Wet my lips one last time
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me out of your eye
Shooting star
Wet my lips one last time
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me out of your eye
Shooting star
Let the clouds pass you byEmbed
