Make It Grand LyricsAll i hear
Is how
How you want it to be
All I see
Right now
Is that you can't make it real
Unconscious overload
Too long
Blew your castles away
Milkman always comes again
You'd make it grand
Out there
But I always find you here
'cause all that monsters fear
Is the day
All I see
You wear
Is a confident smile
All of my
Concerns
Pours the fuel on your fire
Leaving a war behind
You'd drink
Till you thought you'd forget
Milkman turned you down today
You'd make it grand
Out there
But I always find you here
'cause all that monsters fear
Is the day
You turn around
With your head upside down
Don't know how
To grab it, to hold it, to keep it close to you
You'd make it grand
Out there
But I always find you here
'cause all that monsters fear
Is the day
You'd make it grand
Out there
But you're still just sittin' here
'cause all your monsters fear
Is the change
Is the changeEmbed
