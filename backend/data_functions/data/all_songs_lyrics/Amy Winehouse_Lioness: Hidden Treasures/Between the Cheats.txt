Between the Cheats Lyrics
I would die before I divorce ya
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
'Cause anyone who's seen us
Through our victories and dumb defeats
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

Between the cheats, the, ah (Between the cheats)
Between the cheats, the, ah (Between the cheats)

My husband is the finest, handsome hustler
And he still makes this housewife blush
So I'm holding my hand in his
I'm sittin' on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swim in him with green eyes
Then go home and cash the chips you've got
And here, maybe two, oh, two bottles
The jack of hearts is my jackpot

Between the cheats, the, ah (Between the cheats)
Between the cheats, the, ah (Between)
'Cause we all have to lock eyes
And I know is my heart beat
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats

Between the cheats, the, ah (Between the cheats)
Between the cheats, the, ah (Between)
Between the cheats, the, ah (Between the cheats)
Between the cheats, the, ah (Between the cheats)Embed
