Body and Soul Lyrics
My heart is sad and lonely
For you, I sigh
For you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance, oh

Are you pretending? It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove it, dear

My life, a wreck, you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear

My life, a wreck, you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul3Embed
