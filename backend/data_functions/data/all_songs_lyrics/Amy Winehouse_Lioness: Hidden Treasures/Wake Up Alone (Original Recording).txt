Wake Up Alone (Original Recording) Lyrics
It's okay in the day, I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself, I do a 180
I stay up, clean the house
Least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
And that silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears when the sun sets

He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

If I was my heart, I'd rather be restless
The second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
This ache in my chest
'Cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
And he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light
He is fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in

And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone1Embed
