Love You Alice/D LyricsPull my face back
And lead me by the tongue
Pull my face back
You'll see a burning sun
Love you, Alice, I do
Your touch has made me see
Love you, Alice, I do
Love her, and she love me
Pull my eyes out
And lead me by the holes
Pull my eyes out
You'll see two burning coals
She's not throwing sticks at me
It feels like I'm on fire
She's just playing tricks on me
She burns me gently
She's so friendlyEmbed
