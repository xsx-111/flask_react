Shine (In Your Mind) LyricsHere I come
A marigold for you to hold
Now one on one
There's something for us to share
Shine in your mind
Leave these things behind
Shine in your mind
And, whoa, you are already there
And, whoa, you dissolve in the air
And, whoa, you are everywhere
Now shine in your mind
Shine in your
Look outside
A splendid world for us unfurled
Now close your eyes
There's so much more for us in store
Shine in your mind
Leave these things behind
Shine in your mind
And, whoa, you are already there
And, whoa, you dissolve in the air
And, whoa, you are everywhere
Now shine in your mind
Shine in your
Your mind is falling from the trees
And everything you see
Your mind is pouring from the sky
And flowing to your eyes
Your mind is everywhere you go
You know it is, you know
You are for real
The things you need all sow the seeds
For things you feel
There's something there for us to share
Shine in your mind
Leave these things behind
Shine in your mind
And, whoa, you are already there
And, whoa, you dissolve in the air
And, whoa, you are everywhere
Now shine in your mind
Shine in your
Your mind is everything you are
You know it is, you know you areEmbed
