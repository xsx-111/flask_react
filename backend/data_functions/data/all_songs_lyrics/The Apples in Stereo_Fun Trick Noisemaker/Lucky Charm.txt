Lucky Charm LyricsJust ask the folks who knew me when
They'll say, "Nice boy, but he's always been
Well-behaved, kinda strange
None of that has changed
"The last we heard, he left the ground
Won't turn up in the lost and found
He's lost, lost in space
Take a good look at his face"
She's got me in orbit
God, I love her and her lucky charms
She's got me in orbit
How they jingle jangle on her arms
And I jingle jangle in her arms
It's bad enough to be alone
But locked up in the Phantom Zone
Is the worst place to be
She's the first girl that could see me
She's got me in orbit
God, I love her and her lucky charms
She's got me in orbit
How they jingle jangle on her arms
And I jingle jangle in her armsEmbed
