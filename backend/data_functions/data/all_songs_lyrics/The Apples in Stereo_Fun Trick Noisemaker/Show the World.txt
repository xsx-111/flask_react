Show the World LyricsDon't, dont give in to the things that you despair
Use, use your mind, you may find why they are there
Don't, don't give in to the things that you despise
Use, use your hands pull the strands out of your eyes
I could have cried to see you hide behind your hair
Smile, little girl and show the world that you are there
Think, think it out, think about what you perceive
You world is small if that is all that you believe
I could have cried to see you hide behind your hair
Smile, little girl and show the world that you are there
Or does it astound you that there's a world around you?Embed
