Winter Must Be Cold LyricsHe's been born to the sky
She can't seem to get as high
He sees her from the ground
That's okay, she's always 'round
Winter must be cold because
You already missed the spring
I won't give it up until I get my ring
He asks her on a date
She accepts, they stay up late
Riding off to the sun
Winter's never been this fun
Winter must be cold because
You already missed the spring
I won't give it up until I get my ring
Shorter days, and the snow
Summer seems to come so slow
Winter must be cold because
You already missed the spring
I won't give it up until I get my ring
Winter must be cold because
You already missed the spring
I won't give it up until I get my ringEmbed
