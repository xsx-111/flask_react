The Narrator LyricsThis program is coming to you via relay 2 satellite, a spacecraft orbiting the earth at a speed of over 17,000 miles per hour
The musical selections you're about to hear were first tape-recorded and fed in to a transmitter where they were beamed to relay 2 spacecraft
As you listen to the musical selections, note the clarity and excellent stereophonic separation between the left and right channels, even after traversing 12,000 miles through spaceEmbed
