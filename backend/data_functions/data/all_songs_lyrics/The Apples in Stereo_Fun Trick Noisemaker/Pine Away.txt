Pine Away LyricsEvening, the sky is glowing
Underneath us the grass is slowing down
On its way up to the sun
Lying around devoting time
To watching the stars exploding off
Into space one by one
Takes me to a distant place and time
This is not the first time I have pined
Puts me in a distant state of mind
This is not the first time I have pined
I pine away
I love the older people
They seem to live in a world of simple life
Where simple pleasures still belong
Years past, they contemplated
How the world was less complicated off
Years before they came along
Takes me to a distant place and time
This is not the first time I have pined
Puts me in a distant state of mind
This is not the first time I have pined
I pine after my home, the yard
The olden days, the faraway
The stars that rain over it all
Lying around devoting time
To watching the stars exploding off
Into space one by one
Takes me to a distant place and time
This is not the first time I have pined
Puts me in a distant state of mind
This is not the first time I have pined
I pine awayEmbed
