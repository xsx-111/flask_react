Glowworm LyricsPut a penny in the pot
Put a nickel in your pocket
Every nickel that you've got
Is a nickel in the slot
You just had to spend it all
Every hour, every minute
You had to make it all
Wonderful, beautiful
You lived to burn
You were a glowworm
You lit the sky
You were a firefly
I remember you in sparks
Keep your picture in my locket
It's an image in my heart
I can wear anywhere
I could never give it up
I could never do without it
I just want to live it up
Like you did, that you did
You lived to burn
You were a glowworm
You lit the sky
You were a firefly
I remember you in sparks
Keep your picture in my locket
It's an image in my heart
I can wear anywhere
I could never give it up
I could never do without it
I just want to live it up
Like you did, that you did
You lived to burn
You were a glowworm
You lit the sky
You were a firefly
You lit my eye
You were a firefly
You lived, I learned
I am a glowworm
Spoken:
You are listening to the first stereo broadcast
As it was relayed from outer space
And received and recorded back on EarthEmbed
