Green Machine LyricsWhat happened to me, wake me up from this dream
I want my Green Machine, don't wanna keep myself clean
Where can I go, I feel I'm running low
A cinema show to forget what I know, to forget what I know
Saturdays and Superfriends
These are things that I can still remember
Saturdays and Superfriends
These are things I thought would last forever
No money to spend, just my best friends
Wish I could turn a bend, be with them again
On my Green Machine, that wasn't a dream
Some things still seem important to me, seem important to me
Saturdays and Superfriends
These are things that I can still remember
Saturdays and Superfriends
These are things I thought would last forever
Summertime, the world should shine, shine for everyone
Days on end, time to spend, underneath the sun
If you grow old, time's bought and sold, time's yours when you're young
And summer comes for everyone underneath the sun
Something inside feels like butterflies
I want to run and hide or take off and ride
My Green Machine, that wasn't a dream
Some things still seem important to me, seem important to me
Saturdays and Superfriends
These are things that I can still remember
Saturdays and Superfriends
These are things I thought would last forever1Embed
