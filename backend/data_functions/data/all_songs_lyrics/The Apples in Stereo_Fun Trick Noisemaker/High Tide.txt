High Tide Lyrics
Come with me, wading in the sea
It's high (high) tide (tide), glad you arrived
Look around, sea foam on the ground
It's high (high) tide (tide), glad you're on time

This summer's not over until we say goodbye
Then will the tears roll out on the tide?

You and me, starfish in the sea
It's high (high) tide (tide), we're on the rise
When we're old, stories can be told
Of high (high) times (times) to be alive

This summer's forever, won't ever pass us by
Or will the years roll out on the tide?

(High tide)
This summer's forever, won't ever pass us by
Or will the years roll out on the tide?
I'll remember this summer until the day I die
Then will the tears roll out on the tide?Embed
