Dots 1-2-3 LyricsStep inside the rocket ride
You're leaving on a race through outer space
Speeding your way to the constellations
It's easy, you can trace a starry face and see me
Dots, dots, dots, dots, one, two, three
Dots, dots, dots, dots, connecting me
What's your sign, can you draw the line around it?
If you can, you're a spaceman, you've found it
On the trail of a comet's tail, believe me
You can lose face in the constellations, it's easy
Dots, dots, dots, dots, one, two, three
Dots, dots, dots, dots, connecting meEmbed
