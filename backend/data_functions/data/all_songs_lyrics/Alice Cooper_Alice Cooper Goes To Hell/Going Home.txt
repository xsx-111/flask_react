Going Home LyricsI'm going home
There I am in my bedroom
I'm safe and snug and snoring
And so glad to be there
I'm going home
None of this ever happened
But God, I really did it
Still nothing has changed
I'm going home
I'm going home
To my own room to all the mess
To all the dirty laundry
It looks so good I don't care
I'm just so glad to be back home
Sweet home
I wonder if anyone missed me
Or have I been gone so long
They thought that I died
How many said I wonder what happened to Alice
How many shrugged or laughed
How many cried
But I don't give a damn
'Cuz I'm going home
I'm going home
To my own room to all the mess
To all the dirty laundry
It looks so good I don't care
I'm just so glad to be back home
Sweet home
I'm going home
Nothing can stop me now
I'm going home
Nothing can stop me now
I'm going home
Nothing can stop me now
I'm going home
Nothing can stop me now
I'm going home
Nothing can stop me now
I'm going home
Nothing can stop me nowEmbed
