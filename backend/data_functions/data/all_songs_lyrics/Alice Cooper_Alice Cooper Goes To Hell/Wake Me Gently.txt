Wake Me Gently LyricsI was scared to death
Afraid to close my eyes
And find that I was gone
Like every other one
Who left before the dawn
I vanished in the air
Am I still there
Wake me gently
If you can
Wake me gently
Just touch my hand
Wake me gently
Pull my sleeve
'Cuz where I'm at
Is where I want to leave
And in my sleep
I look so lifeless on this bed
Laid out on satin sheets
This dream's a novel
That I don't dare complete
No happy ending read
I think the hero's dead
Wake me gently
If you can
Wake me gently
Just touch my hand
Wake me gently
Pull my sleeve
'Cuz where I'm at
Is where I want to leave
Me to my slumber
And I'll never come home
Please help me, I'm frightened
Of what's going on
What's going on
And if I can't wake up Will I be all alone
A stranded orphan here
Or will I bump into
Some other wandering soul
And will they talk to me
Somebody, somebody please rescue me
Wake me gently
If you can
Wake me gently
Just touch my hand
Wake me gently
Pull my sleeve
'Cuz where I'm at
Is where I want to leave
I wanna leave
I wanna leave
I wanna wake up
I wanna leave
I don't wanna stay
I wanna leave
I wanna go
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Just wake me up
I wanna go home
Wake me up please
'Cuz I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wake me
Wake meEmbed
