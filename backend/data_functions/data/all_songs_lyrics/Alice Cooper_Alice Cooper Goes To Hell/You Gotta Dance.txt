You Gotta Dance LyricsWe like to throw our bodies around
We like to feel each other
We're all slaves when we hear that sound
Says dance
Says dance
Says ya gotta dance
Says dance
(And there ain't no two ways about it)
We're all compelled to rise and thrust
When we all move together
We're hypnotized with savage lust
Says dance
Says dance
Says ya gotta dance
Says dance
I'm so hot it makes me shiver
Makes me wet
Makes me slide
It's some spirit I'm possessed by
I can't stop
We just got to dance
Dance
Dance
We gotta blow when we say blow
And we gotta shake and shimmy
We got the strings tied to our soul
Says dance
Says dance
Says we gotta dance
(And I don't mean tomorrow)
I'm so hot it makes me shiver
Makes me wet
Makes me slide
It's some spirit I'm possessed by
I can't stop
We just got to dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
