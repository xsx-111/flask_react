Bricks Lyrics
When faith alone is not enough
To keep our heads barely above
We look for reason and come up empty-handed
And when our children fight our wars
While we sit back just keeping score
We're teaching murder not understanding now

We're setting the fires to light the way
We're burning it all to begin again
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands
We sing for change

The lives our buried sons have laid
Will cancel debts we've yet to pay
How could we justify anything now
As long as we blindly obey and do exactly what they say
We'll have no one to blame but ourselves now

We're setting the fires to light the way
We're burning it all to begin again
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands
We sing for change
We run on the fumes of injustice
We'll never die with the fuel that you give us
Keep it coming cause I'm prepared to burn
Keep running from me at every turn
Your life around
(Into something true, into something true)
So turn your life around
(Into something true, something true)

We're setting the fires to light the way
We're burning it all to begin again
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hand
We sing for change3Embed
