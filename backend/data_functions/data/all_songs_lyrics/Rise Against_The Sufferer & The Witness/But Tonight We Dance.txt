But Tonight We Dance Lyrics
Breathe deep and easy, swallow this pride
Stare at my shaking hands through bone-dry, blood-shot eyes
Clock strip the hours, I count the miles
Will you be there waiting, awake until sunrise?

I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days
I crawled from the sink-holes, collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight?

In the glow of twilight, our world is finally calm
I felt it complete me, when the stars give way to dawn
A language universal, but I speak not its tongue
Is this a night that spans forever or a dawn that never comes?

I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days
I crawled from the sink-holes, collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight?

Tomorrow we might wake in servitude and silence
I will give you everything if only you would have me
Tomorrow we will sweat and toil
Our hands will quiver, caked with soil
Tomorrow we'll give it one last chance
But tonight we dance
But tonight we dance!
I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days
I crawled from the sink-holes, collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight?6Embed
