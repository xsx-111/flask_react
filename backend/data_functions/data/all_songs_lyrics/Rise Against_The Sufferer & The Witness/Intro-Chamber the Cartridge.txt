Intro/Chamber the Cartridge LyricsThis is Noyes

Down beyond these city streets through gutters filled with black debris
In alleys void of any light where nameless things live out of sight
Down through the scrapers of the sky past neon words glowing all night
Echoes my name between each car, “Are you happy where you are?”

Blind to this impending fate
We'll let the world carry our weight
It's back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial

Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Let's go!

And so we carry on each day as if our lives are not so grey
While every breath that we take, we only suffocate
Brush past a myriad of scenes a homeless vet crashed
On Wall Street, a single mom of three, a TV personality
I'm blind to this impending fate
We'll let the world carry their weight
Its back breaks with every mile
But they all live in denial

Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right
Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mineEmbed
