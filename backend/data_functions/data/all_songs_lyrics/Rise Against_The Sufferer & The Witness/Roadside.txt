Roadside Lyrics
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
With all these left over feelings of you
Cause I don't know
And tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When all these nightmares become real
Cause I don't know

And I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we separate the lies here from the truth
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do

So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry;
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry

And I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do

So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
Cause I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do
Exactly what to do5Embed
