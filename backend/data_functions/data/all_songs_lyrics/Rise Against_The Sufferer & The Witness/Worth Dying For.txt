Worth Dying For Lyrics
Set me off like dynamite strapped tight around my waist
We are the ones in competition but claim this ain't no race
Let's go!
Take a breath and explode like bullets tearing through the wind
Cut me up with a razor blade that tries to separate the skin
Now in the
White flames of burning flags we
Found a world worth dying for, yeah
We've been battered so hard that we don't feel anymore

Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?

Send me off on the morning breeze so far away from here
Feel me rise in the strength I've found inside the warm embracing air
I'm moving slow
Like a glacier melting watch me dissipate
I searched for love in an empty world but all I found was hate
Now in the
White flames of burning flags we
Found a world worth dying for, yeah
We've been battered so hard that we don't feel anymore
Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?

Don't ask me why
Cause I don't know
Don't ask me how
I'm gonna solve this on my own
Don't ask me why
Cause I don't know
These things I've never faced
Scratch out, but won't erase
In the wreckage of a job well done
I saw a place I'd never seen before, yeah
And that moment I refused to close my eyes anymore

So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?
So take me
So take me4Embed
