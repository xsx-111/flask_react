Blister in the Sun Lyrics
When I'm out walking, I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out

Let me go on
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands, I know you're the one

Body and beats, I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry

Let me go on
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands, I know you're the one

When I'm out walking, I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out
When I'm out walking, I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out
Body and beats, I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry

When I'm out walking, I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out

Let me go on
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands, I know you're the one15Embed
