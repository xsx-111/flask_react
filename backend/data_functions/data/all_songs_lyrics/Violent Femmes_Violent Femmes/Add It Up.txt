Add It Up LyricsDay after day
I will walk and I will play
But the day after today
I will stop and I will start
Why can't I get just one kiss?
Why can't I get just one kiss?
Believe me, there'd be some things that I wouldn't miss
But I look at your pants and
I need a kiss
Why can't I get just one screw?
Why can't I get just one screw?
Believe me, I'd know what to do
But something won't let me make
Love to you
Why can't I get just one fuck?
Why can't I get just one fuck?
I guess it's got something to do with luck
But I waited my whole life for just one
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I take a bow and say goodnight
Mo my momma momma mo my mum
Have you kept your eye, your eye on your son?
I know you've had problems, you're not the only one
But when your sugar left, he left you on the run
So mo my momma momma mo my mum
Take a look now, look what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Cause he went downtown and he got him a gun
So don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Broken-down kitchen at the top of the stairs
Can I mix in with your affairs?
Share a smoke, make a joke
Grasp and reach for a leg of hope
Words to memorize, words hypnotize
Words make my mouth exercise
Words all fail the magic prize
Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs
But mo my momma momma mo my mother
I would love to love you, lover
The city's restless
It's ready to pounce
It go here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce
Sayin' mo my momma momma mo my mother
I would love to love you, lover
The city's restless
It's ready to pounce
It go here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce
Said I'm giving you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she was about ready to cut it up
She said, "Wait a minute, honey, I'm gonna add it up"
I'm gonna add it up
Add it up
Add it up
Add it up
Add it up
Add it up
Add it up
See what'cha got, you gotta add it up
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I take a bow and say goodnight
Good-night4Embed
