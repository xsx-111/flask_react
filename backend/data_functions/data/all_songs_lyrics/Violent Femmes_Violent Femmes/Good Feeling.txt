Good Feeling LyricsGood feeling
Won't you stay with me
Just a little longer?
It always seems like you're leaving
When I need you here
Just a little longer
Oh, dear lady
There's so many things
That I have come to fear
A little voice says I'm going crazy
To see all my worlds
Disappear
Vague sketch of a fantasy
Laughing at the sunrise
Like he's been up all night
Ooh, slipping and sliding
What a good time
But now I have to find a bed
That can take this weight
Good feeling
Won't you stay with me
Just a little longer?
Y'know, it always seems like you're leaving
When I know the other one
Just a little too well
Oh, dear lady
Won't you stay with me
Just a little longer?
Y'know it always seems, always seems like you're leaving
When I need you here
Just a little longerEmbed
