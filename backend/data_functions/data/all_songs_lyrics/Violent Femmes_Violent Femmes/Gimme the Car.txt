Gimme the Car LyricsCome on, Dad
Gimme the car tonight
Come on, Dad
Gimme the car tonight
I got this girl, I wanna...
Come on, dad, gimme the car
Come on, Dad
Gimme the car tonight
I tell ya what
I tell ya what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna pick her up
I'm gonna get her drunk
I'm gonna make her cry
I'm gonna get her high
I'm gonna make her laugh
I'm gonna make her... shh...
Woman, woman, woman
I know she's it
Cause I'm gonna
Touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
And she can
Touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
Time goes by, I can feel myself growing old
Burning inside, it's making this boy turn out cold
What's wrong?
What's right?
I don't care when I hate my life
What's wrong?
What's right?
You know, people don't care
When they hate their life
But how can I explain personal pain?
How can I explain personal pain?
How can I explain, my voice is in vain
How can I explain the deep down driving
Driving
Driving
We're driving
We're driving
We're driving
Well, ohhh...
Hey, Dad
Speaking of driving...
Come on, Dad
Gimme the car tonight
So much he don't understand
Just might never make it to a man
Come on, Dad
Gimme the car
Come on, Dad
I ain't no runt
Come on, girl
Gimme your...
Cause I ain't had much to live for
I ain't had much to live for
You know, I ain't had much to live for
You know, I ain't had much to live forEmbed
