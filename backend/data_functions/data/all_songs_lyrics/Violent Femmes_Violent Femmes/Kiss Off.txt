Kiss Off Lyrics
I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
Could it be you?
Could it be you?
Situation gets rough, then I start to panic
It's not enough, it's just a habit
Hey, kid, you're sick
Well, darling, this is it

You can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, they do it all the time (Yeah, yeah)
They do it all the time (Do it all the time)
They do it all the time (Do it all the time)
They do it all the time, do it all the time

I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record
Oh, yeah?
Well, don't get so distressed
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed?
I take one, one, one 'cause you left me
And two, two, two for my family
And three, three, three for my heartache
And four, four, four for my headaches
And five, five, five for my lonely
And six, six, six for my sorrow
And seven, seven, n-n-n-n-no tomorrow
And eight, eight, I forget what eight was for
But nine, nine, nine for a lost god
And ten, ten, ten, ten for everything, everything, everything, everything

Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, they do it all the time (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, they do it all the time (Do it all the time)
Do it all the time (Do it all the time)
Do it all the time, time, time, time, time, t-time, time
(Do it all the time)
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Do it all the time11Embed
