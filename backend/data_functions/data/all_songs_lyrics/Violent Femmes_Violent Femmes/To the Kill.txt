To the Kill LyricsAin't had no fun
All the time, jacking around
Ain't had no fun
Messing my mind, I kick it around

But if it's all right with you
And if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe
Go ahead
To the kill
I ain't no Kid Chicago
I ain't no Al Capone
But there's a windy city
In my bedroom alone
I said I don't live in Chicago
I don't know no Al Capone
That bitch took my money and she went to Chicago
If I ain't already enough, sick and alone

But if it's all right with you
And if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe
Go ahead
To the kill
Ain't had no fun
Jack, jack, jack, jack, jacking around
Ain't had no fun
(where's it at?)
It's down, down, it's downtown!

But if it's all right with you
And if it's all right, yes, I will
Say it now, it's all right with you
And if it's all right, yes, I will
And if it's all right with you
And if it's all right, yes, I will
And if it's alright with you, dear...
Aw, c'mon, babe
Go ahead
To the killEmbed
