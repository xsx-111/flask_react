Ugly Lyrics
Crossed the path, then I followed your face
It was hard to believe, it was hard to trace
Eh, I saw you today
Seem like I see you everyday
But there's somethin' I figured out about you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
Yeah!

You're so ugly, I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly, don't make no mistake
'Cause you ugly, you can bet it on the bank
Say why, why
Why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?
You're so ugly, all the time
(Ugly!) You ain't no friend of mine
'Cause you ugly, you can bet it on the bank
Say why, why
Why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?
With a smile or a frown
I'm so tired of you bein' around
Engaged in some sexual acts
Well, I'm just gonna have to tell you all the facts
"What could that be?" Well, here's a clue

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
Yeah!

You're so ugly, I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly, don't make no mistake
'Cause you ugly, I'm tellin' you that
I said why, why
Why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?
You're so ugly, all the time
(Ugly!) You ain't no friend of mine
(Ugly!) And you can bet it on the bank
Say why, why
Why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?
You're so ugly, a-la, la, la, la
You're so ugly, a-la, la, la, la
You're so ugly, a-la, la, la, la
You're so ugly
(Ugly!)
So ugly, so ugly
You're so ugly ugly ugly ugly
Ugly ugly ugly ugly
(Ugly!) Ugly!
(Ugly!) Ugly!
(Ugly!) Ugly!
(Ugly!) Ugly!
(Ugly!) Ugly!
(Ugly!) Ugly!
(Ugly!) Ugly!
(Ugly!) Ugly!Embed
