Prove My Love Lyrics
Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become
But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're a thing, I think this thing's begun

Oh, tell me now (What do I have to do?)
Oh, tell me now (What do I have to do?)
Oh, tell me now (What do I have to do?)
Oh, I prove my love to you

Special favors come in thirty-one flavors
We're out of mints, pass the Life Savers
I'm dropping hints
Candy for candy-coated tongue
You'd be so good, so very good for me
What do you think? Tell me honestly
I'm wait, wait, wait, w-wait, wait, waiting for you to come

Oh, tell me now (What do I have to do?)
Yeah, tell me now (What do I have to do?)
Yeah, tell me now (What do I have to do)
Yeah, to prove my love to you?
Third verse, same as the first
Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become
But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're a thing, I think this thing's begun

Oh, tell me now (What do I have to do?)
Yeah, tell me now (What do I have to do?)
I'd do anything (What do I have to do?)
I'd do it all (What do I have to do?)
I'd do it all for you (What do I have to do?)
I'd climb a mountain (What do I have to do?)
I'd cross the ocean (What do I have to do?)
I'd do it all (What do I have to do?)
Oh, I prove my love to you1Embed
