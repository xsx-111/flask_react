Promise LyricsWell, y'know that I want your loving
But my logic tells me it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defenses say I did't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar
Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness
Please ignore my vacant stares
Cause just what I've been through
Is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
And you're unhappy
This is only a guess
Do you know what it's like to hate
When it's way down deep inside?
Oh God, I hate
What's been done to my life
I could rule the pain
I could rule the night
Or would it ruin my salvation?
Ruin my mind
Rule your pains
Rulers of the night
Ruin your salvation
Ruin your mind
You know that I want your loving
Well, then Mr. Logic
Mr. Logic tells me it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defenses say, well, I didn't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar
Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness
Ple-please ignore my vacant stares
Just what I've been through
Is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
A promise
And you're unhappy
And you're unhappy
And you're unhappy
And you're unhappy
This is only a guessEmbed
