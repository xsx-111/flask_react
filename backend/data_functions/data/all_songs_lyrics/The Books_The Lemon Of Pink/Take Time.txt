Take Time LyricsTutto santo
Tutto santo
Tutto santo
Non c' niente di naturale nella natura ragazzo mio
Tentilo bene in mente
(laughter)
Whoooo!
Take time
Take time
Take time
Take time
Take time
Take time
Take time
Noooo! (laughter)
Take time
Take time
Take time
Take time
Take
Time and a time, a time and a time
A time and a time, a time and a time
A time and a time, a time and a time
A time and a time, a time and a time
That which is now
And that which is to be hath already been
That which is now hath already been
To be and that which is
That which is now
For the first time in the history of the world a young girl climbed into a tree one day. She climbed down from the tree next day. God bless her
Time
Something is happening that is not happening
Take
Sex (laughter)
Something is happening which is not happening at all
Time
Take
(laughter)
Ce n'est pas la longueur qui fait la puissance
(laughter)
Time
(That which is now)
Take time
(And that which is to be, that which is now hath already been)
Take time
(That which is now hath already been)
Take time
(There is no remembrance of former things)
Take time
(Time and a time, a time and a time)
Take time
(A time and a time, a time and a time)
Take time
(A time and a time, a time and a time)
Take time
(There is no new thing under the sun)
Take time
Take time
