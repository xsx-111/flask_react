What You Wish For Lyrics
Woke up today
To everything gray
And all that I saw
Just kept going on and on

Sweep all the pieces under the bed
Close all the curtains and cover my head
And what you wish for won't come true
You aren't surprised love, are you?

If this serenade
(Repeat after me)
(Just a little bit closer)
Is not what you want
(Do what is sane)
(Caught up in a lie)
It's just how it is
(Won't change a thing)
(Got a little bit colder)
It keeps going on and on

Come out, come out wherever you are
Would you do it all over right from the start?
And what you wish for won't come true
You aren't surprised love, are you?
So what you wish for won't come true
You aren't surprised love, are you?
Once had this dream
Crashed down in oz
Not black and white
But where the colors are
I never dreamed that
I would let it go

And I will get what I deserve
Keep all the secrets under the bed
Open the curtains, forget what I said
And what you wished for could come true
You aren't surprised love, are you?
So what you wished for could come true
You aren't surprised love, are you?Embed
