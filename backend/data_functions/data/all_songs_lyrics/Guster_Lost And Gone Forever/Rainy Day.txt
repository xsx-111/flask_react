Rainy Day Lyrics
I will dig a hole
Save my pennies for a rainy day
I will dig a hole
Saving pennies for a rainy day
I'm not scared

I will build a wall
Sensing trouble from a mile away
I will build a wall
Saw it coming from a mile away
I'm not scared
I'm not scared

Try
When your inside's out
I don't even try
I know I have seen the best I'll have
I don't even try

I will just play dumb
I won't hear a single word that's said
And I will bite my tongue
Never sing another song again
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
Try
When my inside's out
I don't even try
I know I have seen the best I'll have
I don't even try
Never been one to take my chances
I don't even try

Clouds are coming, air gets heavy
Looks like trouble on a rainy day
Sun starts sinking, can't see my shadow
Looks like trouble on a rainy day
Holes uncovered, walls will crumble
All spells trouble on a rainy dayEmbed
