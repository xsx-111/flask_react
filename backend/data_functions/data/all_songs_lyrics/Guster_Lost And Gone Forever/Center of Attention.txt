Center of Attention Lyrics
One of us
Won't last the night
Between you and me, it's no surprise
There's two of us
Both can't be right
Neither will move 'til it's over

I'm the center of attention
In the walls inside my head
And no one will ever know it
If I keep my mouth shut tight

My own little world
Is what I deserve
'Cause I am the only child there is
A king of it all
The belle of the ball
I promise I've always been like this
Forever the first
My bubble can't burst
It's almost like only I exist
Where everything's fine
If I can keep my mouth shut tight, tight, tight
All by myself
I'm so much better on my own
And way out there
Oh oh oh
It is the same old place that it always has been

I'm the center of attention
In the walls inside my head
And no one will ever know it
If I keep my mouth shut tight

My own little world
Is what I deserve
'Cause I am the only child there is
A king of it all
The belle of the ball
I promise I've always been like this
Forever the first
My bubble can't burst
It's almost like only I exist
Where everything's fine
If I can keep my mouth shut tight, tight, tight
One of us
Won't last the night
Between you and me, it's no surprise
There's two of us
Both can't be right
Neither will move 'til it's over

I'm the center of attention
In the walls inside my head
And no one will ever know it
If I keep my mouth shut tight
Yeah no one will ever notice
If I keep my mouth shut tight, tight, tight

My own little world
Is what I deserve
'Cause I am the only child there is
A king of it all
The belle of the ball
I promise I've always been like this
Forever the first
My bubble can't burst
It's almost like only I exist
Where everything's fine
If I can keep my mouth shut tight, tight, tightEmbed
