So Long Lyrics
Yes I heard all that you had to say
That's when it all fell apart
Might be hated, but I can't pretend
I liked you better before

So long, so long, front foot leads that back one
Go on, and it won't be too soon
I'm gone, I'm gone and on to the next one
So long, and I won't be back soon

Yes I'm blue but from holding my breath
Like I have from the start
I'm the villain and I should confess
I liked you better before

So long, so long and on to the next one
Go on , and it won't be too soon
I'm gone, I'm gone, bet you saw this one coming
So long, and I won't be back soon

It's hateful to say I see it this way
Don't even know who you are
But in my defense, I'd do it again
I don't need to know who you are
So long, so long, and on to the next one
Go on and it won't be too soon
You're gone, you're gone, are you waiting for something?
Go on, cause I won't be back soon

It's hateful to say I see it this way
Don't even know who you are
But in my defense, I'd do it again
I don't need to know who you are

So long, so long, front foot leads the back one
Go on 'cause it won't be too soon
You're lost and gone and on to the next one
I don't need to know who you are

Don't need to know who you areEmbed
