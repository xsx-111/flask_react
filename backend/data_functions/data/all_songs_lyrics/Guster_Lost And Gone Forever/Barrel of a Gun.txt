Barrel of a Gun Lyrics
I know a movie star, I've got her plastered to my wall
Just like we're dear old friends, like she already knows me
She's perfect as she seems, lifts me right out the mezzanine
I finally fell in love, I've been waiting forever

4, 3, 2, 1
Went out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down
Stay out or stay in
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound

Lie back and fast asleep, if you could see what I could see
Drip drop a lovely dream
God damn you movie star, can't you just play a minute more
We'd be the best of friends, you could stay here forever

4, 3, 2, 1
Went out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down
Stay out or stay in
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound
She will be sweet on me, just like a mystery
It's not so hard to see, if I'm not mistaken
She comes from far away (far away)
And gets closer every day (every day)
And all that i can say (I can say)
She's all I want and all that I live for

4, 3, 2, 1
Went out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down
Stay out or stay in
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and soundEmbed
