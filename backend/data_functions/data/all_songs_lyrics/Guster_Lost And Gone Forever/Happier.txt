Happier Lyrics
Say goodbye, lose your friends
Make them go, don't need them around
'Cause it's time, lose your friends
Make them go, was never supposed to be like this
They were too weak
Too prone to break
Their needs too deep
Their skin too thin
By now you took what was to take
Tear it apart and start again

So go on
If this will make you happier
It got you this far
Do what you have to

You've wasted every moment
Of your Saturdays and your Sundays
You're wasted from the boredom
It was never supposed to be like this
Like your father said
"Just do what was done onto you, always"
In your father's steps
You'll do what was done onto you
It won't be hard to start again
So go on
If this will make you happier
It got you this far
Do what you have to

And you're gone now
(But you've known this would come and you've left me alone)
And did it make you happier?
(And you're lost and you're gone, don't take it so seriously)
It wasn't that hard
(Go on, get going, I'm fine on my own)
Did what you had to
(It got me this far, finally got it figured out)

One more inch
You son of a bitch
Been a waste of my time, always
And now you're half awake
You bend 'til you break
And make the same mistakes, always

So go on
If this'll make you happier
It got you this far
Do what you have to
But you've known this would come and you've left me alone
(And you're gone now)
And you're lost and you're gone, don't take it so seriously
(And did it make you happier?)
Go on, get going, I'm fine on my own
(It wasn't that hard)
It got me this far, finally got it figured out
(Did what you had to)Embed
