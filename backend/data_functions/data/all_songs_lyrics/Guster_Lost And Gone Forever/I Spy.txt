I Spy Lyrics
We went down to the May parade
Mumbled words under my breath
There is something I've been meaning to do
I am dying to tell you
I've been so damn tired

It went down at the May parade
Bitter words under my breath
There is something I've been dying to do
I was meaning to tell you
I've been so damn sad
Cause I spy something red

You don't know how far you've gone
Or recognize who you've become
How'd you grow to be so hard?
Sick of playing my part

We went down at the May parade
Alcohol under my breath
There is something I've been meaning to do
I am dying to tell you
I've been so damn sad
Cause I spy something red
You don't know how far you've gone
Or recognize who you've become
When'd you grow to be so hard?
Sick of playing my partEmbed
