Two Points for Honesty Lyrics
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all

I want to be where I've never been before
I want to be there and then I'd understand
Know I'm right and do it right, could I get to be like that
How to know what I don't know, nothing more to gain

Will I get better or stay the same
I find I always move too slowly
Can't lift a finger, can't change my mind
I never knew 'til someone told me that

If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all

And all the people who've seen it all before
And all the people who already understand
Know they're right, and have done it right, could I get to be like that
How to know what I don't know, it's harder everyday
Can't lift a finger, can't hurt a fly
I've found I always move too slowly
One thing's for certain, I'm insecure
I never knew 'til someone told me that

If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed of thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
Nobody cares at all
They never cared at allEmbed
