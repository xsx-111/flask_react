All the Way Up to Heaven Lyrics
He said to only look up
He said to never look down
Down is where we came from
He said to hope for the best
And take a load off my chest
Soon I could be happy

And go all the way
Up to heaven
And go all the way
Back home

He thought I might need his help
No one gets high on themselves
I just seem so lonely
He is just trying to be nice
And spread around his advice
I could be that happy

And go all the way
Up to heaven
And go all the way
Back home
Stay the way I am today is certainement disaster
He can tell a fairy tale
It's happily ever after
Just relax and greener grass
Will grow here for a change
Maybe then we'll last a million years
Or more or more or more or more
(More, more, more, more)

And go all the way
Up to heaven
And go all the way
Back home

Yes, I do believe what he says
I want to be happy
I could sure use his help
No one gets by on themselves
He can make me happy

And I will only look up
(It's a warm summer breeze)
And I will never look down
(It's a weakness in your knees)
It's a perfect place above full of everlasting love
(Down is where we came from)
And I will hope for the best
(Nothing to fear, nothing to hide)
And take a load off my chest
(You just say what's on your mind)
Needn't think before you speak, this is how it's meant to be
(He could make me happy)
And I needed his help
(Ever high, never fall)
Now I am high by myself
(You can do no wrong at all)
In this heaven up above filled with everlasting love
(I am never lonely)
And I will try to be nice
(To the light)
Because you only live twice
You could be this happy
To the light
(Yes, do you believe what he says?
 could  happy)Embed
