Life Goes On Lyrics
Life goes on and on and on
If you think it's all gone wrong
Go on and on and on

Life's a con a con a con
If you think you can't go on
Go on and on and on

But always remember
This is the happiest day of your life

Life goes on and on and on
If you think it's all gone wrong
Go on and on and on

Life's a con a con a con
If you think you can't go on
Go on and on and on

But always remember
This is the happiest day of your life
And as the years they move along
I see it now, there's something wrong
'Cos life is for always
Take your time
Who cares what fools say
I don't mind
'Cos this is my day
I'll live it my way
Today, there's just today

Life goes on and on and on
If you think it's all gone wrong
Go on and on and on

Life's a con a con a con
If you think you can't go on
Go on and on and on

But always remember
This is the happiest day of your life
