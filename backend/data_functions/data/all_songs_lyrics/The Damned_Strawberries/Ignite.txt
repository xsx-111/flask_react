Ignite LyricsTwilight comes and the mood's complete
Gonna hit the street grab some of that night time beat
My heart is beat beat beating like a drum
The night is in my veins we're gonna have some fun tonight
Light the fuse I must ignite
I'm gonna set the world alight
Light the fuse I must ignite
I'm gonna set the world alight
I wanna see you burn
I killed the cigarette I killed the light
I'm killing time the heat kills me on a hot summer night
I'm gonna dream a life live a dream
Hell for leather in my scheme of things tonight
Light the fuse I must ignite
I'm gonna set the world alight
Light the fuse I must ignite
I'm gonna set the world alightEmbed
