Generals LyricsBig city all scratched out revenge is not so sweet
Once proud once so devout they're tired and they are weak
They came from east to west counting up the cost
Red star soon to arrive they know that all is lost
And only the wounded remain
The generals have all left the game
With no will to fight
They'll fade with the light
There's nobody left they can blame
What once was decadence now's nothing but razed land
The end so imminent big city's not so grand
They came they saw they conquered people hid in fear
They looted raped and plundered angry Russian bear
And only the wounded remain
The generals have all left the game
With no will to fight
They'll fade with the light
There's nobody left they can blame
Reichstag flies red flag signaling the end
Party now bad bad suicide the end
There's some who think that golden years might lie ahead
No leaders anymore in the bunker dead
And only the wounded remain
The generals have all left the game
With no will to fight
They'll fade with the light
There's nobody left they can blame
And only the wounded remain
The generals have all left the game
With no will to fight
They'll fade with the light
The whole world is going insaneEmbed
