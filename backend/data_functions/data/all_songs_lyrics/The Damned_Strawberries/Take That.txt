Take That LyricsB-side of Dozen Girls 7"
Also appears on 'Damned But Not Forgotten' CD
(Vanian/Scabies/Sensible/Gray)
Well I'm just a poor guy
Been thrown out on the street
My hair's a mess and my clothes
Well they sure ain't neat
Yeah listen to my warning
Yeah listen to me now
Those short changed mean people
You're feeble and fat
I'm rugged and handsome
So big nose take that
Take that
I'm standing at the bus stop
In the bleeding rain
Waiting for the 68
It's sodding late again, huh
Don't think I'm gonna get there
Gonna make it on my own
Some things just happen
I'm gonna take your throne
Yeah listen to my warning
Yeah listen to me now
Chorus
I'm gonna take your throne
I'm gonna take your throne
I'm gonna take your throne
I'm gonna take your throne
La la la la la la la la ohh
La la la la la la la la ohhEmbed
