Torture Me LyricsTorture me
I'm just an animal you see
I'm the slap for your lap
Not upset
You know pets don't really feel
Torture me
Why don't you carve my body up
Throw me into a pot
Make it hot
And you'll have a lovely meal
Torture me
'Cause you're the beauty i'm the beast
For your feast
Weddings, bar mitzvahs and all
Torture me
Take my skin and eat my flesh
'Cause it's fresh
Boil or roast'll be a ball
And if I can suffer more
And if I can suffer more
I'll improve your life for sure
And if I can suffer more
And if I can suffer more
And if I whimper just ignore meEmbed
