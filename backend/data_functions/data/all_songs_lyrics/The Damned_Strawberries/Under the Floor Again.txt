Under the Floor Again LyricsUnder the floor again
Once I was up and in the air but now I'm down
Goodbye to all my friends
Forget I ever was the mole goes underground
Under the floor again
Eight years of hide and seek no peek of me is seen
I skip the law again
The to and fro the come and go and miss the scene
But who was the girl we saw last night
Wearing a frock and gown she's kinda paralysed
A door in the floor a head materialised
I'm sure that I saw a face I recognised
Don't say a word
Just stay here at my leisure
No sound is heard
Can't take my simple pleasures
Like walking in the park
And taking in the air
Just lock me in the dark
It's no fun
Under the floor again
My baccy bets and beer are here and all I need
I'm feeling sore again
Three feet of life is all I have and rats to feed
Won't say a word
Just stay here at my leisure
No sound is heard
Can't take my simple pleasures
Like breathing in the air
It's cleaner than the stuff
I've had in recent months
It's no fun
Under the floor again
Once I was up and in the air but now I'm downEmbed
