Bad Time for Bonzo LyricsBad time
You know I saw him in a movie with his leather on
Bad time
The fists were flying and the guns did roar
Bad time
You know I kinda liked the way he sung his cowboy songs
Bad time
But I can't listen to them anymore
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always dreaming
He'd like you to be dreaming too
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always scheming
He'd like you to be scheming too
He'd like you to be scheming too
Bad time
You know there was a time when no-one knew the fun he'd start
Bad time
As actors go he was an 'also ran'
Bad time
But now old Bonzo's gone and got himself
Another part
Bad time
We'd best re-write the script while we can
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always dreaming
He'd like you to be dreaming too
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always screaming
He'd like you to be screaming too
He'd like you to be screaming too
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no nooh
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always dreaming
He'd like you to be dreaming too
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for bonzo too
You know that bonzo's always scheming
He'd like you to be scheming too
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always dreaming
He'd like you to be dreaming too
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always screaming
He'd like you to be screaming too
Bad time for me
Bad time for you
Bad time for Bonzo too
You know that Bonzo's always dreaming
He'd like you to be dreaming too
Bad time for me
Bonzo is dreaming
Bad time for me
Bonzo is schemingEmbed
