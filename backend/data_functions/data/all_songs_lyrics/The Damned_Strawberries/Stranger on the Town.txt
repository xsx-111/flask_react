Stranger on the Town LyricsDid you ever see a man turned inside out
He can come and go without a sound
They say ok when they turn you down
'Cos someones always smiling when they really frown
You turf me out can't keep me down
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
Don't put me down
And I only want a place to rest my head
But if looks could kill I might as well be dead
Get me on my feet take me to the door
I'll face the law might even get a bed
You turf me out can't keep me down
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
Don't put me down
You turf me out can't keep me down
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
Don't put me down
Don't need me
Won't feed me now
Just say the word
Just smile as I'm thrown out
You turf me out can't keep me down
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
Don't put me down
And the city's new so the faces change
I know they're different yet they act the same
I've read the script and I know the score
I know it's only time before I'm shown the door
You turf me out can't keep me down
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
Don't put me down
You turf me out can't keep me down
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
Don't put me down
I've got some money
So do you love me now?
Now will you run me out
And they wonder why I shout
Even in a crowd when you're all alone
It's so far from home there's faces all around
They stare mean and proud you've gotta get away
You gotta get away
So I'm a stranger
And though you put me down you know I
Ain't no clown and you're a stranger
'Cause I'll see you around
When the chips are down
And I'm a stranger on the town....
Ooh ooh the city's new the faces change
I know they're different yet they act the same
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
And I only wanna place to rest my head
If looks could kill I might as well be dead
'Cos Im a stranger on the town
Yes I am
And everyone tries to put you down
Nobody wants to have you around
'Cos I'm a stranger on the town
Yes I am1Embed
