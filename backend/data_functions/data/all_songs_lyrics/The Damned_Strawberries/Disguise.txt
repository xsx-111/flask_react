Disguise LyricsB-side of Lovely Money 7"
Also appears on 'Damned But Not Forgotten' CD
(Vanian/Scabies/Sensible/Gray/Jugg)
Who is the person that everyone knows?
She seems to live her life so naturally
An angel in the guise of something else
What lies behind those eyes in mystery?
A wealth of secrets
A light in a dream
I'd like to know what they mean
A haunted voice from a ghost like face
I hope and pray that it won't end
The light is fading you're not the one in your eyes
The others follow in your disguise
Chorus
Who is the person that everyone knows?
She seems to live her life so naturally
An angel in the guise of something else
What lies behind those eyes in mystery?
A wealth of secrets
A light in a dream
I think I know what they meanEmbed
