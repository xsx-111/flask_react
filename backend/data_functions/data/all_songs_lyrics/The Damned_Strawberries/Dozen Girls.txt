Dozen Girls LyricsWon't you tell me the reason why
He goes out almost every night?
He never goes too far he's always
The one who's got it right
He's got charm
He's got style
He's got a dozen girls
Tell me why
I don't know why
He's got a dozen girls
Now he's always the one with all the hooks
When it comes to making it with you
Now I would be there in his place if only
I knew what it is I had to do
He's got charm
He's got style
He's got a dozen girls
Tell me why
I don't know why
He's got a dozen girls
He's got charm
He's got style
He's got a dozen girls
Tell me why
I don't know why
He's got a dozen girls
He's alright and he don't care
He's got thermal underwearEmbed
