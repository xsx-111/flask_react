The Dog LyricsShe wanders alone through the night
A child with eyes burning bright
She extends her arms for an embrace, a tiny smile
Her ruby lips on her doll-like face
The danger's a mystery here
As she invites you to hold her near
Her mirrored image could not be linked to
A woman's mind so sharp and so distinct
Like a swimmer in a secret sea
Undecayed for all eternity
Claudia
Better stay away from Claudia
The silkiness of her lips
As she bends low to kiss
A tiny seductress in ringlets and pearls you reel
In madness as the whole world about you whirls
Like the tinkle of a small silver bell
Her voice will put you under her spell
A crushed crysanthemum in her hand a beautiful doll of death
She'll take your dying breath
Like a swimmer in a secret sea
Undecayed for all eternity
Claudia
Better stay away from Claudia
Like a swimmer in a secret sea
Undecayed for all eternity
Claudia
Better stay away from ClaudiaEmbed
