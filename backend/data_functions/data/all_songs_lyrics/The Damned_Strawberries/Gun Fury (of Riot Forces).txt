Gun Fury (of Riot Forces) LyricsI do expect you might have heard
Through state research an old jailbird
About the guys
The gun fury of riot forces
A warning sounds they're dressed to kill
They're out of bounds we've had our fill
Who dares resist
The gun fury of riot forces
They're glad to be your friend
They hate the public they defend
They call the shots from start to end
Shots from start to end
A handbag man he makes a snatch
In riot cops he's met his match
He lies dead before
The gun fury of riot forces
A warning sounds they're dressed to kill
They're out of bounds we've had our fill
Who dares resist
The gun fury of riot forces
They're glad to be your friend
They hate the public they defend
They call the shots from start to endEmbed
