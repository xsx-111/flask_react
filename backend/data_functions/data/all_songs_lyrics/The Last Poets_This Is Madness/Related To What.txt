Related to what, the enemy of man
Related to what man, the enemy of man
Related to what humans try to steal my spiritual being
Raping my mind with a  penis
Selling my love on the market for half price 
Related to what
Related to what an ICBM, IBM
Another defied billion dollar ABM system
A attack B black and men system
Attack black men system
System attacks black men
Our black women are allowed to walk around with mini skirts on
Their mind, drinking birth control pills for free
Sweetened Kool-Aid and digging on Tom Jones because it's not unusual

Related to what, Aunt Jemima serving Richard Nixon honey-coated black egos for breakfast every morning
The New York  is drying like an eco-piss
But understand that you are the sons and daughters of lovers
Lovers who were loving before time
Time , always on time in time to make love
We are the lovers of time
Time is what we need, the time ain't for real
Related to what
Related to what, no more tears please
No more tears, hate has torn tears from my eyes and 
And I have no tears that have been torn for others to cry tears
And love that was lost is ancient and forgotten
City of my soul
Daddy, what is watu wazuri?
Son, it's beautiful people use Afro-Sheen
Daddy, what is freedom?

Related to what, an armageddon jumped off on the corner of 125th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue as the junkies, rhinos, pimps, and prostitutes finally reclaim their rightful name as a vanguard party
Here we are standing in the shadows of love
Standing in the shadows of love
Waiting for the heartaches to come and Malcolm is going to pimp  Johnson in the hereafter
To be young, gifted, and black
To be young, gifted, and black, that's where it's at
Related to what
Related to what and the Father, the Son and Holy Ghost ain't dead
They're standing on the corners of 126th Street and 8th Avenue shooting dope into their arms trying to get to Heaven as fast as they can
And Diana Ross is a beautiful example of 
And I dream dreams of black people who dream dreams of other black people who dream of being free

Related to what and in the end when Uncle Sam found out that  that he had brought into the world, he began to pray
Yes, he began to pray, he prayed to the Virgin Mary
He prayed to the Pope, he prayed to Malcolm
He prayed to Emmett Till and Mack Parker
He went up and down and back and forth all over the land praying
He prayed to the chosen few
He even prayed to the few who weren't chosen
He prayed to the East, he prayed to the West
He prayed to the God he knew the best
Why, he even prayed to the funk under niggas' arms
Yes, he prayed to God for forgiveness
He prayed to God for forgiveness
He prayed, he prayed, he prayed
"I'm sorry, God, please forgive me! Amen!"
