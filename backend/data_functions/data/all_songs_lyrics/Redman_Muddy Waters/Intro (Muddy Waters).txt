Intro (Muddy Waters) Lyrics
Redman, wake up
Wake up, Redman, wake up
This is album three, can you hear me?
This is Dr. Trevis, can you hear me?
You must stay focused, you must focus your mind

Ba-ga-goom-ba-gi (repeated throughout the whole intro)
*a dark eerie music background comes in after 50 second of the intro with various jungle sounds*
*T-Rex stomps around and roars*Embed
