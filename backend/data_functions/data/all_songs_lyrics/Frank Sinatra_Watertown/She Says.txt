She Says LyricsShe says she's sleeping well
She says she's lost some weight
She says she's seen some shows
She says the city's strange
(So she says)
She says the weather's cold
She says there's been some rain
She says there's lots to see
She says she hopes we're fine
(So she says)
(So she says)
The price is high
High as the sky
And she says
She says
She's comin' homeEmbed
