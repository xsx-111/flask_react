What a Funny Girl (You Used to Be) LyricsYou always looked a little out of place
All grown up with freckles on your face
We'd spend each night with company
Just you the teddy bears the dolls and me
What a funny girl you used to be
You always had a thousand things to do
Getting all involved with something new
Always some new recipe
The kitchen always looked like world war three
What a funny girl you used to be
It was so good with you around
You always found a smile
Where smiles could not be found
I never ever met a person more sincere
You'd always listen
With an open ear
You'd fall for lines so easily
Whatever they were selling
You'd buy three
What a funny girl you used to be
What a funny girl you used to beEmbed
