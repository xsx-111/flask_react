Michael & Peter LyricsMichael is you, he has your face
He still has your eyes, remember
Peter is me, 'cept when he smiles
And if you look at them both for a while
You can see they are you, they are me
This spring we had some heavy rain
By summer it was dry again
The roses that we planted last fall
Climbed the wall
I think the house could use some paint
You know your mother's such a saint
She takes the boys whenever she can
She sure needs a man
All those years I've worked for Santa Fe
Never ever missed a single day
Just one more without a raise in pay
And I'm leaving
And the air still has a country smell
And everyone is looking well
As far as anyone can tell
The sun will rise tomorrow
You'll never believe how much they're growing
John Henry came to cut the lawn
Again he asked me where you'd gone
Can't tell you all the times he's been told
But he's so old
Guess that's all the news I've got today
Least that's all the news that I can say
Maybe soon the words will come my way, tomorrow
And the air still has a country smell
And everyone is looking well
Far as anyone can tell
The sun will rise tomorrow
You'll never believe how much they're growing
You'll never believe how much they're growing...Embed
