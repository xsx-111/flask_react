I Would Be in Love (Anyway) LyricsIf I lived the past over
Saw today from yesterday
I would be in love anyway
If I knew that you'd leave me
If I knew you wouldn't stay
I would be in love anyway
Sometimes I think think about before
Sometimes I think
If I knew then what I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change
Somehow
Though you'll never be with me
And there are no words to say
I'll still be in love anyway
If I knew then
What I know now
I don't believe I'd ever change
Somehow...Embed
