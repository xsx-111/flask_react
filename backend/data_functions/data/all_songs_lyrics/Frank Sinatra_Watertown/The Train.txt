The Train LyricsAnd now the sun has broken through
It looks like it will stay
Just can't have you comin' home
On such a rainy day
The train is leaving Ellensville
Unless my watch is fast
The kids are comin' home from school
Must be quarter past
So many changes since you've been away
And there'reâ€‹ so many things to say
This time around you'll want to stay
Cause I've had so many nights to find the way
Even bought that summer cottage yesterday
Pretty soon I'll be close to you
And it will be so good
We'll talk about the part of you
I never understood
And I will take good care of you
And never let you cry
We will look so much in love
To people passing by
So many changes since you've been away
And there're so many things to say
I wrote so many times and more
But the letters still are lying in my drawer
Cause the morning mail had left some time before
All the passengers for Allentown wait closer to the track
It's hard for me to realize you're really coming back
The crossing gate is coming down I think I see the train
The sun has gone and now my face is wet with heavy rain
The passengers for Allentown are gone
The train is slowly moving on
But I can't see you any place
And I know for sure I'd recognize your face
And I know for sure I'd recognize your faceEmbed
