For A While LyricsLost in day to day
Turn another way
With a laugh
A kind hello
Some small talk
With those I know
I forget
That I'm not over you
For a while
A wave an easy grin
A smile to put them in
With other lives
To listen to
And some work
I've got to do
I forget
That I'm not over you
For a while
Days go by
With no empty feeling
Until I
Remember you're gone
People say to me
You need company
When you have
Some time to spend
Drop around
And meet a friend
They forget
That I'm not over you
For a while
They forget
That I'm not over you
For a while...Embed
