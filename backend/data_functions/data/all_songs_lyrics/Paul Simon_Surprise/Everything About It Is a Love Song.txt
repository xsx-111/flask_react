Everything About It Is a Love Song LyricsLocked in a struggle for the right combination
Of words in a melody line
I took a walk along the riverbank of my imagination
Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine
But if I ever get back to the twentieth century
I guess I'll have to pay off some debts
Open the book of my vanishing memory
With its catalogue of regrets
Stand up for the deeds I did
And those I didn't do
Sit down, shut up, think about God
And wait for the hour of my rescue
We don't mean to mess things up
But mess them up we do
And then it's "Oh, I'm sorry"
Here's a smiling photograph
Of love when it was new
At a birthday party
Make a wish and close your eyes
Surprise, surprise, surprise
Early December and brown as a sparrow
Frost creeping over the pond
I shoot a thought into the future and it flies like an arrow
Through my lifetime and beyond
If I ever come back as a tree, or a crow
Or even the wind-blown dust
Find me on the ancient road
In the song when the wires are hushed
Hurry on and remember me
As I'll remember you
Far above the golden clouds, the darkness vibrates
The earth is blue
And everything about it is a love song
Everything about it
Everything about it is a love song
Everything about itEmbed
