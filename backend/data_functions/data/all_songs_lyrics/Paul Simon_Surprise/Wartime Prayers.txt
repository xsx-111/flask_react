Wartime Prayers Lyrics
Prayers offered in times of peace are silent conversations
Appeals for love or loves release, in private invocations
But all that is changed now
Gone like a memory from the day before the fires
People hungry for the voice of God
Hear lunatics and liars
Wartime prayers, wartime prayers
In every language spoken
For every family scattered and broken

Because you cannot walk with the holy
If you're just a halfway decent man
But I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind
With a genius marketing plan

I'm trying to tap into some wisdom
Even a little drop would do
I want to rid my heart of envy
And cleanse my soul of rage
Before I'm through

Times are hard, hard times
But everybody knows all about hard times
The thing is, what are you going to do?
Will you cry?
And try to muscle through?
And try to rearrange your stuff?
But when the wounds are deep enough
And it's all that we can bear
We wrap ourselves in prayer


A mother murmurs in twilight sleep
And draws her babies closer
With hush-a-bies for sleepy eyes
And kisses on the shoulder
To drive away despair
She sends a wartime prayerEmbed
