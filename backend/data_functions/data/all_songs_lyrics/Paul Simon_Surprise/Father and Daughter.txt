Father and Daughter Lyrics
If you leap awake in the mirror of a bad dream
And for a fraction of a second you can't remember where you are
Just open your window and follow your memory upstream
To the meadow in the mountain where we counted every falling star
I believe a light that shines on you will shine on you forever (forever)
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary hiding under your bed
I'm gonna stand guard like a postcard of a Golden Retriever
And never leave 'til I leave you with a sweet dream in your head

I'm going to watch you shine
Going to watch you grow
Going to paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father
Who loved his daughter more than I love you

Trust your intuition
It's just like going fishing
You cast your line and hope you get a bite
But you don't need to waste your time
Worrying about the market place
Try to help the human race
Struggling to survive its harshest night
I'm going to watch you shine
Going to watch you grow
Going to paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two (oooh oooh)
There could never be a father
Who loved his daughter more than I love you
I'm going to watch you shine
Going to watch you grow
Going to paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two (oooh oooh)
There could never be a father
Who loved his daughter more than I love youEmbed
