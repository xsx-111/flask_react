Beautiful Lyrics
Snowman sitting in the sun
Doesn't have time to waste
He had a little bit too much fun
Now his head's erased
Back in the house
Family of three
Two doing the laundry
And one in the nursery
We brought brand new baby
Back from Bangladesh
Thought we'd name her Emily

She's beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

Yes sir, head's erased
Brain's a bowl of jelly
Hasn't hurt his sense of taste
Judging from his belly
But back in the house
Family of four now
Two doing the laundry
And two on the kitchen floor
We brought a brand new baby back
From mainland China
Sailed across the China Sea

Go-kart sitting in the shade
You don't need a ticket to ride
It's summertime, summertime
Slip down a water slide
Little kid dancing in the grass
Legs like rubber band
It's summertime, summertime
There's a line at the candy stand
Keep and eye on them children
Eye on them children in the pool
You'd better
Keep and eye on them children
Eye on them children in the pool
We brought a brand new baby
Back from Kosovo
That was nearly seven years ago
He cried all night
Could not sleep
His eyes were bright
Dark and deep
