Little Drum Lyrics
I was mothered like an orchid tethered to eternal sights
I hurried home in orbit close to where I know I’m fine
No edge of the seat, no arms ever broken, you see

I waited for the crash to come
Too many days with too little to do
I waited but nothing came at all
So many days spent in empty rooms

The little drum inside behaves itself until you turn 25
And then it strikes this all we've lived this long and only ever half alive

I waited for the crash to come
Too many days with too little to do
I waited but nothing came at all
So many days spent in empty rooms
It’s too late for a wasted youth
All quiet on the eastern front and
We dare not move
It’s too late to wage a war
It’s all quiet on the eastern front and
We all are boredEmbed
