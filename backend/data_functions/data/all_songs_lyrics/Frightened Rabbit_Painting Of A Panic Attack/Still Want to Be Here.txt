Still Want to Be Here Lyrics
The perfect place may never exist, may never exist
The perfect time might be years and years away
The city is overweight, and it's pressing on the pair of us
We scowl and sweat beneath the overbearing crush

But I still want to be here, want to be here
I still want to be here, want to be here
And I would live in a devil's ditch just to be near you
I still want to be here, want to be here

There is shit all over the street outside our house now
Junk fiends dance at the bus stop next to the rodeo clowns
Nowhere to run to, so we hide like mislaid infants
Fuck these faceless homes and everyone who lives in them

But I still want to be here, want to be here
I still want to be here, want to be here
And I would live in a shallow pit just to be near you
I still want to be here

I still want to be here, want to be here
I still want to be here, want to be here
And I would live in a shallow pit just to be near you
I still want to be hereEmbed
