The Wreck LyricsCome out from under our covers
Put on your clothes
We're both sinking tonight
Forever it goes
After somebody hammers
Emergency glass
Sing in key with the sirens
You're so bad
As the saltwater gushes
Into our ship's holes
Don't you dare jump without me
I'm not good on my own
Oh, you're not leaving this wreck
We're both going down with it
There is peace beyond trouble
I'm desperate to meet you
Below the blue surface
In a quiet reprieve
We're too poor to be precious
So cut off your nose
And come dying with me darling
The bed of the ocean's
Great tank of disaster
It wrecks who it pleases
The swell pulls me under
Come under with me
Oh, you're not leaving this wreck
We're both going down with it
Oh, you're not leaving this wreck
We're both going down with it
Oh, you're not leaving this wreck
I've got pills in my pocketEmbed
