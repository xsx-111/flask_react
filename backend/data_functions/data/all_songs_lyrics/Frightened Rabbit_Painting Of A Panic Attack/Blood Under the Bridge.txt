Blood Under the Bridge Lyrics
Clean out your mouth, this is not what it's for
There's still a bloodstain from the spill of the war
Pick up your sorrow, this is not who we are
I won't cry "uncle", having come so far

It's alright, it's alright
It’s just blood under the bridge
And I'm too tired to fight
The affliction that we fixed
Ah, that's alright, it's alright
It's just blood under the bridge
Put down the knife
And watch the blood under the bridge go by

So tie your ragged fuck-ups in a neat little knot
And put it on the shelf behind the picture we bought
I found the way to make the best of a flaw
And realize it's not the end, it's an uncomfortable pause

It's alright, it's alright
It's just blood under the bridge
There is a fragment of light
But it’s hiding in the distance
It's alright, it's alright
It's just blood under the bridge
Put down the knife
And watch the blood under the bridge go by
And it's alright, it's alright
It's just blood under the bridge
And I'm too tired to fight
And you’re sick of feeling sick
And so am I, it's alright
It's just blood under the bridge
Ah that’s alright, it's alright
It's just blood under the bridgeEmbed
