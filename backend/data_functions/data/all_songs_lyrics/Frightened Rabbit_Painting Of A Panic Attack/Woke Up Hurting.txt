Woke Up Hurting Lyrics
Daybreak comes with the devil’s hum
A carcass starts to breathe
Wakes one more time to try and find
A place to count its teeth
And scrub the cuts from yesterday’s
Hot scuffle in the street
Show me the door
I need somewhere to go

Daylight
Woke up hurting
With tarmac to my side
I woke up with dirty knees
Not for the first time
I woke up hurting
Though I can’t quite say why
I woke up hurting
Woke up hurting

Slug through the day, sneak between
The houses I have made
And run sacred rivers up my sleeve
Pills by mouth with lemonade
As the hours slow down, they all clock out
Of the cracked up daily grind
I’m in a back back street, coming down
I wait for the beam of light
Show me the door
I need somewhere to go
Midnight
Woke up hurting
With tarmac to my side
I woke up with dirty knees
Not for the first time
I woke up hurting
Though I can’t quite say why
I woke up hurting
Woke up hurting

If all these southern tales are true
We should pray for abduction, pray it comes soon
If all these southern tales are true
Plan for Heaven, or Hell will do
If all these southern tales are true
We should pray for abduction, pray it comes soon
If all these southern tales are true
Plan for Heaven, or Hell will doEmbed
