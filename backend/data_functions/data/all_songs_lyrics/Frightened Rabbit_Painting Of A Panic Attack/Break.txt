Break Lyrics
Took my bag underneath the overpass
Forgot to bend and now I've broken all we have
Nothing's worse than realizing who you've hurt
I didn't bend and now we eat the consequence

Over the edge, I can't stop myself
Off the ledge throwing punches
Over the edge, I can't steer myself
All over again, I don't want this

If I bend then I might not break
I should think about giving in
If I bend then it might be okay
If we're thinking 'bout how it ends
If I bend then I might not break
I should think about giving in
If I bend then it might be okay

Put down the bag in the calm before the aftermath
Can we pick up all the debris of our bitter past?
Nothing's worse than realizing who you've hurt
I didn't bend and now we eat the consequence
Over the edge, I can't stop myself
Off the ledge throwing punches
Over the edge, I can't steer myself
All over again, I don't want this

If I bend then I might not break
I should think about giving in
If I bend then it might be okay
If we're thinking 'bout how it ends
If I bend then I might not break
I should think about giving in
If I bend then it might be okay
If weâ€™re thinking 'bout how it ends1Embed
