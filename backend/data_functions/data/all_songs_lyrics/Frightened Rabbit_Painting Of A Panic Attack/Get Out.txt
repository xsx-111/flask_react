Get Out Lyrics
I'm in the arch of the church
Between her thumb and her forefinger
I'm a worshipper
A zealot king, cursed, a devotee
Of the heady golden dance she does
She's an uncut drug
Find the vein and the pulse
Chased it and for a minute I was floating dead above myself

Get out of my heart, she won't, she won't
Get out of my heart, she won't, she won't
I saw a glimmer in the dark and now I know
She won't get out of my heart, she won't

I'm in your purse
Pull me out and throw me down
Stick me to your lip and draw a scarlet 'O'
There's a name on my chest in red
The embossing of a branded bull
And I don't want you to

Get out of my heart, she won't, she won't
Get out of my heart, she won't, she won't
I saw a glimmer in the dark and now I know
She won't get out of my heart, she won't
Get out of my heart, she won't, she won't
Get out of my heart, she won't, she won't
And there's a heavenly scar that let's me know
She won't get out of my heart, she won't1Embed
