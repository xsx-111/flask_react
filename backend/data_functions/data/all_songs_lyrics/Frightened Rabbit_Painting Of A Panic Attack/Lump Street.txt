Lump Street Lyrics
In a commissioned town, on Lump Street
The brick-hard boy repeats a scripted lie
Eyes to the ground on Lump Street
There's a broken jaw behind the dog-tooth smile

The grunt and moan behind the night here
And though breath is warm, sex is cold
Nothing is grown on Lump Street
Each piece is fired inside a broken mould

Do you want more unshapely love?
What you waiting for? Cut out that lump

She tore his tongue out at the end of Lump Street
She liked to see the blood beneath his skin
He wore her muscles, kissed all of the bruising
Away, away

Do you want more unshapely love?
What you waiting for? Cut out that lump
He's a full-grown man, no shoulder to cry on
Raised by wolves and they taught him to bite down hard, ah ah ah
No locks on the doors, no corner to hide in
Scars like armour, dead boy's eyes, ah ah ah
She's a Lump Street girl, with a blade in her brow
Raised by the state but they tore it all down, ah ah ah
They fucked and they fought but it still felt right
Run away from these orange Lump Street lights, ah ah ah

Get together now, find hope
There is a life beyond the one you already know
Get together now, build a home
There is life beyond the one you already know1Embed
