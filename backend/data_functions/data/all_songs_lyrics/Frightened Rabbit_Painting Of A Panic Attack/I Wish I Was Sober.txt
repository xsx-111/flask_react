I Wish I Was Sober LyricsFall prey to the blizzard head
Wrapped my hand around the glass again
We all thought that I might change as I got older
Fell down and nothing bled
Wrapped in cotton alcohol again
"To the hilt!" I hear from the prick upon my shoulder
Free pour the fruitless thoughts
It's far too late to talk so much but
Still not giving up though
I wish that I was sober
Forgive me I can't speak straight
Forgive me I can't
Forgive me it's far too late
Choke down the gateway drug
Open the gates, in came the flood, it comes
Like a blush of love, it hits me without warning
Long nights of getting lost
I walk beneath a bridge I don't know
I need a black suit for tomorrow, I'm in mourning
My love, you should know
The best of me left hours ago, so
Shove a rag into my mouth and let me smolder
Fallout and the damage done
I can't un-sink the things I've sunk
Still not giving up, though I wish that I was sober
Forgive me I can't speak straight
Forgive me I can't
Forgive me it's far too late
Oh come and shake me till I'm dry
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh I wish that I was sober
Oh come to me and kill the night off
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wish that I was sober
Oh come and shake me till I'm dry
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh I wish that I was sober
Oh come to me and kill the night off
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wish that I was sober1Embed
