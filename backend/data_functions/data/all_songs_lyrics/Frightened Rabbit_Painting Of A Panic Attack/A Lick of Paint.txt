A Lick of Paint LyricsI know you’re listening
I know you’re there
I’ll cut the dick act
Pull up a chair
We get listless
And worn with age
I can see it now
There’s crack in the paint
There’s no shame in
Shutting down
But we could say more
And think aloud
It wasn’t you
It didn’t break
But we could use
A lick of paint
Remember Idaho
With nothing to do?
It can get like that
Sometimes it should
There’s medications
That we can take
But they kill our judgement
And strip the paint
There is time
So take some rest
Don't worry too much
It can be repaired
It could be me
Who's to blame?
I think I need
A lick of paintEmbed
