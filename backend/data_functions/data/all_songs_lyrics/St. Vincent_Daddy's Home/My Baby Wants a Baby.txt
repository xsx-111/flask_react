My Baby Wants a Baby Lyrics
My baby loves me like a saint
My baby hates when I'm away
My baby wants a baby
How can I go on?

What in the world (What in the world)
Would my baby say?
"I got your eyes and your mistakes"
You make a home (You make a home)
I run away
And the story starts again
Then I couldn't stay in bed all day
I couldn't leave like my daddy
And I wouldn't be your only baby anymore

My baby's closer than a shave
My baby's blue when I dye greys
My baby wants a baby
How can it be wrong, wrong?
But I wanna play guitar all day
Make all my meals in microwaves
Only dress up if I get paid
How can it be wrong, wrong?

What in the world, what in the world would my baby say?
"I got your eyes and your mistakes"
I wanna run, I wanna run, I wanna chase
The еnding I can't see
Then I won't have no legacy
'Causе I won't write no symphonies
Won't have no streets named after me
Won't even have your sympathy
No one will scream that song I made
Won't throw no roses on my grave
They'll just look at me and say
"Where's your baby?"2Embed
