The Laughing Man Lyrics
9-1-1 (9-1-1, what's your emergency?)
I'm in love (I see, so how can I help you?)
I can hear the angels weepin'
So why do I feel like sleepin'?
Little birds, little birds
Chirp, chirp, chirp
Singin' like the day is perfect
But to me, they sound psychotic

I know you're gone, you left the scene
Heaven had more important things
But I can't sleep
I know you know exactly what I mean

If life's a joke, then I'm dyin' laughin'

Brown liquor
Why? Not sure
Like the heroines of Cassavetes
I'm underneath the influence daily
Remember when (Remember when)
We were kids? (Just kids)
Best of friends (Best of friends)
All grass stains and chicken dinners
Menthol mouths and secret stitches
Half-pipes and PlayStations
Suicidal ideation
I know you're gone, you dropped the scene
Left all of your guitars to me
But I can't play
I know you know exactly what I'm sayin'

If life's a joke, then I'm dyin' laughin'Embed
