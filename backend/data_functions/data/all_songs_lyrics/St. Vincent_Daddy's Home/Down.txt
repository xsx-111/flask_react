Down Lyrics
You've hit me one time
Imagine my surprise
When you hit me two times
You got yourself a fight
I was a patsy
You were a creep from the cheap seats
Thinking that my little scratch was like your big victory
See?
But I'll take you down, uh-huh

Tell me who hurt you
No, wait, I don't care to
Hear an excuse why you think you can be cruel
(Cruel, cruel, cruel)
Mama always told me
(Ooh, my mama told me)
"You got to turn the other cheek"
(Ooh, my mama told me)
But even she would agree, you're an exception to that rule
(Rule, rule, rule)

I'll take you (I will)
Yeah, I'll take you (I will)
I'll take you (Come on, baby)
I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down)
I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Go get your own shit, get off of my tit
Go face your demons, check into treatment
Go flee the country, go blame your daddy
Just get far away from me

'Cause I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down)
'Cause I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(I'll take you down)

Go tell your friends
Go tell your friends you're down
Run to your friends
If you got any left, you're down
Oh-oh-oh, run to your friends
Yeah, go tell your friends you're down
Oh-oh-oh, run to your friends
Ooh, if you got any left, you're down5Embed
