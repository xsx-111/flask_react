The Melting of the Sun Lyrics
So sorry, missed the party
Hello, on the dark side of the moon
Jane lost it, crashed her Corvette
Ran into the tide in Malibu

And we all heard the gun
But I was slow to run

It's just the melting of the sun
(It's just the sun)
I wanna watch you watch it burn
(So watch it burn)

Saint Joni ain't no phony
Smoking Reds where Furry sang the blues
My Marilyn shot her heroin
"Hell," she said, "It's better than abuse"

So who am I tryna be?
A benzo beauty queen?
It's just the melting of the sun
(It's just the sun)
I wanna watch you watch it burn
(So watch it burn)
We always knew this day would come
(The day has come)
It's just the melting of the sun (Sun, sun, sun)

Brave Tori told her story
Police said they couldn't catch the man
And proud Nina got subpoenaed
Singing, "Mississippi, good goddamn"
But me, I never cried
To tell the truth, I lied

Girl, the world's spinning 'round
Spinning down and out of time
Girl, you can't give in now
When you're down, down and out
Girl, the world's spinning 'round
Spinning down and out of time
Girl, you can't give in now
When you're down, down and out5Embed
