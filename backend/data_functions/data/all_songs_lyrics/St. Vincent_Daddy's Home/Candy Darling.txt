Candy Darling Lyrics
Candy Darling
Who knows why the caged bird even sings?
For high-priced lowlives
Red bodega roses, you and me

I never wanna leave
Your perfume candy dream

So, queen of South Queens
We never did stop cheerin' for you, babe
And your wig, blonde, rolls home
Wavin' from the latest uptown train

I never wanna leave
Your perfume candy scene

So, Candy Darling
I brought bodega roses for your feet
And Candy, my sweet
I hope you will be comin' home to meEmbed
