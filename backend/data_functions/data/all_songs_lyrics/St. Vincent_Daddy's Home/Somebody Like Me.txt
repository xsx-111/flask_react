Somebody Like Me Lyrics
Paint yourself white
Clip on the wings
Climb high to the top of a building
Does it make you an angel
Or some kind of freak
To believe enough
In somebody like me?
Baby

Oh, I (Oh, I), guess we'll see
Who was the freak

Dress up in white
Slip on the ring
Walk straight down the aisle
To the violin strings
Does it make you a genius or
The fool of the week
To believe enough
In somebody like me?
Baby

Oh, I (Oh, I), guess we'll see (I guess we'll see)
Who was thе freak
Time (Oh, I), tells us things (I guеss we'll see)
That you and I can't see
