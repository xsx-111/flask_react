Down and Out Downtown Lyrics
Last night's heels
On the mornin' train
It's a long way back downtown
Ten missed calls
They don't know where you are
It's a long way back downtown

Hey, I was flyin' (Flyin', flyin', flyin')
Over the Empire State (Over, away)
Then you kissed me (Kissed me, kissed me)
And I crashed again

When'd it start?
This feeling so wrong
When you're down and out downtown

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bowery John
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Forgotten, but not gone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Prayin' at St. Ann's
Bodega roses in my hands
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Down and out downtown
And the joker with that funny laugh
Is diggin' through the basement of my past
It's a long way back down
Down and out downtown

Hey, I was flyin' (Flyin', flyin', flyin')
Over the Empire State (Over, away)
Then you kissed me (Kissed me, kissed me, kissed me)
And I crashed again
Ooh-ooh-ooh2Embed
