Pay Your Way in Pain Lyrics
(Ow)
Oh-oh-oh

You got to pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame (Yeah, ow)

I went to the store, I was feelin' kinda hungry
But I didn't have the money and the shelves were all empty
So I went to the bank to ch-ch-ch-check my checking
The man looked at my face, said, "We don't have a record"
Oh no, you thought we had forgotten?
The show is only gettin' started
The road is feelin' like a pothole
Sit down, stand up, head down, hands up, and

Pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame (Uh-huh)

Do you know what I want? (What do you want? What do you want?)
You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
Keep the rest, baby, ah, ah
I wanna be loved
Pay, pain
Pray, shame
So I went to the park just to watch the little children
The mothers saw my heels and they said I wasn't welcome
So I, I went back home, I was feelin' kinda queasy
But all the locks were changed, my baby wouldn't see me
Oh no, you've put your finger on it
The stove is only gettin' hotter
The sun, it's gotta, gotta melt it
Stand up, sit down, hands up, break down

(What do you want? What do you want?)
You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
I wanna be loved (What do you want? What do you want? Pay, pain)
I wanna be loved (What do you want? What you do want? Pray, shame)9Embed
