...At the Holiday Party Lyrics
At the holiday party
Red wine-lipped a little early
Reminiscin' got us laughin'
And that's when I saw your face crackin'

Smiles and smoke and screens
Your Gucci purse a pharmacy
Pretend to want these things
So no one sees you not gettin'

Not gettin' what you need, need
Need, need
You can't hide from me

Are you still workin' on your screenplay
Or did those lights go out on Broadway?
Think if you can just keep spinnin'
You won't miss what you've been missin'

Pills and JUULs and speed
Your little purse a pharmacy
And hide behind these things
So no one sees you not gettin'
Not gettin' what you need, need
Need, need
You can't hide, you can't hide from me

(You can't hide from me, you can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide from me)
(You can't hide from me)Embed
