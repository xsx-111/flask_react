Live in the Dream Lyrics
Hello
Do you know where you are?
You've been out cold
We almost called the cops
Don't get up
Can you count to ten?
Oh, boy, you're so lucky we found you when we did

'Cause there's a lot of people here who wanna do you harm
But stay with me, you fallen lamb
And I'll keep you in my arms

But I can't live in the dream
The dream lives in me

Welcome, child
You're free of the cage
Tryin' to seem sane makes you seem so strange
You look tired
Go on, rest your head
Oh, girl, you're so lucky we found you when we did
'Cause there's a lot of people here who wanna do you harm
But stay with me, you fallen lamb
And I'll keep you in my arms

But I can't live in the dream
The dream lives in me
Oh, I can't live in the dream
The dream lives in me
