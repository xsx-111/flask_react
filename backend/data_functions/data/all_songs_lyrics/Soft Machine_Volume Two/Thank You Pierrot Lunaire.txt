Thank You Pierrot Lunaire LyricsIn his organ solos
He feels 'round the keyboards
Knowing he must find the noisiest notes for you to hear
And when I know that he's found them
It feels so good...
But I still can't see why people listen, instead of doing it themselves
But I'm grateful all the same
You're very kind and I don't blame you
I don't mind if you just watch
In fact I'd welcome it, welcome it, welcome it, welcome it
Welcome it, welcome it, welcome it, welcome it, welcome it..Embed
