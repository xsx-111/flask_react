A Love Supreme Lyrics
Love
Love is a sacred word
Love is the name of god
The entire universe is created with Love by Love and in Love
Love is the beginning
Love is the continuation
And Love is the end
Love for love's sake is divine
It is constrictive, it is beautiful
Brings peace
Brings harmony
It brings joy
To the lover
And to the loved
But if Love is based on selfishness, egoism
The very same love brings restriction
Peace and harmony is based on Love
And used properly by a selfless mind for the benefit of the humanity
Love knows no business
Love knows no bargain
Love never expects anything in return
Love knows only giving
Giving and giving
Without even waiting for a thank you
Such a Love is the supreme word
Let that Love Supreme reign over the universe
Om Shanti Shanti Shanti OMEmbed
