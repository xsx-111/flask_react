Sleep Lyrics
Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, go to sleep

You are now in a deep sleep
(In-store promises)
Endless possibilities, a life of ease
A life cocooned in a routine of food
(Stimulus and response!)
Softness is a thing called comfort
(It doesn't cost much to keep in touch)
We never forget you have a choice
Possibilities in store, a taste of paradise
Success on a plate for you, endless promises

(Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep)
Sleep, go to sleep
You are now in a deep sleep
Sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, go to sleep
You are now in a deep sleep2Embed
