Shrink Wrap LyricsShrinkwrap, you lie, you lie, you lie 

Wolf in sheep's clothing
Enshrine our latest product
Define the hollow spaces
(Stimulus and response)
Mobilised cellophane
Untouched by human hands

Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
You can have your cake and eat it

It's an expanding universe1Embed
