Triumph Lyrics

Through dirty net curtains
You look at me
Why is it I can't see through to you?
The mesh, it is in your favour (Under my steady gaze)
How will you move (Frozen mid-step)
When the angles are reversed? (You cannot move)

Triumph of the will (triumph of the will)
Triumph of the will (triumph of the will)Embed
