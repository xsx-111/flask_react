Paper Hats Lyrics
Well, what do we expect?
Paper hats?
Or maybe even roses?
The sounds of explosions?

Oh no, is this any easier?
Comfy? Climax? Ego?
Decorations up or down?
The sound of explosions?

What does this tune signify?
What is its meaning?
Is it really that straightforward?
Or are our ears beyond words?
