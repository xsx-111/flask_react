Cenotaph Lyrics
History, history repeats itself
History repeats itself

Remembrance Sunday
A war to end all war
And the war that came after that
To keep freedom's flag flying
Lest we forget
The glorious dead
Poppy day, remember poppies are red
And the fields are full of poppies

History, history repeats itself
History repeats itself
History repeats itself

And when the lights go on again
All over the world
And when the boys come home
All over the world
Rain and snow will be all that fall
From out of the sky
A kiss won't mean goodbye
When Johnny comes marching homeEmbed
