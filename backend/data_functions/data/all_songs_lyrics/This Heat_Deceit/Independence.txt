Independence Lyrics
"We hold these truths to be self evident
That all men are created equal
That they are endowed by their Creator with certain rights
That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
— That to secure these rights
Governments are instituted among men
Deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
— That whenever any form of government
Becomes destructive of these ends
It is the right of the people to alter or abolish it."Embed
