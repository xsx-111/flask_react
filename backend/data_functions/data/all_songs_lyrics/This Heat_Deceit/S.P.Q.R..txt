S.P.Q.R. Lyrics
Amo, amas, amat
Amamus, amatis, amant

We are all Romans, unconscious collective
We are all Romans, we live to regret it
We are all Romans and we know all about straight roads
Every straight road leads home, home to Rome

Two plus two equals four
Four plus four equals eight

We organise via property as power
Slavehood and freedom, imperial purple
Pax Romana!
Suckled by a she-wolf, we turn against our brother

Bella, bella, bella
Bellorum, bellis, bellis
Veni, vidi, vici
I came, I saw, I conquered
We're all Romans, unconscious collective
We are all Romans, we live to regret it
We are all Romans and we know all about straight roads
Every straight road leads home, home to Rome

Two plus two equals four
Four plus four equals eight

We organise via property as power
Slavehood and freedom, imperial purple
Pax Romana!
Suckled by a she-wolf, we turn against our brother

Bella, bella, bella
Bellorum, bellis, bellis
Veni, vidi, vici
I came, I saw, I conquered

We're all Romans1Embed
