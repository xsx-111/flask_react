Sad Girl Lyrics
Ah, ah

Being a mistress on the side (Ah, yeah-ah)
It might not appeal to fools like you (Ah)
Creeping around on the side
Might not be something you would do
(Ah, ah)

But you haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen my man (Man, man)
You haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen him (Whoa-ah)

He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
Being a bad bitch on the side (Ah, ah)
Might not appeal to fools like you (Ah, ah)
Creeping around while he gets high
It might not be something you would do (ah)

But you haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen my man (Man, man)
You haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen him (Whoa-ah)

He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
I'm on fire, baby
I'm on fire

He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl99Embed
