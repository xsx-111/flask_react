Cruel World Lyrics
Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
Did what I had to do
'Cause you're so far past me now
Shared my body and my life with you
That's way over now
There's not more a mind can do
You're so famous now

Got your Bible, got your gun
And you like to party and have fun
And I like my candy and your women
I'm finally happy now that you're gone

Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm the best
I'm crazy, yeah, yeah
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Get a little bit suburban and go
Crazy, yeah, yeah
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
You're crazy for me
I shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I found another, anyhow
Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I could see you leaving now

I got your Bible and your gun
And you love to party and have fun
And I love your women and all of your heroin
And I'm so happy now that you're gone

Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess
I'm crazy, yeah, yeah
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Go a little bit suburban and go
Crazy, yeah, yeah
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're crazy for me
Got your Bible and your gun
You like your women and you like fun
I like my candy and your heroin
And I'm so happy, so happy now you're gone

Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess
I'm crazy, yeah, yeah
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Get a little bit suburban and go
Crazy, yeah, yeah
'Cause you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You're crazy for me

Oh, oh
Oh
You're crazy for me105Embed
