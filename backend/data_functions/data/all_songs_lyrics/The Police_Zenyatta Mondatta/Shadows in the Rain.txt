Shadows in the Rain Lyrics
Woke up in my clothes again this morning
Don't know exactly where I am
And I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can

He claims I suffer from delusions
Yet I'm so confident I'm sane
It can't be no optical illusion
So how can you explain?

Shadows in the rain, oh

And if you see us on the corner
We're just dancing in the rain
I join my friends there when I see them
Outside my window pane

Shadows in the rain, oh
Shadows in the rain, yeah
Shadows in the rain, yeah
Shadows in the rain, oh
Woke up in my clothes again this morning
Don't know exactly where I am
And I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can

Shadows in the rain, oh
Shadows in the rain, oh

Shadows in the rain, oh, oh
Shadows in the rain, oh
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
How can I explain
Shadows in the rain?
Shadows in the rain
How can I explain
Shadows in the rain?
How can I explain
How can I explain
Shadows in the rain?Embed
