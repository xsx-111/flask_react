13 Candles LyricsNow the night lays dark and cold
Upon a world at sleep
Across the world sweeps a crimson haze
Now the virgin's seal is broken
The fertility rite is complete
And the seed is sown in a holy place
Born a child of the underworld
The fire and flame
Born a child of the underworld
Desire and pain
Born a child of the underworld
Evil prevail
Born a child of the underworld
Now the day is slowly fading
The 12th night is comed
Prepare soon the virgin shall give birth
To the son of Satan, child of Hell
Spread the news across the universe
Satan's child is born tonight by womb untouched and pure
All Hell rejoice the birth of the Son
Laced in sin
Child of Hell
The spirit of lust and pain
Baptised in sacred angel blood
Now Evil can prevail
Born a child of the underworld
The fire and flame
Born a child of the underworld
Desire and pain
Born a child of the underworld
Evil prevail
Born a child of the underworld
So light the 13 Candles
Born a child of the underworld
The fire and flame
Born a child of the underworld
Desire and pain
Born a child of the underworld
Evil prevail
Born a child of the underworld
So light the 13 CandlesEmbed
