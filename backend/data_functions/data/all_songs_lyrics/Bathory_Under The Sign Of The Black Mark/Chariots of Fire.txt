Chariots of Fire LyricsThe damned earth cometh under starspangled sky
As the sound of destruction increase
Tongues of red fire snatch black clouds above
And unite with the cold northern breeze
A massive veil of flames raise high over the mountains
And burning clouds fill up the sky
Along vast hills liquid fire brim over
Tonight hell's jaws open wide
Over the skyline approaching at high speed
Objects of flames reaching higher
Crossing the sky at hell's pace comes a thousand
Chariots of Fire
Chariots of fire emerge spreading pure
Hell on earth as they pass over water and land
All living to ashes turn all creatures
Alive they burn they die as they lay and stand
Vast hills on fire thick smoke dark sight
Ashes and death everywhere
Covered with ashes the bleak world lies
Dead as the chariots emerge the poisoned air
Over the skyline approaching at high speed
Objects of flames reaching higher
Crossing the sky at Hell's pace comes a thousand Chariots of Fire
The damned earth cometh under starspangled sky
As the sound of destruction increase
Tongues of red fire snatch black clouds above
And unite with the cold northern breeze
A massive veil of flames raise high over the mountains
And burning clouds fill up the sky
Along vast hills liquid fire brim over
Tonight hell's jaws open wide
Over the skyline approaching at high speed
Objects of flames reaching higher
Crossing the sky at hell's pace comes a thousand
