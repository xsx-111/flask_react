Woman of Dark Desires LyricsAll dressed in gold and purple the beauty awaits the night
Knowing what will satisfy; aware of her delight
The thought of young fresh blood makes the hours go so slow
But the yearn for eternal life and beauty makes her hazel brown eyes glow
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Elizabeth Bathory
Now the hour is comed, the time is right for the feast to take its roll
And by the sunrise 60 bodies will be found raped from their blood and souls
The beauty patiently selects the victims for the night
Innocent blood will give eternal beauty eternal life
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Elizabeth Bathory
Now the life you have lived have comed to light and unfold is your perversity
Now the end is near still death is real: no more beauty or life for eternity
Cold walls entomb your secrets but there's nothing you regret
Embrace death with a smile as the highlands face sunset
Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Elizabeth Bathory
