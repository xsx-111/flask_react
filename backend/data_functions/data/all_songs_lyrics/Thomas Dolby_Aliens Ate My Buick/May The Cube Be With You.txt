May The Cube Be With You LyricsLate one night a happy martian with nothing to do
Made the perfect pleasure drug and he called it the Cube
A Cube so potent in a stroke it turned nightmares to dreams
He flew right past the planet Earth and he gave it to me
Then he said

May the Cube be with you
And your father
May the Cube be with you
Ever after
You might care to spend an evening with Marilyn Monroe
Share a cell with Jimmy Cagney or Paris with Brando
Drop some bombs on Maggie Thatcher or Ronnie Reagan
You see Cube power comes by the hour so why not have fun?
Right here

Half a million people are such a sight to see
Lying in the sunshine in a private fantasy
But you got to have more
You won't stop 'til you get it all
And I would give it to you baby
But the law is catching up with me
Pending my interrogation and stuck for an excuse
I thought up two more variations on pastry abuse
I'm so very sorry constable but what can I do
When half the Western world is turning on to Dolby's Cube
