The Ability To Swing LyricsEverybody talking
Talking pretty hard
Everybody talking
'Bout singing from the heart
If you want my opinion
It doesn't mean a thing
If you haven't got that
Ability to swing
Yeah, the ability to swing
Everybody thinking
Thinking pretty hard
Everybody thinking
'Bout singing from the heart
So listen up already
I'm saying it again
If you haven't got that
Ability to swing
Ah, the ability to swing
Dreams, take 'em away
Go it alone, honey Rome wasn't built in a day
But now it's a ruin, the joke has worn thin
And it isn't cool to abuse the ability to swing
Everybody working
Working pretty hard
Everybody working
At singing from the heart
If you want my opinion
It isn't worth a bean
If you you ain't in possession
Of the ability to swing
Friends, send them away
Go it alone, honey Rome wasn't built in a day
Now it's a ruin, the joke has worn thin
And it isn't cool to abuse the ability to swing
But each beat send me deeper under
Each beat send me more to sleep
Heart melts ice and heart spells danger
Don't hold your breath boy
'Cause it don't come cheap
Everybody looking
Looking pretty hard
Everybody searching
For a meaning in my art
I'll level with you bucko
It isn't worth a bean
If you ain't in possession
Of the ability to swing
The ability to swing
Mmm, the ability to swingEmbed
