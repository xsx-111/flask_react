My Brain Is Like A Sieve LyricsOh!
My brain is like a sieve
Sometimes it's easier to forget
All the bad things you did to me
You did to me
Oh! My brain is like sieve
But it knows when it's being messed with, yeah
If you wanted you could come in
So come in
When you said you loved me
When you told me you cared
That you would be a part of me, mmmm
That you would always be there
Did you really mean to hurt me?
No, I think you only meant to tease
But it's hard to remember
I lost my memory
See

My brain is like sieve
But it knows when it's being messed with, ah
If you wanted, you could come in
So come in
Ye-a-a-a-ah!
You ought to be ashamed of your behaviour
When you're treating me this way
As if I had deserved to be a place to vent your ire
Some day I'm gonna douse that bonfire
We make a crucial team for a dying world
And style is a word I never even heard
In your vocabulary, (ire) victim of a murder mystery
Murder

Did to me
Ye-a-a-a-a-ah!
My brain is like a sieve
My brain is like a sieve, yeah
Sometimes it's easier to forget
All the bad things you did to me
You did to me
Ah
My brain is like sieve
But it's a place where we both could live
If you wanted, you could come in
So come in
Oooooo!
When you said you loved me
When you told me you cared
When you said you loved me
When you told me you cared
That you would be a part of me, mmmm
That you would always be there
Did you really mean to hurt me?
No, I think you only meant to tease
But it's hard to remember
Through these broken memories
Through these broken memoriesEmbed
