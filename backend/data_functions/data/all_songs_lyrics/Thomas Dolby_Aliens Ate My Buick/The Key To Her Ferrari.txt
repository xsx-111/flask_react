The Key To Her Ferrari LyricsThere was one room in her house that was always kept locked
It was the garage
I don't want your love
Don't want your money
I just want the key to your Ferrari
Don't want your bed
I don't want your body
I just want the key to your Ferrari
I'm gonna rip it, shine it, rev it
Scoot it, skid it, jam it
Rev it, skip it, gun it
Up and down the 101
Don't want your love
Don't want your money, girl
I said all I want is the key to your Ferrari
And then
And then I saw her
She was a bright red '64 GTO
With fins and gills like some giant piranha fish
Some obscene phallic symbol on wheels
Little rivers of anticipation ran down my inseam
As I kicked those five hundred Italian horses into life
And left reality behind me
Fifty, sixty, seventy miles an hour...oh!
My hand slipped inside the belt of my trousers
As we passed eighty, ninety miles an hour
And as we hit the magic hundred, I
Yes, my love exploded all over her bright pink leather interior
And at that moment, I thought of my mother
Don't need no drugs
Don't need no liquor
Said all I want is the key to your Ferrari
Your ruby lips, pa (should be "Bah!")
Your perfect figure, eech
I just want the key to your Ferrari
I'm gonna rev it, jam it, scram it
Rip it, tear it, bare it
Ram it, repair it, scoot it
Up and down the 101
Don't want your love
Don't want your money, girl
I said all I want is the key to your Ferrari
He's gonna rev it, scoot it, skid it
Rip it, skip it, gun it
Brake it, zoom it, vacuum it
Up and down the 101
Don't want your love
Don't want your money, girl
I said all I want is the key to your Ferrari
Oh, I just want the key to your Ferrari
Cause aliens ate my BuickEmbed
