Pulp Culture LyricsI drove all over Hollywood
Looking at the stars
First I ate my Milky Way
And then I ate my Mars
But sucking on a Galaxy
I noticed something pretty bizarre
There's not a lot of people there
Just an awful lot of cars, check it out!

Stale! Pulp culture, take it away
True! Pulp culture, help to redefine it
Old! Pulp culture, day upon day
Young! Pulp culture, serve to undermine it
Sham! Pulp culture, buried in time
True! Pulp culture, there to be plundered
Same! Pulp culture, year upon year
Hey! Pulp culture, live to be a hundred
Shake off that thing, you gotten used to it
Here is one you won't wanna parlay
In a small round cruel scum brown brat shack dumb world
So squeeze a little tear from your body...
Another dozen unchained!

If a child ever rose on the wings of a dove
Or the claws of a vulture
Then a man ain't a man when he don't understand
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Pulp culture, pulp culture, pulp culture, pulp culture
Do you really love me girl?
I think I know but I wanna be sure
You tell it to me all night long
Still I wanna hear it some more
You tell me in the bathroom babe
And you tell me back in the hall
You tell me on the kitchen table
And up against the wall, what it is
So check beneath your fingernails
In between your toes
Right between your earlobes darling
That's where culture grows
It's breeding in your short and curlies
Ready to expand
From the heart of Poison City out over televisionland
