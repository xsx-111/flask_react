Good Enough Lyrics
Hey your glass is empty
It's a hell of a long way home
Why don't you let me take you?
It's no good to go alone
I never would have opened up
But you seemed so real to me
And after all the bullshit I've heard
It's refreshing not to see
I don't have to pretend
She doesn't expect it from me

Don't tell me I haven't been good to you
Don't tell me I have never been there for you
Don't tell me why nothing is good enough

Hey little girl would you like some candy
Your momma said it's okay
The door is open come on outside
No I can't come out today
It's not the wind that cracked your shoulder
And threw you to the ground
Who's there that makes you so afraid?
You're shaken to the bone
And I don't understand
You deserve so much more than this
So don't tell me why he's never been good to you
Don't tell me why he's never been there for you
Don't you know that why is simply not good enough?
Oh so just let me try and I will be good to you
Just let me try and I will be there for you
I'll show you why you're so much more than good enough


So don't tell me why he's never been good to you
Don't tell me why he's never been there for you
Don't you know that why is simply not good enough?
Oh so just let me try and I will be good to you
Just let me try and I will be there for you
I'll show you why you're so much more than good enoughEmbed
