Elsewhere Lyrics
I love the time and in between
The calm inside me
In the space where I can breathe
I believe there is a distance I have wandered
To touch upon the years of
Reaching out and reaching in
Holding out, holding in

I believe
This is heaven to no one else but me
And I'll defend it long as
I can be left here to linger in silence
If I choose to
Would you try to understand?

I know this love is passing time
Passing through like liquid I am
I'm drunk in my desire
But I love the way you smile at me
I love the way your hands reach out and
Hold me near
I believe, I
I believe
This is heaven to no one else but me
And I'll defend it long as
I can be left here to linger in silence
If I choose to
Would you try to understand?

Oh the quiet child
Awaits the day when she can break free
The mold that clings like desperation
Mother can't you see I've got
To live my life the way I feel is
Right for me
Might not be right for you but it's
Right for me
Oh

I believe
This is heaven to no one else but me
And I'll defend it long as
I can be left here to linger in silence
If I choose to
Would you try to understand it?
I would like to linger here in silence
If I choose to
Would you understand it?
Would you try?
Would you try to understand?Embed
