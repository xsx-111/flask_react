Mary Lyrics
Mary walks
Down to the water's edge
And there she hangs her head
To find herself faded
Shadow of what she once was
She said "How long have I been sleeping?
And why do I feel so old?
Why do I feel so cold?
My heart is saying one thing
But my body won't let go"

With trembling hands she reaches up
A stranger's flesh is offered

And I would be the last to know
I would be the last to let it show
I would be the last to go

Take her hand
She will lead you through the fire
Oh and give you back hope
And hope that you won't take too much
Respecting what is left
She cradled us
Oh she held us in her arms
Unselfish in her suffering
She could not understand
That no one seemed to have the time
To cherish what was given

Oh and I would be the last to know
And I would be the last to let it show
I would be the last to go
Mary walks
Oh and I would be the last to know
And I would be the last to let it show
I would be the last to goEmbed
