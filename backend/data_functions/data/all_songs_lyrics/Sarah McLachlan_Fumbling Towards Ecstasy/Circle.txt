Circle Lyrics
There are two of us talking in circles
And one of us who wants to leave
In a world created for only us
An empty cage that had no key
Don't you know that we're working with flesh and blood
Carving out of jealousy?
Crawling into each other
It's smothering every little part of me

What kind of love is this that keeps me hanging on
Despite everything it's doing to me?
What is this love that keeps me coming back for more
When it will only end in misery?

I know too many people unhappy
In a life from which they'd love to flee
Watching others get everything offered
They're wanton for discovery
Oh my brother, my sister, my mother
You're losing your identity
Can't you see that it's you in the window
Shining with intensity?
What kind of love is this that keeps me hanging on
Despite everything it's doing to me?
What is this love that keeps me coming back for more
When it will only end in misery?


What kind of love is this that keeps me hanging on
Despite everything it's doing to me?
What is this love that keeps me coming back for more
When it will only end in misery?Embed
