Ice Lyrics
The ice is thin come on dive in
Underneath my lucid skin
The cold is lost, forgotten
Hours pass days pass time stands still
Light gets dark and darkness fills
My secret heart forbidden

I think you worried for me then
The subtle way that I'd give in
But I know you liked the show
Tied down to this bed of shame
You tried to move around the pain
But oh your soul is anchored

The only comfort is
The moving of the river
You enter into me
A lie upon your lips
Offer what you can
I'll take all that I can get
Only a fool is here

Well I don't like your tragic sighs
As if your god has passed you by
Well hey fool that's your deception
Your angels speak with jilted tongues
The serpent's tale has come undone
You have no strength to squander
The only comfort is
The moving of the river
You enter into me
A lie upon your lips
Offer what you can
I'll take all that I can get
Only a fool is here to stay
Only a fool's here to stay
Only a fool's hereEmbed
