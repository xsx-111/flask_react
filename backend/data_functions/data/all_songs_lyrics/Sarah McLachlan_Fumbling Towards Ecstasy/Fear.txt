Fear Lyrics
Morning smiles
Like the face of a newborn child
Innocent, unknowing
Winter's end
Promises of a long lost friend
Speaks to me of comfort

But I fear
I have nothing to give
I have so much to lose here in this lonely place
Tangled up in our embrace
There's nothing I'd like better than to fall

But I fear
I have nothing to give

Wind in time
Rapes the flower trembling on the vine
Nothing yields to shelter
From above
They say temptation will destroy our love
The never-ending hunger
But I fear
I have nothing to give
I have so much to lose here in this lonely place
Tangled up in our embrace
There's nothing I'd like better than to fall

But I fear
I have nothing to give
I have so much to lose
I have nothing to give
I have so much to lose
I have nothing to give
I have so much to lose
I have nothing to give
I have so much to lose
I have nothing to giveEmbed
