Hold On Lyrics
Hold on
Hold on to yourself
For this is gonna hurt like hell
Hold on
Hold on to yourself
You know that only time will tell
What is it in me that refuses to believe
This isn't easier than the real thing?

My love
You know that you're my best friend
You know I'd do anything for you
My love
Let nothing come between us
My love for you is strong and true
Am I in heaven here or am Iâ€“?
At the crossroads I am standing

So now you're sleeping peaceful
I lie awake and pray
You'll be strong tomorrow
And we'll see another day
And we will praise it
And love the light that brings a smile
Across your face
Mmm. oh God
If you're out there, won't you hear me?
I know that we've never talked before
Oh God
The man I love is leaving
Won't you take him when he comes to your door?
Am I in heaven here or am I in hell?
At the crossroads I am standing

Now you're sleeping peaceful
I lie awake and pray
That you'll be strong tomorrow
And we'll see another day
And we will praise it
And love the light that brings a smile
Now you're sleeping peaceful
I lie awake and pray
That you'll be strong tomorrow
And we'll see another day
And we will praise it
And love the light that brings a smile
Across your face

Hold on
Hold on to yourself
For this is gonna hurt like hellEmbed
