Waltzing Back LyricsWho gave them the right
Waltzing back into your life?
Your life, your life?
Now I feel fear
I wish that they'd never come here
Here, here
What they gonna do?
What they gonna say
Taking you away
From my life?
My life, my life?
Say, what they gonna do?
What they gonna say
Taking you away
From my life?
My life, my life?
Who gave them the right
Turning it back into light
Tonight, tonight?
And then I felt fear
I wished that they'd never come here
Here, here
What they gonna do?
What they gonna say
Taking you away
From my life?
My life, my life?
Oh, I don't wanna line
I wanna shine
I wanna say
'Cause it's your life
Your life, your life
La...
La...
La...
Who gave them the right?
The right?
The right?
Who gave them the right?
The right?
The right?
Who gave them the right?
The right?
The right?
Who gave them the right?
The right?
The right?Embed
