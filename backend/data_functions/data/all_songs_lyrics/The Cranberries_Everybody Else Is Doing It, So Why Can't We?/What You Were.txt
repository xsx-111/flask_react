What You Were Lyrics
Now it's easy for to see
Why people's life are so lonely
And you never understood
You never really could, you were wrong

What you were, what you were
I couldn't say
'Cause you left me here behind
A stupid state of mind, and I'm lonely

Yeah, you left me here behind
A stupid state of mind, and you're gone
'Cause you left me here behind
A stupid state of mind, and you're gone

What you were, what you were
I couldn't say
It took something hard like this
Mistaken to resist, and I'm lonelyEmbed
