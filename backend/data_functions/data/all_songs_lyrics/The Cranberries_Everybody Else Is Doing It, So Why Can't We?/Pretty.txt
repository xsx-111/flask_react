Pretty LyricsYou're so pretty the way you are
You're so pretty the way you are
And you have no reason
To be so insolent to me
You're so pretty the way you are
La... la...
You can say it if you want to
But you won't change me
La... la...
You can say it if you want to
But you won't change me
You're so pretty the way you are
You're so pretty the way you are
And you have no reason
To be so insolent to me
You're so pretty the way you are
La... la...
You can say it if you want to
But you won't change me
La... la...
You can say it if you want to
But you won't change me1Embed
