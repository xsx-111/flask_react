Reason Lyrics
Nothing to say, nothing to do
Nowhere to go, and I can't get over being with you
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
I don't know what you want, is there anything that I can do?
'Cause if you were somewhere else instead
If you were with someone else instead
If you were...

The look on your face, that tells us come here
A reason to be escaping from reality
I'm frightened with fear indefinitely
A reason to be escaping from reality
'Cause if you were somewhere else instead
If you were in someone else's hay
If you were...
Na-na-naa, na-na-naa
Naa-na-na-naa, naa-na-na-naa

Nothing to say, nothing to do
Nowhere to go and I can't get over being with you
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
I don't know what you want, is there anything that I can do?
'Cause if you were somewhere else instead
If you were in someone else's bed
If you were...
Na-na-naa, na-na-naa
Naa-na-na-naa, naa-na-na-naaEmbed
