Them LyricsOh, don't listen to what they say
Make up your mind, walk away
Oh, don't even give them the time of day
They put you wrong
Turn away
So why did they all just walk away
There was something wrong
Didn't want to stay
Oh, why did they listen to someone else?
I did something wrong, something...
They all got that attitude
That all got that attitude...
Don't listen to what they say
Make up your mind, walk away
Oh, it won't ever happen again
They've all gone wrong, gone insane
That's why they all just walked away
There was nothing wrong
Didn't want to stay
That's why they listened to someone else
I did nothing wrong, nothing...
That's why...
That's why....Embed
