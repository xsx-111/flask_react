How Lyrics
Look, you're standing alone (Standing alone)
However I should have known (I should have known)

Never before, never again
You will ignore, I will pretend
Never before, never again
You will ignore, I will pretend

In your world, you're alone in your face
You're alone in your world
You're alone in your face
How you said you never would leave me alone, how
How you said you never would leave me alone

Now you're just walking away (Walking away)
When you said you always would stay (Always would stay)

Never before, never again
You will ignore, I will pretend
Never before, never again
You will ignore, I will pretend
In your world, you're alone in your face
Your alone in your world
Your alone in your face
How you said you never would leave me alone, how
How you said you never would leave me alone

Never before, never again
You will ignore, I will pretend
In your world, you're alone in your place
You're alone in your world
You're alone in your place

How you said you never would leave me alone, how
How you said you never would leave me alone
How you said you never would leave me alone, how
How you said you never would leave me alone
