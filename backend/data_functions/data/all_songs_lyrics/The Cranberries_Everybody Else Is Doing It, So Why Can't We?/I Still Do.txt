I Still Do Lyrics
I'm not ready for this
Though I thought I would be
I can't see the future
Though I thought I could see

I don't want to leave you
Even though I have to
I don't want to love you
Oh, I still do

Need some time to find myself
You wouldn't live with it
Can I go my own way?
Can I pray my own way?
I don't want to leave you
Oh, I need you

Am I ready for this?
Did I think I would be?
Can I see the future?
No, I can't see
I don't want to leave you
Even though I have to
I don't want to love you
Oh, I still do
Ah
Ah
Oh I still do
Ah
Ah
Oh I still do
Ah
