Overthrown Lyrics
Murdered, slayed, sucking disease
What is the point of it all?
Flee, bleed, fucking bled clean
What is the point of it all?
Dead, hard and flecked with disease
What is the point of it all?
Running, stabbed, innocent lives
What is the point of it all?

Ceiling, walls, freckled with blood
What is the point of it all?
Curdled, rot, brindled with shot
What is the point of it all?
Please, please, down on your knees
What is the point of it all?
Barren, burned, vacant of trees
This is the end of it allEmbed
