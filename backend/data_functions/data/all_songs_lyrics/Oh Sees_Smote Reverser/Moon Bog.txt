Moon Bog LyricsSometime before I
Wake up, wake up
The stranger comes up beside me, yeah
Right on, right on
I lie, moon light
Hoof beat, asleep
Black dream, retreat
Dawn creeps asleep
I lie, moon light
Hoof beat, asleep
Black dream, retreat
Dawn creeps asleep
Oft-times I lie there
In the black swirling sands
The stranger comes up beside me, yeah
Chills my heart in his hands
I lie, moon light
Hoof beat, asleep
Black dream, retreat
Dawn creeps asleep
I lie, moon light
Hoof beat, asleep
Black dream, retreat
Dawn creeps asleep
Other times I wake up
The fever runs over with plan
On how to be a better lover, yeah
Of my better fellow man
I lie, moon light
Hoof beat, asleep
Black dream, retreat
Dawn creeps asleep
I lie, moon light
Hoof beat, asleep
Black dream, retreat
Dawn creeps asleepEmbed
