Beat Quest LyricsAh, who's the man I used to call my brother?
He gave his life, so agony averted
I'll roll his bones up to the gates forever
And toss them over walls and into time
I beat my chest upon the quest and follow
The high-end squeal of grinding wheel avoided
Rolling over walls and tumbling rubble
There's nothing left for us to claim at allEmbed
