Nail House Needle Boys LyricsYou lie inside a swelling head
And float your sail like a soldier
You lie and cheat, you're sickly sweet
And follow the echo down the hole, yeah
You cry and pout, what's it all about?
The rind of your life lays all around you
You drag your feet down city streets
And scan the sky for the eye, yeahEmbed
