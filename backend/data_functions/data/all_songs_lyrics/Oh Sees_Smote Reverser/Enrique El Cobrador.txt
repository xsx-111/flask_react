I left the horse in the dust
So many miles ago
Slayed scores of men to get this far
To knock upon your door
You won't escape terminus
Crush opponents, drunk with lust
Feeding then repeating till you fall
I am the skull upon the hill
Drenched in blood that I spill
Butchering and ticking down the day, hey hey
Murdering and dreadful form
Shattering and vengeful swarm
Savoring the ending of your days
The driven horde under whip
Broken teeth and bloody lips
Cast a foul shadow on your doorEmbed
