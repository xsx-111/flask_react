Sentient Oona Lyrics
They don't care if you're holding
Unwinding a mystery for free
They've got a system, vultures closing
Peel back your armor, under siege

You won't care when you're frozen
Slightly slip away into deep sleep
The blinking eye of your oppressor
Watch you as you slip into the deepEmbed
