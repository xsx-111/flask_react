Red Eye Lyrics
Hey!
Love, hate, play this game of give and take
Go, stay, we all make mistakes
I'll say, what a wonderful escape
I embrace
Hey, hey, hey

Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I can't understand, I don't understand it
The visions in my head
I just can't make sense of it
I just can't make sense of it
I just can't make sense of it
Cause I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
There's no use for it baby
I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
I’m so used to you baby
I can never run, I can never run
There’s no use for it baby
I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
I’m so used to you baby

Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
Ooo-oh! Ooo-oh!
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
Baby, Oh oh
Ooo-oh! Ooo-oh!
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
Baby, Oh oh! Ooo-oh!

Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)27Embed
