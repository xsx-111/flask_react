Afterwards (Bring Yo Friends) Lyrics
Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around, nigga slide by
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, got some friends around me
Have us a good time, and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around, nigga slide by
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, got some friends around me

We should go to my home
Afterwards, come on
Bring your friends, we should go to my home
Afterwards, come on
We should go to my home
Afterwards, come on
Bring your friends, we should go to my home
Afterwards, come on
Bring your friends
Bring your friends
Bring your friends

My people be on across the globe
Don't box me in, claustrophobe
Tonight we alive, we should give em a show
And my living room dance floor is ready to go
My people be on across the globe
Don't box me in, claustrophobe
Tonight we alive, we should give em a show
And my living room dance floor is ready to go
(Bring your friends)
Ready to go
(Bring your friends)
Ready to go

Bring your friends
Bring your friends
Bring your friends
Bring your friends
Bring your friends
Bring your friends
Bring your friends
Bring your friends
