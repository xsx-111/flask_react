Solace LyricsFarewell to the west now
And welcome, to the east
Farewell to the one who raked, the sand beneath my feet
Thank you for the space we shared, and the heart and soul my friend
I will see you through the colours, between the mountains as the sun decends
Oh we twisted and we reflected upon a grin
Common ground we walked upon, with common feelings & common things
Yes it is a cruel world, but there is solace amongst the sin
Peace to you for now we'll share again, we'll share againEmbed
