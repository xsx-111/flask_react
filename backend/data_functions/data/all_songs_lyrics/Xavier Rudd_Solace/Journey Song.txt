Journey Song LyricsThe stone it sinks
The day is near
And i watch your feet i feel your breathe
I'm in your dreams
Seems such a long long time But i will return
You are the only spark i use
In these things I do
This is the thing I do
All these people
And all these times
And all this road I see for real
In four twenty time
There will be fourteen days
When sadness climbs
And there will be times when i feel chilled
With you on my mind
This is the thing I do
You miss me now
Well I miss you too
You see well chances are given
Only once
Now there's clouds in my heart
Clouds in my mind
You see well chances are given
Only once
