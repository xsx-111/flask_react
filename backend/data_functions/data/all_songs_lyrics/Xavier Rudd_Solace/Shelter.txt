Shelter LyricsHere I am this is my shelter
Here I'm at one with these trees
And all these birds sing to my rhythms
And these waves they comfort me
Do what you will, while your able
Find what it is that you seek
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean
I will fly so high above the sea
If it's shelter you're searching for
One that I cannot provide
Well, I wish you well on your journey
I hope your dreams they come alive
I hope your dreams back down and they, they thrive
Do, do, do
Do, do, do
Do, do, do
Well, I filled my cup with the answers
And I filled my cup with your lies
You topped it up with your mysteries
And all those secrets I denied
Do what you will, while you're able
Find what it is that you seek
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean
I will fly so high above the sea
If it's shelter you're searching for
The one that I cannot provide
Well, I wish you well on your journey
I hope your dreams they come alive
I hope your dreams back down and they
Well they thrive
I hope your dreams they come alive
Well, I hope your dreams back down and thrive
Yeah now
Do, do, do
Do, do, do
Do, do, do
