Ducter Lyrics
From now on I will be like this all of the time
Though I have said that so many times

I was under his scrutiny, but oh, he failed to break me
He laid out his theories, every one that he got
He tried his best to stay strong, and resilient
He does not view things as they are
But he views them as they fit into his plan
He looks prophetic as he theorises my demise
But he is pathetic and he is nothing more

But he could not break me
He could never break me
He could not break me
He could never break me
He could not break me
He could never break me
He could not break me
He could never break me

He looks so distraught as all his efforts amount to nothing
I sit back and watch his 69 mind in full effect
Every quote just eats itself with a different perspective
He recycles points with a different tone of voice
From a lack of any reaction he begins to become complacent
I have the upper hand, now all I need to do is speak
I say, "Diagnose if you wish but please first take your hands off your dick
Diagnose if you wish but please first take your hands off your dick"
He could not
He would not
He would not
He could not
He could not
He would not
He could not
He would not
He could not break me
He could never break me
He could not break me
He could never break me
He could never
He could not1Embed
