Of Schlagenheim LyricsHe's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
At a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
He's at a centre
She's at a centre
Monday morning, commotion throughout
Reverberations of a bell's sound
A sweetheart calls and I venture forth
A voice so fair, I had no thought
And preaching on the pros of naval aviation
“Ha n'a n'a n an n'a n'a hee n'a”
I'm so enthralled by this grand affair
So I choose to be one with the scum of this earth
Nought is true
So unclean
And it smells so bad
Looked so grand
The thing left at one o'clock
But no, It is awful
And sweat is running down
No, it is awful
And the silesfunder he, “hem l n’a n’a n’a neeeeeeeeeeeeee!”
But I dream of a woman with the teeth of a raven
And the hands of a porcupine
Oh yes, a sweetheart with the teeth of a raven and the feet of a shrimp and the legs of a--
Scrap poff puff poff bluah bla
Scre poff pef a hé n'a ne ne ne n'a o!

And the sweat is running down my face, I wish it could be cold
So I could get a bottle full of it and sell it to the old
Their leather cannot handle heat and cracks repulsively
I'd sell to soothe my eyesight, not because they have the need
And he said, "Come here sweetheart, give me a kiss"
With the thoughts of a sister whom he so dearly missed
Now I understand the reason and feel to comply
I said, "But please, first you must understand the reason why
Is because that I dream of a woman with the teeth of a raven
And the hands of a porcupine
And she'd be so sweet, she'd be so nice, and she'd be all of mine
Oh yes, a sweetheart with the teeth of a raven
And the hands of a porcupine
She'd be so sweet, yes, she'd be so nice, she'd be all of mine"2Embed
