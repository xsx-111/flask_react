Speedway LyricsNew city
Old buildings
Build this ground
On floodplain
Near needly water
And dogshit park
New city
Old buildings
Council going
Missing tonight
To live next to
Live next to the game
New flats
New ground
Honey, we won't build to this code
Honey, we won’t build it
Honey, we won't build
Honey, we won't, we won’t, we won't
Honey, we won't build to this code
Honey, we won't build it
Honey, we won't build
We won't, we won't, we won't
We won’t
Stock car racing
Speedway
Old greyhounds
New old ground
This new city
This new town
This new sound
This new ground
And old gripes
Cup ties
Turnstiles
Don’t sit right
Up here
Up here
Up here
Up here, up here, up here1Embed
