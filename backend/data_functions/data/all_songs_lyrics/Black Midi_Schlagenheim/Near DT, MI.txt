Near DT, MI LyricsHe sleeps alone
He drinks alone
Outside
His home
They're loving the water, they breathe in the water
They fight in the water, they're fixing the water
What's in the water? Here in the water
And I see you hide
I'm alive and I can see
The water is foul and it's hard to breathe
There's lead in the water, there's lead in the water
There's lead in the water and you think that I'm fine
I'm stained by the water and only the water
I'm drained by the water, are you losing your mind?
Dead in the water, dead in the water1Embed
