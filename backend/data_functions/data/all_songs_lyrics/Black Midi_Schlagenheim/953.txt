953 Lyrics
Please stop all of this
Strange fantasy
This is not who you are
Not who you want to be
Not who I want you to be
You were once so kind
Please remove these thoughts
Remove them from your mind
For they are a disgrace
To yourself and your family
If not, I'll have to make

So self-righteous
Do not lie
What a contradiction
An eye for an eye
But you are just too lazy
It is purely fantasy
And it takes so quick
Everyone joins in
And it is condemned
It is a sin, it is a sin1Embed
