Western LyricsWe'd wake before daylight
Practice up until noon
He wanted perfection
Always the same tune
After all the shitty things you'd done for me
I left you in a ditch
You were the bank but I was the star on the silver screen
My cheeks made blind men see and they all rose for me
But after all the pretty things you'd done for me
I left you in a ditch
My voice grew hoarse reciting words that you know so well
Though no one heard, they would so soon
Once my sound was known to the finest tastes that set global tone
"And I'll helm the seas of a burgeoning scene as the new-come queen
While you lick your wounds in a hole that's black perpetually"
A pink caterpillar with six anorexic children let me stay
But I had to keep moving through anteater town
After anteater town after anteater town after anteater town after anteater town
I'd spent all your cash by the time I got to Schlagenheim
And your name was gouged, it was no use
To think that you could play
But despite all the stupid plans you set for me
You're still in that ditch
And I was led here after some talk of atmospheres
I skipped the line, made it known that I was one to see
The desk was pain, said I did not fit
No time for ploys and games, I made my way
Through flocks of imbeciles, I crawled through my entry point
But the curtain drew, I was too late
In a white suit stuffed with hay, you were on stage
You were on stage, you were on stage, you were on stage
You were on stage, you were on stage, you were on stage
You were on stage, you were on stage, you were on stage
Lights came dim and hands came one
Though not for me
He sat and began the sound
It sang the chords of my memory, implying that tune1Embed
