Details in the Fabric Lyrics
Saved message:
Hey, what’s up…Uh, I just lost it, at the end of the day I fucking lost it, I just blew up. My whole entire fucking apartment building. I told everyone to go fuck themselves. I just had a hard time today and uh, I don’t know…

Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling on your threads
And breaking yourself up
If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm, then brace it
If it's a broken heart, then face it

And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine

Hang on
Help is on the way
And stay strong
I'm doing everything
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything, everything will be fine
Everything

Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?
Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing

Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything
Hold your own
Know your name
Go your own way
Hold your own (Are the details in the fabric)
Know your name (Are the things that make you panic)
Go your own way (Are your thoughts results of static cling?)
Hold your own (Are the details in the fabric)
Know your name (Are the things that make you panic)
Go your own way (Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?)
Hold your own (Are the things that make you blow)
Know your name (Hell no reason go on and scream)
Go your own way (If you're shocked it's just the fault)
(Of faulty manufacturing)
Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold

Yo, what’s up man? I, uh, I don’t know, I just wanted to say that, uh, everything’s cool with me now. I mean, I just think, I think I’ll always be funky, can’t stop being funky, but I guess we just deal with it how it comes, deal with the humps, take the jumps. I feel like you’re an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea. And I love you buddy. Ok. Bye7Embed
