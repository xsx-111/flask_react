The Dynamo of Volition Lyrics
I've got the dynamo of volition
The p-pole position
Automatic transmission with l-ow emissions
I'm a brand new addition to the old edition
With the love unconditional
And I'm a drama abolitionist
Damn, no opposition, to my proposition
Half of a man, half magician
Half a politician, holding the mic like ammunition
And my vision is as simple as light
Ain't no reason we should be in a fight, no demolition
Get to vote, get to say what you like, procreation
Compositions already written by themselves
Heck is for the people not believing in gosh

Good job, get 'em up way high
Gimme, gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme, gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme, gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good intentions

I do not answer the call if
I do not know who is calling
I guess the whole point of it all is
That we never know really
I'm trying to keep with the Joneses
While waiting for guns and the roses
To finish what we all suppose is
Gonna be the shit, well sue me
Oh, fist like bumping and wrist lock
Twisting up a rizla
Kid Icarus on the transistor
Nintendo be giving me the blister
I bend over take it in the kisser
My best friends are hitting on my sister
Try to tell them that they still a wish-a
'Cause she already got herself a mister
And besides that's gross to wanna diss her
Dee-didee-dee-di-didn't I say, didn't I say

Good job, get 'em up way high
Gimme, gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme, gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme, gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good versus evil
Oh oh

I do not keep up with statistics
I do not sleep without a mistress
I do not eat unless it's fixed with
Some kind of sweet like a licorice
My home is deep inside the mystics
I'm known to keep digging on existence
I'm holding in the heat like a fish stick
My phone it beeps because I missed it
I do not answer the call if
I do not know who is calling
I'm making no sense of it all
Say, can I get a witness?

I'm only a boy in a story
Just a hallucinatory
Tripping on nothing there is
Living in the wilderness
With a tiger spot on my back
Living life of a cat
I just wanna relax here
And write another rap tune
Driving off on your blind man's bike
You can say just what you like
Oh, nothing can stop you, oh

Good job, get 'em up way high
Gimme, gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme, gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme, gimme that high ten
You're the best, you're the best, you're the best
You're the best, you're the best, you're the best
You're the best
Good job, get 'em up way high
Gimme, gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme, gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme, gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good intentions
You're the best definition of good intentions
You're the best definition of good intentions
You're the best around6Embed
