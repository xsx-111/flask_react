Coyotes Lyrics
I'm sippin' coffee at a quarter to two
I wake and I'm dialin' and my mind's runnin' to you
No wonder I'm a one woman man
She keeps my heart in a jar on her nightstand
I should tell her that she couldn't be more
Opposite than a foot in a door
There's no one else I would rather go out with
It's hell when I see them standing there
Me and my mouth, we don't mean to be rushin'
We talk about deep freely cause we crushin'
I'm 'onna shake both sides of the butt, yeah
Theoretically, yes, ain't we lucky?

And when the coyotes they sing in the park
That's when the city life starts falling for the sea
Winding roads are winding down and the flying men'll hit the ground
Every notion is closer to touchin'
The coyotes sing when they call on your lovin'

(Hello?)
We're comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you
You know we should be, we should be together
'Cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
Ah, not today or tomorrow, oh no
You better lock your doors
You know why, 'cause we want you
'Cause we like you a lot
Mmm, mmm, mmm

I wish the world was alive like you
I wish the wind would blow me through
Another opportunity to approach you
Another telepathic rendezvous
I wish you well with your weapon of jargon
You've got a double-sided lexicon
I got to try to keep your attention
Gotta write using less emoticons
Gotta figure out the snooze alarm
I wanna lay in your place till dawn
I wanna play in the park come on, now
Let me see your other upper echelon
Mmm, mmm

And when the coyotes escape to New York
Then the city life has crumbled to the sea
And the girls all fall to the lost and found
The flying men'll hit the ground
Every notion is closer to touching
The coyotes sing when they feast on your loving, mhm
I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your loving
Comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you
You know we should be, we should be together
Because once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
Not today or tomorrow, oh no
Because once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow, oh, mmm
We're comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you
You know we should be, we should be together
'Cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
(Can you get a little closer to the mic?)
(Okay.)Embed
