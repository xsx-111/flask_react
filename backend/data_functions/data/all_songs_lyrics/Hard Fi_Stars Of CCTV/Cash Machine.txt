Cash Machine Lyrics
Go to a cash machine to get a ticket home
A message on the screen says "don't make plans, you're broke"
No, no, this can't be right
I know that times is tight
I've only just been paid, three weeks, five days till I'm seen
Right...
No...

I scratch a living, it ain't easy
You know it's a drag
I'm always paying, never make it
But you can't look back
I wonder if I'll ever get to where I want to be
Better believe it
I'm working for a cash machine

I try to phone a friend
My credit's in the red
I try to skip the fare
Ticket inspector's there
No, no, this can't be right
I live an honest life
It seems like sometimes
You don't cross the line, you don't get
By...
No...
I scratch a living, it ain't easy
You know it's a drag
I'm always paying, never make it
But you can't look back
I wonder if I'll ever get to where I want to be
Better believe it
Yeah

What am I gonna do?
My girlfriend's test turned blue
We tried to play it safe
That night we could not wait
No, no, this can't be right
She said it would be alright
I can't afford to be a daddy, so I leave
Tonight...
No...

I scratch a living, it ain't easy
You know it's a drag
I'm always paying, never make it
But you can't look back
I wonder if I'll ever get to where I want to be
Better believe it
I'm working for a cash machine
Cash machine
Cash machine
Cash machine
There's a hole in my pocket, my pocket, my pocket
There's a hole in my pocket, my pocket, my pocket
There's a hole in my pocket, my pocket, my pocket
There's a hole in my pocket
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahEmbed
