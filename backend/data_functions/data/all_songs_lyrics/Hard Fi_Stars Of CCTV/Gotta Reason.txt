Gotta Reason Lyrics
Hung around here long enough
I've seen the smooth, but only caught the rough
I've got no reason
Ooh no, I've got no reason
Disco on the radio
I ain't got no place to go
I've got no reason
Ooh no, I got no reason

But wait, see the new girl in town
Maybe I can show you round
Oh baby, let's generate some heat

Gotta reason
Ooh now I've gotta reason

Hey hey, baby, you knock me out
You make me want to scream and shout
I've gotta reason
Now, I've gotta reason
You can make it all worthwhile
I like your face girl, I like your style
You've gotta reason
Ooh, now I'vegotta reason
Yeah, you look so good
I want to eat you up like food
Oh baby, let's generate some heat

I've gotta reason
Ooh now, I've gotta reason

Alright, let's go
Woo
Check it out, check it out yeah
Oh yeah

Gotta get my head just right
Gotta make my move tonight
I've gotta reason
Now I've gotta reason
Oh, I've gotta reason
Ooh now, I've gotta reason
Ooh now, I've gotta

I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gottaEmbed
