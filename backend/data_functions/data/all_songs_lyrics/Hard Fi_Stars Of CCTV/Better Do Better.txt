Better Do Better Lyrics
You're back, sitting on my doorstep
Ah yeah, like nothing happened
Telling me that you're free and, oh
Can you see me again?
Yeah right, so you've been kicked out
Do you think I'm that stupid?
You say you're free but didn't he just, oh-oh-oh
Get tired of your games

I could not eat for days
I cried so much my face
Has never been the same and
And now you're back here with your lies
I hope you realise

You think I'm gonna take you back?
You'd better do better than that
I'll tell ya how it's gonna be
Don't you never ever come near me
Let me tell you how I've been:
I've been hiding from my friends
Hiding from the world
Hiding from myself
You think you come round here
Start singing in my ear
Girl, you damaged me
I don't forgive so easily
You better do better than that
Your face makes me want to be sick
Ah yeah, it's a physical reaction
You'd better leave 'cause you see, I
Can't, won't be blamed for my actions
Don't know how I ever loved you
So dumb, how did I ever trust you?
But you and he laughed at me, oh yeah
While you laid together

I could not eat for days
I cried so much my face
Has never been the same...
And now you're back here with your lies
I hope you realise...

You think I'm gonna take you back?
You'd better do better than that
I'll tell ya how it's gonna be
Don't you never ever come near me
Let me tell you how I've been:
I've been hiding from my friends
Hiding from the world
Hiding from myself
You think you come round here
Start singing in my ear
Girl, you damaged me
I don't forgive so easily
You better do better than that
I gave you everything I had, girl
But you had to try and take some more
You went behind my back, girl
Cheated on me, I was the last to know
Did everything we have, girl
Meant nothing to ya?
Well, I was such a fool
Now you come crawling back, girl
Well let me tell ya, I am through with you
Oh, I'm back up off the floor
And I won't get hurt no more
I've been waiting for this day when
You'll be back here with your lies
I hope you realise

You think I'm gonna take you back?
You'd better do better than that
I'll tell ya how it's gonna be
Don't you never ever come near me
Let me tell you how I've been:
I've been hiding from my friends
Hiding from the world
Hiding from myself
You think you come round here
Start singing in my ear
Girl, you damaged me
I don't forgive so easily
You better do better than that
Say something, say something
You'd better do better than thatEmbed
