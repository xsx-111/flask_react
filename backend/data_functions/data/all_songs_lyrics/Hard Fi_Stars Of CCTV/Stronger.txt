Stronger Lyrics
Seems like we've waited far too long
For some good times to come along
And though it's no-one's fault but ours
It hasn't helped that they've been dragging us down too

This stinking hole has had its day
Gonna buy it up and have it razed
To the ground, and in its place
A brand new world just for us
West London screams

Can't you see the problem?
They can't see further than tomorrow

I'm getting stronger every day
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
I'm getting stronger every day

You can dish it out, can't take it in
I can only grow from the lies you spin
If you're not scared then you should be
Nothin' in the world will keep ya from me
I'm coming home
Can't you see the problem?
You can't see further than tomorrow

I'm getting stronger every day
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
I'm getting stronger every day

Well I just can't wait any longer
I just keep on movin', getting stronger
I look up, look further than tomorrow
Don't you wanna be there
Don't you wanna be there, baby
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
Don't you wanna be there
Don't you wanna be there, baby
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Yeah, hear West London scream

Can't you see the problem?
They can't see further than tomorrow
I'm getting stronger every day
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
I'm getting stronger every day
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
Well, don't you wanna be there, baby
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
Well, don't you wanna be there
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
Well, don't you wanna be there, baby
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
Yeah, yeah
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep getting stronger, stronger)
(We keep on getting stronger, stronger)Embed
