Unnecessary Trouble Lyrics
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

You take it easy
You have your reasons
Sometimes it eats you inside
It feels like treason

You give it right back
Then they just can't take it
You mind your business
Whats yours, they have to wreck it
The hypocrites don't, don't like the bed they lay in
Come out fighting, you know you're always going to win

There's just no point in causin' unnecessary trouble
Just make sure you cause trouble when it's necessary
There's just no point in causin' unnecessary trouble
Just make sure you cause trouble when it's necessary
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

You make excuses
For their ruthlessness
You can't imagine yourself being so careless

There is no reason why they want to hurt you
Maybe it's envy, they know they just can't touch you
The hypocrites don't, don't like the bed they lay in
So come out fighting, you know you're always going to win

There's just no point in causin' unnecessary trouble
Just make sure you cause trouble when it's necessary
There's just no point in causin' unnecessary trouble
Just make sure you cause trouble when it's necessary
There's just no point in causin' unnecessary trouble
Just make sure you cause trouble when it's necessary
Just no point in causin' unnecessary trouble
Just make sure you cause trouble, it's necessary (It's necessary)
Whoa whoa whoa (It's necessary)
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa (It's necessary)
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa (It's necessary)
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa (It's necessary)
Whoa whoa whoa (It's necessary)Embed
