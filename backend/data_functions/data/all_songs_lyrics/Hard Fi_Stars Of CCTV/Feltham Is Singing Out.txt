Feltham Is Singing Out Lyrics
It started off alright
We'd go out Friday night
And have a drink and do whatever made us feel alright
We'd stay out all weekend
Try taking everything
But never hurt no-one and so what
You only live once - I thought
Till I got bored

That weren't enough for you
You'd go out Monday too
And Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday till it all caught up with you
You're everyone's best friend
'Long as they've got something
I did not know you no more
Heartbreak - a sickness I can't see
Oh oh oh, no no no no

Feltham is singing out
Feltham is singing out
Tonight a light's gone out
21 years old and out
Feltham is singing out
We all went out one night
You got us in a fight
You owed some money
To a monkey who had seen you right
You sold your furniture
So you could pay him off
They cut the power
Cut the phone and you slept on the floor

You can't hold down a job
So then you had to rob
First from your mum and then your friends and then the local shops
But as a criminal
You're just no good at all
You got your collar felt
And so dumb, you thought about skipping bail
Now you're in jail

Feltham is singing out
Feltham is singing out
Tonight a light's gone out
21 years old and out
Feltham is singing out
You don't like prison life
You loved to watch the sky
And you'd get beaten and you'd end up throwing up all night
You could not take no more
So when they closed the door
Tied up your sheets, strung yourself up
And then you were no more, no more

Every day I, I, I see your face
As I walk on by past that awful place
23 hours in a cell
Each and every day just like a living hell, living hell, living hell

Feltham is singing out
Feltham is singing out
Feltham is singing outEmbed
