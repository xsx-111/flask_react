Middle Eastern Holiday Lyrics
I've got to go (Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go)
But what a prize to give (Oh)
A package deal to the sun, everything is inclusive
Where bullet holes (Bullet holes, bullet holes, bullet holes)
Scar the minarets (Oh)
Smoke on the horizon, a beautiful sunset

I'm going on my Middle Eastern holiday
Give me a gun, I hope I see my mum again
I'm going on my Middle Eastern holiday, oh
Been gone so long, I hope I'm coming home some day
We can fight, we can fight

I'm 21 (21, 21, 21)
Ah, meanwhile back at home (Oh)
My friends are out tonight, all drinking and dancing
I've got a girl (Got a girl, got a girl, got a girl)
Oh, is she missing me? (Oh)
Watching out for me on the news on TV

I’m going on my Middle Eastern holiday
Give me a gun, I hope I see my mum again
I’m going on my Middle Eastern holiday
Been gone so long, I hope I'm coming home some day
We can fight, we can fight
Back at home, politicians sit
Over lunch discussing this
In the desert the fuse is lit
And I'm the one who has to deal with it

He's got a gun (Got a gun, got a gun, got a gun)
Bullets meant for me (Oh)
Time seems to stand still, I'm so scared I can't speak
I'm flying home (Flying home, flying home, flying home)
Above everything (Oh)
I don't understand, why is my mother crying?

I'm going on my Middle Eastern holiday (1, 2, 3, 4)
Give me a gun, I hope I see my mum again
I'm going on my Middle Eastern holiday, oh
Top up the tan, fight for the man, going far away
Far away...1Embed
