Hard to Beat Lyrics(One, two, three, four!)

I've seen you darling, seen you hanging round town
You in a short skirt, shining eyes a deep brown
You had a dirty look, you caught me on your hook
Turn up the thermostat, I want to see you sweat

Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like

I walked right over, said hi, how ya doin'?
You smiled at me and girl you tore right through me
I said "Come on let's dance, we've gotta take our chance"
You whispered in my ear, you wanna get out of here

Can you feel it? Rocking the city
Ah yeah, straight out of nowhere-ness
Like a fist, can't resist you, oh no
I tell you something

You know I love ya, just wanna touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Let's spend the night, spend the night together
Heart beating so fast, as you take my shirt off
This girl I saw round town, well now she's going down
Stuck on a losing streak, I think you've turned it round

Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like

Read all about it, have you heard the latest?
Boy in a band dates Hollywood actress
But baby, you and me, we came up from the street
No time to hesitate, we gotta punch our weight

Can you feel it? Rocking the city
Ah yeah, straight out of nowhereness
Like a fist, can't resist you, oh no
I tell you something

You know I love ya, just wanna touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Goodness
No, I've never known a night like this
Can't believe it, you're so hard to beat
Hard to beat
Drive me crazy, my beautiful baby
Let's spend the whole day right here together

You know I love ya, just wanna touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Hard to beat

Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh, sitting at home, sitting on the bus
All I ever do is think about us
On and on, I said
Yeeeeeeah
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like2Embed
