Tied Up Too Tight Lyrics
Oh, where I come from
I just don't conform
Get me out of here
Leave the boredom behind
Wanna see the bright lights
Get this thing in gear, yeah

So weâ€™ll ride in my car
Follow the star
Drive on into town
With the stereo loud
Take the Great West Road out
Nothing can bring me down, down

You put your boots on
You put your boots on
And all the boys and girls sing

(Na na na na na na) Straight out of West London
(Na na na na na na) Just like a loaded gun
(Na na na na na na) The cognoscenti don't like us
Don't like us
(Na na na na na na) We'll hit the strip tonight
(Na na na na na na) Your eyes are burning so bright
(Na na na na na na) Can't you feel the blood rush baby?
Tied up too tight
Whoa oh-oh-oh oh oh
Tell me, can ya feel it?
Feel the city breathing
Feel its beating heart
No superstition
Just cold ambition
It's time to make our mark, oh

You put your boots on
You put your boots on
And all the boys and girls sing

(Na na na na na na) Straight out of West London
(Na na na na na na) Just like a loaded gun
(Na na na na na na) The cognoscenti don't like us
Don't like us
(Na na na na na na) We'l hit the strip tonight
(Na na na na na na) Your eyes are burning so bright
(Na na na na na na) Can't you feel the blood rush baby?
Tied up too tight

Tied up too tight
Tied up too tight, tight
Yeah, say something
You put your boots on
You gotta move on
And all the boys and girls sing
(Na na na na na na) Straight out of West London
(Na na na na na na) Just like a loaded gun
(Na na na na na na) The cognoscenti, they don't (Don't like us)
They don't (Like us), So what?
(Na na na na na na) We'll hit the strip tonight
(Na na na na na na) Your eyes are burning so bright
(Na na na na na na) Can't you feel the blood rush baby?
Tied up too tight
Whoa oh-oh-oh oh oh
Tied up too tight
Whoa oh-oh-oh oh oh
Tied up too tight
Whoa oh-oh-oh oh oh
Tied up too tight
Whoa oh-oh-oh oh oh
Tied up too tightEmbed
