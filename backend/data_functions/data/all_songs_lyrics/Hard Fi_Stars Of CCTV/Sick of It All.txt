Sick of It All Lyrics
I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it all

In every paper I read
It says who's sleeping around
Don't mean nothing to me
I think it's bringing me down

Shut up, shut up (Yeah, it's impossible)
Shut up, shut up
I'm sick of it all
Shut up, shut up
Gonna get a fireball and let it rip
Gonna take out everything I hate, it makes me sick
I feel like nothing's real

Everything on TV
Cult of celebrity
Making some monkey a star
It don't mean nothing to me
Just shut up, shut up (Yeah, it's impossible)
Shut up, shut up
I'm sick of it all
Shut up, shut up
Gonna get a fireball and let it rip
Gonna take out everything I hate, it makes me sick
I feel like nothing's real

Are you talking to me
What are you trying to say?
You know I don't give a damn
You know you make me this way

Just shut up, shut up (Yeah, it's impossible)
Shut up, shut up
I'm sick of it all
Shut up, shut up
Gonna get a fireball and let it rip
Gonna take out everything I hate, it makes me sick
I feel like nothing's real

I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it allEmbed
