Stars of CCTV Lyrics
And every move that I make
Gets recorded to tape
So somebody up there
Can keep me safe

I'm going out tonight
I've got my hair just right
I'm always looking good
For my spotlight

Stick 'em up
Give me the money
A winning smile
Up to the gallery
I'm gonna get my face on the 6 o'clock news

We're the stars of CCTV
Making movies out on the street
We're the stars of CCTV
Can't you see the camera loves me?

On every corner, every street
Down every underpass you'll see
Somebody's stealing the show
Somebody looking like me
I'll see you out tonight
Just got the pose just right
We're always looking good
For the spotlight

We turn it on
And so effortlessly
We fill the screen
Can't help but notice me
I'm gonna get my face on the 6 o'clock news

We're the stars of CCTV
Making movies out on the street
Flashing blue lights, camera, action
Watching my life, main attraction
We're the stars of CCTV
Can't you see the camera loves me?
We're the stars of CCTV
Making movies out on the street
Flashing blue lights, camera, action
Watching my life, main attraction
We're the stars of CCTV
Can't you see the camera loves me?Embed
