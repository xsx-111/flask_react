Living for the Weekend Lyrics
Oh, I've been working all week, I'm tired
Yeah, I've been working all week and I'm
Just living for the weekend
Hey hey
Got some money, I just got paid
Got some money and I can't wait
At 6 o'clock, I'm out of here

Out there tonight is the night of my life, got my name on
Run down my street, Adidas on my feet
I'm on fire

Working all the time, work is such a bind
Got some money to spend, living for the weekend
When it gets too much, I live for the rush
Got some money to spend, living for the weekend

Oh man!
Yeah, I've been working all week, I'm shot
Yeah, I've been working all week, for what?
Just living for the weekend
Ah shit!
So my clothes are all counterfeit
So my name isn't on the list
"No you can't come in, so go home boys!"
Slip round the back look at that, there's a cracked toilet window
Drop to the floor
Covers us through the door
I'm on fire

Working all the time, work is such a bind
Got some money to spend, living for the weekend
When it gets too much, I live for the rush
Got some money to spend, living for the weekend

Can you feel it?
Feel the pressure... rising
Pushing down on me, oh lord!
Pressure, pressure
Pressure pressure pressure
Feel the pressure, pressure
Pressure, pressure pressure

Living for the weekend
Living for the weekend
Living for the weekend
Living for the weekend
Living for the weekend
Living for the weekend
Living for the weekend
Living for the weekend
Going out tonight, going out tonight
Baby you and I are going out tonight
Going out tonight, going out tonight
Baby you and I are going out tonight
Going out tonight, going out tonight
Baby you and I are going out tonight
Going out tonight, going out tonight
Baby you and I are going out tonight1Embed
