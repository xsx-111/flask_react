Move On Now Lyrics
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now

Looking out my bedroom window
See the planes take off from Heathrow
One by one they come and go
On and on, on and on
I think about the places I'd go
Think about this place I call home
All the shots and all that come
All around, all around

Red light blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
Red light blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now

Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Don't you think it's quiet around here
Doesn't seem so much to do here
Think back to this time last year
Good times, good times, good times
Don't you think we stayed far too long
Don't you think the colour has gone
Get on a plane, it can't be wrong
Moving on, moving on

Red light blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
Red light blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now

Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
Baby baby
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Dance halls are empty
The clubs are all closed down
Nothing's going on 'round here
It's time we left town
Got a feeling, my love
We've gotta get out
Before it brings us down, down, downEmbed
