The Control Freak LyricsInto the retrofit past - Turn the corner
The voice in my head barks its selfless orders
And the nylon leash gets just a little shorter
And I wonder who the invisible bondsman is
Over shoulder, checking to see if anyone is watching
Against the bonds of what I cannot do, what I cannot
And I know that I will remain shut in
Because the metal door is locked from the inside
It's just me and myself against the world
It's just a flat out refusal
And so my superiority and privilege lies dashed to pieces
On the cold, stone floor, mixed with the horrific runoff
From what is no longer my freedom, my laziness
My violence, my freedom, my fucked freedom, mine
That freedom which so many love
The freedom I choose to pursue no more
And I see just how perverse that "freedom" is
The fists and blood money stay in my hip pockets
And I show that my hands aren't inherently violent
And I realize how beautiful these Chinese handcuffs are
These Chinese handcuffs
These Chinese handcuffs
These Chinese handcuffs
These Chinese handcuffs
And it's just me, me, me
Just a control freak
Me, me, me
Just a control freak
Me, me, me
Just a control freak
Me, me, me
Just a control freakEmbed
