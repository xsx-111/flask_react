KQED Equals Volvo LyricsA little closer to home one - who's distant
A sick look glazed over my repression
Humbly I'm dismissed with no warning
A sick look glazed over my repression
Humbly I'm dismissed with no warning
Momentary bliss
You can see the look on my face
Momentary bliss
You can see the look on my face
Say, nothing's said
I wish you'd fight me till the last teardrop's bled
Say, nothing's said
I wish you'd fight me till the last teardrop's bled
Momentary bliss
I can see the look on your face
Momentary bliss
I can see the look on your face, and I just can't waitEmbed
