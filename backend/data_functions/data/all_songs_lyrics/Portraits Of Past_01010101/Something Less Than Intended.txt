Something Less Than Intended LyricsRemember those ideals, mom and dad? We're them
Remember carefree friendship? Oh, those great times
Living like the stars, just playing with our hearts, how cute
Predestined, predestined, I'm predestined
Let's play scapegoat, let's play martyr
Pretty intention, pretty intention
Let's be the living dead
Okay, I'm going to fuck you over now
It's like I'm living someone else's life
Okay, I'm going to fuck you over now
But I know, I'm just not "them"
Flashy packaging leads me to believe in the novelty
Of my own being
Evolving into enemy, into trash, into self
Look at this hand, would I ever hurt someone?
But the tongue will brand regardless
Looking in the mirror, I'd trust that face
Prusing for reflection, you'd be a fool too
Looking in the mirror, I'd trust that face
Prusing for reflection, you'd be a fool tooEmbed
