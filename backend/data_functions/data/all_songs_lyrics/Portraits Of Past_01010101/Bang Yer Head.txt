Bang Yer Head LyricsLower your voice and be recognized
I, of course, see no reason to reply
Give me my just deserts and give me my...
That proof
Remain closed to all of those who
Dare to remain unchanged by your words
Pull back the hammer and take aim
And shoot yourself in the foot
And shoot everyone else in the foot
And the credit seems to be all yours
And you're sure of yourself once more
(And all could be dismissed with, "Whatever, it's cool," and you could argue that it must be good or violent or irrelevant, but it isn't really any of those, and I guess I hate that attitude more than anything.)
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't shoot
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't shoot
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't show
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't shoot, don't show
Don't show
Push harder, the plastic forks under my nails
Things don't turn like this even in our wildest dreams
Tell me, what is that smile?
What is that smile on your face supposed to mean?
"We both know I've got those thoughts and words too, too, too
But I guess I just don't give them use"
"We both know I've got those thoughts and words too, too, too
("Go back where you came from, I don't care, please go right now")
But I guess I just don't give them use, use, use, use"
("I wish I could but I seem to have forgotten how")
"Go back where you came from, I don't care, please go right now"
"I wish I could but I seem to have forgotten how"
There are a few truths
And here's just one:
I'm as fucked up
About as much as you're fucked up
But, beyond that, there are only grasped straws
And our own private perceived flaws
Where's that gun?
We should both use it
Doomed from the start
Committed to failure
Simply mirrors all?
Rejected selves live to fall1Embed
