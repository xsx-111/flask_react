Snicker Snicker LyricsWould become
Lulled to sleep
Would become
Lulled to sleep
Would become
Lulled to sleep
Would become
Lulled to sleep
It always works that way
It always works that way
It always works that way
It always works that way
Bullets in control, watch out for your
Uniform in control, watch out for those
Stray bullets in control, watch for those
Bullets in control, watch out for your
Stray bullets
Tongue tied
Those outside define everything
High beams
My dark side is everything
Tongue tied
Those outside define everything
High beams
My dark side is everything
No wonder high use
Of black plastic eye shields
No one leaves the house
Without a kevlar skinsuit
Tongue tied
Those outside define everything
High beams
My dark side is everything
Let's not pretend any longer
A weapon, open grave, our desire
Just maybe a simple little glance
Whose eyes are glued to your head?
Just maybe a simple little glance
Whose eyes are glued to your head?
And we keep saying fuck you
And they keep right on looking
But I will not say one word, no
I won't say one fucking word, no
And we keep saying fuck you
And they keep right on looking
But I will not say one word, no
I won't say one fucking word, noEmbed
