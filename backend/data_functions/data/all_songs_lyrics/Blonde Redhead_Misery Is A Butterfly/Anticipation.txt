Anticipation LyricsAnticipate and evaluate
What he thought
And what I thought before
You're broken like me
Like me before
Dark place is your place
I take dark drive to your place
You're staring me
You're staring me with your inside eyes
Knowing you, knowing me
We're deeply sorry
You're broken maybe baby
Maybe it didn't happen
Maybe all of this would go away
And if we're ever young again
He'll anticipate
We'll evaluateEmbed
