Maddening Cloud LyricsSure you can look back
If it means moving on
And you can take me back
But you must come home
We are both a in maddening cloud
And you can touch me there
Just don't leave me alone
And you can call me softly
When I dream and ask for more
You can slow and fold and mold my mind
And she said
I can't feel my toes
And she must be alone
And far too cold
And he stares
Like he doesn't see
He must be scared
And far too lost
Under and over
We must have glanced
Face to face
We've had to dance
We're both in a maddening cloud
Sure you can step back
If it means moving on
And you take me back
But you must be alone
You can choke and smoke and rock my mindEmbed
