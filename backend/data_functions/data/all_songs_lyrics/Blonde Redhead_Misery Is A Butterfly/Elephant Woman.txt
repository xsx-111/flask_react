Elephant Woman LyricsAngel I can see myself in your eyes
Angel won't you feel for me from your heart
Do return my heart to me
No don't insist I'm already hurt
Elephant girl
It was an accident unfortunate
Angel threw me like a rubber man
Aiming for the ground
Why amuse yourself in such a way
No don't insist I'm already hurt
Lay me down on the ground softly softly
Don't remove my head hurts much too much
You never return it
Well I wouldn't miss it
I shed no tears for broken me
You never know it my peace of mind
Now inside and outside are matching
If you never return it
Will it break your wings
Will you shed no tears for broken me7Embed
