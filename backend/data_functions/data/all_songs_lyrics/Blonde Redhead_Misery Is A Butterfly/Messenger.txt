Messenger LyricsStay still, do be still
No wonder you are always lost
If a messenger you must be known
Then with messages you must return
To be seen by demanding hands
And touches of jealous men
Invisible and forgivable
To all their secret hands
Be it so be quick
Don't run just walk and walk and walk
Don't lose yourself to decorate
Somewhere on your wall
Cause somewhere in your mind
You know you are doing fine
Holding secret hair locks
You'll pluck before you hide
So how can I keep anything to myself
So how can I keep any of these things to myself
So how can I keep anything to myself 
Behind those clouds
I'm almost homeEmbed
