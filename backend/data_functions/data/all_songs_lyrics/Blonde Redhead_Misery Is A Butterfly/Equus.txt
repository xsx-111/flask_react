Equus LyricsAllow me to show you
The way which I adore you
Sometimes I think I must
Just let you be a horse
All I want is to be a rider
To be part of you
Afraid so afraid
To lose you
If someone looks at you
Turn into donkey
Pretend you are lame
Equus by nature
Timid creature
Ready to run away
Equus by nature
Timid creature
Cares nothing
For the plans they made
I will hide you
Will protect you
Won't let anyone
Take you awayEmbed
