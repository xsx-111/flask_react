Doll Is Mine LyricsMine is an act of love
Mine is a wish to solve
And mine is to sink by your side
You are to be amused
And you are never to be confused
In your first love
Your first time
Why a doll so they tell me
Cause she is mine
Faith and fully mine
I must say
This love hasn't changed me
Cause I feel fine
Faith and fully fine
I must have seen too much skin
Much more than I needed to win
And much more than I wanted to dream
I must have felt so much pain
It's funny how some things do remain
It isn't true that things do change
Isn't it strange how pain remains
But don't look sad cause it isn't sad
Now that I have you to myselfEmbed
