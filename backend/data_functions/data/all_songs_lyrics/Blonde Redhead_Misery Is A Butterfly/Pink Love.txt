Pink Love Lyrics
I won't bind my strings to you
But build my world besides you
Watching you draw a line
Some say you are, you are
Just like a butterfly
Whose broken wings will spread
To softly feel your mood
Over the blue blue sky full of you
Pink love, pink love, pink love
Just like a fairytale

My only reason naturally
Starts to get to me
Pushing my way through
Mesh of life
I want to kiss the sickness of mind
My heart without reason
Sunken to deep disappointment
Spreads over universe
With a knife
I want to bleed out distress like this

It's not just a fairytale
It's painted by me
It's not just a loneliness between you and I
If on magic mountain, you find you can breathe
Then stay and don't look back
To the blue woven sky
Storms of petals are pouring down
Pushing their way through our pink love
So many polka dots painted by me
Spreads over universe for you
And I, I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love
Now I, I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love
Whu-huh-oh
In my mind
I state myself
The clock is ticking without you
Some may say illness
So called, so called love
The sickness of mind

It's not just a fairytale
It's painted by me
It's not just a loneliness between you and I
If on magic mountain, you find you can breath
Then stay, don't look back
To the blue woven sky

Storms of petals are pouring down
Pushing their way through our pink love
So many polka dots painted by me
Spreads over universe for you
And I, I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love
Now I, I want to kiss
Pink love, pink love
Uh-oh
Ohhh
Kisss
