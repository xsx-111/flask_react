Falling Man LyricsTell me how you seek your man
And tell me all your secret spells
Tell me how you learn
To tell by his voice that he fell
I know a ghost will walk through walls
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
Try to re-imagine me
And I'll re-invent myself
Still I remember scenes
Of when you looked at someone else
I know a ghost can walk through the wall
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
If you start doubting me
Then I start to doubt myself
And never look through me
Cause I'll keep close to myself
I know a ghost can walk through the wall
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
I am what I am
And what I am is who I am
I know what I know
And all I know is that I fell
If only I could walk through walls
Then maybe I would tell you who I was
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fallEmbed
