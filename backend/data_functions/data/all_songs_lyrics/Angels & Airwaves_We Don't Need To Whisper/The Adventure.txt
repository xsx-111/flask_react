The Adventure Lyrics
I wanna have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Just as the four walls close me within
My eyes are opened up with pure sunlight
I'm the first to know my dearest friends
Even if your hope has burned with time
Anything that's dead shall be re-grown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
You will be fine

Hey oh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin

Any type of love - it will be shown
Like every single tree reach for the sky
If you're gonna fall, I'll let you know
That I will pick you up, like you for I
I felt this thing I can't replace
Where everyone was working for this goal
Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back, as pure as gold
To recite this all
Hey oh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Tonight
Hey oh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Tonight
Hey oh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin

I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me

Hey oh, here I am (do this with me)
And here we go, life's waiting to begin (do this with me)
Hey oh, here I am (do this with me)
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Life's waiting to begin6Embed
