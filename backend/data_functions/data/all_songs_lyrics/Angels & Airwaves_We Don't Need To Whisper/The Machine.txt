The Machine Lyrics
The ash set in and blew away
It's getting lost into the sea
I grew so close to all the thoughts I had to leave forever
I left the chill and voice the screams in kids and ran for shelter
You know I won't say sorry
Do you know I won't say sorry?
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
Do you know what it's like to believe?
It makes me wanna scream
I see a glow from far away
A faint reflection on the sea
I left some words quite far from here to be a short reminder
I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever
You know I won't say sorry
Do you know I won't say sorry?
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
Do you know what it's like to believe?
It makes me wanna scream
You know what it's like to believe...
It makes me wanna screamEmbed
