The War Lyrics
The ocean is on fire
The sky turned dark again as the boats came in
And the beaches, stretched out with soldiers
With their arms and guns, it has just begun

Believe, you want this
Believe, I want this too

Why won't you tell me that it's almost over?
Why must this tear my head inside out?

And the houses, laid out like targets
With the deafening sound, we watched them all go down
And the families, now useless bodies
They lay still black and blue, a gift from us to you

Believe, you want this?
Believe, do I want this too?

Why won't you tell me that it's almost over?
Why must this tear my head inside out?
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh (Believe)
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh (Believe, you want this too)
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

Why won't you tell me that it's almost over?
Why must this tear my head inside out?
Why won't you tell me that it's almost over?
Why must this tear my head inside out?

Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh2Embed
