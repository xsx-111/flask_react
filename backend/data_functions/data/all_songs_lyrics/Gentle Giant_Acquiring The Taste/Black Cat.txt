Black Cat LyricsThere's a cat prowling through the streets at night
And she's black and her eyes are burning yellow
Fierce and bright the lights are darkened
Senses sharpened, wide awake
As she acts out her past of Jungle days
When the night was her friend in many other
Different ways it gave protection
Of detection by her prey
With a sway and swing she walks away
And the look in her eye it never ever seems
To say the way she's feeling
No revealing Black Cat WaysEmbed
