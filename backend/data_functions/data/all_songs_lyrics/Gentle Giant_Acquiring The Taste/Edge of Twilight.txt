Edge of Twilight Lyrics
The moon is down
Casting its shadow over the night-haunted town
Mystical figures under the silence of light
The trembling air
Drifts slowly unseen over the houses there
And echoes changing into the voices of night

(On the edge of twilight whispering
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
On the edge of twilight whispering
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper)

Elusive time
In limbo active in never ending mime
The edge of twilight into the darkness of dayEmbed
