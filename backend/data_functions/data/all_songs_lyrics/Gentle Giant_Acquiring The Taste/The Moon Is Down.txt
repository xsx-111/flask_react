The Moon Is Down LyricsAnd the horse riding up through the red skies
The moon is down
With a gold coloured bird through the cloud flies
The moon is down
Look East to the Sun, Oh where do they run
Look East to the Sun, Oh where do they run
They live in my dreams
In my dreams, in my dreams
And the Moon and the Earth they were mating
The moon is down
And the Angels of hell they were waiting
The moon is down
Oh bride of the winds, Reward for their sins
Oh bride of the winds, Reward for their sins
They live in my dreams
In my dreams, in my dreams
There's a chaos of visions and voices
The moon is down
Sad is the laugh of the clown
Now the old moon is downEmbed
