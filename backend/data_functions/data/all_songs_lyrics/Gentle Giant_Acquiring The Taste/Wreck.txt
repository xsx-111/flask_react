Wreck LyricsThe ship's rising up from the sea to the sky, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
Just one sorry scream and a desperate cry, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
Their lives pass before them before they die (Hey-yea-yeah, hey-hey-yea-yeah, hey-hey-yea-yeah)
The sea yawns around like a boiling hell, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
And souls disappear with the toll of that bell, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
The arms of the sea they are dragging them down (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
And sorrows and sins they are lost as they drown (Hey-yea-yeah, hey-hey-yea-yeah, hey-hey-yea-yeah)
How strange when you think that the sea was their way
And a meaningless death is the price they pay
For their living was made from the deep
To their people in comfort and keep
Keep all their people and places there
Never to be seen again, never to be loved and their last embrace
And the kiss has a salt bitter taste
Now all that remains is the deep cruel sea (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
And wreckage of things that used to be (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
No stone marks the place of that watery grave, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
Together they die both the weak and the brave, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
The arms of the sea they are dragging them down (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
And sorrows and sins they are lost as they drown (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
The sea yawns around like a boiling hell, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
Now all that remains is the deep cruel sea (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
And wreckage of things that used to be (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
No stone marks the place of that watery grave, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
Together they die both the weak and the brave, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
The arms of the sea they are dragging them down (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
And sorrows and sins they are lost as they drown (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)
The sea yawns around like a boiling hell, crying (Hey-yea-yeah, hold on)2Embed
