Plain Truth LyricsWhy do you question
When there's no answer told?
Plain truth is nothing
You can't buy it when it's sold
Save all your money
And they won't reason why
Why all the worry?
They'll spend it when you die
Don't look for something
Plain truth is nothing
Nothing but the plain truth
You stand and wonder
Just let it warm your skin
Take all the living
Live life and let it win
Plain truth means nothing
Cry, laugh and cry again
You question answers
Born, live and die, Amen
Don't look for something
Plain truth is nothing
Nothing but the plain truth
Why do you question
When there's no answer told?
Plain truth is nothing
You can't buy it when it's sold
Save all your money
And they won't reason why
Why all the worry?
They'll spend it when you die
Don't look for something
Plain truth is nothing
Nothing but the plain truthEmbed
