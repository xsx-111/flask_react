Gravedigger (acoustic) Lyrics
Cyrus Jones, 1810 to 1913
He made his great grandchildren believe
He could live to a hundred and three
A hundred and three is forever
When you're just a little kid
So Cyrus Jones lived forever

Gravedigger, when you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger

Muriel Stonewall, 1903 to 1954
She lost both of her babies in the second great war
You should never have to watch
As your only children lowered in the ground
I mean
Never have to bury your babies


Ring around the rosie
Pocket full of posies
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down

Little Mikey Carson, '67 to '75
He rode his bike like the devil
Until the day he died
When he grows up he wants to be
Mister Vertigo on the flying trapeze
Or 1940 to 1992
