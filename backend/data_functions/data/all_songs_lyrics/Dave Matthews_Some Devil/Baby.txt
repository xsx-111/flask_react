Baby Lyrics
Baby, it's alright
Stop your crying now

Nothing is here to stay
Everything has to begin and end
Like a ship in a bottle won't sail
All we can do is dream that the wind
Will blow us across the water
A ship in the bottle set sail

Baby, it's alright
Stop your crying now

There was a weakling man
Who dreamed he was strong as a hurricane
A ship in a bottle sets sail
He took a deep breath and blew across the world
He watched everything crumble
Woke up a weakling again

Some might tell you there's no hope in hell
Just because they feel hopeless
But you don't have to be a thing like that
You be a ship in a bottle set sail
Baby, it's alright
Stop your crying now
It's alright
So stop your crying now
Be a ship in a bottle set sailEmbed
