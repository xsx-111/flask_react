Stay Or Leave Lyrics
May be different but remember
Winters warm there you and I
Kissing whiskey by the fire
With the snow outside
And the summer comes, in the river
Swims at midnight, shiver cold
Touch the bottom you and I
With muddy toes

Stay or leave
I want you not to go
But you should
It was good as good goes
Stay or leave
I want you not to go
But you did

Wake up naked drinking coffee
Making plans to change the world
While the world is changing us
It was good good love
We used to laugh under the covers
Maybe not so often now
The way I used to laugh with you
Was loud and hard

So what to do
With the rest of today's afternoon?
Isn't it strange how we change
Everything we did?
Did I do all that I should
That I could'a done?

Remember we used to dance
And everyone wanted to be you and me?
I want to be, too
What day is this
Besides the day you left me?
What day is this
Besides the day you went?

Oh what to do
With the rest of the day's afternoon?
Hey isn't it strange how we change
Everything we did?
Did I do all that I could?
Remember we used to dance
And everyone wanted to be you and me?
I want to be, too
What day is this
Besides the day you left, baby?
What day is this?8Embed
