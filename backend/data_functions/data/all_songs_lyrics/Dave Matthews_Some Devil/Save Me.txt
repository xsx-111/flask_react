Save Me Lyrics
Driving through the desert
I met a man who told me of his crazy plan
He'd been walking there for twenty days
He was gonna walk on for twenty more
I said, "How 'bout a drink or a bite to eat?"
He said, "No, my faith is all I need"

I said, "Then save me, save me
Mr. Walking Man, if you can"

You don't need to prove a thing to me
Just give me faith
Make me believe

Come on, save me, save me
Mr. Walking Man, if you can
Come on, save me, save me
Stranger, if you please
Save me, save me
Stranger, if you please
Or am I too far gone
To get back home?
To get back home?
How 'bout you take a ride with me?
We could kill some time or shoot the breeze
He said, "Every whispering wind and second counts "
Brother, maybe if you walk
But you should drive around

Come on, save me, save me
Mr. Walking man, if you can
Come on, save me, save me
Stranger, if you please
Save me, save me
Stranger if you please
Or am I too far gone
To get back home?
To get back home?

I don't need you to turn off the sunshine, no
I don't need you to turn water into wine, no
I'm not asking you to fly
I'm just asking you to save me

(You might try saving yourself)
Save me
(You might try saving yourself)
I swear those lips shine
(You might try saving yourself)
As if the moon shine
(You might try saving yourself)
Why don't you save me?
(You might try saving yourself)
Come on and save me
(You might try saving yourself)
(You might try saving yourself)
Why don't you save me?
(You might try saving yourself)
Why don't you save me?
Save me
Save me
(Oh you gotta save yourself
May try, may try
May try, may try
May try, may try
May try, may try
May try, may try
To save yourself)1Embed
