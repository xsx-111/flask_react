So Damn Lucky Lyrics
Everything's different
My head in the clouds
I hit this corner
My foot on the gas
I started sliding
I'm losing
Everything's different
Just like that

Oh my God, wait and see
What will soon become of me
This frozen heart
And screaming wheels
Does that screaming come from me?

So damn lucky
That you went on ahead
You said, you said
I'll see you later
I heard what you said, a few minutes later
I'm sliding
Everything's different again
Oh my god, wait and see
What will soon become of me
This frozen heart
And screaming wheels
Does that screaming come from me?
I'm dizzy from all this spinning

Now I'm thinking that you did all you could
When you said, "My love
Take it slowly
"Okay," is what I said

Oh my god, wait and see
What will soon become of me
This frozen heart
And screaming wheels
Does that screaming come from me?

Take me back
To just before I was spinning
Take me back
Just before I got dizzy
Take me back
Amazing what a minute can do
Just like you
Around around around…
Amazing what a minute can do…
"Okay"
Is what I saidEmbed
