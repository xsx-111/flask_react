Grey Blue Eyes Lyrics
I fade from the light
Your glory was lost that night
And no mind can't get me right
And now I'm praying that you'll find me out
Stone, stone has pulled me down
But my faith has got me bound to your grey blue eyes

Don't forget my broken heart
You remember it from the start
You made it and it's all a part
Of your grey blue eyes

You're gone and I know I'm dead
I've lost my way, can't find it
In your grey blue eyesEmbed
