Dodo Lyrics
Once upon a time
When the world was just a pancake
Fears would arise
That if you went too far, you'd fall

But with the passage of time
It all became more of a ball
We're as sure of that
As we all once were when the world was flat

So I wonder this
As life billows smoke inside my head
This little game
Where nothing is sure
Why would you play by the rules?

Who did?
You did, you
Who did?
You did, you

When was she killed
The very last dodo bird?
And was she aware
She was the very last one?
So I wonder this
As life billows smoke inside my head
This little game
Where nothing is sure
Why would play by the rules?

Who did?
You did, you
Who did?
You did, you
Who did?
You did, you

If all the things that you are saying now
Were true enough well still
What is all the worrying about?
We can work it out
We can work it

Oh I wonder this
As life billows smoke inside my head
This little game
Where nothing is sure
Why would you play by the rules?
Who did?
You did, you
Who did?
You did, you
Who did?
You did, youEmbed
