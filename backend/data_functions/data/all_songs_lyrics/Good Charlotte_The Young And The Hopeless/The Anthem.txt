The Anthem Lyrics
Yeah...
Here we go...

It's a new day, but it all feels old
"It's a good life!" That's what I'm told
But everything, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

"Go to college or university
Get a real job!" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'Cause I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You! Don't wanna be you!

You shake it once, that's fine
You shake it twice, that's okay
You shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again


You! Don't wanna be just like you!
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
You! Don't wanna be just like you (Be just like you!)
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh)
Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh)
Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh)
Another loser anthem!18Embed
