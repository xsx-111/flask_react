Say Anything Lyrics

Here I am on the
Phone again and
Awkward silence is on
The other end
I used to know the sound of a smile
In your voice
But right now, but right now, all I feel, all I feel
Is the pain of the fighting starting up again

All the things we talked about
You know they stay on my mind, on my mind
All the things we laugh about
They'll bring us through it every time, after time, after time

Don't say a word, I know you feel the same
Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything
Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay
If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything

Some say that time changes
Best friends can become strangers
But I don't want that, no, not for you
If you just stay with me, we could make it through
So here we are again, the same old argument
Now I'm wondering if things will ever change, yeah
When will you laugh again? Laugh like you did back when
We'd make noise until 3 A.M., and the neighbors would complain
All the things we talked about
You know they stay on my mind, on my mind
All the things we laugh about
They'll bring us through it every time, after time, after time

Don't say a word, I know you feel the same
Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything
Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay
If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything

I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down
Down, down, down...

Don't say a word, I know you feel the same
Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything
Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay
If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything

(Please...) Don't say a word, I know you feel the same
(Don't go...) Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything
(Please...) Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay
(Don't go...) If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything...Embed
