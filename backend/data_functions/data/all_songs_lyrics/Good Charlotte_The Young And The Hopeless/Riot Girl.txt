Riot Girl Lyrics
She's got tattoos and piercings
She likes Minor Threat, she likes Social Distortion
My girl's a hot girl
A hood ride who needs an attitude adjustment

Christina, wouldn't want to meet her
She hates you, Britney, so you better run for cover
My girl's a hot girl
A riot girl and she's angry at the world

Emergency, call 911, she's pissed off at everyone
Police rescue, F.B.I., she wants a riot, she wants a riot

And everywhere we go, she gets us thrown out constantly
But that's okay, 'cause I know, I know, I know
My baby would do anything for me
Yeah!

Christina, wouldn't want to meet her
She hates you, Britney, so you'd better run for cover
My girl's a hot girl
A riot girl, and she's taking on the world
Emergency, call 911, she's pissed off at everyone
Police rescue, F.B.I., she wants a riot, she wants a riot

She wants a riot, she wants a riot

Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh...
(Oh, oh, oh...) Don't you know that all I really want is you?
(Oh, oh, oh...) Got it all and all I really want is you

Emergency, call 911, she's pissed off at everyone
Police rescue, F.B.I., she wants a riot, she wants a riot

Emergency, call 911, she wants a riot, she wants a riot
Police rescue, F.B.I., she wants a riot, she wants a riotEmbed
