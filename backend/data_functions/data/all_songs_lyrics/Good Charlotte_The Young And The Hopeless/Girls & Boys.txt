Girls & Boys Lyrics
Educated with money
He's well dressed, not funny

And not much to say in most conversations
But he'll foot the bill in all situations
'Cause he pays for everything

Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls
When they're not funny

Paper or plastic
Don't matter, she'll have it
Vacations and shopping sprees
These are a few of her favorite things

She'll get what she wants if she's willing to please
His type of girl always comes with a fee
Hey, now, there's nothing for free
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls
When they're not funny

And these girls like these boys, like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with Ferraris
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money

Let's go!
Hey, hey!


Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls
When they're not funny

And these girls like these boys, like these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies like boys with Ferrari's
Girls don't like boys
Girls like cars and money
All of these boys, yeah, and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys, yeah, and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys, yeah, and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world
All of these boys, yeah, and all of these girls
Losing their souls in a material world...4Embed
