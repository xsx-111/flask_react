Emotionless Lyrics
Hey, Dad, I'm writing to you
Not to tell you that I still hate you
Just to ask you how you feel
And how we fell apart, how this fell apart

Are you happy out there in this great wide world?
Do you think about your sons? Do you miss your little girl?
When you lay your head down, how do you sleep at night?
Do you even wonder if we're alright?

If we're alright
We're alright

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried?
You broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for life
It's not okay, but we're alright
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
The days I spent so cold, so hungry
Were full of hate, I was so angry
The scars run deep inside this tattooed body
There's things I'll take to my grave

But I'm okay
I'm okay

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried?
You broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for life
It's not okay, but we're alright
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive

Yeah, I'm still alive...

Sometimes I forgive, yeah, and this time, I'll admit
That I miss you, said, "I miss you..."
It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried?
You broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for life
It's not okay, but we're all right
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive

And sometimes I forgive, yeah, and this time, I'll admit
That I miss you, said, "I miss you..." Hey, Dad...2Embed
