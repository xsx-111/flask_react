The Story of My Old Man Lyrics
I don't know too much about, too much of my old man
I know he walked right out the door, we never saw him again
Last I heard, he was at the bar doing himself in
I know I've got that same disease, I guess I got that from him

This is the story of my old man
Just like his father before him
I'm telling you, do anything you can
So you don't end up just like them, like them

Monday, he woke up and hated life
Drank until Wednesday and left his wife
Thursday through Saturday, lost everything
Woke up on Sunday miserable again

I remember baseball games and working on the car
He told that he loved me and that I would go far
Showed me how to work hard and stick up for myself
I wish he wasn't too hard to listen to himself

This is the story of my old man
Just like his father before him
I'm telling you, do anything you can
So you don't end up just like them, like them
Monday, he woke up and hated life
Drank until Wednesday and left his wife
Thursday through Saturday, lost everything
Woke up on Sunday miserable again...

Again...
Again...


Someday he'll wish that he made things right (Made things right)
Long for his family and miss his wife (Miss his wife)
Remember the days he had everything (Everything)
Now he's alone and miserable againEmbed
