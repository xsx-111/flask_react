My Bloody Valentine Lyrics
Oh, my love, please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life

I ripped out his throat
And called you on the telephone
To take off my disguise
Just in time to hear you cry when you

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time, singing

Oh, my love, please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
I don't know much at all, I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that I love you tonight

There was police and flashing lights
The rain came down so hard that night
And the headlines read, "A lover died..."
No tell-tale heart was left to find when you
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time, singing

Oh, my love, please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
I don't know much at all, I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that I love you tonight

Tonight...

He dropped you off, I followed him home
Then I stood outside his bedroom window
Standing over him, he begged me not to do
What I knew I had to do, because I'm so in love with you

Oh, my love, please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
I don't know much at all, I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that I love you tonight...
Tonight!
