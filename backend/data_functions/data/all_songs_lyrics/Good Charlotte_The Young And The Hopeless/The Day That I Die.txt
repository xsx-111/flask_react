The Day That I Die Lyrics
One day, I woke up, I woke up knowing
Today is the day I will die
Ca$hDogg was barking, went to the park
And enjoyed it one last time
I called my mother, told her I loved her
And I begged her not to cry
I wrote a letter, I said I'd miss her
And I signed that goodbye

You know, the happiest day of my life
I swear, the happiest day of my life is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (The day that I die...)
It sets in, but it's alright (The day that I die...)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (The day that I die...)
All alone, but I feel fine (The day that I die...)

We took a drive and we drove through DC
To see the places we lived
Long conversations, we talked of old friends
And all the things that we did
The summer nights, drunken fights
Mistakes we made, did we live it right?
You know, the happiest day of my life
I swear, the happiest day of my life is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (The day that I die...)
It sets in, but it's alright (The day that I die...)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (The day that I die...)
All alone, but I feel just fine...


You know, the happiest day of my life
I know the happiest day of my life
I swear, the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (The day that I die...)
It sets in, but it's alright (The day that I die...)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (The day that I die...)
All alone, but I feel fine...
Did I live it right? I hope I lived it right (The day that I die...)
Did I live it right? (The day that I die...)
Did I live it right? I hope I lived it right (The day that I die...)
I know I lived it right... (The day that I die...)

Good boy...2Embed
