Wondering Lyrics
If you want me to wait, I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay, I would stay right through
If you don't want to say anything at all
I'm happy wondering

Go! Yeah, yeah!

Since I was a young man, I never was a fun man
I never had a plan and no security then
Ever since I met you, I never could forget you
I only want to get you right here next to me

Because everybody (a-wha-oh-oh)
Needs someone that they can trust and
You're somebody (a-wha-oh-oh)
That I found just in time

If you want me to wait, I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay, I would stay right through
If you don't want to say anything at all
I'm happy wondering
Now my life is changing, it's always rearranging
It's always getting stranger than I thought it ever could
Ever since I found you, I want to be around you
I want to get down to the point that I need you

Because everybody (a-wha-oh-oh)
Needs someone that they can trust and
You're somebody (a-wha-oh-oh)
That I found just in time

If you want me to wait, I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay, I would stay right through
If you don't want to say anything at all
I'm happy wondering

Go! Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!

Don't tell me the bad news
Don't tell me anything at all
Just tell me that you need me
And stay right here with me
If you want me to wait, I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay, I would stay right through
If you don't want to say anything at all
I'm happy wondering

If you want me to wait, I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay, I would stay right through
If you don't want to say anything at all
I'm happy wondering...1Embed
