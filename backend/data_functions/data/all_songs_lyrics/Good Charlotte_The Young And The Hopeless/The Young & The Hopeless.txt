The Young & The Hopeless Lyrics
Hard days made me, hard nights shaped me
I don't know, they somehow saved me
And I know I'm making something
Out of this life they called nothing

I take what I want, take what I need
They say it's wrong, but it's right for me
I won't look down, won't say I'm sorry
I know that only God can judge me

And if I make it through the day, will tomorrow be the same?
Am I just running in place?
And if I stumble and I fall, should I get up and carry on?
Will it all just be the same?

Because I'm young, and I'm hopeless, I'm lost, and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast, that's what they say
I'm troublesome, I'm fallen, I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world, and I don't care

I don't care...
And no one in this industry understands the life I lead
When I sing about my past, it's not a gimmick, not an act
These critics and these trust fund kids try to tell me what punk is
But when I see them on the streets, they got nothing to say

And if I make it through the day, will tomorrow be the same?
Am I just running in place?
And if I stumble and I fall, should I get up and carry on?
Will it all just be the same?

Because I'm young, and I'm hopeless, I'm lost, and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast, that's what they say
I'm troublesome, I'm fallen, I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world, and I don't care

I don't care, I don't care, no, I don't care...
Ooh, ooh...


I'm young, and I'm hopeless, I'm lost, and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast, that's what they say
I'm troublesome, I'm fallen, I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world, and I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care...1Embed
