Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous Lyrics

Always see it on T.V.​
Or read in the magazines
Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

Well, did you know if you were famous you could
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​
I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall...

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

Rob them, rob them...


They would fall, fall...

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
You got so many problems, I think I can solve them
Lifestyles of the rich and famous, we'll take your
Clothes, cash, cars, and homes, just stop complaining
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
