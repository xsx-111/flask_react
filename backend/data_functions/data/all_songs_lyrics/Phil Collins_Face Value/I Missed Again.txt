I Missed Again Lyrics
So you finally came right out and said it girl
What took you so long
It was in your eyes
That look's been there for far too long

I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

Did I miss again
I think I missed again, oh

I think about it from time to time
When I'm lonely and on my own
I try to forget and yet
Still rush to the telephone

I'm waiting in line
But would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again
I think I missed again, oh
Oh, I missed again, oh
I think I missed again, oh
Well it feels like something you want so bad
Then you think you've got it, but it's something you already had
And you can feel it all around you, but it's something you just can't touch, oh-ho-ho
And I can feel it coming at me
Yes I can feel it coming at me

Oh, did I miss again
I think I missed again, oh
Oh, I missed again, oh
I think I missed again oh

Seems I'm waiting in line
But would you say if I was wasting my time

Did I miss again
I think I missed again, oh
Oh, I missed again, oh
I think I missed again, oh
Oh, I missed again
I think I missed again, ohEmbed
