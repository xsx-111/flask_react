This Must Be Love Lyrics
It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love

Well I wait in every day, just in case
You decide to call
And I can hardly wait, 'cos I never thought time could pass so slowly


Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again, but now I know
It's you that I've been looking for
And day by day more and more
I know what you think, you've heard it before
Don't tell me I know
But this feeling inside my heart
You know I'm never letting go
Becouse I think that


Words can only say so much
It's hard to express
The things you do to me
You're everything I could ever dreamed you'd be
