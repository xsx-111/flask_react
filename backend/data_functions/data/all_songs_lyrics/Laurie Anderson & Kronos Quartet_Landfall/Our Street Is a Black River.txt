Our Street Is a Black River Lyrics
October 2012
The river had been rising all day
And a hurricane was coming up slowly from the south
We watched as the sparkling black river crossed the park
Then a highway
Then came silently up our street
From above Sandy was a huge swirl
It looked like galaxies
Whose names I didn't knowEmbed
