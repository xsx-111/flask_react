Solitaire LyricsWe're more than overwhelmed
By hundreds of hugs and a million good words
We are satisfied
From monday till friday and on sunday we cry
But we like it
From that point of view
So we stay here and bare until dawn everyday
And we stay here and bare everyday
We never ever lie
From ten in the morning we are honest till nine
We are overcute
We never will manage to be rude only twice
But we like it from
That point of view
So we stay here and bare until dawn everyday
And we stay here and bare everyday
But we like it from
That point of view
So we stay here and bare until dawn everyday
And we stay here and bare everyday1Embed
