Consequence Lyrics
You're the color
You're the movement and the spin
Never
Could it stay with me the whole
Day long
Fail with consequence
Lose with eloquence
And smile
I'm not in this movie
I'm not in this song
Never

Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love

You're the color
You're the movement and the spin
Never
Could it stay with me the whole day long
Fail with consequence
Lose with eloquence
And smile
You're not in this movie
You're not in this song
Never
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, love
Leave me paralyzed, love
Leave me hypnotized, loveEmbed
