One with the Freaks LyricsYou'll no longer be kissed and kind
As you long for intuition
As you have to learn the lesson twice
You'll no longer be kissed and kind
As you long for intuition
As you have to say the password twice
Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?
Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?
You're the pincard
You're the lifeguard
You're the information guy
But things look much bigger
On your knees
On your knees
Miss the signal
Miss the signpost
Lose the access to it all
And all of a sudden
You were one with the freaks
Have you ever?
Have you ever been all messed up?
Have you ever?Embed
