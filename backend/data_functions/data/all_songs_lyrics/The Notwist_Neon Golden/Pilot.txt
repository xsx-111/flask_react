Pilot Lyrics
He's living next the rails
He can tell you things of different cars and trains
Now he's trying the whole day
To switch off time by causing train delay

Could be enough
If only he's the pilot
Once a day
Could be enough
If only he's the pilot
Once a day

Not a word to compensate
Not a sentence to describe this desperate state
Not a picture to compare
Step into the room of opaque air

Could be enough
If only we are pilot
Once a day
Could be enough
If only we are pilot
Once a day
Not a word to compensate
Not a sentence to describe this desperate state
Not a picture to compare
Step into the room of opaque air

Could be enough
If only we are pilot
Once a day
Could be enough
If only we are pilot
Once a day
Could be enough
If only we are pilot
Once a day
Could be enough
If only we are pilot
Once a day2Embed
