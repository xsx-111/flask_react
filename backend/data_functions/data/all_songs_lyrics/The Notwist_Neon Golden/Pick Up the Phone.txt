Pick Up the Phone Lyrics
You know this place
You know this gloom?
We've been here before
When life is a loop
You're in a room without a door

Pick up the phone and answer me at last
Today I will step out of your past

Trouble that we've come to know
Will stay with us
With every step it slowly grows
Rub off the rust

Pick up the phone and answer me at last
Today I will step out of your past


Pick up the phone and answer me at last
Today I will step out of your past
Pick up the phone and answer me at last
Today I will step out of your past
Pick up the phone and answer me at last
Today I will step out of your past
Pick up the phone and answer me at last
Today I will step out of your past3Embed
