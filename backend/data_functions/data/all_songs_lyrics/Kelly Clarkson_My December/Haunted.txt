Haunted Lyrics
Louder, louder
The voices in my head
Whispers taunting
All the things you said
Faster the days go by and I'm still
Stuck in this moment of wanting you here
Time
In the blink of an eye
You held my hand, you held me tight
Now you're gone
And I'm still crying
Shocked, broken
I'm dying inside
(Ooh, inside)

Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me, be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Shadows linger
Only to my eye
I see you, I feel you
Don't leave my side
It's not fair
Just when I found my world
They took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart
I miss you, you hurt me
You left with a smile
Mistaken, your sadness
Was hiding inside
Now all that's left are the pieces to find
The mystery you kept
The soul behind a guise
(Ooh, you were smiling)
Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Why did you go?
All these questions run through my mind
I wish I couldn't feel at all
Let me be numb
I'm starting to fall (To fall)

Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me
Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Where are you?
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

You were smiling
You were smiling
You were smiling1Embed
