Sober Lyrics
And I don't know
This could break my heart or save me
Nothing's real
Until you let go completely

So here I go with all my thoughts
I've been saving
So here I go with all my fears
Weighing on me

Three months
And I'm still sober
Picked all my weeds
But kept the flowers

But I know
It's never really over

And I don't know
I could crash and burn, but maybe
At the end of this road
I might catch a glimpse of me
So I won't worry about my timing
I wanna get it right
No comparing, second guessing
No, not this time

Three months
And I'm still breathing
Been a long road since those
Hands I left my tears in

But I know
It's never really over, no

Three months
And I'm still standing here
Three months
And I'm getting better, yeah
Three months
And I still am
Three months
And it's still harder now
Three months
I've been living here without you now
Three months
Yeah, three months
Three months
And I'm still breathin'
Three months
And I still remember it
Three months
And I wake up

Three months
And I'm still sober
Picked all my weeds
But kept the flowers1Embed
