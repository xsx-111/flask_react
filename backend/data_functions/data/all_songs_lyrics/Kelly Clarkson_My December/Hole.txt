Hole Lyrics
Tired
Of everything around me
I smile
But I don't feel a thing, no

I'm so far from where I need to be
I've given up on faith, on everything
All I want, all I need
Is some peace

There's a hole
Inside of me
It's so cold
Slowly killin' me, yeah

Secrets (Secrets)
Eating at the core of me (Eating at the core of me)
Shut off (Shut off)
Trusting all the lies I breathe

I'm so far from where I need to be
I've given up on faith, on everything
All I wanted, all I needed
Was some peace, yeah
There's a hole
Inside of me
It's so damn cold
Slowly killin' me, yeah

Sinking ever so slowly
So far from where I should be
No hands reaching out for me
Help me, help me
Something's gone
I can feel it
It's all wrong
I'm so sick of this, yeah

There's a hole
Inside of me
It's so cold
Slowly killin' me, yeah
There's a hole (Sinking ever so slowly)
Inside of me (So far from where I should be)
It's so damn cold (No hands reaching out for me)
Slowly killin' me, yeah (Help me, help me)Embed
