Maybe Lyrics
I'm strong, but I break
I'm stubborn, and I make plenty of mistakes
Yeah, I'm hard, and life with me is never easy
To figure out, to love
I'm jaded, but oh so lovely

All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be
If you'll trust me, love me, let me
Maybe, maybe

Someday, when we're at the same place
When we're on the same road
When it's okay to hold my hand, without feeling lost
Without all the excuses

When it's just because you love me, you let me, you need me
Then maybe, maybe

All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be
If you'll trust me, love me, let me
Maybe, maybe
I'm confusing as hell
I'm north and south
And I'll probably never have it all figured out
But what I know is I wasn't meant to walk this world without you
And I promise I'll try
Yeah, I'm gonna try
To give you every little part of me
Every single detail you missed with your eyes
Then maybe
Maybe, yeah, maybe
Yeah, maybe
Maybe, yeah, maybe, maybe

One day, we'll meet again and you'll need me
You'll see me completely
Every little bit
Oh, yeah, maybe you'll love me, you'll love me then

I don't wanna tough
And I don't wanna be proud
I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found
I'm not lost
I need to be loved
I just need to be loved
I just wanna be loved by you and I won't stop 'cause I believe
That maybe, yeah, maybe
Maybe, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe
I should know better than to touch the fire twice
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah, maybe you might
Maybe, love, maybe3Embed
