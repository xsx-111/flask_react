One Minute Lyrics
You're going crazy, running on empty
You can't make up your mind
You tried to hide it, but you had to say it
Restless all this time
So completely drained from everything that's in your life
It's so wrong, but you had to scream every thought you'd kept inside

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep tryna get up, but I keep falling back
And you love, and you hate, and you wait
'Cause one minute goes fast

You just can't escape it, you're losing patience
You wonder what went wrong
Everything changes, happy then jaded
Always a different song
Playing in your head just when you think you've got it down
Out of nowhere, you realize it's different music playing now

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep tryna get up, but I keep falling back
And you love, and you hate, and you wait
'Cause one minute goes fast
One minute goes fast
One minute goes fast
Fast

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep tryna get up, but I keep falling back
And you love, and you hate, and you wait
'Cause one minute goes, one minute goes, one minute goes fastEmbed
