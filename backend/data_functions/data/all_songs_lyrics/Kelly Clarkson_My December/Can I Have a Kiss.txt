Can I Have a Kiss Lyrics
Excuse me for this
I just want a kiss
I just wanna know what it feels like to touch
Somethin' so pure
Somethin' I'm so sure of
What it feels like to stand outside your door
I'm unworthy
I can see you're above me
But I can be lovely, given the chance

Don't move
I wanna remember you just like this
Don't move
It's only a breath or two between our lips

I know why you left
I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you
I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever, but I'm workin' on it
If I can't hold you, can I give you a kiss?
Can I have a kiss?
I see that you're torn
I've got some scars of my own
Seems I want what I know is gonna leave me hungry

Don't move
I need to remember you just like this

I know why you left
I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you
I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever, but I'm workin' on it
If I can't hold you, can I give you a kiss?
Can I?

All I have
All I can give to you, I will
Just promise this
If I can't have forever
Can I have a kiss?
Kiss, kiss, oh
I know why you left
I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you
I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever, but I'm workin' on it
If I can't hold you
Can I give you a kiss?
Can I give you a kiss?

Can I, can I, can I have a kiss?Embed
