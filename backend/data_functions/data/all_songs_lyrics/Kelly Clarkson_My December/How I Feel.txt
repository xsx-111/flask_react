How I Feel Lyrics
Looks like I made a mess again
Heartbreak everywhere I step
This fire is getting hot again
But I touch the flame 'cause I'm a curious cat
Creepin' where I don't belong
Findin' out what I knew all along
Cryin' all alone
And it's all my fault, all my fault

Yeah, I did it again... again

Oh, I'm gettin' tired of believin'
Even sicker of pretendin'
That it's not so bad, just wait it out
Oh, I think you're feedin' me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now, so just let me be
Let me be

It seems every time I find a good man
He's got a good little wife
I'm not jealous, but I won't lie
I don't wanna hear about your wonderful life
And babies everywhere I look
Trophy wives with their little black books
At this rate, I'm gonna end up alone
It's probably all my fault, all my fault
Oh, another dead end... again

Oh, I'm gettin' tired of believin'
Even sicker of pretendin'
That it's not so bad, just wait it out
Oh, I think you're feedin' me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now

Bitter pill that I've swallowed (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just how low can my heart sink (Ohh, ohh)
Fairy tales from so long ago (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save them for someone that's not smart enough to know

'Cause I, I'm gettin' tired of believin'
I'm through pretendin'
Yeah, I'm broken and sad, so I'll sit this one out
Oh, I think you're feedin' me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now

How I feel right now
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
Let me be
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
Let me beEmbed
