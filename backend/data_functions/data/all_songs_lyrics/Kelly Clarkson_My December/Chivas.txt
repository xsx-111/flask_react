Chivas Lyrics
You're not worth it, babe
The trouble you bring, the noise you keep
And you don't even care, yeah
I'm so sick of you, babe
Nights wasted, I'm through faking
You don't turn me on, you don't do anything at all

Baby, I can't stand the sight of your face
Baby, I don't even wanna hear your name

Don't know what I saw, but I ain't seein' it now
Woke up this morning, bitterness in my mouth
Guess I fell too fast, guess I learned my lesson
So much for true love, I'll take the Chivas instead
Yeah, I'll take the Chivas instead
Oh, yeah

You're too high maintenance, babe
All the time you spent tryna fit in
And no one even cares, yeah
It's so ridiculous, babe
Watching you turn as I burn
It's like you're not even there, yeah
Baby, don't you try and hold my hand
Maybe you should keep your eyes on your new girlfriend

Don't know what I saw, but I ain't seein' it now
Woke up this morning, bitterness in my mouth
Guess I fell too fast, guess I learned my lesson
So much for true love, I'll take the Chivas instead

Ooh, I'll take the Chivas instead, of your bed
It wasn't even good, trust me
I must have been so, so, so, so lonely
You are crap, yeah
You should keep your eyes on your new little brat
Yeah, it's hard not to look, I know, I'm amaz-zing
I love you, Chivas1Embed
