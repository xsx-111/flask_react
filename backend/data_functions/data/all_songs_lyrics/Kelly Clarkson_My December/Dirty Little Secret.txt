Dirty Little Secret Lyrics
I've been thinking
How you're wasting
All that loving on someone else, I can't take it
I will make you
Forget all about the one I'll be replacing
So just say it
I know you've been thinking about it
I see you looking around
I will give you
What you're missing
What you see in me when you think no one's watching
Don't wait too long, I'm not that strong
I can't hold on
Much longer

Oh (Don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh (Don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret

You don't touch
You don't talk
You don't look me in the face
Your dirty little secret
Oh, yeah, yeah
I don't care
What they say
I'll deal with anything
If it gets you next to me
I don't want
Just a taste
I want you anytime I feel a little craving
I'm not that strong, I can't hold on

Oh (Don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh (Don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret

You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

What are you hiding in your covers?
Like to wait, little lover
What will you do when they discover your eyes on another?
Why you running 'round in circles?
Trying so hard to discourage
Telling secrets that'll surface
One way or another
Oh, I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh, oh, I got you now
I found your dirty little secret

You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face
You never touch
You never talk to me
You never look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

Your dirty little secret
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty, dirty secret
Na, na, na, na
Dirty
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
DirtyEmbed
