Disappearing Act LyricsYou do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
Silence, I know I could get used to this
Cunning, your sin is something I'm not gonna miss
Exile, it's a small price to pay for bliss
Alone, like the painter's dog without a bone
When there's only one thing you need to own
And that is hunger, hunger itself
I know you're (missing)
Your (missing) is ripped and it is torn to shreds
From all the lovers taken to your beds
They're empty now
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone in to love
You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
Jealousy, it's not what it's cracked up to be
Envy, gets you where you need to be
Alone, rather the river than your stepping stones
Leave the graveyard before you turn to bones
I'm tragic, you're comedy
Oh, baby doll, the dogs are barking, they need to be fed
All the lepers you let in your head - is it empty now?
Cause you think that can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love
You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing actEmbed
