Indian Summer Sky Lyrics
In the ocean cuts ring deep, the sky
Like there, I don't know why
In the forest there's a clearing
I run there toward the light
Sky
It's a blue sky

In the earth the hole deep, deep, decide
If I could, I would
Up for air to swim against the tide
Hey, hey, hey
Up toward the sky
It's a blue sky

To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this, the longest day

So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
(So wind blow through my soul)
You give yourself to this the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away

Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change and so do I
The light that strikes the tallest trees the light away for I
The light away
Up towards the sky
It's a blue sky

To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this, the longest day

So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
(So wind blow through my soul)

You give yourself to this the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away1Embed
