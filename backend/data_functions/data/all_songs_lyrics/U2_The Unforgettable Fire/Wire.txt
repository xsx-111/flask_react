Wire Lyrics
Innocent, and in a sense I am
Guilty of the crime that's now in hand
Such a nice day, throw your life away
Such a nice day, let it go

Cold, these eyes, I can't believe it
Cold, this heart is slow
Heart is stone

Call me
Such a cold heart
Such a cold man
Watch you tear yourself apart
So lay me down, my soul to give
So lay me down, the longest sleep
Oh, the longest sleep
In I come and out you go, you get
Here we are again now, place your bets
Is this the time
The time to win or lose
Is this the time
The time to choose
Cold, these eyes, I can't believe it
So deep inside a cold fire
Cold, this heart is slow
Heart is stone

Any time you're on there
Kiss me
Won't you tell me
That's it, just give me it
In some white track
You come right back
Cartoon cutout
Cut throat let out
I'm on your side
Be on the both side
I'm on right track
You get off my back
I'm no dope
I give you hope
Here's the rope
Here's the rope
Now swing awayEmbed
