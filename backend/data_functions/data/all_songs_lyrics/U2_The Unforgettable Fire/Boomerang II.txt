Boomerang II LyricsSoul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Under her skin I hear her within
Under her love at peace with him
Under her hands that which I'm needing
Under her eyes I glimpse her love
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Under her time I think I'm missing
Under her lie I hear her love
Under her breath I hear nothing
Under her eyes I disappear
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Under the sky I'm pointing there
Under the power, baby
You say run away
Throw me away
Throw me away
In the drift we've come
In the drift we go
In the drift we had come
In the drift we go
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Under her skin I feel loving
Under her sign there is no fear
Under her hands, that which I'm holding
Under her eyes I disappear
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
In the drift we come
Soul wind blows
In the drift we go
Soul wind blows
In the drift we've come
Soul wind blows
In the drift we go
Soul wind blows
In the drift we come
Under her
In the drift we go
Under her
In the drift we come
Under her
In the drift we go
Under her
Soul wind blows
Soul wind blows
Under her hands
Soul wind
Some day throw me away
Fade it away
Throw it away
In the drift we've come
In the drift we go
In the drift we come
In the drift we go
In the drift we come
Soul wind blows
In the drift we go
Soul wind blows
In the drift we come
Soul wind blows
In the drift we go
Soul wind blows
In the drift we come
In the drift we goEmbed
