Diana LyricsAll the boys I know love Diana, some calming apparition you bet she is
The world careering nightmare somewhere it is her arms reach out
And stop the savagery at least they do for me
Her eyes china blue saucers she's born that way
She tastes of apple strudel you can tell she does
With arms that hold sweet William to her breast
I wish that it were true our family includes you
Even though you're warped and unattractive
I see I've made you cry by saying here comes the bride
There's always some sweet petticoat grabs the eye
That's why the boys and girls love Diana
Looking for a star, looking for a star
Looking for a star is fine. If we don't find it here
If we don't find it now what are we going to say
What are we going to say ?
Her eyes china blue saucers she's born that way
She tastes of apple strudel you can tell she does
With arms that hold sweet William to her breast
The darling of, the darling of, creation of the editor
I guess that's what, suppose that's what she's for
I hope they're crying in their sleep for promises they cannot keep
For disappointments rooted deep
That's why the boys and girls love DianaEmbed
