Tiffanys LyricsTime is the healer, time was on my hands
The bus stopped at Tiffany's
So I went to hear the band
I saw Cinderella, then the curtain dropped
Time hung heavy on my hands but today
The clock just stopped
I heard that music saw those pictures on the wall
I fell in love with Tiffany's, I thought it said it all
Soothed by your saxophones I thought you'd understand
I'd love to sing my songs for you but I don't know if I can
I said, I don't know if I can
I said, I don't know if I can
I don't know if I can
Midnight is striking there's a pumpkin by the door
It's five o'clock and the streets are clear am I alone once more?
I watched the dawn in an electric storm, my compass blew haywire
There she stands with a slipper in her hand
And her eyes were the colour of fire
I saw you crying from that doorway for some time
It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those telling signs
I saw you crying from that doorway for some time
It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those telling signs
She said, I see those telling signs
She said, I see those telling signs
I see those telling signs
I heard that music saw those pictures on the wall
I fell in love with Tiffany's, I thought it said it all
Soothed by your saxophones I thought you'd understand
I'd love to sing my songs for you but I don't know if I can
I said, I don't know if I can
I said, don't know if I can
I don't know if I can
Time is no healer, in truth she plays no part
When money's got you in her pocket where can she put your heart?
She led a charmed life, so I believe
Before she left she wrote a note and this is how it reads
I saw you crying from that doorway for sometime
It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those telling signs
I saw you crying from that doorway for sometime
It's no use drying your eyes 'cos I see those telling signs
She said, I see those telling signs
She said, I see those telling signs
I see those telling signsEmbed
