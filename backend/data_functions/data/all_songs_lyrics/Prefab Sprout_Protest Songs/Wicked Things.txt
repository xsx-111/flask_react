Wicked Things LyricsYour Mother's got bags of good advice the don'ts exceed the do's
But she's not you
All it takes is a little nerve as I close in for the kill
Just stand still
What could make a girl believe the wicked things he'd say ?
What could make a girl believe the wicked things he'd say ?
Like by the grace of God he'll be the bugle boy on judgment day
All the jokers running wild, their politics are street, but still elite
The revolution's underway the dream is coming true - But not for you
All it takes is a little nerve as they close in for the kill
You just stand still
What could make a girl believe the wicked things he'd say ?
What could make a girl believe the wicked things he'd say ?
Like by the grace of God he'll be the bugle boy on judgment day
Why must honest Joe reap the wicked seed they sow ?
Maybe honest Joe hides from things he hates to know
If Joe goes on this way on honest wind will surely come and blowEmbed
