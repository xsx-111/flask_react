Talking Scarlet LyricsCarry no bright torches for me...
You hide under the eiderdown all you can't sweep underneath the carpet
When you cover your neighbour's wife scalding marks appear you're talking scarlet
Kid yourself that it's platonic love
Best of friends - Eyes all smiling - Watch them turn to iron filings
I will say late one evening while moonstruck beside her
I'll break the bonds of friendship one by one. I'll tell her
I'm more than some friendly fellow, I will say "How ya doin ?"
So casually she never suspects I'm harbouring thoughts of kissing her neck
I think my mouth's been drinking my basest thoughts do the thinking
You've no shame when Scarlet is your name trust in flames
When Scarlet is your name
Yes he's crying in his sleep, yes he's thoroughly miserable for me
Losing his looks for me. Losing
Certain themes keep recurring, boundaries start a blurring
I will say late one evening while moonstruck beside her
I'll break the bonds of friendship one by one. I'll tell her
I'm more than some friendly fellow, I will say "How ya doin ?"
So casually she never suspects I'm harbouring thoughts of kissing her neck
I think my mouth's been drinking my basest thoughts do the thinking
Oh my God someone tell her - I know she's a star, celestial feast
In the zoo of my heart she is thrown to the beast, tell her
The mouse here beside her won't always be denied her
I've no shame, Scarlet is my name, trust in flames
Scarlet is my name
Carry no bright torches for meEmbed
