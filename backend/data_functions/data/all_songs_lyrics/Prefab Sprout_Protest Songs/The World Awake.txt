The World Awake LyricsThat frightening little sound it's just the world awake
It's just a way of saying we're in business
It's just a lightning strike, it's just a family row
It's just the give and take of forgiveness
Chance being a fine thing brought us together
But we're not magnets well not forever
It's just the way I am, it's just the way we are
It's just a nervous flickering of old flames
Now everybody wears the look of the child who wished to marry you
Who, knocking proudly on your door, was greeted by your pretty wife
If this is life make no mistake it keeps the weary world awake
Chance being a fine thing brought us together
But we're not magnets well not forever
It's just the way I am, it's just the way we are
It's just a nervous flickering of old flames
So don't you cry they're, they're only words
They're only the saddest thing you've ever heard
Now everybody wears the look of the child who wished to marry you
Who, knocking proudly on your door, was greeted by your pretty wife
If this is life make no mistake it keeps the weary world awakeEmbed
