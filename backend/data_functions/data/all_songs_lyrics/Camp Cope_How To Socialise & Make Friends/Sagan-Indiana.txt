Sagan-Indiana Lyrics
They said, "Since the death
Your absence has been noticed"
And there is nothing that I don't owe the past

Sagan-Indiana
Never saw where she was named after
Follow the future
Back to me, back to me, back to me

There's a man filling my petrol tank
All to feed his children
On Christmas Day
I'm avoiding seeing my family
And I buried my heart
Comfortable stranger
The last thing she said
Was, "Don't go digging up the dead"

Sagan-Indiana
Never saw where she was named after
Follow the future
Back to me, back to me, back to me
She said her house was like a friend
Keep the lights on and the stereo going
While they were mappin' out the world
She was inside taking care of herself

Sagan-Indiana
Never saw where she was named after
Said, "It didn't matter
I found me, I found me, I found me
I found me, I found me"Embed
