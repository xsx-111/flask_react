UFO Lighter Lyrics
It's a question that I never learned to ask
How far I'd follow you into the dark
And it's still a question that I'm too afraid to ask
How far I'd follow you, how far I'd follow you
When she saw that I'd tattooed my hands
I said, "Mum, I don't think I was ever gonna work for the bank"
And I said that I was sorry about that line
I only wrote it 'cause it rhymed

We're not those kids sitting on the swing set
And I will follow you across the planet
If we could take our time
We'd get it right, we'd get it right

He was so bitter when he said
"They'll offer you the world, but they'll leave you for dead"
And nobody tried to understand
Or at least act surprised when I said that
I wasn't the one who was unfaithful
That I could see why people thought I was
Sometimes making love is the only time I ever feel loved
There was never any middle ground
Now he sits alone in his one bedroom apartment
Tells himself he's happy and he made the right decisions
And he expected that I was gonna fail and run back
Well, fuck that
But I'll wait for you
At the end of the earth is where I'll wait for you
And you can meet me there
See, I never really stray far from here

'Cause my head just gets so loud
That I can't hear the words coming out of your mouth
Sorry I don't react the way you want me to sometimes
I only wrote it 'cause it rhymed
Your silhouette against the fire
Where I thought I saw a UFO but it was just a lighter
And we nearly died, shit, I'm still amazed how we survived
You probably shouldn't let me drive1Embed
