The Face of God Lyrics
I had to leave because
I had to say "No" and "Stop" more than once
Way too many times
And you just kept trying to change my mind
So I left, it was 3:00am
And I slept in the middle of my bed
With the comfort of my own choices
Yeah, I bet you didn't even think about what you did

"Couldn't be true
You don't seem like that kind of guy"
"Not you, you've got that one song that I like"
They said, "He's got one song that I like"

Now I don't even know why I went
Every light on the way was screaming at me: "Red"
Now you've got me questioning everything I did
And what would've happened if I'd done one thing different
And I saw it, the face of God
And he turned himself away from me
And said I did something wrong
That somehow what happened to me was my fault
You can see it in apologists and hear it in the songs
"Couldn't be true
You couldn't do that to someone"
"Not you, nah, your music is too good"
They said your music is too good
Kept saying your music is too good
They said your music is too good2Embed
