Anna Lyrics
She packed all her bags and went on her way
Back to Adelaide
Uh-huh, uh-huh
The cat's been crying out
Wandering all alone around the house sayin'
"I really hope you're happier where you are now"

Just get it all out
Put it in a song
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna, Anna

Bed bound doesn't feel the same without you
You are the other half, the missing parts, the sleepless muse
And he said, "I got a lot of problems
And one of 'em is always you
But I'm fine with that, let's just work on it
I mean, you've got yours too"

Just get it all out
Put it in a song
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna, Anna, Anna
Don't get used to the isolation
You're gonna want it when you're gone
When there's no one with any patience
And you think
"Are they my friends, or do I just want something from them?"
The endless record spinning inside my head

Just get it all out
Put it in a song
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna, come on
Tell 'em what went wrong
Just get it all out
Write another song
Anna

She packed all her bags and went on her wayEmbed
