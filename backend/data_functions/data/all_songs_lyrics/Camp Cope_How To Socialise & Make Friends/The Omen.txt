The Omen Lyrics
We all sold weed for a while
And we've all made our mother cry
It's a habit that I've finally broken
At this point in my life
And now I'm kinda getting by
But sometimes it's hard to go outside
And I've been driving way too much
I've been too lazy to fix my bike

Now as long as I close my eyes, I'm by myself
And I'd rather be at home with you than anywhere else

And now I'm turning onto your street
Now I love you like you never hurt me
The planet took a real sharp turn
Before all that space in between
And I really don't agree
That your merit's buried in your gender normalities
And I promise I'll take care of you if you promise to let me

Now as long as I close my eyes, I'm by myself
And I'd rather be alone with you than anybody else
And I've never needed God
I think I kinda knew that all along
To need a promise of heaven to do good deeds
Always seemed inherently wrong
And so I wrote you this song
It probably isn't as good as all the other sad ones
And I'll pass out in your bed
After getting too high while you were gone

Look at me, it was all for you
And it's about time that you knew
That I've loved you since I was seventeen
And for all the things I've seen
There's still some wounds that I need to clean
But let's move far away from here
When I finally get my degree
Where we'll live happily
Get some rescue dogs in a house by the sea
And I promise I'll take care of you
If you promise to let meEmbed
