Animal & Real Lyrics
2:00am or something
And the past won't leave the present alone
Won't leave me alone
The underground's not for everyone
The things you learn working the graveyard
The graveyard
And although I'd never listen
Your voice is loud in my
My goddamn head, boy
All the other animals are laughing at me and you
Yeah, it's just me and you

Can't escape this perspective
Or the mark that was left on me
Damaged goods for the world to see
They walk straight past and away from me
Will you? I know what those hands can do
How I wish you'd use them on me
Like I was an instrument
Feels good, doesn't it?

Yeah, I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel better
I know I'm lucky, this makes me feel
Animal and real
Then 2:00am came around
Drove his car into the ground
Smother the pain with sound
Or is it just bringing you down?
Let's talk about saving face
Let's talk about putting me in my place
Come out and then walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
As long as you cameEmbed
