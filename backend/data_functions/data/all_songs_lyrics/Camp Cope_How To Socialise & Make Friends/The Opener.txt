The Opener Lyrics
Tell me you never wanna see me again
And then keep showing up at my house
Tell me you'll never be in love again
And now you're walking 'round with someone else
If I was hungry, then you were starving
And he was so sick, but you were dying
If I was hungry, then you were starving
Now tell the dead man that you're the one dying

Treat them like queens until they disagree
And never reflect to think, "Wait, maybe the problem was me"
Nah, man, just keep smoking weed
Tell this one, "Yeah, they were all crazy, unlike you, baby"

Tell me that no one knows me like you do
And tell me that my friends don't tell me the truth
And maybe I'll come crawling back to you
Like, that was your plan, right?
You worked so hard, but we were just lucky
To ride those coat tails into infinity
And all my success has got nothing to do with me
Yeah, tell me again how there just aren't
That many girls in the music scene
It's another all-male tour preaching equality
It's another straight cis man who knows more about this than me
It's another man telling us we're missing a frequency
Show 'em, Kelly
It's another man telling us we can't fill up the room
It's another man telling us to book a smaller venue
"Nah, hey, come on, girls, we're only thinking about you"
Well, see how far we've come not listening to you
Yeah, just get a female opener, that'll fill the quota3Embed
