In the Dark Lyrics
I've written songs in the dark
I've felt inspired in the dark
I hide myself in the dark
Used to be afraid of the dark
Those in the light know we die in the dark

There's only artificial light here
My flaws hide well here
I used to be afraid of cluttered noises
Now I'm afraid of silence

Fill this space with idle words
I'm scared to death of light and silence
Jesus, kill me inside this
Raise me up to live again
Like you did
Like you did

Now I am mute despite myself
All of them are gone
The silence overtakes me
The idle words forsake me and I am left to face me
I'm held accountable
For every idle word
Curse the idle words
I'm scared to death of light and silence
Jesus, kill me inside this
Raise me up to live again
Like you did
Like you did

Glory shows up
Exposes us
I'm naked here
Forsaken here
By the dark
By the dark
Damn the dark!

I'm scared to death of light and silence
Jesus, kill me inside this
Raise me up to live again
Like you did
Like you didEmbed
