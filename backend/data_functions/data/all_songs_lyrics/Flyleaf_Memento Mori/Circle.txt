Circle Lyrics
Circle encircles the earth
Chance and choice break his heart
His innocent arm moves to save me and I am spared
His beautiful arm is bloody and cut off
His heart ripped out to show me he loved me
But I wouldn't believe him
He did all that he could
I still would not believe him

I left his arms empty and tied outstretched for me until he died
I left his arms empty and tied outstretched for me until he died

No man shows greater love
Than when a man lays down his life
For his beloved

I left his arms empty and tied outstretched for me until he died
I left his arms empty and tied outstretched for me until he died

And here I am alive
And I don't have the right
And he gave me the right
Costing him his life
New mercy's in the morning
I believe! What if I believe you now?
Could it ever change this harrow
Forgive me, relieve me
Please come back to life
I believe! What if I believe you now?
Could it ever change this harrow
Forgive me, relieve me
Please come back to life
Come back to my life

I believe! What if I believe you now?
Forgive me, relieve me
Please come back to life1Embed
