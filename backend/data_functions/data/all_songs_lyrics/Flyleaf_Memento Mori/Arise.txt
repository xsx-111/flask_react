Arise Lyrics
Tell the swine
We will make it out alive
There’s a note in the pages of a book
So sleep tonight
We’ll sleep dreamlessly this time
When we awake, we’ll know that everything’s alright

Sing to me about the end of the world
End of these hammers and needles for you

Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for
There's still strength left in us yet
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for
There's some hope left in it yet

There's snow on your face
And your razor blade
The twilight is bruised
And there you lie

Sing to me about the end of the world
End of these hammers and needles for you
We’ll cry tonight
But in the morning we are new
Stand in the sun
We'll dry your eyes
Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for
There's still strength left in us yet
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for
There's some hope left in it yet

Sing, sing
Arise

Arise and be
All that you dreamed
All that you dreamed
Arise and be
All that you dreamed
All that you dreamed
(Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for)
Arise and be
All that you dreamed
All that you dreamed
(Hold on to the world we all remember dying for)
Arise and be
All that you dreamed
All that you dreamed
(Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for)
Arise and be
All that you dreamed
All that you dreamed
Arise and be
All that you dreamed
All that you dreamed1Embed
