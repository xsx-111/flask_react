Chasm Lyrics
Break up already, wake up now
Walk away, take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off
You're spitting in his face with the rest of them
Break up already, wake up now
Walk away, take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off
Your spitting in his face with the rest of them

Please give me something
I'm so thirsty, I'm so thirsty
Oh, please, let me warn them
Don't you come here
Don't bring anyone here

The chasm isn't fixed yet
Take this water
Drinking ever deeper
Living water
The chasm isn't fixed yet
Take this water
Drinking ever deeper
Living water
Please give me something
I'm so thirsty, I'm so thirsty
Oh, please, let me warn them
Don't you come here
Don't bring anyone here


Please give me something
I'm so thirsty, I'm so thirsty
Oh, please, let me warn them
Don't you come here
Don't bring anyone here1Embed
