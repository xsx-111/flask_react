Treasure Lyrics
That night I felt like I'd become something...treasured...different

Can I tell you a story as we dance while the sun starts to bleed
Song of Songs' Love is calling
"Daughter, wake up from your sleep."

Refined I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure
I'll be treasured over all the earth

Bearing the gift of a new heart
Patience ablaze I'm slowly burning

Refined I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure
I'll be treasured over all the earth
Refined I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure
I'll be treasured over all the earth

I am in awe and in shock
I am in love and given away
I'm reserved with these words
Can I tell you a story as we dance while the sun starts to bleed
Trees rejoice with the wind here
Hallelujah, Yeshuah

Tonight I've become the most dazzling precious treasure
I am treasured over all the earth
Just look at what He's done
How He's laying down His life
Take this life
Oh most dazzling precious treasure
Tonight I've become the most dazzling precious treasure
I am treasured over all the earthEmbed
