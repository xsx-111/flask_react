This Close Lyrics
Had a dream that we were dead
But we pretended that we still lived
With no regrets we never bled
And we took everything life could give
And came up broken empty handed in the end

In the hearts of the blind
Something you'll never find is a vision of light
With the voice of the dead I'm screaming

I don't know who I am anymore
Not once in life have I been real
But I never felt this close before
I've been looking in your window
I've been dressing in your clothes
I've been walking dead, watching you
Long enough to know I can't go on

Had a dream that fire fell
From an opening in the sky
Someone warned me of this hell
And I spit in his naive eye
And left him crying for my soul he said would die
In the hearts of the blind
Something you'll never find is a vision of light
With the voice of the dead I'm screaming

I don't know who I am anymore
Not once in life have I been real
But I never felt this close before
I've been looking in your window
I've been dressing in your clothes
I've been walking dead, watching you
Long enough to know I can't go on

In the hearts of the blind
Something you'll never find is a vision of light
With the voice of the dead I'm screaming

I don't know who I am anymore
Not once in life have I been real
But I never felt this close before
I've been looking in your window
I've been dressing in your clothes
I've been walking dead, watching you
Long enough to know I can't go on
I've been looking in your window
I've been dressing in your clothes
I've been walking dead, watching you
Long enough to know I can't go onEmbed
