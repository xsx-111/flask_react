XXYY LyricsWe, we have this fight within
Born through circumstance
XYYYYY me
If you don't look you can't and fail to see
Then we fly my love
Through the stars above
They'll write out your name when I am alone
They'll map out my way when im coming home
Fly Sure above
Born to there are to calm
If you see my love tell that im fine
If you see my love tell that im fine
If you see my love tell that im fine
If you see my love tell that im fine
If you see my love tell that im fine
If you see my love tell that im fine
