Slow Was My Heart LyricsSlow was my heart and so you had gone
So we move on, please stay strong
It keeps on turning, yeah-yeah, for everyone
We keep on learning, yeah-yeah, to kiss the sun
Weak was my strength, your hand I should have lend
So we move on, please stay strong
It keeps on turning, yeah-yeah, for everyone
We keep on learning, yeah-yeah, to kiss the sun like everyone
Fly, fly my plane to an eastern runway
And tell me why love must die
It keeps on turning yeah yeah for everyone
You keep on learning yeah yeah to kiss the sun
I'm just like everyone (keep on learning, yeah-yeah)
I'm just like everyone (keep on learning, yeah-yeah)
I'm just like everyone (keep on learning, yeah-yeah)
I'm just like everyone (keep on learning, yeah-yeah)
For everyone (keep on learning, yeah-yeah, keep on learning, yeah-yeah)
(Keep on learning, yeah-yeah, keep on learning, yeah-yeah)Embed
