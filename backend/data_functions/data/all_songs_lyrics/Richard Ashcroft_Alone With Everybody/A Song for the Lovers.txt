A Song for the Lovers Lyrics
I spend the night, yeah, looking for my insides
In a hotel room waiting for you
We're gonna make it tonight, yeah, something in the air
Tells me the time is right, so we better get on

DJ, play a song for the lovers
And tonight, alright
I said, please, play a song for my lover
Tonight, alright

Don't wanna wait
Please, Lord, I've been waiting all my life
And I'm too late again, I know, but I was scared
And can't you see?
Oh, I'm moving like a train into some foreign land
I ain't got a ticket for this ride, but I will

Move to the song for my lover
Tonight, alright
And, DJ, play a song for the lovers
Tonight, alright

Ah, DJ, play a song for the lovers
Tonight, alright
I said, please, play a song for my lovers
And tonight, alright
I can't stop looking back, oh, Lord
Tonight, alright
I can't stop looking back, oh, Lord
Tonight, alright

Oh, brother, won't you lend a hand?
I'm alone in a room and I'm waiting for love
I don't know when this dream's gonna stop
But I'm telling you, man, I don't wanna get out
Oh, brother, won't you lend a hand?
I'm alone in a room and I'm waiting for love
I don't know when this dream's gonna stop
But I'm telling you, man, I don't wanna get out
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
For the lovers
For the lovers
For the lovers
To the lovers
To the lovers
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you2Embed
