Leave Me High LyricsLeave me high
Leave me looking
Leave me low
Leave me warm
No love can fulfil
Like this love that you give
Leave me high
Leave me looking
Over mountains in the heavens
No love can fulfil
Like this love that you give
Wasted moments come together
Like a ball on a string
Your love take me higher
Realise everything
Take those chains from your heart and soul
And take those chains from your heart and soul
Take those chains from your heart and soul
And take those chains from your heart and soul
Yeah like a slow train
And take those chains from your heart and soul
Yeah like a slow train
And take those chains from your heart and soul
Yeah like a slow train
And take those chains from your heart and soul
And take those chains from your heart and soul
Through the mountains over heavens
Through the mountains over heavens
Leave me high
Leave me lookingEmbed
