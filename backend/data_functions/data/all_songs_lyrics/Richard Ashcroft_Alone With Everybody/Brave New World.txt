Brave New World LyricsInto the brave new world
I hope I see you on the other side of this changing world
Baby when my ship pulls in
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in
But for now I'm just sitting at the table
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Brother don't try to find
Don't try to believe in anyone for I would change your mind
Baby when my ship pulls in
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in, I'm fine
But for now I'm just sitting at the table
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
I hope I see you on the other side, I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side, I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side
But for now I'm just sitting at the table
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (brave new world)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (brave new world)Embed
