Crazy World LyricsThere's nothing really wrong with the state of your ambition
The whole world is crumbling 'cause your crazy vision
All wars are boys and death is what you hate most
Come on baby, don't you want to get
A new size, a new size, a new size, a new size
It's a crazy world for a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
It's a crazy world for a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
So you got no God, you got no love to tell me off
But you've got that spirit, so please stick with it
This world wouldn't be a world without you in it
Please (shelter me) shelter me, please (shelter me) shelter me
I found this crazy world
It's chewing on my brain like a desert drained locust
I find it hard to love I find it hard to focus
The whole world is crumbling 'cause their crazy visions
Come on baby, don't you want to get
A new size, a new size, a new size, a new size
It's a crazy world for a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
It's a crazy world for a mixed up boy and a mixed up girl
So you got no God, you got no love to tell me off
But you've got that spirit, so please stick with it
This world wouldn't be a world without you in it
Please (shelter me) shelter me, please (shelter me) shelter me
I found this crazy world
You got to keep your spirit, you'll stick with it
There ain't a world without it, you'll stick with it
You got to keep your spirit, you'll stick with it
There ain't a world without it, you'll stick with it
So you got no God, you got no love to tell me off
But you've got that spirit, so please stick with it
This world wouldn't be a world without you in it
Shelter me, shelter me, shelter me, shelter me
Shelter me, shelter me, shelter me, shelter me, yeah oh1Embed
