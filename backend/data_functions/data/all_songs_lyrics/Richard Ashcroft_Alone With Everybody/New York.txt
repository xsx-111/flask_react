New York LyricsAre you tuning in, are you tuning in
Are you tuning in, are you tuning in
And I wanted to go half my life
And I feel kind of strange like I never lived that life
And I'm trying hard to control my heart
And I always want to know, and I always want to go
New York, are you tuning in, New York, big city of dreams
New York, oh what a city, New York, are you tuning in
Are you tuning in, are you tuning in, are you tuning in (New York)
There's now time to unpack yet, let's get straight out on the street
And feel no inhibitions, this city was built for me
And my head is full of questions when did I feel this good
In the arms of my lover burning through the night of
New York, are you tuning in, New York, are you tuning in
New York, oh what a city, New York, big city of dreams
Are you tuning in, are you tuning in, (New York) are you tuning in
Are you tuning in, are you tuning in, (New York) are you tuning in
And it's funny how time fly's in the city that never sleeps
It's getting after hours and I'm feeling the heat
I'm almost dead and buried, this day is nearly done
But I want to keep on going, I'm going to kiss the sun in
New York, are you tuning in, New York, are you tuning in
New York, big city of dreams, New York, oh what a city
New York, big city of dreams, New York, oh what a city
New York, big city of dreams, New York, are you tuning in
And I'm feeling kind of selfish cause I'm just having my own fun
I've been busy on your island just having my own fun
It's an English tradition find some money make some time
Get busy on your island and slowly lose our minds in
New York, are you tuning in, New York, are you tuning in
New York, big city of dreams, New York, oh what a city
New York, big city of dreams, New York, oh what a city
New York, are you tuning in, New York, are you tuning in
Are you tuning in, are you tuning in, (New York) are you tuning in
Are you tuning in, are you tuning in, (New York) are you tuning in
Are you tuning in (New York), it's a state of me, (New York) are you tuning in
Are you tuning in (New York), it's a state of me, (New York) are you tuning inEmbed
