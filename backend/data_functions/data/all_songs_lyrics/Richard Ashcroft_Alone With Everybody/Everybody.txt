Everybody LyricsCold morning, I was looking out it was a cold day
Songbird was drinking from a table but songbird you just flew away
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
So let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
And let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
It's not a sign of weakness when you're searching
For the places where the memories flow
There may come a time when you rearrange
And may leave those memories you've gotta let them go
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Stay strong, move on, keep on
Stay strong, move on, keep onEmbed
