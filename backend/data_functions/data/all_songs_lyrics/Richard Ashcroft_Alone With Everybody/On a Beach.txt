On a Beach LyricsAhh, I have swum those raging seas
Washed up by an ocean who had tired of me
How I survived I will never know
This wreck's got a home and a whole lot of hope
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
Full of love and new desire
I lit my fire blew my conch, nobody comes
I built my boat from bamboo but it sunk
I looked at the sky for vapor trails nobody comes
I wrote your name on a tree along with the days
This is taking you away from me
I'm out on a beach, eating my heart
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
I'm on fire (I need somebody like you), I ain't afraid to die
I ain't afraid to die, I ain't afraid to die
I'm out on a beach, eating my heart
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Thinking of you and the love I got (I need somebody like you)
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I lit my fire, saw my coach (I'm full of love)
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home (and new desire)
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock (I'm full of love)
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home (and new desire)
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dogEmbed
