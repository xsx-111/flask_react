You on My Mind in My Sleep LyricsYou ain't ever seen the way to find your dream
Forget what's within within 'cause who you've been you've been
If all we lose is the skin, I'm pulling you under within
We're gonna make this life together
The symptoms are too deep, I got you on my mind in my sleep...
You on my mind in my sleep...
Do you know how hard I'll try to lose this foolish pride
Can you take me as I am, can you understand me (I'm changing now...)
If all we lose is the skin, I'm pulling you under within
We're gonna make this life together
The symptoms are too deep, I got you on my mind in my sleep...
You on my mind in my sleep, you on my mind in my sleep...
You on my mind in my sleep...
“Talk to me”
“Talk to me”
“Talk to me”
You on my mind in my sleep... (symptoms are too deep, come on)
You on my mind in my sleep...
You on my mind in my sleep... (heavenly body)
You on my mind in my sleep... (heavenly body)
You on my mind in my sleep... (heavenly body)
You on my mind in my sleep... (heavenly body)
You on my mind in my sleep... (heavenly body)Embed
