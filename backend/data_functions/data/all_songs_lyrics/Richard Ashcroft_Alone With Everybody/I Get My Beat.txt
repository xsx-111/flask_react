I Get My Beat LyricsI get my beat with you when we see things through
And I think about you all the time
Who the winners in the game were playing
I don't even think they know
Who the losers and how much their paying
I don't even think they know
I need to hear the truth from the soul of you
Chase the moments we can share
Who the winners in the game were playing
I don't even think they know
Who the losers and how much their paying
I don't even think they know
They've got time, oh, they've got life, oh
Take and take your time, take your time
I got to hear the sound of the morning song
As the light plays with your hair
I'm blowing smoke and I'll feel so damn fine
That I know you care
Who the winners in the game were playing
I don't even think they know
Who the losers and how much their paying
I don't even think they know
They've got time, oh, they've got life, oh
Gonna take a little of my time, it's a beautiful thing, yeah
No one is rushing this life, it's a beautiful thing
(We've got a richous thing something no dollar can buy)
Take and take your time
One life, one life, one life
They've got time, oh, they've got life, oh
Take your time (it's a beautiful thing, yeah), oh
Even when they say that you mad (it's a beautiful thing, yeah), oh
It's only 'cause the rushing to tell (it's a beautiful thing, yeah), oh
I get my beat with you when we see things through
And I think about you all the time
We've got a richous thing something no dollar can buy
Take your time (it's a beautiful thing, yeah), ohEmbed
