Money to Burn LyricsWoo hoo hoo, I got money to burn, I wanna burn it on you
Come on, yah yah, we got one short life, I wanna spend it with you
You light my fire, I wanna burn all night, I wanna burn on through
Oh, yeah yeah, I got one short life, I wanna spend it with you
Ooh baby, you're my sweet savior, you're my one adventure
You're the only gift I've got from above from above

Come on now, now, we got one last supper, gonna eat with you
Oh, yeah yeah, we got one last high, I wanna get high too
