Ship LyricsThe left hand ship has set an attack
Get a lazer beam and give it one back
Shadow on the right says it wants you back
Keep a float and climb up on its back
All aboard all aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard actually no no
Abandon ship abandon ship
Shadow ran forth with a dazzling fear
People wanted to help but they couldn't get near
Sit on your lap for the deadliest years
Let your body hold blood sweet and tears
All aboard all aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard actually no no
Abandon ship abandon ship
One minute one minute what what
What have they done, to deserve this
Fate and be on the run. one minute
One minute what what what have
They done 'c 'c can't you play fair
And put down your guns
Well franky love i don't give a dam
I'll blow that ship out the water
And live in my plan
When the water rises up to our lips
I'll utter the words to sink all ships
All aboard all aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard actually no no
Abandon ship abandon ship
Read my lips you going to sink
Your a peanut shell in my finger tips
Like a crispy jello, hello, bye
Read my lips and look me in the eye
All aboard all aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard actually no no
Abandon ship abandon shipEmbed
