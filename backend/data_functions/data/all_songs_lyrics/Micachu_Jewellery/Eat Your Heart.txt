Eat Your Heart Lyrics
Well, I can feel you're miles away
And I'd sell out everyday
And your large heart melts my brain
Yeah, your large heart melts my brain

'cause I could eat your heart
'cause I could eat your heart
Yeah, I could eat your heart
And I could beat your heart

Well, if I smile ten times a day
I can keep that fire away
And if I spit them bars too late
My whole world will segregate

'cause, 'cause I could eat your heart
'cause I could eat your heart
Yeah, I could eat your heart
And I could beat your heart

'cause I could eat your heart
'cause I could eat your heart
Yeah, I could eat your heart
And I could beat your heartEmbed
