Curly Teeth LyricsYeah she had straight eyes and curly teeth
When she smiled at me I got a nose bleed
She spat me out, said "What's your business with me?"
But all I wanted to be was in her company
She had a room with no space to compete
When I fell at her feet she clapped in time to the beat
That beat me up inside but I was discrete
She blew smoke in my eyes and flicked me out on the street
Boom boom dead
Boom boom dead
Boom boom dead
Boom boom dead
She's took my money now I'm sinking to deep
Those curly teeth. That fucking fief
She's got my stuff buried into concrete
Those curly teeth. That fucking fief
Boom boom dead, yeah you thought that it would last
Boom boom dead, yeah you thought that it would last
Boom boom dead, yeah you thought that it would last
Boom boom dead, yeah you thought that it would lastEmbed
