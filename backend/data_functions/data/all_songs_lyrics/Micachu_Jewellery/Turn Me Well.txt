Turn Me Well LyricsGet to me and turn me well, I'm a tired soul
Get to me and turn me well, I'm a tired soul
I was told desire had a sell by date
Well it's rotted and altered, but still remains
Climbs the promise of no real change
I didn't know you would last this long
I didn't think I would last this long
No vacuum is now, and here we are
Did it hate to last, and here we are?
You squeezed my heart so tight tonight
You must return it before you leave
'Cause when you get to me
When you get to me
When you get to me, you turn me well
Get to me and turn me well, I'm a tired soul
Get to me and turn me well, I'm a tired soul
Get to me and turn me well, I'm a tired soul
Get to me and turn me well, I'm a tired soulEmbed
