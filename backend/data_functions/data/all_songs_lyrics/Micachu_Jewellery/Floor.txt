Floor LyricsI'm wearing my expressionless face
Bought lots of things to replace you
I fill every possible space
Do anything to contain you
And I'll put things all over the floor
If I stand on my bed I can see it all
And I'll put your things all over the floor
If I drop off my bed I can smash it all
I think I've made a massive mistake
I'll put you away and exchange you
My feelings are slightly misshaped
Do anything to you
And I'll put things all over the floor
If I stand on my bed I can see it all
And I'll put your things all over the floor
If I drop off my bed I can smash it allEmbed
