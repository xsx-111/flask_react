Guts LyricsWe'll dress your guts up
Convince you to stay
At first we will rush
But that's coz we're both afraid
Forget about trust
We'll toughen you up
You've got the right stuff
You're rolling with the guys...NOW
You chewed on the crust
That's soaked in your gut
We'll stress your guts up
You're rolling with the guys...NOW
You're rolling with the guys...NOWEmbed
