Lips LyricsDie, die, die, your lips a big lie
You lie all the time, but you still get by
You bite your tongue, but you don't comply
You lie all the time and you still get by
Dry your tears away with your tie
You drive that truck, but you're still let by
Shut that trap, your drivel is dry
Drop, drop, drop, your lips a big lieEmbed
