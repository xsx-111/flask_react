Sweetheart LyricsOh juicy friend I can't pay the bills, I ate the food and swallowed the pills
The bleach so thin so that there's no point, I'll shave the walls and kick a stone
Crawl the floor for blims and scabs, I'll get a job when I grow old
It's fun to lose a few i'm told. The thought of kissing anything
Reminds me that I have become thin
Eating fruit reminds me of ragging girls
I love the sound of bass and fear I want to live for twenty years
When I die of a fast fun death there will be nothing I have left
I love my friends and I am loved I'll keep these thoughts for when 'm lost again
In this tunnel there is only back and forth
This is the boy that I was taught. I love my fam they are divorced
I am the nutter and I love the forceEmbed
