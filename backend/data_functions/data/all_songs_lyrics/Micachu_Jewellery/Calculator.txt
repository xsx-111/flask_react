Calculator LyricsGrab your calculator
You'll be needing that sooner or later
'Cause I don't think I can work this one out
No I don't think you can work this one out
Walk into the future
You're controlled by your computer
But I think I'm going to sit this one out
Yes you might wish you were no longer about
Consider this your final kiss
'Cause after this we'll slip your disc
Consider this your final piss
Into the wind is where it will drip
They don't care who knows you
It's getting near it's closure
And they know when you will be leaving your house
And they also know the reason why you're out
So grab your calculator
You'll be needing that sooner or later
'Cause I don't think I can work this one out
Yes I think I'm going to sit this one out
Consider this your final kiss
'Cause after this we'll slip your disc
Consider this your final piss
'Cause after this you are dismissedEmbed
