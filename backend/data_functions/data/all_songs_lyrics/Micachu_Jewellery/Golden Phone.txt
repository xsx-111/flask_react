Golden Phone LyricsThis is the Golden Phone, can you ring me back?
Ten mongrels home alone bring the panic back
Sound travelled in the air then they blew it back
They took out all the noise and it all went black
How could they even care it's a nonsense sound
This sound is everywhere but it can't be found
Find Nancy fool around and the noise went white
It built the warmth back and there was light
Crimes everywhere yeah, but I don't want that
Love's all around yeah, but I don't want that
Gold in my hair yeah, but I don't want that
Bring me that nonsense sound and I'll be back
Well, crushed up bit of stuff, can you pull their ear?
Their legs are far too stiff and they can't get near
I'll make this call back to you in a year
Mongrels, this nonsense sound won't disappear
Crimes everywhere yeah, but I don't want that
Love's all around yeah, but I don't want that
Gold in my hair yeah, but I don't want that
Bring me that nonsense sound and I'll be backEmbed
