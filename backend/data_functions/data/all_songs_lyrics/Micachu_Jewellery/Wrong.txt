Wrong LyricsI think my love has gone
I worked hard all night long
Can't tell anyone
I think my love is wrong
Muscle art it will do you in
But if I pierce your heart
It is bound to sting
Think I'll shrug it on
How long 'til I belong
I'll gain complete control
Take on anyone
Muscle art it will do you in
But if I pierce your heart
It is bound to sting
Muscle art it will do you in
But if I pierce your heart
It is bound to sting
I'm so tired
My muscles ache
And I'm so bored
That my heart can't break
I think my body's strong
I think it turns you wrong
I think I'm inside out
I'll correct any wrong
Muscle art it will do you in
But if I pierce your heart
It is bound to sting
Muscle art it will do you in
But if I pierce your heart
It is bound to sting
I'm so tired
My muscles ache
And I'm so bored
That my heart can't breakEmbed
