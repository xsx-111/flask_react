Vulture LyricsVulture, vulture, don't make me laugh
That poisonous drink was just a half
Half of my leg is still half my calf
You'd have to drink that
18 times
Skeletal talk is not the way
To turn me into your bird of prey
Grab my things to flood away
You'd have to drink that
18 times
Soldier, soldier put guns away
You're still a bird and I'm still okay
You'll eat my bones up right away
You'd have to eat that
18 times
Poker poker rules still apply
You can't cheat me out of my silver pie
When you eat me up I'll surely die
You have to beat that
18 times
You can't eat me, I'm still not dead
You can't beat greed, it's confident
You can't eat me, I'm still not dead
You can't beat greed, it's confident
Vulture, vulture, don't make me laugh
That poisonous drink was just a half
Half of my leg is still half my calf
You'd have to drink that
18 times
Skeletal talk is not the way
To turn me into your bird of prey
Grab my things to flood away
You'd have to drink that
18 times
You can't eat me, I'm still not dead
You can't beat greed, it's confident
You can't eat me, I'm still not dead
You can't beat greed, it's confidentEmbed
