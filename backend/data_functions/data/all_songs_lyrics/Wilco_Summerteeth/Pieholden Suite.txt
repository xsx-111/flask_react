Pieholden Suite Lyrics
There's a whisper
I would like to breathe into your ear
But I'm too scared
To get that close to you right now

There are dreams we might have shared
And I still care
And I still love you
But you know how I've been untrue

In the beginning
We closed our eyes
Whenever we kissed
We were surprised
To find so much inside2Embed
