Summer Teeth Lyrics
Like a cloud his fingers explode
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
His hearts in a bowl behind the bank
And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries
While his shoes get cold

It's just a dream he keeps having
And it doesn't seem to mean anything
And it doesn't seem to mean anything

One summer, a suicide
Another autumn, a traveler's guide
He hits snooze twice before he dies
And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries
While his shoes get cold


He feels lucky to have you here
In his kitchen, in your chair
Sometimes he forgets that you're even there
