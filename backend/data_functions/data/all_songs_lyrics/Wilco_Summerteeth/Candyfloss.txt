Candyfloss LyricsI'm the boy that looks excited
I'm the boy that's gonna fall apart
Candyfloss, a plot device
I'm the boy that eats his heart out
I know I should be more careful
I know I should watch where I've been
Candyfloss, she's a safe cracker
She kissed me first and then broke in
We slip and slide on the stay-together landmine
I make my mind up to never be myself
And every time I make a rhyme
I live my life for someone else
Oh-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa-whoa
She's in the kitchen
With bitter diamond drunk
(She's in the way)
I'm on the sofa
(I'm in the way)
Hoping she leaves that punk
'cause
I'm the boy with the poetry power
I'm the boy, smells like flowers
Every time I make a rhyme
I live my life like I wasn't invited
Oh-whoa-whoa
She's in the way
I'm in the way
I'm the boy that looks excited
I'm the boy that's gonna fall apart
Candyfloss, she kissed me first
And I'm the boy, don't get me started
I know I should be more careful
I know I should watch where I've been
Candyfloss, she's a safe cracker
She kissed me first, then broke in
Oh-whoa-whoaEmbed
