ELT Lyrics
I, I should've been listening
To every word you said
Oh, what have I been missing
Wishing, wishing that you were dead
I didn't mean to be so stupid
So far from home
Oh, what have I been learning
By being all alone

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
(Is gonna) Just tears you apart

When, when we were younger
Sleep while I'm awake
I was trying to keep the door locked
I realize that's a mistake


Every little thing that you do
Seems so much better than I could do
Oh, I should've been listening
To every word you said
