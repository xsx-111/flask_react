My Darling Lyrics
Go back to sleep now, my darling
And I'll keep all the bad dreams away
Breathe now, think sweet things
And I'll think of all the right words to say

Because we made you, my darling
With the love in each of our hearts
We were a family, my darling
Right from the start

Grow up now, my darling
Please don't you grow up too fast
And be sure, darling
To make all the good times last
