In a Future Age Lyrics
Genuine day will come
When the wind decides to run
And shakes the stairs that stab the wall
And turns the page in a future age

Some trees will bend and some will fall
But then again so will us all
Let's turn our prayers into outrageous dares
And mark our page in a future age

High above
The sea of cars
And barking dogs
In fenced-in yardsEmbed
