Times to Die Lyrics
All of my friends are getting married
All of my friends are right with God
All of my friends are making money
But art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves
I think I’m gonna build a giant hotel
Lest we be scattered, I’ll stack it sky-high
It’s not symbolic, it’s just human nature
Under the foundations, there is a graveyard

We’ve all had better times to die
We’ve all seen better times to die
We’ve all had better times to die
We all had better times to die

“Get a job!”
Job lying in bed while all his friends chant
“You must’ve done something wrong!”
But he just keeps singing this song

We’ve all had
Better times to di-
We’ve all seen better time-
We’ve all had better times to
We’ve all had
We’ve all had
We’ve- better times to die
(We all had better times to die)
We’ve all seen better times to die
We’ve all had better times to
We’ve all seen better times to die
We’ve all had better times
Got to have faith in the one above me
Got to believe that Lombardi loves me
It’s a deal
I want a deal
Let’s cut a covenant

And when they took him to the temple
Oh, then they fed him to the devil
And when they took him to their temple
Oh then they fed him to their devils
And when they took him to the table
(Hey man we listened to your demos!)
Before they fed him to their devils
And when they took him to the temple
(Hey man we listened to your demos!)
Oh then they listened to his demos

Most of the time I’m just getting older
But I’ll get to heaven standing on your shoulders
So many people you know that could make you
They say kid you’re good, but do you have what it takes to be
Invited into the divine council?
Invited into the divine council?
Invited into the divine council?
Invited into the divine...
We’ve all had better times to die
We’ve all seen better times to die
We’ve all had better times to die
We all had better times to die

Invited into the divine council
Invited into the divine council
Invited into the divine council
Invited into the divine…
Invited into the divine council
Invited into the divine council
Invited into the divine council
Invited into the divine…

Would you give it all up if there was another scene?
Would you kill it to see and to be seen?
Would you give it all up if you had another scene?
Would you kill it to see or to be seen?

Is it harder to speak when you're holding the machine?
Is it harder to sleep when you can hear him breathe?
Is it harder to speak when you're holding the machine?
Is it harder to sleep when you can feel him breathe?
