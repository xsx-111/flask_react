Sunburned Shirts Lyrics
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't picked up the phone for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't picked up the phone for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
(I haven't been outside)
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
(I haven't been outside)
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
(I haven't been outside)
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
(I haven't been outside)
People here bang on the walls late at night
People here, their smiles are all growing teeth
People here, they're here to die
Can you help me get out of the city?
People here, they lock their doors nice and tight
People here, their smiles are all growing teeth
People here, they're here to die
Can you help me get out of the city?
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to5Embed
