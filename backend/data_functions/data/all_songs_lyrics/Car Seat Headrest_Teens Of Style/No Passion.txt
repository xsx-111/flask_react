No Passion Lyrics
I never feel
I can never feel
Oh, I was cut open
And now I can never feel

I don't want to do this, I am thinking
Like a child, I am speaking
To no one, spitting words out like dirt
In the morning I'm a corpse
Draft my emails to the corporation
"You're saving my life every day, God bless you"
There's no way out for cowards
Suicide is embarrassing
The whole town at your door
"Come back David we need you"
I just needed more money
More time, more love
All my desires are so poorly drawn now

I never feel
I can never feel
Oh, I was cut open
And now I can never feel
I know who stole my face
But I don't know who will replace it
Now I'm still alive, but I got no perspective
When the album is over
I will go to bed sober
I've got plenty of love, but nothing to show for it
In my wildest sexual dreams I dream
That I'm watching porn, but there's too much sunlight
Shining on my laptop monitor
So I can't see anything with any amount of clarity

I never feel
I can never feel
Oh, I was cut open
And now I can never feel3Embed
