Oh! Starving Lyrics
Goodbye secret files
When I'm gone, all this information will die
Goodbye stupid smiles
When you're gone, all anyone will do is cry

I used to enjoy losing money
But now all I do is win
And now it's far too easy to be satisfied with things
I used to enjoy being worried
But now everything is fine
I wish I could go back to that unhappier time

Cats crawl into gutters
Just at the sight of me
(I'm not happy unless I'm unhappy)
You guys got mad skills
I just got mad
(I'm not happy unless I'm unhappy)

I used to enjoy losing money
But now all I do is win
And now it's far too easy to be satisfied with things
I used to enjoy being worried
But now everything is fine
I wish I could go back to that unhappier time
Goodbye all you secret files
When I'm gone, all this information will die
(Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
Goodbye all you human styles
When I'm gone, I won't have it in me to try
(try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try)

To try
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
To try (Goodbye)
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
To try (Goodbye)
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
To try (Goodbye)
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
To try (Goodbye)
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
To try (Goodbye)
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
To try (Goodbye)
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
Good try
Good try
