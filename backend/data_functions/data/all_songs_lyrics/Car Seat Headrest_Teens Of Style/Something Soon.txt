Something Soon Lyrics
Biting my clothes to keep from screaming
Taking pills to keep from dreaming
I want to break something important
I want to kick my dad in the shins
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I want to close my head in the car door
I want to sing this song like I'm dying
Heavy boots on my throat, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
I can't talk to my folks, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
All of my fingers are froze, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
Only one change of clothes, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
My head is, my head is, my head is
Stay inside all this winter
Filling out forms from a busted printer
I want to talk like Raymond Carver
(An advertisement cries out)
I want to turn down the goddamn TV
("He should have gone to Jared's")
Binging on the latest sitcom
Feeling guilty every second it's on
I want to put my foot through a window
(I document my mind loss)
I want to romanticize my headfuck
(Through instruments of wordplay)
Heavy boots on my throat, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
I can't talk to my folks, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
All of my fingers are froze, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
Only one change of clothes, I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
My head is, my head is, my head is
My head is, my head is, my head is
Let's burn this house down (x a lot)14Embed
