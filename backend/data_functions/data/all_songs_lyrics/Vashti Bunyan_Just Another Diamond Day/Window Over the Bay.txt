Window Over the Bay LyricsI wish I had a window over the bay
And a black horse grazing on the green all day
I wish I had a well to draw my water from
And a warm log fire for when the summer is gone
I wish I had a window over the bay
And a flock of white sheep to watch from where I lay
I wish I had a little boat bobbing on the deep
And a big wooden table all laid out for tea
I wish I had a window over the bay
And a dreamy eyed cow to fill my milking pail
I wish I had a cockerel to raise me at dawn
And a little bed to sleep in when the curtains are drawnEmbed
