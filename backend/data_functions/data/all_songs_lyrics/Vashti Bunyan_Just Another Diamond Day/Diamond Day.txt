Diamond Day LyricsJust another diamond day
Just a blade of grass
Just another bale of hay
Hope the horses pass
Just another field to plough
Just a grain of wheat
Just a sack of seed to sow
And the children eat
Just another life to live
Just a word to say
Just another love to give
And a diamond day3Embed
