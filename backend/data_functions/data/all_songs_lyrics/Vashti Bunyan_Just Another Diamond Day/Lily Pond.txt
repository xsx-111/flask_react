Lily Pond LyricsIn a lily pond I lay
All upon a summer's day
Then I chased a dragonfly
All across an ancient sky
Falling with a thousand stars
Down the Milky Way to Mars
Back again in time for day
In a lily pond I lay
The only thing he said to me
Was: "Young lady, I love thee"
In a lily pond I lay
All upon a summer's day
Then I chased a dragonfly
All across an ancient sky
Falling with a thousand stars
Down the Milky Way to Mars
Back again in time for day
In a lily pond I layEmbed
