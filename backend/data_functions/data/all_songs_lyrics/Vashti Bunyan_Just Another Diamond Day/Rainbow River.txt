Rainbow River LyricsThe rainbow river is a laughing stream
Down in a valley by a mountain that is pine tree tall
The rainbow river has a small boy fishing with a worm
And a jam jar by the waterfall
Don't make a sound, don't disturb the ground
The biggest fish you ever saw is around
And the rainbow river gives a rainbow fish
As one small boy goes running proudly to his mother's call
The stone built farmhouse is a rough stone cottage
Hiding close against the hillside, up a winding track
The stone built farmhouse has a fair-haired farmer
Wearing wooden shoes and building up a new haystack
Run in the door, stand on the stone floor
The oven opens, there's the biggest loaf you ever saw
And the stone built farmhouse gives a good warm welcome
As he sits down in his own chair with a Windsor back
The magpie meadow is a glowing evening colour
Sun is setting quietly and the boy is tired
The magpie meadow has a sparrow hawk who hovers
Hanging on the wind, preying eagle eyed
Sit by the lantern, watch as the years turn
Slowly bringing truth for every child to learn
And the magpie meadow darkens gently blue now
As the family sit, their faces lit by ember fire1Embed
