Come Wind Come Rain LyricsCome wind, come rain, we're off again
Our muddy boots plod down the lane
The snow has snowed, now the grass has growed
And it's time that we were on the road
The mare is shod, the miles untrod
Between us and the land of God
We're on our way and every day
Is another ten miles and an armful of hay
Hey, ho, the wind and the rain
It's another ten miles and a pocket of grain
Come wind, come rain, we're off again
Our muddy boots plod down the lane
The snow has snowed, the grass has growed
And it's time that we were on the road
Hey, ho, the wind and the rain
The passers-by wave their arms and grin1Embed
