Glow Worms LyricsGlow worms show the path we have to tread
Dreamers, we should be asleep in bed
Moving slowly through the springtime air
Holding moments in the depth of care
Holding moments in the depth of care
Whisper fairy stories till they're real
Wonder how the night could make us feel
Loving, living more with love to stay
Long past sadness that was in our way
Long past sadness that was in our way
Dawntime mist begins reflecting light
Waking sun, we'll soon forget our night
Love me through the day and I'll with you go
Into summer and the next year's snow
Into summer and the next year's snow3Embed
