Timothy Grub LyricsMaurice Snail and Timothy Grub
Swanney and Blue and Emily Grub
Decided one day to go into the wood
And build them a house and live there if they could
And they stayed there a while in the trees and the rain
Till one day two blue men said, "You're all insane"
And to please not come here again
They had a green car called Happiness Runs
Friday comes and Happiness runs
Out of petrol and everyone gets out to push
And suddenly see through a gap in the bush
A real caravan just like the one in their dreams
The gypsy doesn't want it for nowadays it seems
His home stays in one place and gleams
He told them that he had a horse down the lane
Saturday morning they went back again
He showed them a shed that was built out of tin
He opened the door and they all peered within
And there lying in straw was a horse black as night
With a star on her forehead and eyes full of light
And they all fell in love at first sight
They thought and they thought about having Black Bess
Timothy planted some mustard and cress
They lived in a cupboard and made it their home
And lay there and dreamed of the days when they'd roam
Up and down all the hills of the north countryside
With the dogs eating buttercups on the wayside
And they'd wave all the cities goodbyeEmbed
