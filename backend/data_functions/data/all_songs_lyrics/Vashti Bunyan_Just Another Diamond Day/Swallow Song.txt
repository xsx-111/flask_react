Swallow Song LyricsAnd there's a sunset brimming over the sky
And there's a swallow teaching it's young how to fly
Up on high
See how fast the summer passes by
And there's an oak leaf turning green into brown
And there's a pine so proud of her evergreen gown
Looking down
See how fast the winter comes around
And there's a rain cloud passing over our heads
And there's a cat on the doorstep waiting to be fed
Milk and bread
Day is done and now it's time for bedEmbed
