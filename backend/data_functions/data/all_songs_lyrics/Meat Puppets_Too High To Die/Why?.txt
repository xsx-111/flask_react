Why? LyricsWhy must I move so slow
In my heart I can't let it go
And dreams fall into my eyes
In the night I got no disguise
Why does it seem to go
Always from my side
Seems we will never know
Always asking why
Please let us stop this now
No it don't matter anyhow
My heart's sole reality
Is the world's triviality
Why does it seem to go
Always from my side
Seems we will never know
Always asking why
I know that it's over now
But I still want it anyhow
My heart's trivialities
Are the world's sole realities
Why does it seem to go
Always from my eyes
Seems we will never know
Always asking why
Why does it seem to go
Always from my side
Seems we will never know
Always asking why
Always asking why
Always asking whyEmbed
