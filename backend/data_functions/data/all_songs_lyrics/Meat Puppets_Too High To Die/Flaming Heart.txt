Flaming Heart LyricsPraise the sight
Someone dropped a ball on me
Damn the wind
Giving life to sails
Human sin
Couldn't stir a fire in me
Damn the night
As the powders fail
And one beam of light is falling
From a single crazy eye
And it sweeps the inside sky
From east to right
Flaming heart, burning out
Pray tonight
Someone slaps a name on me
Damn the sight
Painted on my eyes
Back to life
Passing through the wall to me
Feel the fire
Violet, black, and white
And one beam of light is falling
From a single crazy eye
And it sweeps the inside sky
From east to right
Flaming heart, burning out
Late tonight
Someone pinned a tail on me
Later on
Someone robbed me blind
Took my life
Took my box of chicken teeth
Take the blame
Trusted enemyEmbed
