Things LyricsShadowed is the game
Rodent be thy claim
Any open door
Leads to instant things
Make me go away
Take me to a place
Do some things to me
Make me go away
Ancient things design
Make me go away
Over is the game
Captured have you been
Twisted was part two
Ageless is the end
Things we must not do
Must not walk through walls
Also also don't
Do some things we did
Is this thing an oak?
What kind of a tree
This here must be swept
Must do instant things
The smell of blue perfume
Present in design
I've a need to talk
Let us speak of things
Nothing do I know
But loudly do I ring
Also also don't
Do some things we did
Make me go awayEmbed
