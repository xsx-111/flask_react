Shine LyricsYou got wings on your fingers
In the middle of a bottle is a little of the way you talk
And you shine
And you shine
You got cobwebs on your halos
In the closet there are skeletons lined up ready to talk
And they shine
And they shine
Fade, fade into what
Made into hours
And pulled into lines
Lines
You got a ring 'round your finger
And a heart in the bottle that never really learned to talk
And they shine
And they shine
Fade, fade into what
Made into hours
And pulled into lines
Lines
You got brickbats on your beltway
In the middle is a puzzle with the pieces that have turned to slop
And they shine
And they shine
Fade, fade into what
Made into hours
And pulled into lines
Lines
You got wings on your fingers
In the middle of a bottle is a little of the way you talk
And you shine
And you shine
And you shine
And you shineEmbed
