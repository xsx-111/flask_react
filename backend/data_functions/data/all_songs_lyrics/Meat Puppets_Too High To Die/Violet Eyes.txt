Violet Eyes LyricsMother master, some things must be
Plastic master, this is for free
You give off a dark
Seems larger than life
Violet eyes
Plastic master, smoke drifts from a rose
Timber empire, able to explode
Cut open the box
Out rushes the night
Violet eyes
Plastic baby, rope drifts through open holes
Robot Kingdom, fables will explode
Cut open the box
Out rushes the night
Violet eyesEmbed
