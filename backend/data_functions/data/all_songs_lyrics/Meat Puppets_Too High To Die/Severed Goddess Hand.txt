Severed Goddess Hand LyricsThe horizon breaks to pieces
And the mainline is the twilight
And the giant net has a perfect window
Passage through has the ticket screaming
I want a mind
I'll tell you what I find
No severed goddess hand
No plaster in my eye
No picture of a lamb
No goddess hand have I
I'm a picture of a goddess
Of a planet in the window
Through a tiny hole in the giant curtain
I have watched while it stood undressing
I want more eyes
I wanna see more lies
No severed goddess hand
No plaster in my eye
No picture of a lamb
No goddess hand have I
Ahh
In the silence of the neurons
Where the pathway has been printed
There's a gleaming hope for an understanding
Timing's gone and there's been no planning
Two heads, one dream
Two-thirds a crowd it seems
No severed goddess hand
No plaster in my eye
No picture of a lamb
No goddess hand have I
No severed goddess hand
No plaster in my eye
No picture of a lamb
No goddess hand have I1Embed
