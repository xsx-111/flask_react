Farewell, Mona Lisa (Demo) LyricsWash it down the drain
Drown the dream
Wash your smile down
Wash it down the drain please
Like animals destined for fuel or observance
Our role is clear never stray far from the path
Everything must have an end
But what am I supposed to say?
Oh sorry I guess I forgot
You think you could tell me again?
Please?
I don't remember
What am I supposed to think?
What am I supposed to feel?
There's no feeling in this place
The echoes of the past speak louder
Than any voice I hear right now
Don't you ever try to be
More than you were destined for
Or anything worth fighting for
There's no feeling in this place
There's no feeling in this place
Feeling in this place
What did you expect?
That we would never leave home?
That we would never leave?
What did you expect?
That we would never leave home?
That we would never leave?
That we would never leave?
That we would never leave?
That we would never leave?
What did you expect from us?
We're murderers!
Murderers and liars and rapists and thieves!
You should never put your trust in any of us
There is nothing to gain from this interference
Don't you ever try to be
More than you were destined for
Or anything worth fighting for
There's no feeling in this place
The past speaks louder than anything I hear right nowEmbed
