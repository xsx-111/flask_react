Gold Teeth on a Bum LyricsDon't see you ever do without
Leper
Forced to feel pitiful
And how clever
You call him pretty
And blessed child (Blessed!)
Now see how the pretty boy
Runs wild (Running!)
It's just an ordinary day
I know how to fix you
If you come my way
You are the proud and simple man (Simple!)
Now run as fast as I know you can (You can!)
Trick me with your deaf, dumb and blind (Dumb and!)
Feigned hero daily disguise (Disguise!)
It's just like every other day
But I know how to fix you
Should you come my way
Pull out your teeth and stare
With your hands at your share
Pull out your eyes and stare
With your hands at your share
(You call him pretty and blessed child)
You call him pretty
And blessed child (Blessed!)
Now see how the pretty boy
Runs wild (Running!)
It's just an ordinary day
I know how to fix you
If you come my way
It's just like every other day!
But I know how to fix you
Should you come my way
Pull out your teeth and stare
With your hands at your share
Pull out your eyes and stare
With your hands at your share
You are the first one to fall down
You are the first one to cry foul
You are the first one to point the blame
You are the last one to feel ashamed
Couldn't you help me so that I may believe?
Couldn't you show me so that I may be saved?
Couldn't you help me so that I may believe?
Couldn't you show me so that I may be saved?
Couldn't you help me so that I may believe?
Couldn't you show me so that I may be saved?
Couldn't you help me so that I may believe?
Couldn't you show me so that I may be saved?
Couldn't you help me so that I may believe?
Couldn't you show me so that I may be save-Embed
