Endless Endings LyricsNothing but the nerves
Shuddering the sun and moon
Nothing but illusions
Endless endings
Endless endings
Driving on empty for too long
Driving on empty for too long
How soon did you...
How soon did you know we were gone?
How soon did you know we were dead and gone?
What time did you wake up today?
Was there a dream you tried to take back?
We could have left so long ago
We could have left so long ago
When everyone around us said so
How fast we assemble?
How could you go when I was trying to leave?
How could you go when I was trying to leave?
How could I go when you were trying to leave?
When did you know that we were gone?
When did you know that we were dead and gone?
How fast we assemble?
Endless endings
Seems we tried everything
We tried it allEmbed
