Crystal Morning LyricsCheering crowds deify their waste
Making love to their disgrace
After so much how could you not
Fall asleep, dream and die
Fit for nothing dead where you lay
All the nights of broken glass
Drown the screaming
Choke your breath and hide
To pass the time
When the wrath comes
Where will they turn?
All these nights of broken glass
This vision soon will pass
Soon will pass
All the way from hell to here
This is an act of vengeance
They say the end is near
Well let it start
Let it start now
It is not you who will die
Only the world that will end
It is not you who will die
Only the world that will end
So let it start
Don't live to pay
Load up the gun
And blow them away
Let it start nowEmbed
