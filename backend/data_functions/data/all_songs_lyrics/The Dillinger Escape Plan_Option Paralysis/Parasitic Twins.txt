Parasitic Twins LyricsI feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
My beating pulse crawls to a strange height
Please calm it down
I need a strong pull from your little lies
Or I'm going down
'Cause I built it all up from the inside
And you burned it down
'Cause when you took your love away
You let go
I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
Although I miss you I'll never say I do
Bleed like the rain that's falling
Cut me through and through
I'd seen it all hiding in plain sight
And I held it down
But I'll give you all that you deserve tonight
'Cause you earned it when you burned me down
'Cause when you took your love away
You let go
I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
Although I miss you I would never ever say I do
Bleed like the rain
Like the rain that falls upon my skin
Then you just gave our love away
You just let go
Then you just gave our love away
You just let go (You just let go, you just let go)
Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin (Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin)
