Good Neighbor LyricsSo there you are
Until the dawn
Still whistling
That same old song
Happy all the time
Now she gives the shoulder
Look into her eye
You cannot control her
Look into her eye
You cannot control her
Smile and nod your head
You are the cause of it
This is not your dream
This is not your dream
Hey there you fucking bum
Look what you have become
No secrets without walls
A social free-for-all
Come on and get it all for free
Just hit that fucking key
Your long term memory
Pushed aside
I'm not evaporating (Pushed aside!)
Let them sit gorged and frozen (Pushed aside!)
In their immediacy (Pushed aside!)
(Suicide!) by way of information
So there you are
Until the dawn
So there you are
Until the dawn
(Suicide!) by way of
(Suicide!) by way of
(Suicide!) by way of informationEmbed
