Room Full of Eyes LyricsAnd in the end
I'm sure I'll know it's
My mistake
We're forsaken
And in the end
I'm sure I'll know it's
My mistake
We're forsaken
And on the last day
I'll play turn your eyes
I still must surface
There's a price to pay
There's a price to pay
How long can we wait?
I can't see anyway
This could be healthy to do
I guess I hoped we could find another way
To just get through
And sometimes I'm feelin' that
That I should find a way out of this mess
Oh, I guess we'll make a way
This isn't healthy to do
I guess I hope we can find another way
To just get through
This is none of your business
Your business, this is not
This is none of your business
This is some of your business
There is nowhere to hide
In a room so full of eyes
Until we die we're never satisfied
We'll lust for and feed the dissatisfaction of want and need
Oh, yeah...
Can I tell you a secret?
While your voice hung thick in the waves
You were mistaken if you thought I could behave
I was not afraid
But little honey I needed
I needed a reminder from you
There sure ain't nothin' like the sight of your fine skin
From across the room
Oh, yeah!!
This sure seems so familiar
The same feelings that I thought I had lost
We're only waiting to come in through another door at another cost
And why?
'Cause we reap what we sow and it's a difficult crop
But we keep cutting down
Yet it grows again
Still it grows againEmbed
