Will the Sun Rise LyricsIn the name of liberty, we set off to the sea
In the name of glory, fighting to be free
But one mistake can set it all to rest
No one sees and no one wins the game of chance
I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise another day
A simple answer, that all of us should see
Let things be what they may be
Open your eyes, do you think that you're the best
Try to see the light before the final test
I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise another day
Someone is watching, waiting to see
If there's a chance before the sun fades for eternity
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise another day
Will the sun rise, I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, I need to know
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise
Will the sun rise
When it's overEmbed
