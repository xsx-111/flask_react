Unchain the Night LyricsI've been lost in the middle
Always trying to find the wishing well
Running around in circles
Never crossing the line
Don't want to touch you
Don't want to see
You've got a knife in your heart
Don't say that you did it for me
Never unchain the night
Don't tell me that the love is gone
Never unchain the night
Cause there's always another turn
You know right where you want it
But you never gave it in return
Running me in circles
Always crossing the line
Don't want to touch you
Leave you confused
You took the easy way out
When you looked through the eyes of a fool
Never unchain the night
Don't tell me that the love is strong
Never unchain the night
Cause there's always another turn
Never, never
Never, never
Never unchain the night
Don't tell me that the love is gone
Never unchain the night
I'm never gonna set you free
Never unchain the night
Don't tell me that the love is gone
Never unchain the night
Cause there's always another turn
Never unchain the nightEmbed
