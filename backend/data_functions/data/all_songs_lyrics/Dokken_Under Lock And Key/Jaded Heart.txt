Jaded Heart LyricsI didn't know you, but I could see it in your eyes
Shattered dreams and hopes, you'd been hurt too many times
Well I've heard your past from a friend I'd seen today
Told me of your heart, that you had been away
How I wish I could take you away
I would show you that my love's not the same
But I see I've found you too late
Jaded heart
You look but don't see
Love in front of you
You can't believe
Jaded heart
Love can't get to you
To bring your heart to me
I realize you've heard it all before
Lies and promises, you don't listen anymore
How I hope that I will find a way
To break down all these walls that you have made
But my eyes see that it's too late
Jaded heart
You look but don't see
Love in front of you
You can't believe
Jaded heart
Jaded heart
Love can't get to you
To bring your heart to me
How I wish that I could take you away
I would show you that my love's not the same
Can it be that I found you too late
Jaded Heart
You look but don't see
Love in front of you
You can't believe
Jaded Heart
Love can't get to you
To bring your heart to meEmbed
