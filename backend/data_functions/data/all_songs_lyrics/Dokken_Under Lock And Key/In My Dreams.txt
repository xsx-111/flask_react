In My Dreams LyricsIn my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
Toss and turn all night
In the sheets
But I can't sleep
Night after night
Don't know what it means
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back
We're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away
In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be
Calling your name
But you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles
Waiting to see you
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back
We're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away
In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be
In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be
In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You'll always be
In my heart and
In my dreams
In my dreams
It's still the same
In my dreams
You're still by me
In my dreams
Just the way it used to be
In my dreams
What can I say
In my dreams
You're still by me
And in my dreams
You'll always be
In my dreams
You'll always be
In my dreams
Your love is strong
In my dreams
You're still the same
