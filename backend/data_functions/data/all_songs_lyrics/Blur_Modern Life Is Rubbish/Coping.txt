Coping Lyrics
Primal, evil, what am I?
Tongue-tied 'til the day I die
There's no love made with mermaids
It's just distraction, so they say

And I'm too tired to care about it
Can't you see this in my face, my face?

When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?

It's a sorry state you're getting in
The same excuse is wearing thin
There's no self-control left in me
What was not will never will be

And I'm too tired to care about it
Can't you see this in my face, my face?

When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?
And I'm too tired to care about it
Can't you see this in my face?
The emphasis is on coping
Can't you see this in my face, my face?

When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange, can I go through this again?
(Can I be dreaming or am I just coping?)
