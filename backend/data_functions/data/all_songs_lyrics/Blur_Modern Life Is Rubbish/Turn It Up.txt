Turn It Up Lyrics
Kazoo, kazoo, you are mine
Kazoo, kazoo, every time

Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in

Anyway you choose
Anyway you choose at all
Some days you get too much
Some days it all gets too much

Kazoo, kazoo you are mine
Why do you turn your back on me?

Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in

Anyway you choose
Anyway you choose at all
Some days you do too much
Some days it all gets too much

Kazoo, kazoo, you are mine
Kazoo, kazoo, every time

Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in1Embed
