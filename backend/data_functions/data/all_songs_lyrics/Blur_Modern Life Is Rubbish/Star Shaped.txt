Star Shaped Lyrics
Wash with new soap behind the collar
Keeps a clean mental state
Don't usually bother in cold weather
But still I'm getting into work late
And I don't need the practice

I've been making plans (For the future)
Become an unconscious man (All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary (We don't think so, you seem star-shaped)

I have a couple at the weekend
Keeps up camaraderie
And my mind boggles in the muddle
At the possibilities
And I don't need the practice

I've been making plans (For the future)
Become an unconscious man (All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary (We don't think so, you seem star-shaped)
And I've been making plans (For the future)
Become an unconscious man (All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary (We don't think so, you seem star-shaped)
I wash with new soap behind the collar
Helps keep down the laundry
And now I bother in cold weather
Because it cleans me mentally
And I really don't need the practice

I've been making plans (For the future)
Become an unconscious man (All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary (We don't think so, you seem star-shaped)
I've been making plans (For the future)
Become an unconscious man (All for the good)
I feel so unnecessary (We don't think so, you seem star-shaped)3Embed
