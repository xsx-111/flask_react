Villa Rosie Lyrics
Practice doesn't make perfect when you're interbreeding
Speaking drivel, can it get confused with heavy breathing?
Mixing drinks at water holes get snarled up in the suburbs
Meandering through this and that, you're suspected of vagueness

When work is done, go to Villa Rosie every night
So tasty
Go form a queue at Villa Rosie every night
So tasty

Across the common every day, you come across the fine line
But wearing boots can prevent the leeches in the long grass
Eating between meals stifles the appetite, is it healthy?
Coming home, that nagging doubt there in your belly

And all the while at Villa Rosie every night
You're tasty
A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night
So taste

All losers come to Villa Rosie every night
They're waiting
So form a queue at Villa Rosie every night
So tasty
Don't break your own back at Villa Rosie every night
We're tasting
A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night
So tasty2Embed
