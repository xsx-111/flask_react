Advert Lyrics
Food processors are great!

It's six o'clock on the dot and I'm halfway home
I feel foul-mouthed as I stand and wait for the Underground
And a nervous disposition doesn't agree with this
I need something to remind me that there is something else

You need a holiday somewhere in the sun
With all the people who are waiting
There never seems to be one
Say something, say something else
Say something, say something else

Advertisements are here for rapid persuasion
If you stare too long, you lose your appetite
And a nervous disposition doesn't agree with this
You need fast relief from aches and stomach pains

I need a holiday somewhere in the sun
With all the people who are waiting
There never seems to be one
Say something, say something else
Say something, say something else
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen
(You can have a holiday in the sun, yes
Ladies and gentlemen, one week only, on special offer)

You need a holiday somewhere in the sun
With all the people who are waiting
There never seems to be one
Say something, say something else
Go on, say something, say something else
Say something, say something else
Say something, say something else6Embed
