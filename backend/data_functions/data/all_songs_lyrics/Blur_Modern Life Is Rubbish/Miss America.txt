Miss America Lyrics
Michael!

Miss America sits in the shower
She's plucking hours from the sky
Picks up the telephone into another home
Don't ask me why

I don't mind, I don't mind at all
I love only you

She's a well wisher and she wishes you well
Wish away, wish away
She no jellybean, she a Jemima, ho-ho
Wish away, wish away

I don't mind, I don't mind at all
I love only you
Da-da, da-da-do
Da-da, da-da-do

Here is here and I am here, where are you?
Far away, far away
She no jellybean, she a Jemima, ho-ho
Wish away, wish away
I don't mind, I don't mind at all
I love only you
Da-da, da-da-do
Da-da, da-da-do
Da-da, da-da-do2Embed
