Pressure on Julian Lyrics
Only the magical transit children
Sing-sing a lullaby, bah-bah-bah
Sitting on the pavement, sucking on a long straw
It's colourful, it's colourful, but it washes you out
Here is my violence and here is the excuse
I learnt it all, but only second-hand
Falling into walls, well, what is it with you?
You'd never know, never know, never know

We planned it all this way
We planned it all this way
Pressure on Julian

Swimming in yellow, pissy water
Sand getting in between the ears
No blood in head in this bloody weather
Irate people with yellow tongues
Only the magical transit children
Sing-sing a lullaby, bah-bah-bah
Falling into walls, well, what is it with you?
You'd never know, never know, never know

We planned it all this way
We planned it all this way
Pressure on Julian
There was pressure on Julian
Pushing trolleys in the car park
From B to A, then back to B
Pressure on Julian
He keeps passing out, poor little snout
The birds are singing at night
The birds are singing at night
Pressure on Julian

We planned it all this way
We planned it all this way
Pressure on Julian2Embed
