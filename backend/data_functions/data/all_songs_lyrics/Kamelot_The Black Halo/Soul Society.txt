Soul Society LyricsIf my soul could revive from my carnal remains
What does it matter to me
If it all fades to black, if I'm born once again
Then no one really is free
How could I be condemned for the things that I've done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know some things under the sun
Can never be understood
How can we believe in heaven
Human reason counters all
Ideas of a soul society
My life is just a fragment
Of the universe and all
There must be more than I can see
In the dark we're the same, in the concept of time
We're like a grain in the sand
And we strive for the flame as if death was our aim
Cause we cannot understand
How I wish there was a heaven
All for one and one for all
A flawless soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and all
There may be more than we can see
How could I be condemned for the things that I've done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know, some things under the sun
Can never be understood
How can we believe in heaven
All for one and one for all
Ideas of a soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and all
There may be more than we can seeEmbed
