The Haunting (Somewhere In Time) (Radio Edit) LyricsMerely the sound of your voice
Made me believe that
That you were her
Just like the river disturbs
...my inner peace
Once I believed I could find
Just a trace of her beloved soul
Once I believed she was all
Then she smothered my beliefs
One cold winter's night
I may follow her voice to the river
Somewhere in time
I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time
When no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep
How could that first time recur
When memories linger on and on
What made me think you were her
Helena is dead to all
Dead to all
Nothing can bring her to life
Don't pretend that I'll be loving you
Once I believed she was gone
I corrupted from within
Leave, leave me for now and forever
Leave while you can
Somewhere in time
I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time
When no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep
I was a liar in every debate
I rule the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly I'll go to sleep
Follow me into the light
Like ice on a lake of tears
I'll take you through
Leave me tonight
I've gone too far to begin all anew (Life fades in)
With someone like you
Somewhere in time
I will find you and love you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time
When no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep
I was a liar in every debate
I rule the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly I'll go to sleepEmbed
