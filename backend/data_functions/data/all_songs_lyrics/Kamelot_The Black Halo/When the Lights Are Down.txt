When the Lights Are Down LyricsRules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
I've come to soak my sorrow in halo black
As black as the seal on my soul
('Cause when the lights are down there's no more to say)
Love is the real pain
An internal revolution in our minds
(And when the lights are down you're so far away)
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite
(Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny)
What can protect me from the past
And all the things that I have done
She told me and then she was gone
(But when the lights are down there's no more to say)
Deep in the shadows
Where the last of my delusions made a stand
('Cause when the lights are down she'll take me away)
Tell me her real name
And in death we'll live the love we never had
Oh, come all ye faithful beneath the moon-beneath the moon
Into the void as one
Marching on
('Cause when the lights are down there's no more to say)
Love is the real pain
An internal revolution in our minds
('Cause when the lights are down she'll take me away)
Tell me her real name
And in death we'll live the love we never hadEmbed
