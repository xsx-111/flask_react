Epilogue LyricsOne other year has left my life
One year bygone so soon
These were the days I sacrificed
These days were lived for you
Some came with winter in white
Some days were blown away
Some came with sultry summer nights
Some with October rain
Oh, how I long for utter silence
But who am I to know
When rain will turn to snow?
If life brings another dayEmbed
