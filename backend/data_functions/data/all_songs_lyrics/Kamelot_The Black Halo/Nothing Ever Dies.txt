Nothing Ever Dies LyricsHere we are
Under the same old sun
All alone yet somehow bound and unified
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes won't take long
We search for a harbour
Somewhere to belong
They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone
There is a god in each society
So right is wrong where wrong is right
No one could be sure
Still we are certain
That what we know is truth
The only truth
We're building our temples taller
They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone
How can we trust them once again
They used to tell us lies
And their voices will sustain
'Cause nothing ever dies
Love, love is the only truth
Pure as the well of youth
Until it breaks your heart
You took me higher
Than the mountains I have climbed
You, you waited all your life for me
You left me all alone behind
But we'll meet again
We will meet again
All alone
Stuck without you
They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone
How can we trust them once again
They used to tell us lies
And their voices will sustain
'Cause nothing ever diesEmbed
