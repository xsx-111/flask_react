Serenade LyricsSongs of pain and soothing lullabies
Songs of happiness and some that make us cry
One song we share
The cross we all bear
One that segregates
One that unifies
All we wonder
No one ever denies
If once given life we must die
So bow down with me
Where summer fades into fall
And leave your hatchets of hate
Bow down with me
And sing the saddest of all
The song we all serenade
The more we know
The less we understand
Life... eternity
The savagery of man
We want it all
Aimed at the fall
What is destiny with the masterplan
All we wonder
No one ever denies
If once given life we must die
So bow down with me
Where summer fades into fall
And leave your hatchets of hate
Bow down with me
And sing the saddest of all
The song we all serenade
Hold on now
Don't leave don't let it go
Dance away the waltz of life
Right or wrong
The seed we never sow
That's our loss
Our sacrifice
What does the winter bring
If not yet another spring
So bow down with me
Where summer fades into fall
And leave your hatchets of hate
Bow down with me
And sing the saddest of all
The song we all serenadeEmbed
