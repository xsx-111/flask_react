March of Mephisto LyricsEnglish translation:
Aspirat primo fortuna labori The fortune is smiling at our first effort
Me duce tutus eris Let me lead you and you will be safe
Vox populi vox dei The voice of people, voice of god
Ad maiorem dei gloriam... For bigger glory of the god
Ad infinitum To the infinity
You know just who I am
Don't be so distant
'Cause when you're lost, I am solely there
To share your grief
Wailing your sorrow is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow, you're lonely, I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth
Now tell me all about your pain
Down to the detail
Don't say it's love
Your fragile heart feeds my contempt
Wailing your sorrow is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow, you're lonely, I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth
Chase the heathen call
We belong, you and I
Unison in all you deny
Wailing your sorrow is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow, you're lonely, I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth
I am the thorn in your side that seeks accomplishment
Reminding the mortal of death
I am the spore of your pride, an angel, Heaven-sent
The master of all
I am the urge of the fleshEmbed
