This Pain LyricsPushing for the limit of sanity
Pushing for the surface
So I can breathe
Dark is the night for us all, but some days
I feel the light crawling down these jagged walls
Blessed sunlight
Some of this pain is sole subjected
But what was I to do
Some of this pain will always stay
Deep and true
I left her with a warning, without protection
'Cause the human nature has its ways, with lust
With her back against the wall, she crumbled
Just a minute more would save her life
And even so, part of me
Blessed sunlight
Some of this pain is sole subjected
But what was I to do
Some of this pain will always stay
Deep and true
Some of this pain is sole subjected
But what was I to do
Some of this pain will always stay
Deep and true
I see her shame in my desire
It all took place too soon
Some of these wounds will always bleed
Over you
Over youEmbed
