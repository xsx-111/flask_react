Kick! - Single Version LyricsSee a nation on it's knees
And it's heritage dead
See a nation needing civilization
Just like a hole in the head
One race, today, one show, kick
So now you're trying it on me
But I'm aware of the plan
To save the man you have to kill the Indian
By simply shaking his hand
One race, today, one show
One race, today, one show
One race, today, one show, kickEmbed
