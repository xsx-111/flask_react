Kick! LyricsSee a nation on its knees
And its heritage dead
See a nation needing 'Civilization'
Like a hole in the head
One Race! Today! One Chant! Kick
So now you're trying it on me
But I'm aware of the plan
To save the 'man' you have to kill the 'indian'
By simply shaking his hand
One Race! Today! One Chant! Kick
One Race! Today! One Chant! Kick
One Race! Today! One Chant! Kick
One Race! Today! One Chant! KickEmbed
