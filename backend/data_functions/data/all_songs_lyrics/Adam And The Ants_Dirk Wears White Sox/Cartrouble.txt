Cartrouble LyricsHave you ever had a ride in a light blue car?
Have you ever stopped to think who's the slave and who's the master? (powpowpow)
Have you ever had trouble with your automobile?
Have you ever had to push push push push?
Cartrouble
You might have seen them very busy at the weekend (oh oh)
Licking and polishing the beep-beeps into shape
And then it's proudly up the M1 M2 M3
And keep your feet off the upholstery Ronnie
Cartrouble oh yeah
And remember this:
You don't need anything after an ice cream
I used to sit at home silently and wonder
Why all the preference is polishing the chrome
While all the mothers and the sisters and their babies
Sit and rot at home
Cartrouble oh yeah
And remember this: (on your way home)
You don't need anything after an ice cream
Car carcar trouble (x12)Embed
