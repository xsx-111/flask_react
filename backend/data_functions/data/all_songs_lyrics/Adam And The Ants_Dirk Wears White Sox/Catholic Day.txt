Poor John F-
Kennedy died in '63
Poor John F-
Kennedy died in '63
Poor John F-
Kennedy
Poor John F-
Kennedy
No more messing 'round, playing with Monroe
(Ohohoh playing with Monroe)
No more turning on the middle aged ladies
(Ohohoh the middle aged ladies)
All I remember was your sporty young hairstyle
(Ohohoh your sporty young hairstyle)
All I remember was the Catholic day
Kennedy died in '63
Poor John F-
Kennedy's wife with his brain on her knee
Poor Jackie-
Kennedy's wife with his brain on her knee
Poor Jackie-
Kennedy
Poor Jackie-
Kennedy
No more rocking chairs, sitting on the front porch
(Ohohoh sitting on the front porch)
No more soft drugs, playing the space race
(Ohohoh playing in the space race)
All I remember was your Levi's Sta-Prest
(Ohohoh your Levi's Sta-Prest)
All I remember was the Catholic day
For you and I are privileged to serve the great Republic
In what could be the most decisive decade in its long history
The choices we make, for good or ill
Will affect the welfare of generations yet unborn
I see the chickens have come home to roost (repeat 6x)
In the world beyond our borders
Steady progress has been made in building a world of order
The people of West Berlin remain free and secure
A settlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos
(BANG!)
No more messing 'round, playing with Monroe
(Ohohoh playing with Monroe)
No more turning on the middle-aged ladies
(Ohohoh the middle-aged ladies)
All I remember was your sporty young hairstyle
(Ohohoh your sporty young hairstyle)
All I remember was the Catholic day
