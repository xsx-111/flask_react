Illuminine LyricsSunday lights
Come take my nights
And I'll bend down
To my knees and die
Illuminate
My soul to take
Illuminine
Your clear cool wine
Going back alone
Your lovers light is home
Where the hallowed shine
The lights lighting the road
Monday cries
White clouds turn grey
But your perfect lights
Brings the sun to play
Illuminine
Your clear cool love
Your clear cool light
Morning comes awake
To your wildest dreams
Let the daylight break
Set the angels free
Sunday lights
Come take my nights
And I'll bend down
To my knees and dieEmbed
