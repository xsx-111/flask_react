Benediction LyricsWith benediction in her eyes
Our dearest gods are unsurprised
You better hold your lover down
Tie him to the ground
Whisper "I love you" one thousand times into his ear
Kiss his eyes and don't you cry girl, he won't disappear
But I know better than to let you go
With benediction in her eyes
She'll never get you back in time
You better hold your lover down
And tie her to the ground
Simple pleasures strike like lightning
Scratches spill her name
Thunder demons swipe her halo
Then they run away
But I know better than to let her go
With benediction in her eyes
Our dearest gods are not surprised
You better hold your lover down
And tie her to the ground
Simple pleasures strike like lightning
Scratches cross her name
Whisper "I love you, my darling"
Life is just a flame
But I know better than to let her go
I know better than to let you go
I know better than to let her go
I know better than to let you go
I know better
I know better
I know betterEmbed
