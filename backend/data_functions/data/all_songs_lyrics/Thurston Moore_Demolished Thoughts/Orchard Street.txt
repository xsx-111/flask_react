Orchard Street LyricsMilky cement light, radiation boys
Breaking happy heart, blood and liquid noise
I see your searchlight eyes, the stony demons bliss
Wet and drunken desire, dripping tears
Grape stained escape, an immortal kiss
Free jazz hotel, sweet now girl whispers
Crazy crazy crazy night sky orange
Promise and deceit, blindfolds and prayer
Orchard Street is anchored in divinity's shadowEmbed
