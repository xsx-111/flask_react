In Silver Rain With a Paper Key LyricsThere was a time when you could find him just by staring at the sky
A perfect stranger, out of nowhere, nothing to do, nothing to hide
And he disappears today, where he goes he cannot say
The silver rain is all you see, you lost your lover
It used to be so easy baby just to find you in the clear
But the streets have ghosts that call you back before you get too near
The days that dared to never end, you'd whisper baby please do it again
Now it's an echo without refrain you lost your lover
I seem to recall sometime last fall brown leaves crowned around your head
Now I'm back in town, and I'm looking around, will I ever see your eyes again?
Where did you disappear today, I turn the corner and I see you fade
In silver rain with a paper key, you lost your loverEmbed
