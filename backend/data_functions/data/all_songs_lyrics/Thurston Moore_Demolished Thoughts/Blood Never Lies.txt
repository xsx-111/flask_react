Blood Never Lies LyricsEvery time they come for you
You know it's time to run
Everybody knows it's true
How your love has come undone
Now he has his chance to take
And he will take you out of here
Take you to a secret state
Where blood is light and blood is clear
Every time they take you away
He knows you're never gone
You know you stole his heart away
And he falls into a freezing sun
Now he has to kidnap you
And keep you bound in endless light
And you know he never lets you leave
His blood is clear, it never liesEmbed
