All in the Name of Pity LyricsI smoked the shit that made you love
Drowned all your problems like a wife
Blanked out your anger with my face
Wasted my days to hide disgrace
I did it all, did it all
All in the name of pity
You loved to taunt me with your sex
Kicked up the memory in my head
Watch my neurosis building up
Swallowed the truth your mind forgot
You did it all, did it all
All in the name of pity
You did it all, did it all
All in the name of pity
In the name of pity
In the name of pity
In the name of pity
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
You tried and tried to use my life
To keep your aggresion trivialized
Never an ego in control
Now who's the shit that sold his soul, you know
You did it all, did it all
In the name of pity
You did it all, did it all
In the name of, yeah
You did it all, did it all
In the name of pity
In the name of pity
Oh in the name of pity, ohEmbed
