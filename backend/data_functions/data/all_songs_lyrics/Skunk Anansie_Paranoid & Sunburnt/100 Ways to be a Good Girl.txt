100 Ways to be a Good Girl LyricsI caused a major war just by talking
You flew into a rage, 'cos that's everything you know
Childhood of violence, filled with heartache
I flew into a rage, 'cos that's everything i know
I know 1oo ways to be a good girl
100 ways, my willingness to please
I know 100 ways to be a good girl
Still I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
Still I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
Shielded by unexpected fury
Frightened survivor in my world too shy to see
Softly i spoke softly I'm dying
Crushed by your power, by my willingness to bleed
I know 1oo ways to be a good girl
100 ways, my willingness to please
I know 100 ways to be a good girl
Still I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
Still I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
Crucify my with isolation
Crucify me-whoa-inside my private hellEmbed
