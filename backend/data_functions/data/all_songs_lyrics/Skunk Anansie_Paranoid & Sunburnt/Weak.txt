Weak LyricsLost in time, I can't count the words
I said when I thought they went unheard
All of those harsh thoughts, so unkind
'Cause I wanted you
And now I sit here, I'm all alone
So here sits a bloody mess, tears fly home
A circle of angels deep in war
'Cause I wanted you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Deep as I am, I'm no one's fool
Weak as I am
So what am I now? I'm love's last hope
I'm all of the soft words I once owned
If I opened my heart, there'd be no space for air
'Cause I wanted you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Deep as I am, I'm no one's fool
Weak as I am
In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?
In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?
In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am, weak as I am
Weak as I am, weak as I am, am, am
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I amEmbed
