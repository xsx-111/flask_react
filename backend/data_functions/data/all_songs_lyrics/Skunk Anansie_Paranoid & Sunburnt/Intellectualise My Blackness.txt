Intellectualise My Blackness LyricsI hit him with a piece of his philosophy
Anglo-Saxon muck in his type of greed
What did he do to deserve such hate
He tried to intellectualise my blackness
He tried to summarise, to institutionalise
Still I could recognise, he was materialised
He tried to intellectualise my blackness
To make it easier for his whiteness
He tried to intellectualise my blackness, ooh save me
He's always tryin' to make up for his little slips
The joke about the nigga and the yellow nip
Then he tells me "I'm so different from those other shits"
When he tries to intellectualise my blackness
He tried to summarise, to institutionalise
Still I could recognise, he was materialised
He tried to intellectualise my blackness
To make it easier for his whiteness
He tried to intellectualise my blackness, ooh save me
Motherfucker don't you lecture-rise me
Don't you ever try to lecturise me
Motherfucker don't you lecturerise me
Oh No
He tried to intellectualise my blackness
To make it easier for his whiteness
He tried to intellectualise my blackness, ooh save me
He tried to intellectualise my blackness
To make it easier for his whiteness
He tried to intellectualise my blackness, ooh save me
He tried to intellectualise my blackness
To make it easier for his whiteness
He tried to intellectualise my blackness, ooh save meEmbed
