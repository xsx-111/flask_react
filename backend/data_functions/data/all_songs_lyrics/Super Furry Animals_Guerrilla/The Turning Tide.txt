The Turning Tide LyricsIt just occurred to me
That things aren't as they seem
It's conspiracy
Aaaah
And we're living in a world of quicksand
Castles on their keep
Still waiting under siege
For the turning tide up
Need some inspiration
Time to hitch a ride
On the turning tide
Ah ha ha
The service was so slow
My eyes began to grow
Into telescopes
Aaaah
That are looking at a world of quicksand
Castles on their keep
Still waiting under siege
For the turning tide up
Need some inspiration
Time to hitch a ride
On the turning tide
And we're living in a world of quicksand
Castles on their keep
Still waiting under siege
For the turning tide up
Need some inspiration
With no obligation
Coz there's quicksand
Sucking up the goodness
Graciously impatiently
Is that the time out?
Need recuperation
Time to hitch a ride
On the turning tide
To the turning tide
To the turning tide
To the turning tide
To the turning tide
To the turning tideEmbed
