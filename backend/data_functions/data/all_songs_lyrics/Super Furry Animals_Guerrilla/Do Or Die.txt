Do Or Die LyricsI got you, you got me, we got plenty to see
Let's sail the ocean, fancy free
We could ride the camel, one hump or two
If we do or die, we should try
If we don't try, I say bye-bye
And if I say bye-bye, I'll wonder why
We didn't try to do or die
Yeah yeah yeah
I am free, you are four, let's take a five
We could climb a mountain and landslide
We ride tornadoes, we eat tomatoes
If we do or die, we should try
If we don't try, I say bye-bye
And if I say bye-bye, I'll wonder why
We didn't try to do or die
Yeah yeah yeah
If we do or die, we should try
If we don't try, I say bye-bye
And if I say bye-bye, I'll wonder why
We didn't try to do or die
If we do or die, we should try
If we don't try, I say bye-bye
And if I say bye-bye, I'll wonder why
We didn't try to do or die
Yeah yeah yeahEmbed
