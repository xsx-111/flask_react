The Door To This House Remains Open LyricsThe door to this house remains open
The door to this house doesn't close
The door is open to the alley
The alley opens to the road
The road it opens to the highway
The highway opens to the road
The road it leads me to a highway
The highway leads right down your road
The road it opens to an alley
The alley leads me to your door
The door to this house remains open
The door to this house doesn't close (X4)
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la (X5)Embed
