Keep The Cosmic Trigger Happy LyricsI came to meet you off the Western Line
We hailed a taxi to save drinking time
It's hustle bustle, don't you feel the rush?
The law can't touch us with their flimsy brush
And that's why I persist
Where others can resist temptation
To be with you
I'm going to keep the cosmic trigger-happy
Keep the cosmic trigger-happy
Keep it real
I know the doorman at the Hippo Club
(He's called Paul)
He let us in for free to hear the dub
(He engineered us once on a track called "Don't Be A Fool, Billy")
We drank a double at the upstairs bar
(On Fierce Panda Records)
Then headed downstairs coz it's better by far
And that's why I persist
Where others can resist temptation
To be with you
I'm going to keep the cosmic trigger-happy
Keep the cosmic trigger-happy
Keep it real
And that's why I persist
Where others can resist temptation
To be with you
I'm going to keep the cosmic trigger-happy
Keep the cosmic trigger-happy
Keep it
Keep it
Keep it real, aahEmbed
