The Teacher LyricsWant to come home from school coz it's a drag
And when I come home from school I'm gonna pack my bags
And when I come home from school I'm gonna run away
And then I'll just start a band then learn how to play
And before I know it I'll be back to life (X2)
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
When I come home from school I'm gonna have a drink
And when I come home from school I'm gonna start to think
And when I come home from school I'm gonna burn my books
And when I come home from school I'm gonna write some hooks
And before I know it I'll be back to life (X2)
La la la la la la la la la la la la...
(The teacher...)
