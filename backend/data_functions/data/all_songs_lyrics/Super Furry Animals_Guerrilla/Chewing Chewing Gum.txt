Chewing Chewing Gum Lyrics
Blowing bubbles
I've got stuff on my mind
A thought left behind, so:

Don't go chewing in bed
You might wake up with it stuck in your hair

That's right, don't go chewing now
You might get it right stuck in your hair

Chew, chew, chew, chewing gum

That's right, don't go chewing now
Aah-aah!Embed
