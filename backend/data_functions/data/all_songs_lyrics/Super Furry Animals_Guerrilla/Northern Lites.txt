Northern Lites LyricsBorn in a manger
You're getting stranger everyday
Uncertain chancer
You're sending everything astray
You're certain danger
You're a monsoon and a fire rolled in one
Got me on the run
There's a distant light (distant light)
A forest fire burning everything in sight (easy flight)
We pick it up in space with survey satellite (survey satellite looking at you)
You're turning every modern theory on its head (survey satellite looking at you)
Leaving me for dead
You're so demanding
You've got me fumbling for escape
I'm understanding
But I'm afraid it's all too late
To find a meaning
You're blowing everything away
From coast to coast
Got me much too close
There's a distant light (distant light)
A forest fire burning everything in sight (easy flight)
We pick it up in space with survey satellite (survey satellite looking at you)
You're turning every modern theory on its head (survey satellite looking at you)
Leaving me for dead
Don't worry me or hurry me
Blow me far away to the Northern Lites
Abandon me, abandon me
Blow me far away, blow me far away to the Northern LitesEmbed
