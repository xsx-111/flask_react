One of the Three LyricsThree
You were one, one of the three
One in three must find some peace
You were one, one of the three
I need proof before belief
Oh, well, you just knew they'd come for you
So it was suicide, suicide
Oh, well, now you got just what you want
I hope you're satisfied
One of the three, one of the three, one of the three, one of the three
You were one, one of the three
One in three must find some peace
You were one, one of the three
I need proof before belief
Oh, well, I guess you're not to blame for what they've
Done in your name, in your name
Oh, well, it's a shame you got so famous for a sacrifice
One of the three, one of the three, one of the three, one of the three
One of the three, one of the three, one of the three, one of the three
You were one, one of the three
One in three must find some peace
You were one, one of the three
I need proof before belief
You sent forth your lamb to the slaughter
You sent forth your lamb to the slaughter
You sent forth your lamb to the slaughter
You sent forth your lamb to the slaughterEmbed
