Everybody Knows Lyrics
When you took me in your arms
I knew I'd reply
You breathed me in so deeply
You took my hand as the music began
I knew I could dance if you led me

Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate
Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate

The snake is poised, and is held by your noise
You charm the life out of demons
You kept me up there with the web of your hair
You spun my life into meaning

Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate
Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate

I've seen your stars, so many lives
You seem to shine forever
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember the time?
Our memories held us together
Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate
Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate

Everybody's hopeful, so much feeling
See your face in windows
Hear your calling

Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate
Everybody knows your face, honey, everybody knows your fateEmbed
