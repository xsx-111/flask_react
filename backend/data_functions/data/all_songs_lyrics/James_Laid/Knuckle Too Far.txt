Knuckle Too Far LyricsSlow down, my brother, your life is passing fast
Will you remember all these scenes that you've passed
So long, so long
Speeding past sunset, blurring from town to town
Faces I forget, hotels all look the same
Worn down the knuckle too far
So long, so long
Lost are your colors, now life's in black and white
Stills from a movie, this life's a trick of the light
Worn down the knuckle too far
Worn down
City of strangers, you seem so tired to me
Don't think I'll stay here, you don't seem friendly
I'll keep on moving, searching for peace of mind
Rivers unwinding maybe I'll find it this time
So long, so long
So long
Live from my suitcase, my life's within my hands
Sleep in a strange bed, hometown's a foreign land
Down, the knuckle too farEmbed
