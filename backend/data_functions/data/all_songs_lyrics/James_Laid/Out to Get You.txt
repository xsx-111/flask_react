Out to Get You Lyrics
I'm so alone tonight
My bed feels larger than when I was small
Lost in memories
Lost in all the sheets and old pillows
I'm so alone tonight
Miss you more than I could let you know
Miss the outline of your back
Miss you breathing down my neck

Oh, they're all out to get you
Once again, they're all out to get you
Once again...

Insecure, whatcha gonna do?
Feel so small they could step on you
Called you up, answering machine
When the human touch is what I need, what I need
What I need, what I need, what I need...
Is you, I need you

Looked in the mirror
I don't know who I am anymore
The face is familiar but the eyes
The eyes give it all away...
Oh, they're all out to get you
Once again, they're all out to get you
Once again...

Here they come again, here they come again
Here they come again, here they come again
Here they come again, here they come again
Here they come again, here they come again

Insecure, whatcha gonna do?
Feel so small they could step on you
Called you up, answering machine
When the human touch is what I need, what I need
What I need, what I need, what I need
What I need, what I need, what I need
What I need Is you
What I need Is you
What I need Is you
What I need Is you
Is you is you
If you let me breathe
If you let me breathe
If you let me breathe
If you let me breathe
They're all out to get you once again
They're all out to get you... once again
Get you, once againEmbed
