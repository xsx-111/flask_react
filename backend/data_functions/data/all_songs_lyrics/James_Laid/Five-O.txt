Five-O Lyrics
Are you open for trade
Your salvation, for something, for some thrills?
Is a body of work for your inspection
You can trace, trace my concern
My concern

I've been looking for truth
At the cost of living
I've been afraid
Of what's before mine eyes
Every answer found
Begs another question
The further you go, the less you know
The less I know

I can feel your face
Gonna make it mine
I can be the man
I see in your eyes
Can you take my weight?
Are we both too small?
Know each other well
We've met before
Will we grow together?
Will it be a lie?
If it lasts forever, hope I'm the first to die
Will you marry me?
Can we meet the cost?
Is the power of love worth the pain of loss?
Can you pay the bill?
Will you keep the change?
Are you here for the party?
Or are you here for the pain?

I can feel the faith
Gonna make it mine
I can be the man
I see in your eyes
Will they grow together?
Will we be a lie?
If it lasts forever, hope I'm the first to die
Hope I'm the first to dieEmbed
