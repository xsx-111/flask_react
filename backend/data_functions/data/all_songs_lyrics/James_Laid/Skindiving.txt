Skindiving Lyrics
Reach your hands inside this dream
Unzip the skin, release the sleep
Going down, I'm growing wings
Hope I can fly before I hit the ground
I can hear your thoughts arise
From these depths to creamy skies
Drifting down the water's cool
Let the weeds cover you

The silvery storms show nothing here
The surface domes the water's clear
The water's clearEmbed
