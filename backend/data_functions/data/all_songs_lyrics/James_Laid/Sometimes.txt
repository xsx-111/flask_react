Sometimes Lyrics
There's a storm outside, and the gap between crack and thunder
Crack and thunder, is closing in, is closing in
The rain floods gutters and makes a great sound on concrete
On a flat roof, there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain
Aerial held high, calling, "Come on thunder, come on thunder"

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul

It's a monsoon and the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore
The boy is hit, lit up against the sky, like a sign, like a neon sign
And he crumples, drops into the gutter, cuts strange, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes
I swear I can see your soul
There's four new colors in the rainbow
An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain, endless rain
He says listen, takes my head and puts my ear to his
And I swear I can hear the sea

Sometimes, when I look in your eyes
I can see your soul, I can reach your soul
Sometimes, when I look in your eyes
I can see your soul, I can touch your soul
Sometimes, when I look in your eyes
I can see your soul, I can hear your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soul
Sometimes, look in your eyes
I can see your soulEmbed
