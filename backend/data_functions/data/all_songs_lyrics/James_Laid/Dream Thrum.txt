Dream Thrum Lyrics
She dreamt the scene the night before
She cast you in her mind
She made your face from clay and straw
Precious stones for your eyes

We cut the cord that brought you here
We left you on your own
We filled your head with wild ideas
Our beliefs led you on

We leave a trail thats always changed
You keep your hopes alive
This surface may seem calm enough
But underneath, underneath

We made you feel the way you are is wrong
We made you what you are
You are afraid
If you dont play the game, well make you change

Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
Oh, I've changed (Oh, I've changed)
I've changed
I've changedEmbed
