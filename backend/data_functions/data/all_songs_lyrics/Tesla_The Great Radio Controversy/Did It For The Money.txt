Did It For The Money LyricsYeah
Ow
Ow
Down on the corner, walkin' the streets
She smiles for everyone she meets
He's not a man, no, he's just another trick
She'd do it all just to get that fix
Did you do it for love?
Did you do it in the name of love?
No, it ain't love she's gonna find
She's got just one thing on her mind
Money
She did, she did it for the money
All in the name of money
All for the dirty green
Cold in the city with the traffic slow
He's got nobody, no place to call home
But he's gotta have it, Lord that he can't control
Takin' hard earned money from a poor, helpless soul
Didn't do it for love
Didn't do it in the name of love
No, it ain't love he's out to find
He's got just one thing on his mind
Money
He did, he did it for the money
All in the name of money
All for the dirty green
And the young girl
She gets down on her knees
She's there to please
She wants her money
And then the young man says
"Now, put your hands in the air
Give me what I want, Give me what I need
Now don't you see?
All I want, all I want, all I want is your money, yeah
Give it to me."
He's got the money, left the scene of the crime
Not a clue would he leave behind
One's bad misfortune makes for another's eats
And now the young girl's trick's his treat
Money
He did, he did it for the money
All in the name of money
All for the dirty green
For the money
He did it, did it for the money
All in the name of money
All for the dirty greenEmbed
