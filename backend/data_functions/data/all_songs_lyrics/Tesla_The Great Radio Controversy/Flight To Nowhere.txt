Flight To Nowhere LyricsLook at me, I'm young and bold
Even though I may be growin' old
I'm never slowin' down
No, I won't slow down
I feel like dynamite, I'm ready to explode
Amplifier pushin' overload
Outta touch with reality
To the point of insanity, yeah
(Goin' down) On a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) Gettin' nowhere fast
(Goin' down) I'm on a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) Goin' down, goin' down
Opinion is a piece of mind
Some are good, some are just like
Where the sun don't shine
You know sometimes they can stink out loud, yeah
Now, the more you look, the more you're gonna find
More than enough to blow your mind
It's such a mess, it's a cryin' shame
And we've only got ourselves to blame
(Goin' down) I'm on a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) I'm gettin' nowhere fast
(Goin' down) I'm on a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) Goin' down, I'm goin' down
So just stop, let me off
Seems that I can't get my point across to you
I know you're listening
But I'm just not getting through, yeah yeah
Now there's one more thing I would like to say
This is everybody's world
And everybody's gonna live it their own way
No matter what we say, yeah
Now the headlines read all across the land
'Bout the motherfuckers gettin' way outta hand
Troubled minds are full of hate
Willin' to destroy the human race
(Goin' down) On a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) I'm gettin' nowhere fast
I'm (goin' down) I'm on a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) Gettin' nowhere fast
(Goin' down) On a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) Goin' down, goin' down
(Goin' down) I'm on a flight to nowhere
(Goin' down) Goin' down, goin' downEmbed
