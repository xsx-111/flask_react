The Way It Is LyricsDoesn't matter who gets the best of who
Or who can hurt who the most, no
It never was meant for it to be that way
Never should be that way at all
The way it is, the way that it goes
Happenin' day after day, yeah
That's the way it is, the way that it goes
Working in the strangest ways
Even though we could never seem to work things out
I still love you just the same
I miss your smile and that sparkle in your eyes
You're so beautiful, never change
The way it is, the way that it goes
Happenin' day after day, yeah
That's the way it is, the way that it goes
Workin' in the strangest ways
What it is and what it was
What shall be shall be, yeah
Sometimes it happens in the strangest ways
Sometimes it's hard to believe, yeah
(Do you believe?) Do you believe
Can you believe?
The way it is, the way that it goes
Workin' in the strangest ways, yeah
Now it really don't matter who, who gets the best of who
It never did and it never will
It was never meant for it to be that way
Why must it be that way at all?
The way it is, the way that it goes
Happenin' day after day, yeah
The way it is, the way that it goes
Workin' in the, workin' in the strangest ways
That's the way it is, that's the way it is
That's the way it is, that's the way that it goes, yeah
Yeah, that's the way it is, that's the way that it goes
That's the way it is, that's the way that it goes
See it happen day after day, yeah, yeah
Workin' in the strangest ways
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you believe? Do you believe?
Can you believe? Do you believe?
That's the way it is, that's the way it goes
Yes it doEmbed
