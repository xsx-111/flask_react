Lady Luck LyricsWith a snap in her style and a click in her heels
In seconds flat, my heart she could steal
Lookin' every bit of a-where it's at
More like breakfast, lunch and dinner, as a matter of fact
Mmm, there she stood in living color
Standin' all alone
So I walked up to her, I say, "How do you do?"
And she said, "I don't."
Lady luck took a walk
When all I wanted was some company
Lady luck took a walk
You know she walked right out on me
Hard as it seems
But not as hard to believe
What can it be?
I guess I'm on a losin' streak
And I know it's true, I got a bad attitude
But I'm down on my luck
Bitch, tell me, what's your excuse?
Tell me now
Lady luck took a walk
When all I wanted was some company
Lady luck took a walk
You know she walked right out on me
Hard as it seems
But not as hard to believe
What can it be? What can it be?
I guess I'm on a losin' streak
Lady luck took a walk
When all I wanted was some company
Lady luck took a walk
You know she walked right out on me
Lady luck took a walk
When all I wanted was some company
Lady luck took a walk
You know she walked right out on meEmbed
