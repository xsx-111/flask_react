Lazy Days, Crazy Nights LyricsI'm feelin' so much better
But not quite feelin' fine
Now, I've got to get my shit together
Still little bit closer to the line
But I love those lazy days and crazy nights
It's my way, it's my life
I love those lazy days and crazy nights
I'm doin' fine right here on borrowed time
Needless for you to worry
No use in losin' sleep
Now, I really do appreciate it
For all, all your concern for me
But I love those lazy days and crazy nights
It's my way, it's my life
I love those lazy days and crazy nights
I'm doin' fine right here on borrowed time
Ridin' through stormy weather
So high I can't look down
Still I've got to get it together
'Cause I'm lost in the lost and found
But I love those lazy days and crazy nights
Now, it's my way, it's my life
I love those lazy days and crazy nights
I love those lazy days and crazy nights
Lazy days and crazy nights
Give it to me, lazy days and crazy nights
Can't do without those lazy days and crazy nights
Now, I'm doin' fine right here on borrowed t-t-t-timeEmbed
