Hang Tough LyricsTook a shot to the chin
Looks like you just can't win
In this do or die situation
And it's harder than it seems
To survive, keep alive and make your dreams
Make your dreams all come true
You've gotta, you gotta give it your best shot
Give it everything you got
Oh, you gotta hang tough, oh
Hang tough
Hang tough
Sometimes love can make you blue
A heartache made just for you
But you can't let it bring you down
If you should stumble, if you should fall
Pick yourself up off the floor
Fight for what's right and stand your ground
You've gotta give it your best shot
Give it everything you got
Oh, you gotta hang tough
Hang tough
When the goin' gets rough
Hang tough
You got to give it all you've got
Hang tough
Keep your head above the ground
Don't you let it get you down
Oh, you gotta hang tough
Hey, oh
Hey, oh
You stay locked away inside your room
'Cause you don't know what this world is comin' to
Hummingbird hums 'cause he don't know the words
And the piper will play 'cause he don't know what to say
He's a lot like you, yeah
Oh, he's a lot like you, yeah
He tries hard every day to be free
And fly away, yeah
Hang tough
Oh, when the goin' gets rough
Hang tough
You've got to give it all you got
Hang tough
Keep your head above the ground
Don't you let it get you down
Oh, you gotta hang tough
Hang tough
Oh, you got to give it all you got, you gotta
Hang tough
Don't you let it get you down
Hang tough
No, oh, you gotta hang tough
Hang tough
