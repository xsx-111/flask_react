Be A Man LyricsHey
Yeah, yeah
Uh huh
Bustin' ass all day
Just to put food on the table
And I always will
For as long as I am able
Done all I could
Everything that a man should do
Still they refuse to call me
Call me what I am, hey
Do you know what it takes to be a man?
Don't take a whole lots of money
Diamond rings upon your hand, no
That ain't what it takes to be a man
Do right by the ones you love
Always give a helping hand, yes I do
Now I've been through it all
Seen the good, the bad, the ugly
Always take care of my share of
Responsibilities
Just because I grow my hair
And play in a rockin' band
Old folks are always telling me
"Boy, why don't you grow up and be a man?" Hey
I know what it takes to be a man
And it ain't the way you look
Or the clothes that you wear
That ain't what it takes to be a man
Do right by the ones you love
Always lend a helping hand
I know I got what it takes
I know I got what it takes to be a man
So go ahead and say what you will
Because I know what I am
Just what I am, ow
Alright
Ow, hey
I know what it takes to be a man
I've got what it takes
And you know I know what I am
I know what it takes to be a man
So go ahead, say what you will
'Cause I know what I am
I'm a man
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
I'm a man
I know I got what it takes
I know I got what it takes, ow
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
