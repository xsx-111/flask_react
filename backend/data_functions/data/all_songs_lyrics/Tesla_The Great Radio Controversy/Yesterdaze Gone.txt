Yesterdaze Gone LyricsYesterdaze gone
Why did she go, where'd I go wrong?
Is it somethin' that I said
That made you walk away?
Yesterday is gone
Why did she go and leave me lost in yesterday?
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be okay
All I need is somebody to squeeze
To forget about yesterday
And I try, try, try to forget her
And I'm told the sooner the better
Yesterdaze gone
Why did she go, where'd I go wrong?
Is it something that I said
That made you walk away?
Yesterday is gone
Why did she go and leave me lost in yesterday?
Day after day
Night after night
I'll keep on lookin' till I find a way
To get her off my mind
And you know I try (try, try) to forget her
And I'm told the sooner the better
Yesterdaze gone
Why did she go, where'd I go wrong?
Is it something that I said
That made you walk away?
Yesterday is gone
Why did she go and leave me lost in yesterday?
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be okay
All I need is somebody to squeeze
To forget about yesterday, yeah
Try (try, try) to forget her
And I'm told the sooner the better
Yesterdaze gone
Why did she go, where'd I go wrong?
Is it something that I said
That made you walk away?
Yesterday is gone
Why did she go and leave me lost in yesterday?
Why did she go and leave me lost
Why did she go and leave me lost, lost in yesterday?
Somehow, someway
You know I'll make it through another dayEmbed
