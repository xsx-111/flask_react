Travelling at the Speed of Thought (Remix) Lyrics
I go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
As I take your mind off
And on to a new track
To tame dogs how to act
Respect me, when I whip your brain
Skip your brain and dip your brain
In the lotion while I deck ya skull
I'm like a bird when I'm pecking ya skull
Til it hurts and swell, puffs, bleed, blood
Hatches down, covering knots for eye jammy
I'm taking ya brain from the back
I'ma pull out ya ears 'cause I'm sick
Traveling hard, ill off, another lunatic
Smacking germs, eating bugs, biting mouse
Roaches wonder why I'm traveling
On to Bellevue 'cause I'm sick
Traveling hard at the speed of thought

Well, I'm back to seek and freak a new remix
Wit the sounds of light and I can't miss
Rocking the beats will cause hard time
Wit the way I say and I freak rhymes
Ruff and hardcore, I wanna encore
I'm Ced-Gee, I'm in an uproar
Taking breaks, snatching, giving X-rays
Read ya cells or should I say
Hey, it's nothing, I'm simply rushing
Into ya skull and merely crushing
Cells, leaving you blind
The more you look, the more you will find
Me, traveling at the speed of thought
You want your brain back
React, turn back
Switch back, turn back the time back
Run back, return your brain back then you stop
Think about it again from the galaxy
Planet 1-6 Ultra
Mega-tip, plus the gamma-tip power-tip
To make your brain fit through the atmosphere
Deep in outer space with the helmet
I'm looking for the elements
I'm not out to ill and on the ill tip
I like to party hard and on the real tip
I'm just travelling at the speed of thought

Once again, it's me to tell you this
The things we say are bugged on the ill tip
Reaching your brain from our planet
I'm Ced-Gee from Ultra and it's
Time to hit ya, as well as give ya
A different picture, so we can get your attention
9th dimension (?) your total focus
Designed and isolated because I wrote this
Song to bring us a lot closer
In peace and unity, because of Ultramagnetic
Leading the way
I like to dream that maybe one day
We could all travel at the speed of thoughtEmbed
