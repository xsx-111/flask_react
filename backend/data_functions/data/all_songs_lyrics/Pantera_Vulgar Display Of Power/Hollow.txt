Hollow Lyrics
What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now

He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad
At God
Mad

He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My
Best friend
My
Best friend
Whoa yeah
Come back!
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now9Embed
