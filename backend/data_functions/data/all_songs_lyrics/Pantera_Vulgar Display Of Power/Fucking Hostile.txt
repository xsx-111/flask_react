Fucking Hostile Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe what's evil
Is making love and making friends
And meeting God your own way, the right way

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Ah, fucking hostile!
We stand alone
The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped they ran
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me, I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a God

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Ah, fucking hostile!
We stand alone

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven, hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching, say your prayers
'Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
About to take the ultimate test in life
I question things because I am human
And call no one my father who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us

Fucking!
Fucking!
Fucking!
Fucking hostile!4Embed
