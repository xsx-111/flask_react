A New Level Lyrics
Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got shit on, pissed on, spit on
Stepped on, fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men

New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

A new level
Of confidence
And power

Demanding plea for unity between us all
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar power
Impatient because time is shorter

New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials
A new level
Of confidence
And power
That's right


No fucking surrender
Can't lose

A new level (new level)
Of confidence (of confidence)
And power (and power)
A new level (new level)
Of confidence (of confidence)
And power (and power)

Life kills
Life kills
Life kills
