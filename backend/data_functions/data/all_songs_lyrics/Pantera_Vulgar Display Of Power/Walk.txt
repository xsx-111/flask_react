Walk Lyrics
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you, what do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?

Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
No way, punk


Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Walk on home, boy38Embed
