Live in a Hole Lyrics
Full of grief I scream at the wind
Thought I heard the words of others
Imprison myself and stay in a shell
I won't let you in to have a story to tell

Things tend to drag me down
Don't understand so they hate me now

My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone

I promised myself somewhere in teenage life
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like
Live in a hole but stay close to my kind
'Cause they understand what burns in my mind

I still feel incomplete
Friends are few and far between

My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone

My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone

My fear grips me
My fear grips me2Embed
