Pang Lyrics
There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Tell me what you're afraid of
Tell me what night is made of
What can I not destroy for you?
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

(Tell me what you're afraid of)
There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
(Tell me what you're afraid of)
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Oh, woah, oh
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)3Embed
