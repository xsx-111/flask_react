Go as a Dream Lyrics
Someone changed the clock
And left the window open
When I must have drifted off
And it's just your kind of trick
To leave me empty-handed
Leave me with a riddle unsolved

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And you're almost like that card
Played by the magician
But this time, you're not coming back
And it's slipping through my fists
Blurry at the edges
Leaving only legend

You go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And it hit me like a brick
A joke without a punchline
A script that nobody read
If you saw me lying here
Through my bedroom ceiling
You would have me pick up my head and

Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
Ah, ah, mmm4Embed
