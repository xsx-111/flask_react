Hey Big Eyes Lyrics
I can picture you right now
At  a window seat
Crying  for nobody except the world
I can picture you right now
Running down the street
Late  for nobody except the moon

Hey,  big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me?
Hey,  red star, can you burn
Burn down to me?

Picture me all messed up now
Can't talk to nobody
Can’t  plan for anything
Except the rain
Today the flags will all fly green
At the embassies
You're here next to me
Except you're not

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me? (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me? (Burn, burn)
Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me?
Hey, red star, can you burn?
Burn down, burn down

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me? (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me? (Burn, burn)4Embed
