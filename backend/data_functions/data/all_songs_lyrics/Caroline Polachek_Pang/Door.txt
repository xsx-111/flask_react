Door Lyrics
Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you

Took ten laps 'round the planet
To prove what I wasn't
And the door slams hard behind you
When you leave the house of judgment

Been waiting for regret to hit me
Some kind of reckoning
I waited for the drop, 'cause lately
The yang comes with yin

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty?
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

And we're waking up sore and dizzy
From a ten-year concussion
And the rainfall makes you miss me
Even though you say it doesn't

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Back in the city
Everything's different when we're not together

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty?

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, oh
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running7Embed
