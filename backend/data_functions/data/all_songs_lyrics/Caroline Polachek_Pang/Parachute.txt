Parachute Lyrics
Awake from a dream
One that started as a nightmare
Like a war so extreme
It erased itself from memory
Here's where I jumped
From the aeroplane without questioning it
The curve of the coast of Los Angeles
Spreading itself below

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Change in the wind
And I'm drifting from the crescent
Pulled farther out
From the shore than where I can swim to it

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Closing in on the sparkle of the waves
Go on, take me, it will feel like going home
Go on, take me, I'm not afraid to drown
What is this, pulling me back the other way
To strip malls, highways and treetops?
Landing on the soft ground4Embed
