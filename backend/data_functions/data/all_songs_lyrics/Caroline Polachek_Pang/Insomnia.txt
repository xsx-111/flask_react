Insomnia Lyrics
How long can sunlight stay warm in a stone?
How long 'til the bath runs cold?

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Dreams of dry fields
That once were green
Burned by someone just like me

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Hold on
Hold on
To save a single living piece of us
I still got it
I still got your heat5Embed
