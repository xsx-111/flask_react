I Give Up Lyrics
When I stop caring, you stop caring
When I care less and you care less than me
When I don't need and I don't believe in
The hollow phrases you still repeat
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
A pathetic kind of sad relief

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?

I gave you that told-you-so look that makes you crazy
And you gave me that list of things about myself to change
And now these days, it's every night, babe
It's not a rough patch, it's not a phase
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
An apathetic kind of self-defeat
It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?
I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?3Embed
