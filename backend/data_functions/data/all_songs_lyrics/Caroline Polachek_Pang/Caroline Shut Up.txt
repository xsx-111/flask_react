Caroline Shut Up Lyrics
Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

I dare you to come closer
Let me see you in the light
I dare you to stay with me
You know I get low sometimes
I dare you to make time stop
Instead of speeding up
I dare you to go slow, don't rush

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Now you got me jealous and I'm not the jealous type
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Spending all the cash that I'm saving up
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Lying in the bath made of a fountain of wine
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Looking like a god, you know you fuck me up
Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

And this is hard, God
Give me scissors and I'm running on the tightrope
And I've gotta trust it now, ah
Just don't let go
(Sometimes I, sometimes I, sometimes I)

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
If tomorrow, you want me
Then I don't have a doubt
That it gets even better than right now5Embed
