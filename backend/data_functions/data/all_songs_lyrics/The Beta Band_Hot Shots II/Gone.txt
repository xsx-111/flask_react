Gone LyricsHey now sister won't you come and bless my soul
I been a long time comin' down the mountainside
You see I fell from a spaceship only stuck here for a little while
And I'd very much like to fall in love with you
If you would, if you would, if you would
I'd like to know, will you think of me when I'm gone?
When I'm gone when I'm gone when I'm gone
Sister live a long time I don't want to fight with you
See my head's in a vice and I don't know who I am in the mornin'
And when I wake in the mornin' and I look through my window
I see sun skies sand sea would you fill your heart with me?
If you would, I'd like to know
Will you think of me when I'm gone?
When I'm gone, when I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm gone, when I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm goneEmbed
