Quiet LyricsThere's a quiet little man and he sits at his window
Doesn't make a sound but he watches where the wind blows
Wants to go outside, fears wouldn't let him
First a little smile and the fears come rolling
You can go outside where the sun, the people blind you
You can go outside where the love of the people finds you
You can go outside where the sun, the people blind you
You can go outside where the love of the people finds you
It will find you, it will find you, it will find you
When he walks through the maze in the circles of his back place
While the Jew on his roof is still tying up his shoelace
He will never curse again all the days on his home spent
Nailing all the doors jumping through the window
You can go outside where the sun, the people blind you
You can go outside where the love of the people finds you
You can go outside where the sun, the people blind you
You can go outside where the love of the people finds you
It will find you, it will find you, it will find youEmbed
