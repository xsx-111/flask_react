Dragon LyricsJumpin' up and down and foolin' around
Is it ever any wonder that you get knocked down?
Comin' down fast gonna pass you on the right
I loved you before but now I turn in the night
Why, you never seem to try, why, you never seem to try
Moving down the way and getting lost, blackness is a place in my mind
The less that you know is the more that you learn
Is there any point in knowledge when you're old and infirm
Why, you never seem to try, why, you never seem to try

I've never been the type to sing all night but, aah
I've never been the type to sing all night but, aah
I've never been the type to sing all night but, aah
Sitting on your bed being balanced on your head, rolling back those fears
The loose lipped trouble dutch double on the monkey
You can see it on his face when you hear it in his voice
Why, you never seem to try, why, you never seem to try
Why, you never seem to try
I've never been the type to sing all night but, aah
I've never been the type to sing all night but, aah
I've never been the type to sing all night but, aah
I've never been the type to sing all night but, aah
How the West was won, it's a lie but it's made to sound like fun
How the West was won, it's a lie but it's made to sound like fun
How the West was won, it's a lie but it's made to sound like fun
How the west was wonEmbed
