Al Sharp LyricsIs it because I'm beside myself with love
That I can say these things to you, honey?
Or if it's 'cause I'm beside myself with guilt
That I can say these things to you, honey?
You and me will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile)
You and me will never be fine
Is it because the life beyond the heart
Was taken out for good Al Sharp he got the money?
All because the Power Ranger robots in disguise
Have called a war to you, honey
You and me will never be fine
(To you honey, to you honey)
(You know I never even tried to smile)
You and me will never be fine
(To you honey, to you honey)
Ol' Al Sharp, he laughs in the face of dark
Al Sharp, he laughs in the face of dark
He tried the honey, he tried the money
(He's a liar and a cheater and he falls on the)
Thieving on your mind, thieving on your mind
You and me will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile for you)
You and your mind will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile for you)
You and your mind will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile for you)
You and your mind will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile for you)
You and your mind will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile for you)
You and your mind will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile for you)
You and your mind will never be fine
(You know I never even tried to smile for you)Embed
