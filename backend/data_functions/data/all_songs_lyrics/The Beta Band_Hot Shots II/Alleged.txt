Alleged LyricsOh Ma there's a hole in my head
Used the bullets that come with the gun you gave me
Shine a light into my head
See the place where we were gonna live
Before you ran off with your spaceman
Left me here without a place for us
Oh Ma there's a hole in my head
Used the bullets that come with the gun you gave me
Used to be funny when you told me jokes
Layin around you & me both when I
Try to remember my favorite one
All I get's a vision of the gun - imagine
Oh Ma there's a hole in my head
Used the bullets that come with the gun you gave me
Yes its true, I love you - how does it feel without me?
I don't know what you're gonna do
I don't know where you're gonna go
I don't know who you want to see
I don't know who you want to be
I don't know why I want to know
I don't know why you didn't show
I don't know why I didn't see
I don't know why I didn't leaveEmbed
