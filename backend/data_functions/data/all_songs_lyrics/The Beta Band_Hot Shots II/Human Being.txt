Human Being Lyrics
She took me on a Monday that's what I like to see
Left me on a Tuesday that's what it's meant to be
Took me on a Wednesday I wouldn't want to say
Going on a Thursday, is there any other way?
Stole me on a Friday she's gonna break your neck
Saturday comes around, she's left me on the deck
I thought I'd make it Sunday but I didn't see it coming
And the storm had started humming and my friends they started running
I only want to count the days, to say we made another day
Daytime seems to last too long, at nights I scream and live alone

Some peace of mind for the girl inside
Some little piece for the men who hide
Some peace of mind for the girl inside
So little peace for the men who hide

We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you see us crying?
We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you see us crying?

I find it very hard to say what I see
I'm going through my mind when she's looking up at me
Of all the things I've said right now for both of us came true
Who will look for me when I disappear in you?
It's never very clear just who's in control
It's all so beautiful what's the point of it all
I only want to count the days, to say we made another day
Daytime seems to last too long, at nights I scream and live alone

Some peace of mind for the girl inside
Some little piece for the men who hide
Some peace of mind for the girl inside
So little peace for the men who hide

We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you see us crying?
We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you see us crying?
We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you see us crying?
We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you see us crying?
We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you hear us trying?
We might just break, can you see us crying?Embed
