Broke LyricsSee my friends across the red sky
Why don't they fly?
Simple truth is all I ask for
But no reply
And you won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for me
You won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for me
You won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for me
You won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for me
Sitting in a tunnel watching other people go home
A night alone, watching other people going home
I try to see it from the other side
She loves me but she knows I slide all night
And you won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for me
You won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for me
You won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for me
You won't cry for me
I'm twisting around my own head
Falling around for meEmbed
