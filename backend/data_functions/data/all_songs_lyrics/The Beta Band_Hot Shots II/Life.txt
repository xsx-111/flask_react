Life LyricsI went to look for shadows but the shadows they found me
I went to swim the ocean but I drowned up in the sea
I want to love my woman but she chose him over me
I want to be somebody else I feel I won't be free
Is this me for life?
I fought to keep from crying as I lay upon the floor
And everyone I knew right then pressed me to the floor
I tried to keep on breathing but the people would not give
And all the evil in the world the people would not give
Is this me for life?
And if you left it up to me they'd all go in the sea
With the guns and the disease and the industry of weasels
Saying: sell to them the killing gem, attack to get it backEmbed
