Eclipse LyricsThe people asking questions
To the people with the answers
The people with the answers
Ire the people with the questions
So the people with the questions
Asked the people with the answers
The people with the answers won't tell
The people with the questions the answers
So the people with the questions
They ask the people with the answers
But the people with the answers won't speak to them
Because the people with the answers
Give the people with the questions
Just a little bit too hard a time to speak to
I'm a man who likes to be alone
I'm a man who likes to think alone
I don't have too many answers
But I got a whole heap of questions
I got a whole heap of questions that I won't hide from you
So low, don't smile you get high 
So the people with the books
They went and stood up on the mountain
To get away from the people with no books
The people with the books
They started reading on the mountain but
They couldn't see a thing because the sky went dark
I don't know where the cloud cover came from
I'm just sitting here rocking on the station
I don't want to be the type of guy
Who lives alone, reading books and never eats a pizza pie
I don't want to be the type of person
Sitting alone with a book on my own
With a book on my own
The people with the questions got together
With the people with the books
And left the people with answers out
So the people with the answers
Started to make their way over the hill
To meet with people with the questions
And the people with the books
And we all live together on a little round ball
We all sing together when the cuckoo calls
I'm not the type best living alone
Could we live together? Well, I don't know
I'm not sitting here giving you a lesson
So I'll just keep my mouth shut for the next few minutes
Can't keep quiet for long, I'm a human being
Can't help help singing this song, I'm a human being
You won't listen to me, I'm not an authority
So the people with the answers
Met the people with the questions
And the people with the books sat down
They finally decided to sit around
To talk about their problems
To see if they come up
With some answers to meet the questions
And some questions to meet the answers
Well, the leaves on the trees are green
Okay, we're agreed on that
And the roads are not very clean
Okay, we're agreed on that
And the food we eat is not very healthy
Okay, we're agreed on that
And the music we make is not particularly good
Okay, we're agreed on that
And the planets sort of revolve around the sun
Okay, we're agreed on that
And the moon is a big ball with nothing on it
And I don't think anyone's ever been there
Okay, so we're kind of agreed to that
So what are we arguing about? Well, I don't know
Okay, so let's get together and smoke that pizza pie
Some people with a pizza pie made me very high
The people with the questions smile
And the people with the answers lie
They lie
So no pizza for themEmbed
