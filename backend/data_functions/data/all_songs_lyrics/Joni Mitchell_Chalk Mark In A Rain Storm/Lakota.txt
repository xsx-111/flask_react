Lakota Lyrics
I am Lakota
Lakota

Looking at money man
Diggin' the deadly quotas
Out of balance, out of hand
We want the land

Lay down the reeking ore
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?
Everywhere you touch the earth she's sore
Every time you skin her all things weep

Your money mocks us
Restitution, what good can it do?
Kenneled in metered boxes
Red dogs in debt to you

I am Lakota
Lakota
Fighting among ourselves
All we can say with one whole heart
Is we won't sell, no, we'll never sell
We want the land

The lonely coyote calls
In the woodlands, footprints of the deer
In the barrooms, poor drunk bastard falls
In the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years

You think we're sleeping
But quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
We have seen the trampled rainbows
In the smoke of cars

I am Lakota, brave sun, pity me
I am Lakota, broken moon, pity me
I am Lakota, grave shadows stretching
Lakota, oh pity me
I am Lakota, weak grass, pity me
I am Lakota, faithful rocks, pity me
I am Lakota, meek standing water
Lakota, oh pity me
I am Lakota
Lakota

Standing on sacred land
We never sold these Black Hills
To the missile-heads, to the power plants
We want the land

The bullet and the fence
Broke Lakota, the black coats and the booze
Broke Lakota, courts that circumvent
Choke Lakota, nothing left to lose

Tell me, grandfather
You spoke the fur and feather tongues
Do you hear the whimpering waters
When the tractors come?

I am Lakota, brave sun, pity me
I am Lakota, broken moon, pity me
I am Lakota, grave shadows stretching
Lakota, oh pity me
I am Lakota, weak grass, pity me
I am Lakota, faithful rocks, pity me
I am Lakota, meek standing water
Lakota, oh pity me
Sun, pity me
Mother earth, mother moon, pity me
Father sky, father shadows stretching on the forest floor
Mother earth, oh pity me
Father sky, father grass, pity me
Mother earth, mother rocks, pity me
Father sky, father water standing in a wakan manner
Mother earth, oh pity meEmbed
