Number One LyricsGot to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Number one, number one
Honey tell me when your working day is done
Were you reaching for the high rung?
Reaching to be number one
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
You get a car, you want a boat
You want an eenie-meenie-miney-miney-moe
Oh, there must be more to living
Than a mortgage and a lawn to mow
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Sweaty work and lucky breaks
Blood and tears is all it takes to be a winner
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
People cheer and people gasp
People want your autograph when you're a winner
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Got to be a winner, trophy winner
Get to hold your head up higher
Win or lose, win or lose
To the loser goes the heartsick blues
To the victor goes the spoilers
Honey, did you win or lose?
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Sweaty work and lucky breaks
Blood and tears is all it takes to be a winner
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
People cheer and people gasp
People want your autograph when you're a winner
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher (number one)
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Run, run, run, run, let's see you run
We'll be betting by the starting gun
Shall we shower you with flowers
Or shall we shun you when your race is run?
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Will we shower you with flowers
Or will we shun you when your race is run?
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher
Will they shower you with flowers
Or will they shun you when your race is run?
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher (number one)
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher (number one)
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher (number one)
Got to be a winner, trophy winner (number one)
Get to hold your head up higher (number one)Embed
