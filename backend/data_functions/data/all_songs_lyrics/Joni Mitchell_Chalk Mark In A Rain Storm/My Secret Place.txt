My Secret Place Lyrics
My secret
My secret

I'm going to take you to my special place
It's a place that you
Like no one else I know
Might appreciate

I don't go there with anyone, but
You're a special case
For my special place
My special place
For my secret place

My secret
My secret place
For my secret place
My secret
My secret place
For my secret place

People talk to tell you something
Or to take up space
Guess I'm only talking
To be talking to your pretty face
I don't talk much to anyone, but
You're a special case
My special place
My secret place

I was born and raised in New York City
I'm just getting used to Colorado
Oh street bravado, carry me
Why did you bring me to a place so wild and pretty?
Are there pigeons in this park, muggers after dark?
In these golden trees in the secret place?

My secret
My secret place
For my secret place
My secret
My secret place
For my secret place

I'm going to take you to my special place
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger can deface
I put things back together there
It all falls right in place
In my special space
My special place
Once I saw a film in New York City
That was shot in Colorado
Girl meets desperado
In the trembling mountain trees
Out of all of the girls that you see
In bleachers and cafe windows
Sitting--flirting with someone
Looking to have some fun
Why did you pick me?
For the secret placeEmbed
