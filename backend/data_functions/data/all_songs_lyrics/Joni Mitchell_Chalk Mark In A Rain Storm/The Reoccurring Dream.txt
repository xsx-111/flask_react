The Reoccurring Dream LyricsThis is the reoccurring dream
Born in the dreary gap between
What we have now
And what we wish we could have
More fulfilling--and less frustrating
Out of the envy in our eyes
Glamorous picture people rise
Gleaming down from screens and pages
Glamour before your very eyes
Isn't it true, isn't it true?
Good question, I know - who cares?
Look here they tell you
If you had this, if you had that
Latest styles and colors
If we had that for us, wouldn't it be fabulous?
If you had that house, car, bottle, jar
Your lovers would look like movie stars
Movie stars, movie stars, movie stars
Order your youth secrets of the stars
Call now, just $9.99
Our discontent is their delight
They offer relief for the purchase price
Love in a bottle, love on four wheels
Is that our new car Charles?
Isn't it true--isn't it true?
We guarantee it--pick up your phone and dial
See here they sell you
If you had this, if you had that
I want a new truck!--More power!
If you use this shampoo
True love will come to you
If you had that house, car, bottle, jar
Your lovers would look like movie stars
Movie stars, movie stars, movie stars
Hollywood's greatest legends
Recognize this?
Dreamer
Soft sexy hair
Dream on
He's going to love me in this ruby, ruby lipstick
Others will notice! Sexy! Who cares!
Recognize this?
Dreamer
Latest styles and colors
Oh, dream on, dream on, dream on
The fashion looks you've been hoping for
Sexy, ssexy
Recognize this?
Dreamer
So special
Dream on
We will have happiness in heaven
The place you dreamed of retiring to
Who cares
Recognize this?
Dreamer
I know that glamour is sexy
Oh dream on dreamer
What could go wrong?
Dream on
Who cares
Recognize this?
Dreamer
I'm afraid I can't go below two million
Dream on
Life would be easy if I had that new appliance
Food processors for all of us
Who cares
Recognize this?
Dreamer
There are lots of strings
Dream on
We can solve everything in science
Naturally
Science
It's a picture of how to get what you want out of life
Recognize this?
I love it
Dreamer
Isn't there some other way?
Who cares!Embed
