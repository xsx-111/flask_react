The Beat of Black Wings Lyrics
I met a young soldier, he said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shaking all over like a night-frightened child
This is his story, it's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat of, the beat of black wings

Johnny Angel

They gave me a gun, he said, they gave me a mission
For the power and the glory, propaganda, piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me, I can feel things exploding
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of, the beat of black wings

Johnny Angel

He said, I never had nothin', nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child without even grieving
I put my hands on her belly to feel the kid kicking
Damn, she'd been to some clinic
Oh, the beat of black wings
Johnny Angel

They want you, they need you, they train you to kill
To be a pin on some map some vicarious thrill
The old hate the young, that's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars, we die in 'em
To the beat of, the beat of black wings

Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel

There's a man drawing pictures on the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em, rain come down and wash 'em off
Keep the drinks comin', girl, 'til I can't feel anything
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm
I'm just the beat of black wings
