Cool Water Lyrics
All day I face the barren waste
Without a taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I, our throats slate dry
Our spirits cry out for water
Cool clear water

Keep on movin' Dan
Some devil's had a plan
Buried poison in the sand
Don't drink it, man
It's in the water
Cool clear water

In my mind I see a big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waitin' up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But come the dawn, we carry on
We won't last long without water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
We're still in no-man's land
Dry bones and sand
People never planned here for water
Cool clear water

In my mind I see a big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waiting up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

The shadows sway, they seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there, if you care
Please show us where there's good water
Cool clear water
