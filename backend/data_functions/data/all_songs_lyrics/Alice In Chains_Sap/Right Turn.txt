Right Turn Lyrics
Inside, always trying to get back inside
But it's so hard to penetrate pig-thick skin

I'm 'bout as low as I can get
I'd leave but I can't forget
Still, I wonder why, it ain't right
Mmm, it ain't right, ooh, ain't right
Mmm, it ain't right, yeah

'Bout as low as she can get
She'll leave me but she won't forget
And she wonders why she ain't right
She ain't right, ain't right
She ain't right

Now we're as low as we can get
Can't leave and can't forget
We ain't right, we ain't right, not right
We ain't right

Well, it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you
When you can see you were only high
It's all up to you, so you gamble
Flat on your face and into the fire
Well, it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you
When you can see you were only high
It's all up to you, so you gamble
Flat on your face and into the fire5Embed
