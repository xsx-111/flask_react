Love Song Lyrics
Love Song, take one

I love you, I'm not coming back, bitch
I think I should say something
I can't see, I can't feel anything
I can't I can't
Wash my face
Cut out my teeth and tell me to grin
My gums are bleeding
My gums are bleeding

I hate you, I hate you

Get a fucking haircut
Go fuck yourself
Rae Dawn Chong, Rae Dawn Chong
Rae Dawn Chong, Rae Dawn Chong
Rae Dawn Chong

Get something, get, get them, get them
Get them, get the fuckin' midget
Get the midget, get the midget
Get the fuckin' midget
Kiss the fuckin' midget
"Where the deer and antelope play"
Kiss the midget, kiss the midget
Kiss the midget, kiss the midget
That was perfect, you guys, that was great1Embed
