Am I Inside Lyrics
Loneliness it shadows me
Quicker than darkness
Crawls to the surface of my skin
Visibly surrounded by it

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free

Surrounded by empty souls
Artificial courage used
And because so, once was mine
I walk this maze alone

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free

Miles beside himself
Miles below himself
Miles behind himself
Am I inside myself?
Chaos and hate shadow me
Pain it fills me up
Only one thing makes me feel
Missing better half of me

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free

Miles beside himself
Miles below himself
Miles behind himself
Am I inside myself?6Embed
