Time Travel Lyrics
Time travel will be the death of man
Only the devil fools with the best laid plans
The best laid plans best left unplanned
Time travel will be the death of man

Whats done is done
So you must see
You can't bring back
Whats already been
Technology's tempting the public eye
Do you wanna know why when who and why
We're cloaked in indecision
Concealed by lies
I wanna know why we're really alive
Well you might say we got no proof
There's one thing I know
Is that I'm younger than you
And I can see through your eyes
And I can see through your lies
Hypocrisy is your only disguise
Better tell us why we're really alive

Time travel will be the death of man
Only the devil fools with the best laid plans
The best laid plans best left unplanned
Time travel will be the death of man
In my darkest day
I thought this through
A change in the weather
Could be made by you
And all the information
You're holding back
Is it hidden in the water
That runs from my tap
When few had the proof
That Jesus Christ
Was no more of a man than you or I
Would you tell the people?
Would you try to deceive?
For fear of undermining
Their religious belief
Well there's a war going on!
It's obvious one!
It's between magic and medicine

Time travel will be the death of man
Only the devil fools with the best laid plans
The best laid plans best left unplanned
Time travel will be the death of man
Never give up the fight!Embed
