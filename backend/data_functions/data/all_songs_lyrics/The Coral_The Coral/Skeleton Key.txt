Skeleton Key Lyrics
Sail lightly, on winds
Disappear on, the breeze
Lie firmly, on pins
Pull them out, with ease

Solid boned skeleton key
Opens the most, intricate lock
Brother roll, another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Fumble blindly as we speak
You will wither if you are weak
Finger turns and points at me
I'd hoped they wouldn't notice me

Solid boned, skeleton key
Opens the most, intricate lock
Brother roll another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Skeleton
Skeleton, yeah
Skeleton
Will I ever, return?
Will I ever, get back?
Are the rocks, too high?
Has the dust, turned black?
Will I ever, return?
Will I ever, get back?
Are the rocks, too high?
Has the dust, turned black?


Skeleton Key
Skeleton Key
Skeleton Key
Skeleton Key

Will I ever, return?
Will I ever, get back?
Are the rocks, too high?
Has the dust, turned black?
Will I ever, return?
Will I ever, get back?
Are the rocks, too high?
Has the dust, turned black?
Solid boned, skeleton key
Opens the most intricate lock
Brother roll another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Oh yeah
Hey
That's more like
Here we go here we go
Here we go, go, Byker Grove
Can't believe it's so good
Can't believe it's so goodEmbed
