Dreaming Of You Lyrics
What’s up with my heart when it skips a beat? (skips a beat)
Can’t feel no pavement right under my feet (under my feet)

Up in my lonely room (wa-ooh)
When I’m dreaming of you (wa-ooh)
Oh, what can I do? (wa-ooh)
I still need you but (wa-ooh)
I don’t want you now

When I’m down and my hands are tied (hands are tied)
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line (draw the line)
From this pain I just can’t disguise (can’t disguise)
It’s gonna hurt but I’ll have to say goodbye (say goodbye)

Up in my lonely room (wa-ooh)
When I’m dreaming of you (wa-ooh)
Oh, what can I do? (wa-ooh)
I still need you but (wa-ooh)
I don’t want you now
Oh yeah!

Up in my lonely room (wa-ooh)
When I’m dreaming of you (wa-ooh)
Oh, what can I do? (wa-ooh)
I still need you but (wa-ooh)
I don’t want you now2Embed
