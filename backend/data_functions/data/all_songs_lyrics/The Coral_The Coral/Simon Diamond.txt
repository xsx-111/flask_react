Simon Diamond Lyrics
Simon Diamond sold his soul
Changed his name by deed poll
Started out as Simon Russell
Lived his life inside a nutshell

Couldn't take the public scorn
Changed from human to plant form
Now he's swapped his legs for roots
His arms and soil are in cahoots

What will become of Simon Diamond?
Water himself, can't change the climate
What will become of Simon Diamond?
Water himself, can't change the climate

That'll do (that'll do)
That'll do (that'll do)
That'll do (that'll do)
That'll do (that'll do)
That'll do (that'll do)
That'll do (that'll do)
That'll do (that'll do)
That'll do (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)
Woo-hoo (that'll do)Embed
