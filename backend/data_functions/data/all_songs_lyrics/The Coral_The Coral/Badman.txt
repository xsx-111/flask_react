Badman Lyrics
There's a bad man that I once knew
His heart was black and his blood was blue
Bad man, he's comin' for you
He'd sell his wife for a dollar or two
To be a rich man with many maids
He's got eyes like hand grenades
He had a good woman
In the palm of his hand
Until she left him for another man

Now he's a bad, bad man
A bad, bad man
You gotta' do what you can
When you're a bad man

(Everyone gotta' be a bad man every once in a while, the lord knows he's a bad man )

He's a bad man and that's the truth
The devil's law don't need no proof
He's a jealous man .All alone
A motel room is not a home
Helpless man, he fell ill
He was prescribed a fatal pill
Now he's a dead man
His heart's still black
His only love stabbed him in the back
Now he's a bad, bad man
A bad, bad man
You gotta' do what you can
When you're a bad man
Now he's a bad, bad man
A bad, bad man
You gotta' do what you can
Cos you're a bad bad man
You're a bad bad man
You're a bad bad man
You got to do what you can
When you're a bad manEmbed
