Wildfire Lyrics
Wildfire, a desire to be loved
Climb higher to the platform just above
Little liar, you deceive me with your wit
Elocution sculptured perfectly to fit

Tug of war with the blessed and the mugged
Please let me quiz you, rest assured, but unplugged
Town crier has our voices kindly bugged
Wildfire, a desire to be loved

Daddy calling, see how they run
Mother calling, see how they run
Monday morning, see how they run
Counting stories, see how they

Wildfire, a sifting signal of the times
Tossed and turned up in deceptional rhymes
Soap and water, I'll wash your mouth out all the same
She's my daughter but I let her play the gameEmbed
