Calendars and Clocks Lyrics
Pretty pendant descendant of joy
Return the father to the boy
Resent your past, repent at last
We are only lines on a map

Calendars, oh, and clocks
Oh, and hickory docks

Find a feeling that feels okay
Find another to blow it away
Who are you and who am I
Please don't ask me I'll break down and cry

Calendars, oh, and clocks
Oh, and hickory docks

There's nothing more
Than the seashells on the sea shore
Nothing more
Than the church bell that rings no more
Nothing more
Than the scenes behind a closed door
Nothing more
Than the rich and penniless poor
Nothing more
No, nothing more
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Yeah
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
Calendars, clocks and hickory docks (tick tock, tick tock)
And tick tockEmbed
