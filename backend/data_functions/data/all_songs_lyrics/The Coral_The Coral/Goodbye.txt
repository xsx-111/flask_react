Goodbye Lyrics
I, I looked into her eyes
Saw through her disguise
But never realised
That we were longing to be free
Run away to sea
Well that could never be

Goodbye
Don't say goodbye
I'd rather die
Than say goodbye

Once so very long ago
Was when I loved you so
If only I had known
I was blinded by my fate
I traded love for hate
Now I just sit and wait

Goodbye
Don't say goodbye
I'd rather die
Than say goodbye
"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1"

Goodbye
Don't say goodbye
I'd rather die
Than say goodbyeEmbed
