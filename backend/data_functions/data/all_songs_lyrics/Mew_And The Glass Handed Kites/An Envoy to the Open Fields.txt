An Envoy to the Open Fields Lyrics
All manner of malady come to be seen
All manner of malady come to be seen

Why do you call me at the door?
You don't know me
Why do you?
Why do you call me all the time?
You don't know me

In the corners of eyes
I'll stretch the sky in blue
And I'm thinking you're made for me
And I'm thinking of things you said

Hey now! No using me
Hey now! Can you see them?
No use in me
When all you want is

And when you go I stay
There are no complications
And when you go I stay
The blood is on moirr√© hands today
Why do you call me at the door?
You don't know me
Why do you?
Why do you call me all the time?
You don't know me

Assigned to ascertain their find
For I believe these fields divide
The other world
We timeless horse employ, envoy
How do you know?
Where did you go?
Solar, I can't see anything
Collide with me

In the corners of your eyes
I'll stretch the sky in blue
And I'm thinking we knew no better
And I'm thinking
We're dyingEmbed
