The Seething Rain Weeps for You LyricsSaying goodbye now
Looking at friends
A lump comes in my throat
Hearing them all speak of you
It rains
We have no umbrella brought
With which the wind be fought
The seething rain weeps for you
Speaking of better days
There are so many things I want to say
Should I re-live my life
I'd run into you much sooner
Time has, it would seem
Quickened its pace
Leaving upon your face
A curly smile meant just for me
Speaking of better days
I try to remember everything
But as the years go by
The dark moments lift
Like rain clouds do
With destruction hands
And low lit snow becoming
Winter body aches
Speaking of better days
I try to remember everything
But as the years go by
The dark moments lift
Like rain clouds do
From my window I watch the day go byEmbed
