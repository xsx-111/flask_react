Forever and Ever LyricsThis cannot be the endeavor of a broken heart
Miss you forever and ever if you should fall apart
No one seemed to be gone
All things that you rely on
I miss you forever and ever if you should fall apart
Can't stay forever together in obstructed lie
No one seemed to be gone
All things that you rely on
You can never undo
Because you felt you had to
I miss you forever and ever if you should fall apart
Can't stay forever together in obstructed lie
Miss you forever and ever if you should fall apart
Can't stay forever together in obstructed lie
Miss you forever and ever if you should fall apart
Can't stay forever together in obstructed lie
No one seemed to be gone
All things that you rely on
You can never undo
Because you felt you had toEmbed
