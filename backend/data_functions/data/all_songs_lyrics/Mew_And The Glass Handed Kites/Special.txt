Special Lyrics
You're special, you're like rocket through me
Ohh, you're special, you're a rocket to me and I cannot this time
Agarina, you can't say no
Agarina, this time you will go
Special, you're like a rocket through me
Ohh, you're special, you're a rocket to me and I cannot this time
There's a taste that you can't shake
But you can't seem to let them go awry
I know you're special, you're a rocket to me
At this surprised all the time

I know what you said to me
And I don't care at the same time
But I'll take you up and down
Address it to you

You're special, you're like rocket through me
Ohh, you're special, you're a rocket to me and I cannot this time
There's a taste that you can't shake
But you can't seem to let them go awry
I know you're special, you're a rocket to me
At this surprised all the time
Agarina, you can't say no
Agarina, this time you will go
I know what you said to me
And I don't care at the same time
But I'll take you up and down
Address it to you
(Honey bee)
I know what you said to me
And I don't care at the same time
And what do you stay to do?
I saw the worst of you1Embed
