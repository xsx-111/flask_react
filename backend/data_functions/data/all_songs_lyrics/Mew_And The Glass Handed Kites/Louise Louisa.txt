Louise Louisa LyricsCall Louise Louisa do
I assess myself through you
Call Louise Louisa do
I had such a night
Come true
Overhead
Morning skies all for you
What a day I have had
What a day I have had
Now it's over, isn't it?
What a day I have had
What a day I have had
Now it's over, isn't it?
There goes Louisa
There goes Louisa
Dig out yourself from rubble
Removing all your skin
And don't ever think of trouble
The darkness that has been
No, don’t patronize, be subtle
I don’t meant to
I'm in a car
I don't know where we are headed for
Stay with me
Don't want to be aloneEmbed
