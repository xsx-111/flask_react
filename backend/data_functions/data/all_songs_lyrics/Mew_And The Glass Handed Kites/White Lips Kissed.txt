White Lips Kissed Lyrics
Wake me up
Only nightmares take me in
Through these walls the winter bites
A draft from all sides

Why did you not include me on your list?
Let me in through the ceiling
White lips kissed

Our love is a fickle love
Keeps itself locked in a suitcase
To be ready to go always

I won't cry when the silver lining shows
But you're right, you understand
You ride with both hands
Worrying is the breathing that you need
So there won't be far to fall
You mustn't climb tall

Things that are supposed to mean lots
Leave you cold
And with a malady of the soul

Our love is a tricky love
Bet you know this
Bet you noticed
Bet you know, which is why

I should know
Better than
Anyone
Ever could
Soon as I
Let go
Everything
Falls apart

I won't cry when the silver lining shows
But you're right, you understand
You ride with both hands
Worrying is the breathing that you need
So there won't be far to fall
You mustn't climb tall
Wake me up
Only nightmares take me in
Through these walls the winter bites
A draft from all sides
Of course you can
There are diamonds in demand
It's a shame and as you know
The stain will not go
