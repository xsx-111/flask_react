Chinaberry Tree LyricsIn parallel sea what would I be?
My first love said to me:
"Tears out for the world to see"
I would not be
I did not see the chinaberry tree
Tears out, it would feel so
Heavenly, heavenly, heavenly
Hard now to picture a me
Without a you
"Don't interfere"
Part of her back was frozen
For the remainder of the war
"Don't be concerned"
But I never learned how not to be
As my first love said to me:
"I don't care. I'm not there"
So that I could not sleep
My whole being was falling apart
So that I soon cried out:
"Dear friends, hold me!"Embed
