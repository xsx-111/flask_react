Only Breathing Out LyricsAmong the timeless out of range
I float above the strange now
Something tells me I should be letting go
I don't know what I'm gonna face
Looking down and inside
A soul lost without a trace
Hear me now
I'm calling out to reach you
With love
I feel alive but I've got doubt
I'm only breathing out
Feet don't touch the ground
I'm only breathing out
No one will find me
Constellations unknown
I touch my skin it's not my own
Is this a test to face the fear
Will I return or die alone
Hear me now
I'm screaming out to reach you
But make no sound
I'm only breathing out
Feet don't touch the ground
I'm only breathing out
No one will find me
Words don't make a sound
There's life still left inside me
Breathing out
Hear me now, hear me now
Only breathing out
Feet don't touch the ground
I'm only breathing out
No one will find me
I'm only breathing out
So alone, no returning, so alone
So alone
I'm only breathing out
Words don't make a sound
One last breath inside me
Breathing outEmbed
