Pale Blue Dot LyricsI, i am not a name on board this prison planet
I, i'm feeding love feeling pain and the in-organics
I, i am not afraid to try and understand it
You, you're a man of many faces a man of madness
No matter how hard we try we still can't deny
We're a pale blue dot, a pale blue dot
No matter how hard we try, how hard we try
We're a pale blue dot, a pale blue dot
I, i am not alone on board a world in exile
I, went up a scientist to find out that I'm only human
And i, i am but a child in a world so fragile
You, you're a man of many faces a man of madness
I wanna see, i wanna see from space
I wanna save what i can't replace
I wanna know, i wanna know my name
I wanna show that it's all the sameEmbed
