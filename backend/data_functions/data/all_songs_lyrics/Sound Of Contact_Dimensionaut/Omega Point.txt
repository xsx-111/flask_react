Omega Point LyricsThe further I go
Through the rabbit hole
Into the lens
And out of control
Sleeping awake
All I can take
Of this dementia
Possibly deranged
At sub-atomic range
Risk to go insane
A multitude of pain
Everlasting sign
Faulty by design
Travel takes its toll
Tearing at my soul
Discover who you are
All of who you are
Remember who you are
Shining like a star
This thing I can't escape
Words that came too late
The further I reach
Through the worlds between
Into the void
And out of the dream
Sleeping awake
All I can take
Of this dementia
Tracing back in time
I cannot hit rewind
Exploding in my head
What might have been instead
Point of no return
Don't let the bridges burn
Strong magnetic beam
Always stuck between
Discover who you are
All of who you are
Remember who you are
Shining like a star
Steal from hands of fate
To lie or make you wait
Paradox of mind
Crossed the hidden line
Post-traumatic dream
Was never what it seemed
Memories of you
I cannot hit undo
Re-occurring theme
Unraveled at the seam
Discover who you are
All of who you are
Remember who you are
Shining like a star
I can see your face
Beyond the closing gate
They cannot break us down
I'll erase the pain somehow
There's a way to save us nowEmbed
