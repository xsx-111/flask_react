Remote View LyricsSleeping awake
Going under
Altered state
Stream of wonder
I'm tapping in and tuning out
Shed the skin can do without
A flicker of light
Blink of an eye
And you know I'll be by your side
Somewhere in time
Deep in the mind
I can see you
Remote view
Over you
Like a satellite
Floating above
Blinding starlight
You're never alone or out of sight
I'm flowing in and flowing out
Constant motion all about
A flicker of light
Blink of an eye
And you know I'll be by your side
Somewhere in time
Deep in the mind
I can see you
Remote view
Over you
Like a satellite
Remote view
Over you
Like a satellite
The further I go
The more it shows
And all that we know
Everything is always
Everything is always
A flicker of light
Blink of an eye
And you know I'll be by your side
Somewhere in time
Deep in the mind
I can see you
A flicker of light
Blink of an eye
And you know I'll be by your side
Somewhere in time
Deep in the mind
I can see you
Remote view
Over you
Like a satellite (Everything is always)
Remote view
Over you
Like a satellite (Everything is always)
Remote view
Over you
Like a satellite (Everything is always)
Remote view
Over you
Like a satelliteEmbed
