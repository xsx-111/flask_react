Not Coming Down LyricsYou lost control, you crossed the line
You walked the edge one last time
Closed the door, locked the gate
Spin the wheel, twist your fate
Heard the call, walked the wall
Cut the rope and watch us fall
In a cloud, take a look around
You're so high, you're not coming down
Broke the reins, fading away
You're so high, you're not coming down
You've no regard for who's around you
Spinning out with no escape
In a world of a different shape
It's all the same, it's all the same
You go back from where you came
In a cloud, take a look around
You're so high, you're not coming down
Broke the reins, fading away
You're so high, you're not coming down
You're so high, you're not coming down
So clever, you don't have a clue
What is real and what is half of the deal
You just can't feel
You're all messed up
You're never happy with what you've got
It's never enough, you just give up
All the same, all the same
All the same, all the same
In a cloud, take a look around
You're so high, you're not coming down
You're so high, you're not coming down (coming down)
You're so high, you're not coming down (coming down)
You're so high, you're not coming down (coming down)
You're so high, you're not coming downEmbed
