I Am (Dimensionaut) LyricsI am
I'm not inhuman
But i have lost all sense o self
I pray for resilience
Disguised as someone else
Look all around us
If you could see what i see
Through all the madness
I found a way back to me
Swallow all 'til ruin
Then i wonder why i ache
I'm not the only one
Many fall from their mistakes
I'm not inhuman
I'm a mand without a name
Found resclution
I'll never be the sameEmbed
