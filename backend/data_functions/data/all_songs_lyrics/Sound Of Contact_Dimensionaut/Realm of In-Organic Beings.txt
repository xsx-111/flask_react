Realm of In-Organic Beings LyricsHis breathless body floats among the stars
And the sirens of silence caress his fear
Wrapped in a cocoon of light and love
Travelling back to the mother sphere
Another earth or another you ?
Shadows thrive where the spirits fly
From boy to man to beyond the cell
Embrace the power from the planet's eyeEmbed
