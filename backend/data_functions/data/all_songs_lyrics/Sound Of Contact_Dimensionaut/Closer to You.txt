Closer to You LyricsCloser to you
Closer to me
Eroding with time
Like shells in the sea
A heart overflowing
The thought of just knowing
I throw you a line
And you set me free
I'll never let you down
I'm closer to you
Keep you safe and sound
They cannot hurt you now
Who would have known
You into me
Me into you
So hard to see
All of the changes
The turning of pages
Written in stone
What's meant to be
Laughed in the sun
Howled at the moon
I missed you again
That's all over soon
Wrapped up in arms
A timeless cocoon
Tear down the walls
To be back with you
I'll never let you down
I'm closer to you
I'll always be around
I'm closer to you
Lift you off the ground
I'm closer to you
Salvation found
They cannot break us down
There is a way to work this out
They cannot break us down
There's a way to save us now
Closer to you
Closer to meEmbed
