Over and Over LyricsNo joy and not much changed
I'm still here same old way
How long? Where to?
What for? What truth?
And it's strange you can tell
Always leave, never dwell
Running, restless ache
Must believe for heaven's sake
Don't know where to go
Hung by a thread I'm misled
How long? Where to?
What for? What truth?
Don't know where to go
Hung by a thread I'm misled
How long? Where to?
What for? What truth?
Over and over again
Questionin' wish to come?
Over and over again
Questionin' wish to come?
And over and over again
Wish to come?
How long? Where to?
What for? What truth?
Over and over again
Wish to come?Embed
