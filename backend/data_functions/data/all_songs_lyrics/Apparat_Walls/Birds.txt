Birds LyricsYour head's a busy place
A port for thoughts coming back
Like ships flown overseas
While swarms of birds passing by
If I could catch a thought sometime
I'd put it in a safe place
To the elements I've got
And next time I would check it would be gone
Until single spark ignites it to new light
Until single spark ignites it to new light
Until single spark ignites it to new light
And it comes back to you finally getting through
Your heart's a messy place
A giant garbage dump
For all feelings you can't handle
That's where you bury all of them
And wait 'til they decay
Until single spark ignites them to new lies
Until single spark ignites them to new lies
Until single spark ignites them to new lies
And it comes back to you finally getting through2Embed
