Headup LyricsGood you came to celebrate with us
....
Fall and sway. Bring the bill
I'll answer don't worry
...
On my way with gifts I save
Now, you're feeling bitterly
No one will put you down
You've gotta head up, head up
Stop thinking on me now
I wanna find out how
And I don't need to hide
Say save us for last?
I'm feeling terrifiedEmbed
