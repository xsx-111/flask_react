Arcadia LyricsWhat's the point of waiting for life to come
I could go further and no one's surprised
Your plans collapse, run off or fall apart
Your plans collapse, run off or fall apart
What's the point of waiting for life to come
I could go further and no one's surprised
Your plans collapse, run off or fall apart
Your plans collapse, run off or fall apartEmbed
