Hailin from the Edge LyricsWould you come with me? I can't close the door
These worthless wishes and they got me for sure
Don't look inside like millions before
You might walk in there as we're closing the door
Say how are you out there
Say how are you out there
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
A king from the stars went through the Mars
I've seen way more, that I can ever take
As you've got some time to spend with me, dear
So I've left it all behind
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge)
Come with me. Can't close the door
These worthless wishes and they got me for sure
Don't look inside like millions before
You might walk in there as we're closing the door
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
Say how are you out there (hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge)
(Hailing from the edge) ...Embed
