Tennessee Lyrics
Your dream can never earn enough
Ultimate nihilistic love

Tennessee nights just zip-code love
Always believe the comfort of strangers
Tennessee eyes graffiti once blue
Media sells a trace of hate
Media sells a trace of hate

Our epitaph reads like your sin
Subvert, destroy, beat derelict

Tennessee nights just zip-code love
Commanche becomes as maggot
Tennessee eyes orange once blue
Media sells a trace of hate
Media sells a trace of hate

His pain forgets her agony
His heart P-M-R-C
His heart P-M-R-C
The white man is disease
His heart P-M-R-C
Your dream can never earn enough
Ultimate nihilistic loveEmbed
