Natwest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds Lyrics
Economic forecast soothe our dereliction
Words of euthanasia, apathy of sick routine
Carried away with useless advertising dreams
Blinding children, life as autonotomes

NatWest, NatWest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds
Blackhorse apocalypse
Death sanitized through credit
NatWest, NatWest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds
Blackhorse apocalypse
Death sanitized through credit

Barclays iron eagle, "33 injection"
Sold to advertisers, computer execution line
They give and take away, repossess and crucify
The more you own the more you are, lonelier with cheap desire

NatWest, NatWest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds
Blackhorse apocalypse

NatWest, NatWest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds

Prosperity  exports for Pol Pot
Prosperity Mein Kampf for beginners

NatWest, NatWest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds
Blackhorse apocalypse

NatWest, NatWest-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds
Blackhorse apocalypse
