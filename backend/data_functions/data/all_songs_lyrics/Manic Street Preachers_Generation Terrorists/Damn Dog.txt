Damn Dog Lyrics
This is "Damn Dog" by the Manic Street Preachers: take one

Two, three, four

I can lick your face
I can bite it too
Ooh my teeths got rabies
I'm going to give it to you

Feed me, feed me
Can't you hear me howl
Feed me
Cos I'm a damned dog now

Gotta taste for flesh
Gotta taste for danger
So I foam and chew
Bite the hands of a stranger

Feed me, feed me
Can't you hear me howl
Feed me
Cos I'm a damned dog now
Feed me, feed me
Can't you hear me howl
Feed me
Cos I'm a damned dog nowEmbed
