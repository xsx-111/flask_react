A Vision of Dead Desire LyricsPrimary prole MP judge general policeman
Figureheads sucked in as just another token
To sell your culture and tolerate another
Annihilation in the pursuit of self-love corruption
Vision of dead desire - tune in reception control
Vision of dead desire - underclass coma zone
Don't pacify your life to suit dead law convention
White trash held up as just more gold chain icons
State fed lies charm empty eyes
Happy thoughts a unity death smile of acceptance
Vision of dead desire - mainline on a death fix
Vision of dead desire - bleed the thought of throwing bricks
Europe land, realise your thoughts
Kill all ruling class lawsEmbed
