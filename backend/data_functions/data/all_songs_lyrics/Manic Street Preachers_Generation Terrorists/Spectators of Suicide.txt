Spectators of Suicide Lyrics
Obedience to the law is free desire
Under curfew from neon barbed wire
Wasting away this country
Wearing like a born dead
Free heroin shots for those who never beg

Spectators of suicide
Exploding in society's eye
Democracy is an empty lie
Dead like our yesterdays tonight

The only free choice is refusal to pay
Life reduced to suicidal pain
Cigarettes a life-line, it's safety in death
Choking on the billboards, advertised and fed

Spectators of suicide
Exploding in society's eye
Democracy is an empty lie
Dead like our yesterdays tonight

You're going to shoot us dead with decadence
You're going to shoot us dead with decadenceEmbed
