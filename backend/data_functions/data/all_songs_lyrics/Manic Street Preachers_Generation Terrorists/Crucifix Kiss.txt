Crucifix Kiss Lyrics
So mighty so hegemonic so hating so desecrating
So there so nowhere so hurting
We fall between indifference rejection
And the whole fucking wall
We fall

Christen me FÃ¼hrer Nazarine
Believe in tomorrow but not today
Give me all your possessions
Make poverty your perfect home
Allow your leaders to control you
Questions are now blasphemy

Why walk when you can crawl
Stay on your knees and kiss my feet
Censorship'll stop your excess thought
Check your billboard for my tour

Listen to Luke sermon six
And if one of the occupation troops
Forces you to carry his pack
One kilometer carry it two
Be a tourist in the war zone
Interrogate scriptures and not your stinking home
That diet of bread and waters old
Now feed on alcohol drug and do what you're told
Now we'll take your number for a name
Soak mind control in christening water out of jail

Fall in love, fall in love with me
Nail a crucifix onto your soul
Fall in love, fall in love with me
Nail a crucifix onto your soul
Fall in love, fall in love with me
Nail a crucifix onto your soul
Fall in love, fall in love with me
Nail a crucifix onto your soul

Oh-woah-oooooo
Oh-woah-oooooo
Oh-woah-oooooo
Oh-woah-ooooooEmbed
