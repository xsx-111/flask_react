Born to End Lyrics
Get some pain and I feel alive - born to end
Close my eyes overdose on hell - born to end
Get run over by no direction - born to end
Breathing dead and I'm born to end - born to end

Fall to the floor my baby (baby)
I no longer believe (baby)
Fall to the floor my baby (baby)
I've lost the love to sleep

H-bomb the only thing that will bring a freedom to life
Underneath the blue skies beautiful empty dying
Nagasaki dolls are burning

Europe freed by McDonalds and Levi's - born to end
Can't afford it so I hate it all - born to end
Images linger like repression - born to end
Concentration camps of our dreams - born to end

Fall to the floor my baby (baby)
I no longer believe (baby)
Fall to the floor my baby (baby)
I've lost the love to sleep
H-bomb the only thing that will bring a freedom to life
Underneath the blue skies beautiful empty dying
Nagasaki dolls are burning
H-bomb the only thing that will bring a freedom to life
Underneath the blue skies beautiful
Empty dying dolls

Beg for mercy
Pray for warEmbed
