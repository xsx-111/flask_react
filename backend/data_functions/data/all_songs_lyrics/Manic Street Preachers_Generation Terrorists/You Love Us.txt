You Love Us Lyrics
We are not your sinners
Our voices are for real
We realized and won't be mourned
We going to burn your deathmask uniforms
We won't die of devotion
Understand we can never belong
Throw some acid into your face
Pollute your mineral water with a strychnine taste

You love us
You love
You love us
Oh you love us
You love
You love us
You love us
You love

'Til I see love in statues
Your lessons drill inherited sin
Parliaments a fake life saver
You better wake up and smell the real flavour
You love us like a holocaust
Same P.R. problem as E.S.T
You love us like a holocaust
Same P.R. problem as E.S.T
You love us
You love
You love us
Oh you love us
You love
You love us
You love us
You love
You love us
You love
You love us
Oh you love us
You love
You love us
You love us
You loveEmbed
