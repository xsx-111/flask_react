Repeat (Stars and Stripes) Lyrics
I've seen this happen before
This is a message from occupied England
British adults expect a nuclear war in our lifetime
From earliest human existence there proved to be two fundamental ways of thinking

Repeat after me
Fuck queen and country
Repeat after me
Death sentence heritage
Repeat after me
Death camp palace

Useless generations
Dumb flag scum
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum

Repetition

Repeat after me
Fuck queen and country
Repeat after me
Royal Khmer Rouge
Repeat after me
Imitation demi-gods
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum

I've seen this happen before
A force of sensationalism
A force of sensationalism
From earliest human existence there proved to be two fundamental ways of thinking
What happens to the brains?
What happens?
British adults expect a nuclear war in our lifetime

Useless generations
Dumb flag scum
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum

Repeat after me
Fuck queen and country
Repeat after me
Royal Khmer Rouge
Repeat after me
Imitation demi-gods
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum
Useless generations
Dumb flag scum

British adults expect a nuclear war in our lifetime
British adults expect a nuclear war in our lifetimeEmbed
