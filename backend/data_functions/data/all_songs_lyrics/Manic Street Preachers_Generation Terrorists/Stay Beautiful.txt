Stay Beautiful Lyrics
Find your faith in your security
All broken up at seventeen
Jam your brain with broken heroes
Love your masks and adore your failure
We're a mess of eyeliner and spraypaint
D.I.Y. destruction on Chanel chic
It's a culture of consumption
This is a culture of destruction

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just

Babes on the run with poisoned lips
Wrap your arms round this everlasting kiss
Clinging to your own sense of waste
All we love is lonely wreckage
Your school, your dole and your chequebook dreams
Your clothes, your suits and your pension schemes
Now you say you know how we feel
But don't fall in love cos we hate you still

Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just

Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Anxiety is freedomEmbed
