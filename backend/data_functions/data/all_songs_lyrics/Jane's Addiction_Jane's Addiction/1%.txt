1% LyricsAll the people I know wanna be left alone
Some people! I don't know?
They won't leave you alone
You gotta be just - be just like them
Biggest gang I know they call the government
Gang is a weapon
That you trade your mind in for
You gotta be just - be just like them
The gang
And the government
No different
The gang
And the government
No different
The gang
And the government
No different
That makes me 1%
That makes me 1%
Trouble comes down
Like a foot steppin heavy
Shake your fist
At the bitch
Or wave your money
You gotta be right
You gotta be right
Don't be no
Supper for a big fish
With the big lip
And the over -
Bite - bite
You gotta bite
Bite - bite - bite - dabita
Bite - bite - badadabita
Bite - bite - bite - bite
Bite - bite - bite - bite
All the people I know wanna be left alone
Some people I don't know?
They won't leave you alone!
You gotta be just - be just like them
The gang
And the government
No different
The gang
And the government
No different
The gang
And the government
No different
That makes me 1%
That makes me 1%
That makes me 1%
That makes me 1%Embed
