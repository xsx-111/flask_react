My Time LyricsYeah the rain came
I said hey buddy
Buddy the streets are a snake skin
I belong
Out there walkin
Nobody's stoppin to bother me
They hide
Outside, the ceilings
Cryin'
Listen to the sound
Of the gutters runnin
Wash this dirty town
All fronts and no backs
Give me my time
Let me be
Outside
Under the ceiling
Cryin'
Yeah, all over me
Cryin'
Yeah, all over me
Outside you know
I listen to the sounds
Of the gutters runnin
Wash this dirty town
All fronts and no backs
Give me my time
Let me be
Outside
Under the ceilings
Cryin'
Yeah, all over me
Cryin'
Yeah, all over meEmbed
