I Would for You LyricsOh baby
I'm so tired
The man from the government
The man from the tax board
The man in the public school
The man owns the golden rule, yeah
I'm everybody's slave
I made you my slave
You said, "This I do for you
If it would help to give the world back
What it gave, then I would
I would
I would
I would
I would for you
I would for you"
You say my eyes are crazy eyes
Sometimes they are and so are you
And if you wonder what I would do
I would do anything if I could
You know I would
I would
I would
I would for you
I would for you
I would for you
I would for you, Kate
I would for you1Embed
