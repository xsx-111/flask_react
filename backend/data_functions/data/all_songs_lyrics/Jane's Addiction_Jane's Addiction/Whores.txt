Whores Lyrics
Way down low where the streets are littered
I find my fun with the freaks and the niggers
I don't want much man give me a little
Or I'm gonna take my chances if I get em
I love them whores they never judge you
What can you say when you're a whore?
They cast that pearl and it don't upset em
They take their chances if they get em

Hear me go off!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Need a little more
Goddamn you!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Give me some more!

You give me breadcrumbs
I'm tired of living the bosses' dream
They'll squeeze you dry man if you let em
Better take your - take your - take your chances if you get em
Hear me go off!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Need a little more
Goddamn you!
Give me some more!
Motherfucker!
Give me some more

Oh, I love them whores
Oh, I love them whores
Oh, I love them whores
Oh, I love them whores
Please give me more, please give me moreEmbed
