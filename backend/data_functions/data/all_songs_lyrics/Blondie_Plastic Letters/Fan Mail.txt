Fan Mail Lyrics
I set my hand to writing you
It drifted off the page
I sold my one vision for a piece of the cake
I haven't ate in days
For unspoken value, aesthetic and charm
I'd smile at you sideways
But the lighting is wrong, I'm taking a picture and counting the cost
While the bells in my ears keep ringing

I set my hand to writing you
It drifted of the page
I nearly fell, I feel like a lowlife in hell
And I haven't slept in days and days, days and days

Beat on my Fender through my Gemini 2
Play to the posters on the wall of my room
Thought I was crazy when I'd think about you
And the bells in my ears keep ringing
And the bells in my ears keep ringing
In my ear bells are ringingEmbed
