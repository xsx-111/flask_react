Youth Nabbed as Sniper LyricsSundown finds him out of town on the overpass
His inner self glued to his .22
Dirty metal in the speed of night
Lights and broken glass
My heart can destroy all I see
Moving streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only
I can hide us far from sight
But you must wait and I must fight;
This nothingness
Walls, I see my little room
I hear my parent's friends
I hope that my actions make amends
I would like to kill for love, but I don't know how
Here I lie so high above the crowd
Busy streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only
I can move us through the night
But you must wait and I must fight;
This emptiness
Black top burns with silent screams
Others stop my dreams
Lightning crash, crash, crash!
Fear causes some to live
Others die real cool
I died in the evening after school
Be mine only
Be my own
Be mine only
Be my own1Embed
