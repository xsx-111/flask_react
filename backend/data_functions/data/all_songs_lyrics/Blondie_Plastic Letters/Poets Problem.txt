Poets Problem Lyrics
Poet's problem, patron saint
Puts me in the place I'm in
Passion's letter, poison pen
On these two things I can depend

You will write your number, that's not all
I will not be there when you call
I think I'll do a line and then again...

Dirty dealer's school of thought
An armchair for the strength you've lost
The TV set's been on all night
You were wrong and I was right

You will write your number on the wall
I will not be there when you call
I think I'll do a line and then again...Embed
