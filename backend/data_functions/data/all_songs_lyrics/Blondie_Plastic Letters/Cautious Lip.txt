Cautious Lip Lyrics
(All the way down do it)
(Another way down)
(Why, yeah. What do you know, huh?)
I seen you skip
That cautious lip
Now tell me this
Through that cautious lip
You can be bit
As I make you it
I seen you skip
That cautious lip
A chance you'll fit
That cautious lip
It's just these things
Not really gifts
It's just these things
Not really gifts
I seen you skip
That cautious lip

I seen you skip
That cautious lip
But never miss
My bouncing hips
A girl so sweet
A love so strong
I seen you skip
I see you tip
You can be bit
As I make you it
I seen you skip
That cautious lip
Ah, I seen you skip
That cautious lip
Ah, cautious lip
Cautious lip
You can be bit
I'll make you it
I seen you skip
Cautious lip
Change your fit
Skip of the lip
Oh, oh, not really get
Skip lip
What's going on?
