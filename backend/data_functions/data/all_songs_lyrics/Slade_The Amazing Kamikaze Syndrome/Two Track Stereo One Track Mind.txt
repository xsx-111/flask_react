With her one track mind - With her one track mind
She was a hooked on two track stereo with her one track mind
Woh-ho-oh
Well she always had lousy timing
But she'd like making love to music, wearing headphones (woh-ho-oh)
Wearing headphones yeah-yeah-yeah
They get in the way of talking and it don't sound the same
When you have to shout sweet nothings (wo oh oh oh) through her headphones (wo oh oh oh)
With a one track mind, upgraded her behind
She was hooked on two track stereo, with a one track mind
She'd be late for a date on purpose, making sure that she keeps you waiting
While she makes up, another new face
She was always forgetting something and could easily lose her head
Then there'd be nowhere, to hang her headphones, yeah yeah yeah
With a one track mind, upgraded her behind
She was hooked on two track stereo, with a one track mind
Oh, well she always had lousy timing, wearing headphones, when she's out eating or out walking
Like a zombie, yeah
With a one track mind, paraded her behind
She was hooked on two track stereo, with a one track mind
One track mind - What's going through her mind?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
