Slam the Hammer Down LyricsSpoken Hey you - You up there - Yeah you
Can you hear me? I said, I said
Can you hear me?
Don't you listen to me when I'm talking to you?
If you can't go for it, you can't go for it good!
And that means you ain't gonna get away from what you got comin'!
She's a cool kinda mama - Sure gonna slam the hammer down
When your pistons are pumping - Sure gonna slam the hammer down
Oh when your body starts to shake It's time to loosen off the brake
And ram it down
Push the pedal to the metal - Sure gonna slam the hammer down
Gonna burn up the rubber - Sure gonna slam the hammer down
The chequered flag won't make you stop
You keep on going 'til you drop and ramming it down
Keep a moving and motor racing and the wheels go round and round
Oh when you win you'll be celebrating, ready to slam the hammer on down
Got a flash little chassis
Screams when you slam the hammer down
First, second, third and fourth
Into top and ram the hammer down
You know it's getting all too much
When you're letting out the clutch
And ramming it down
Keep a moving accelerating
And you're waiting to face the crowd
Now you're opening up a wide gap
Ready to slam the hammer on down
Yeah.... yeah.... yeah....
Yeh.. yeh.. yeh!
Yeh.. yeh...!
You dun alright You dun alright You dun alright You dun alright
Oh she's a cool kinda mama Sure gonna slam the hammer down
Get it up and ram it up And baby gonna ram the hammer down
When you loosen off the brake Oh when you're body starts to shake
Fill her up with juice then baby Gonna slam the hammer downEmbed
