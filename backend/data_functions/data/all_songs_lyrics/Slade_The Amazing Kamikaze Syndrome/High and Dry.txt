High and Dry LyricsOver and over
You're such a shy girl
See you every day
Oh me oh my girl
Don't know what to say
Have you lost your voice
Are you spoilt for choice
My reputation's strictly for the birds
Don't believe in everything you've heard
How I operate - You ain't got long to wait
We'll do it over and over (don't you turn me over)
Then I love 'em and leave 'em high
Over and over (don't you turn me over)
Then I love 'em and leave 'em high - High and dry
You take me home and I promise I'll behave
Won't wake your ma, I'll be silent as the grave
You'll be the first to crack - then you'll want me back
To do it over and over (don't you turn me over)
Then I love 'em and leave 'em high
Over and over (don't you turn me over)
Then I love 'em and leave 'em high
High and dry - High and dry
You're such a shy girl, See you every day
Oh me oh my girl, Don't know what to say
You want equality - You won't get none of that from me
We'll do it - Over and over (don't you turn me over)
Then I love 'em and leave 'em high
Over and over (don't you turn me over)
Then I love 'em and leave 'em high - High and dry
I leave 'em I leave 'em High and dry
I love 'em I leave 'em - I love 'em I leave 'em high
I love 'em, I leave 'em - I leave 'em High and dry
I leave 'em High and dry - I love and leave 'em highEmbed
