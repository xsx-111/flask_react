My Oh My LyricsI believe in woman, my oh my
I believe in lovin', my oh my
Don't a women need a man, try and catch one if you can
I believe in woman, my oh my
We all need someone to talk to my oh my
We all need someone to talk to my oh my
Ya need a shoulder to cry on, call me I'll be standing by
We all need someone to talk to my oh my
We all need a lot of lovin' my oh my
Yeah, a whole lot of lovin' my oh my
I can lend a helpin' hand if you ain't go nothing planned
We all need some lovin' my oh oh my
So let's all swing together my oh my
We can all swing together my oh my
You've got troubles on your own, no need to face them all alone
We can all swing together my oh my
So let's all pull together my oh my...Embed
