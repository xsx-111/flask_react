Run Runaway LyricsHold on!
I like black and white
(Dreaming of black and white)
You like black and white
Run run away
See chameleon
(Lying there in the sun)
All things to everyone
Run run away
If you're in the swing
(Money ain't everything)
If you're in the swing
Run run away
See chameleon
(Lying there in the sun)
All things to everyone
Run run away
If you gotta crush
(Don't beat about the bush)
When I gotta crush
Run run away
See chameleon
(Lying there in the sun)
All things to everyone
Run run away
Oh now can't you wait
(Love don't come on a plate)
Oh now can't you wait
Run run away
See the chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run run away
Run run away
Run run away
