Cocky Rock Boys (Rule O.K.) LyricsRock me boys - rock me boys!You and me are the greatest thing
You and me are the honky kings
Rockin' on is the next best thing
To good love - to good love
A little bit of what you like
Slaps your face, says, 'on yer bike!'
She told you once and told you twice
There's no way - no way
You cocky rock boys
You wanna roll away
You cocky rock boys
You rule o.k
You cocky rock boys
You wanna roll away
You cocky rock boys
You rule o.k. - you rule o.k
Get your oats in while you can
You're full of wit and it hits the fan
A fifty - fifty gambling man
Has no chance - no chance
You live on speed and it breaks your neck
A clapped out, living, loving wreck
You gotta keep yourself in check
I tell ya - tell ya
You cocky rock boys
You wanna roll away
You cocky rock boys
You rule o.k
You cocky rock boys
You wanna roll away
You cocky rock boys
You rule o.k. - you rule o.k
Yeah...
Oh won't you rock me - rock me boys, rock me boys
Oh won't you rock me - roll away, roll away
Oh won't you rock me - oh won't you rock me
Oh won't you rock me - oh won't you rock me
Yeah...
You cocky rock boys
You wanna roll away
You cocky rock boys
You rule o.k
You cocky rock boys
You wanna roll away
You cocky rock boys
You rule o.k. - you rule o.k
You cocky rock boys - you cocky rock boys
You cocky rock boys
You Frank and Johnny - you Frank and Johnny
You Frank and Johnny - you're hurting my arm
You Frank and JohnnyEmbed
