Razzle Dazzle Man LyricsWanna be a big operator do ya dig
You play hard to get and make me laugh yeh
Wanna face the rat race - Wanna find myself a place
A womaniser on my epitaph
I'm your man - I'm your Razzle Dazzle Man
I'm your man - I'm your Razzle Dazzle Man
Oh but I know for sure, you'll keep coming back for more
Take me I'm yours
Yeh I'm your man - I'm your man - I'm your man - I'm your man
Wanna be a smooth operator in a groove - Oh I'm a man of means Wanna be
Like a sheik A harem makes you weak
Break right into my dreams
I'm your man I'm your Razzle Dazzle Man
I'm your man I'm your Razzle Dazzle Man
Oh but I know for sure - You'll keep coming back for more
Take me I'm yours
Yeh I'm your man - I'm your man - I'm your man - I'm your man
Baby baby you're looking so good
I ain't seen ya since I don't know when
Baby baby baby Baby baby Baby baby
Where do we go from here
You wanted a car You wanted a ring
You wanted to take all my money You wanted everything
And I couldn't give you everything
It's good to see you don't you know
It's bin a long time don't you know
It's good to see you don't you know
It's bin a long time don't you know
It's good to see you don't you know
It's bin a long time don't you know
It's good to see you don't you know
It's bin a long time don't you know
You're never gonna change
You're never gonna act your ageEmbed
