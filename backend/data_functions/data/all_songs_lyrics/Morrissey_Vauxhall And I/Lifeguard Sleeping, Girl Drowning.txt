Lifeguard Sleeping, Girl Drowning Lyrics
Always looking for attention
Always needs to be mentioned
Who does she think she should be?
The shrill cry through darkening air
Doesn't she know he's had such a busy day?
Tell her, sshhh
Somebody tell her, sshhh
(Oh, no way, no way, no way, no way, there's no movement
Oh, oh, hooray
Slowest...)

It was only a test
But she swam too far against the tide
She deserves all she gets
The sky became mad with stars
As an out-stretched arm slowly disappears
Hooray, oh hooray!
(No, oh, oh, oh, there's no movement
No, oh hooray, oh hooray)
Please don't worry
There'll be no fuss
She was nobody's nothing
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
When he awoke
The sea was calm
And another day passes like a dream
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)1Embed
