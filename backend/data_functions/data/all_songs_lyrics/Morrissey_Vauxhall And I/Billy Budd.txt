Billy Budd Lyrics
Say, Billy Budd
So you think you should?
Oh, everyone's laughing
Say, Billy Budd
So you think that you should?
Everyone's laughing!
Since I took up with you
Things have been bad
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on
Now it's 12 years on
Yes, and I took up with you

I took my job application into town
Did you hear? They turned me down
Yes, and it's all because of us
Oh, and what was in our eyes
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah

I said, Billy Budd
I would happily lose
Both of my legs
I would lose both of my legs
Oh, if it meant you could be free
Oh, if it meant you could be free
(Don't leave us in the dark!)Embed
