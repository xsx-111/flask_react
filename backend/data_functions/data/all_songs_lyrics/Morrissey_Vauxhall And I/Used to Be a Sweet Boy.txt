Used to Be a Sweet Boy Lyrics
Used to be a sweet boy
Holding so tightly
To Daddy's hand
But that was all
In some distant land
Blazer and tie
And a big bright healthy smile
Used to make all
Of our trials worthwhile
Used to be a sweet boy
And I'm not to blame
But something went wrong
And I know
I'm not to blame
Something went wrong
Can't be to blame
Ah...Embed
