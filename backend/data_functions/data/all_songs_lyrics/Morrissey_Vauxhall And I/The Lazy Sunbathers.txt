The Lazy Sunbathers Lyrics
A world war
Was announced
Days ago
But they didn't know
The lazy sunbathers
The lazy sunbathers
The sun burns through
To the planet's core
And it isn't enough
They want more

Nothing
Appears
To be
Between the ears of
The lazy sunbathers
Too jaded
To question stagnation
The sun burns through
To the planet's core
And it isn't enough
They want more

Religions fall
Children shelled
(... children shelled? that's all very well
But would you please keep the noise down low?
Because you're waking
The lazy sunbathers...)Embed
