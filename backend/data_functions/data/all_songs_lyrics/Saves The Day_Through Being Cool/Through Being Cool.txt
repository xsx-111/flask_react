Through Being Cool Lyrics
You know what?
The next time you see Nick
Tell him I'm gonna stick some needles in his face
Then watch him on his knees
Watch him when he sees that I'm not fooling

'Cause I'm through being cool
And he keeps telling everyone about me
Like how I'm such a fool and oh, that I'm so deceptive

I think I'll make him eat the ground
I think that I will turn around and notice the wind blowing tops of trees
I'll see the way the world begins to need color everywhere
And I'll realize how small I really am

'Cause I'm through being cool
And he keeps telling everyone about me
Yeah, like how I'm such a fool and oh, that I'm so receptive

I'll spin right back around
And say, "Nick, why are you such a prick?
Why don't you just marvel in the hopes that make up this reality?
Your world is what you made it
And I don't want a part of it
Chill out."1Embed
