Banned from the Back Porch Lyrics
I stepped out into the night
Put my feet down on the wet patio floor
The sky's air had been cooling
Steam rose from everywhere
I could feel drops of rain slipping off tree's leaves
Spattering to the ground
It's always misty after a summer pour
I remember turning around and looking out
And staring in and focusing on that one beautiful girl

And I said, "Oh, who is this?
Where was she all those crazy years?
Oh, who is this?
Where was she when my heart couldn't take its beat?"

I sipped down
Warm ginger ale
Drew back a breath
And headed over to see about this girl
I couldn't say a thing and I stared open and wide
And connected with her eyes to feel my gut fall through the floor
 
"Oh, who is this?
Where was she all those crazy years?
Oh, who is this?
Where was she when my heart couldn't take its beat?"Embed
