Third Engine Lyrics
The sky grows bigger every day
And the other week I hopped on a train
Cutting through state lines
To come to you as the crow flies
Out there in the offing everything was melon and orange

Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?

And I just want you to know
That every pool of water reminds me of you
Is that all right?
I hope you think it's cool
Sometimes a train can't go as fast as I want it to

Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?
I rolled over and over
Trying to touch your knees underneath the sheets
Trying to touch your knees

Everything seemed a little easier
When we weren't one hundred miles apart
The person across from me
Sitting in her train seat, reminded me of you
And I looked out past her cheeks
Through the glass-light conduit
The sun had sunk
Disappeared into New Jersey
"Oh, why don't they have phones on these things?"
What can I do?
I'm stuck thinking about you
Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?
I rolled over and over
Trying to touch your knees underneath the sheets
Trying to touch your kneesEmbed
