You Vandal Lyrics
Last night I dreamt you called from Costa Rica
The place you've been the last two weeks
You said, "I miss you, oh sweet boy, and will you come on down?"
I woke up to my cold sheets and the smell of New Jersey
When do I get to wake up to you?
Tonight I can't forget that I've got these open wounds
It's such a drag
I can't forget you've gone
My ribs have parted ways
They said, "We're not going to protect this heart you have."

Whoa hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
My spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa hey, what can I do?
You've left me in the cold
And I miss you

You never told me it would be this hard
I think my body's saying so
When you aren't here, it's got to go
It's leaving me
But I hope that you're okay
Even though I'm dying
I hope that you're still trying to have a killer time
Go see the volcanoes
Go see the rainforests
I'll be fine by myself
Yeah, I'll be fine without these bones
Whoa hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
My spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa hey, what can I do?
You've left me in the cold
And I miss you
Whoa hey, miss you
Whoa hey, miss youEmbed
