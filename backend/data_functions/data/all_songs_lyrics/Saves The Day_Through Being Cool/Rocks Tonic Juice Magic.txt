Rocks Tonic Juice Magic Lyrics
Let me take this awkward saw
Run it against your thighs
Cut some flesh away
I'll carry this piece of you with me
'Cause all I can say tonight is, "I hate you."
But it would be all right
If we could see each other sometime
If I could somehow make you mine

And if not, I'll take my spoons
Dig out your blue eyes
Swallow them down to my colon
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
'Cause you're beautiful
Just not on the inside
Light comes from within
And your beaming eyes don't seem so bright

Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Boardwalks and breaking waves
Made our Saturdays
I'd buy you lemonade right now
If you were here
Then I'd throw it in your face
And I'd listen to you cry
Remember how I miss
Our nights underneath ocean skies

Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
 
You and I are like when fire
And the ocean floor collideEmbed
