Holly Hox, Forget Me Nots LyricsSomewhere under water
Maybe you could find my heart
That's where I threw it after you had torn it out
Oh, three days ago
The doctor he said so, told me:
Every skyline and every night spent alone
Is tearing me apart
Maybe I should get some help
Maybe I should fly out to Montana
It's quiet
Out past the electric lines
Out where no one will know my name
Oh, I've had it now
I am walking down to your house
Banging on the door
"Please, please, please, Mr. Hox
Won't you tell your daughter I'm all alone
And I'm not handling this well."
You never know what you have
Until you get it yanked out of your chest
I am walking to the water
Standing on the bank
Staring at my reflection
"Oh my god, I look pathetic tonight."
Well, guess what now?
I'm diving in this river
Fishing out my heart
Never gonna let you
Never gonna let you get your hands on this againEmbed
