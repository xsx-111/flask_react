Do You Know What I Love the Most? Lyrics
Do you know what I love the most?
Even suburbs would be okay
With you beneath my sheets
Breeze in my window
'Cause we will go there
Ignore all our neighbors
I think I'll bring you breakfast
Play Johnny Cash on the stereo
I'll sit in the lazy chair all day remembering the things you do
So when you come home
I'll jump up to kiss you

And it will knock you back
You'll fall over our TV set
I'll pick you up to dust you off
"Baby, let's give it a go."
Kiss your thighs to make you feel all right
Then I will get closer
To taste a little sweat
I think I'm rearing to go
You're gonna get knocked out
Tied up in my trunk
In ten years we'll go to Ohio
Steal Cadillacs for a livingEmbed
