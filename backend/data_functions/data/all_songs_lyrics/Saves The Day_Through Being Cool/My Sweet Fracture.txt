My Sweet Fracture Lyrics
Could you tell me the next time that you're choking?
I'll run right over to shove some dirt right down your throat
It's nothing I have against you
You're just a creep and you can't remember the last five years
What's a bond if it dissolves in water?
I took a piss that lasted longer than you and your manipulations
Called my mom last night
She said, "Sweetie, you don't need someone
Who's more fleeting than fall"

Don't you love those leaves?
Don't you wish the orange stayed forever?
And crickets sang in the night
All through winter

And I thought, slow down
Think of all the times this jerk has fucked you up and left you down
And hey, I choose my company by the beating of their hearts
Not the swelling of their heads, no

Don't you love those leaves?
Don't you wish the orange stayed forever?
And crickets sang in the night
All through winter
Besides, I'd rather forget the days we spent than
Try to stay afloat in shallow water

Rather forget
The days we spent
Than try to stay sadEmbed
