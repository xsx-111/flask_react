Suffer Lyrics
Did you ever see the concrete
Stares of everyday?
The lunatic, the hypocrite
Are all lost in the fray

Can't you see their lives are just like yours?
An unturned stone, an undiscovered door leading to
The gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer

The businessman whose master plan
Controls the world each day
Is blind to indications of
His species' slow decay

Can't you see his life is just like yours?
An unturned stone, an undiscovered door leading to
The gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer

People blow their minds, they choose to resign
This deformed society is part of the design
It'll never go away, it's in the cards that way
The masses of humanity have always, always had to suffer
A door leading to
The gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
The masses of humanity still clinging to their dignity
The masses of humanity will always have to suffer
Always have to sufferEmbed
