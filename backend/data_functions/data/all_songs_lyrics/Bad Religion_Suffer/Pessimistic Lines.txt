Pessimistic Lines Lyrics
So here we are again to experience the bitter, scalding end
And we're the only ones who can perceive it
But others sing of beauty and the story that's unfolded
As one that deserves praise and ritual

My pessimistic lines, your superstitious lives
And the modern age's lies won't absolve you
And the professorial truth and the dear clairvoyant youth
And of course the nightly news will deceive you
(Watch out!)

My pessimistic lines, your superstitious lives
And the modern age's lies won't absolve you
And the professorial truth and the dear clairvoyant youth
And of course the nightly news will deceive you
(Let's go!)Embed
