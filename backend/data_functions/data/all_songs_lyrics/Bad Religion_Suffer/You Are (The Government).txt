You Are (The Government) Lyrics
Hey sit down and listen and they'll tell you when you're wrong
Eradicate but vindicate as "progress" creeps along
Puritan work ethic maintains its subconscious edge
As Old Glory maintains your consciousness

There's a loser in the house, and a puppet on the stool
And a crowded way of life, and a black reflecting pool
And as the people bend, the moral fabric dies
The country can't pretend to ignore its people's cries

Cause you are the government
You are jurisprudence
You are the volition
You are jurisdiction
And I make a difference tooEmbed
