Part IV (The Index Fossil) Lyrics
We're widespread and well fed
The earth's rotating fate is in our head, oh yeah
We're dominant and prominent
And our deity's omnipotent, oh yeah

And immortality's in our mastermind
And we destroy everything that we find
And tomorrow when the human clock stops and the world stops ticking
We'll be an index fossil buried in our own debris

We're listless, promiscuous
And life to us is either hit or miss, oh yeah
We're savoir faire and debonaire
And things we do are done with pride and care, oh yeah

And immortality's in our mastermind
And we destroy everything that we find
And tomorrow when the human clock stops and the world stops ticking
We'll be an index fossil buried in our own debris
See, immortality's in our mastermind
And we destroy everything that we find
And tomorrow when the human clock stops and the world stops ticking
We'll be an index fossil buried in our own debris
In our own debrisEmbed
