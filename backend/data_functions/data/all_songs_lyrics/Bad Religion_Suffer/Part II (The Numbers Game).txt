Part II (The Numbers Game) Lyrics
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

It's superficial progress
They call it liberation
With opiates of silicon
Big Brother schemes to rule the nation

We're one nation under God, we stand above the rest;
With mighty high technology, we're never second best
Our specialty is infiltration
Prepare yourself for subjugation, victory through domination
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

The trepidatious throngs
All fear the big eye in the sky
The government observes them
With their own electric eye

We're one nation under God, we stand above the rest;
With mighty high technology, we're never second best
Our specialty is infiltration
Prepare yourself for subjugation
Automatons, illiterates
And indigents of every shape and size
Don't stop but aid this cruel crusade
Participate in their own demise

We're one nation under God, we stand above the rest
With mighty high technology, we're never second best
Our specialty is infiltration
So pack your bags you third-world nation, victory through dominationEmbed
