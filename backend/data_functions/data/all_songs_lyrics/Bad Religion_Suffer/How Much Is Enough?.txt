How Much Is Enough? Lyrics
Tell me can the hateful chain be broken?
Production and consumption define our hollow lives
Avarice has led us across the ocean
Toward a land that's better, much more bountiful and wide

When will mankind finally come to realize
His surfeit has become his demise?
How much is enough to kill yourself?
That quantity is known today, as we blow ourselves away

Tell me is there anything so sure?
Rapacity, tenacity, capacity for more!
Like a dog that feeds until he suffers
The infirmity of man is brought on by his selfish cure

When will mankind finally come to realize
His surfeit has become his demise?
How much is enough to kill yourself?
That quantity is known today, as we blow ourselves awayEmbed
