Land of Competition Lyrics
Hey, see there's a girl who's afraid of the world
So she stays at home
Also a boy who seems so lost in his joy
He's all alone

The camera's on them, they're in the land of competition
Southern California air feeds them
And they know they're best 'cause of the way they are dressed
You can bet you are not welcome in their home

Hey, see there's a girl who sits and watches the world
From her blue screen
Also a boy who truly wants to destroy
His hometown scene

They both want to travel to the land of competition
Southern California will destroy them
And they won't be the best, they'll be the poseurs who dress
Like the plastic idiots who they copy

Tell me what do you need to make you happy?
Indeed, is it out of your reach?
Beware of number one, see all the damage it has done
There are so few of them
You won't find too many in the land of competition
Southern California doesn't breed them
If you just want the best turn to yourself for the rest
And forget about the ones who have it all

Be careful of the ones who have it all
Be careful of the ones who have it all
Forget about the ones who have it all, yeahEmbed
