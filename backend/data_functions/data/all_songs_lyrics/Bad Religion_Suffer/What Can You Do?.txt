What Can You Do? Lyrics
So you waste another day getting older and gray in the head
And you're hearing lots of stories about the happy times you have ahead
There are other folks in power so you kick back and get farther behind
And although the world rotates itself the only thing you twist is your mind

You see, the world's falling apart at the rifts
And surprisingly, the leaders can't make any sense of it
You mean nothing to the world, we're all someone else's fool
But oh, what can you do?

Yeah you waste your time with losers if you get stuck in a rock-n-roll band
Do you find it more rewarding to compete with morons throughout this land?
They seem to be in power so I'll kick back and get farther behind
And I watch them as they fuck up every good thing on this earth with their minds

You see, the world's falling apart at the rifts
And surprisingly, the leaders can't make any sense of it
You mean nothing to the world, we're all someone else's fool
But, oh, what can you do?

Yeah, you waste another day getting older and gray in the head
And we're hearing lots of stories about the happy times we have ahead
The morons are in power so we kick back and get farther behind
And we watch them as they fuck up every good thing on this earth with their minds
You see, the world's falling apart at the rifts
And surprisingly, the leaders can't make any sense of it
We mean nothing to the world, merely someone else's fool
But oh, what can you do?
I said, oh, what can you do?Embed
