When? Lyrics
I've seen a lot of things in five years
I struggle just to hold back the tears
But every-fucking-where-I-go I see the pathos that I know
Will spell the termination of us all

Someone's got to tell me, do you see
That everything around you has a hidden tragedy?
Seeds of happiness have never found a place to grow
And our generation doesn't know

When, when will you try
To change the logarithmic pace of kissing things goodbye?
When, when will you know
That human life is so short and death is oh so slow?

I've tried to make things make sense but I can't
I'm happy just to watch them all and laugh
And if you think you've got it made, just revel in your selfish ways
'Cause when the world stops turning so will you!Embed
