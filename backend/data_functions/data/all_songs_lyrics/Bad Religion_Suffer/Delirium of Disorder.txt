Delirium of Disorder Lyrics
Delirium of Disorder
Delirium of Disorder

Life is the sieve through which my anarchy strains
Resolving itself into works
Chaos is the score upon which reality is written
The timeless, swirling gyroscopic horde

Delirium
Delirium of disorder

Yeah! I am just an atom in an ectoplasmic sea
Without direction or a reason to exist
The anechoic nebula rotating in my brain
Is persuading me, contritely, to persist

Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
