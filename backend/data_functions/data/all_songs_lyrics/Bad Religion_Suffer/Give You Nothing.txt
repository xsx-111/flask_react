Give You Nothing Lyrics
Hey, everybody's looking but they never can see
All the angst, corruption and the dishonesty
Think about the times and places you've never known
You're a man-swarm atom and yet you're alone

So I give you me, I give you nothing!
I give you me, I give you nothing!

So you got a place that you can call all your own
But you've got a habit of carrying the stone
Look around and ask someone if you are alive
You're a sidewalk cipher speaking prionic jive

So I give you me, I give you nothing!
I give you me, I give you nothing!

Respectable, despicable, it seems all the same
Now we realize that we have nothing to say
If your reserve is weak, audacity complete
Ask yourself again, "Do I deserve much from them?" No!
Hey, everybody's looking but they never can see
All the angst, corruption and the dishonesty
Look around and ask someone if you are alive
You're a sidewalk cipher speaking prionic jive
So I give you me, I give you nothing!
I said I give you me, I give you nothing!Embed
