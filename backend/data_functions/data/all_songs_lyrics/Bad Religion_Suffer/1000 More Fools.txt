1000 More Fools Lyrics
I heard them say that the meek shall reign on earth
Phantasmal myriads of sane bucolic birth
I've seen the rapture in a starving baby's eyes
Inchoate beatitude, the Lord of the Flies

So what does it mean when your mind starts to stray?
Kaleidoscopic images of love on the way
Brother you'd better get down on your knees and pay
1,000 more fools are being born every fucking day

They try to tell me that the lamb is on the way
With microwave transmissions they bombard us every day
The masses are obsequious, contented in their sleep
The vortex of their minds ensconced within the murky deep

So what does it mean when your mind starts to stray?
Kaleidoscopic images of love on the way
Brother you'd better get down on your knees and pay
1,000 more fools are being born every fucking day3Embed
