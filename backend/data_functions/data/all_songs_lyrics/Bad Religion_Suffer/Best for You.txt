Best for You Lyrics
Above us lay the burdens, below us lay the truth
We're somewhere in the middle, and we're all discontent too
Is someone watching over you?
Inside they know what's best for you

Judgment's not tomorrow, its today yes now it's here
But no it isn't Jesus, take a look at all your peers
They're all looking down on you
Inside they know what's best for you...

Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for youEmbed
