Dig Down (Acoustic Gospel Version) Lyrics
When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground
You must find a way
When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end
You must find a way
When God decides to look the other way
And a clown takes the throne
We must find a way
Face the firing squad, against all the odds
We must find a way

Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith
When you're close to the edge
With a gun to your head
You must find a way

When friends are thin on the ground and they try to divide us
We must find a way
We have entered the fray and we will not obey
We must find a way, yeah
Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith
When they've left you for dead and you can only see red
We must find a way
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Dig down
Dig down
Dig down, find faith
We won't let them divide, we will never abide
We must find a way

Dig down (Woah-oh-oh)
Dig down (Woah-oh-oh)
Dig down (Woah-oh-oh)
Faith (Woah-oh-oh)
Dig down (Woah-oh-oh)
Dig down (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
