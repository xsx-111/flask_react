Propaganda (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-paganda
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-propa-gan-ganda
Propa-gan ga
Propa-propa-gan-ganda
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-ga-ga-ga-ga

Floozy
You got me trapped in your dark fantasy world
Don't you know you make me woozy?
You have me wrapped around your little finger

Baby, don't you know you can't lose
You make me offers that I can't refuse
You keep telling pretty lies
You toy with the truth
Oh you're killing me with your

Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-paganda
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-propa-gan-ganda
Propa-gan gan
Propa-propa-gan-ganda
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-ga-ga-ga-ga
Cold chick
You ate my soul just like a Death Eater
I'm the ocean, you're an oil slick
Now I am choking on your thought pollution

Baby, don't you know you can't lose
You make me offers that I can't refuse
You keep telling pretty lies
You toy with the truth
Oh you're killing me with your

Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-paganda
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-propa-gan-ganda
Propa-gan ga
Propa-propa-gan-ganda
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-ga-ga-ga-ga

Can't lose
You make me offers that I can't refuse
You keep telling pretty lies, babe
Baby, don't you know you can't lose?
You make me offers that I can't refuse, yeah
You keep telling pretty lies, babe
Don't you know that you just can't lose?
You make me offers that I can't refuse, yeah
You keep telling pretty lies
You play with the truth
Oh you're killing me with your
Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-gandaEmbed
