Black Candle Lyrics
Gathered my luck and I went with my brother
To where the witch on the hill threw the bones of her mother
To where the bravest birds in the height of the sky
Tumble down the mountainside
And gather to pray like a blanket on the fallen ground

Like prayin' ain't a waste of time

She told me again that she knew I'd be comin'
And she padded her gown with all my counterfeit money
She said your love is locked in the garden you grow
A soldier's wound that bleeds through his clothes
So pick up your gun and pray there's no one left to fight

Like praying ain't a waste of time

Ain't a waste of time
Ain't a waste of time

I said you've given me less than you know I can handle
So the witch on the hill lit a single black candle
And said the name of God is carved on a blade
The deals you make will turn in flames
So pray for love and the world to prayin' comes
Like praying ain't a waste of timeEmbed
