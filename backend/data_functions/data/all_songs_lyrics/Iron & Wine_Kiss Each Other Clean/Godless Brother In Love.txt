Godless Brother In Love LyricsGodless brother in love you might as well
Lay down that rose and fold the flag
She is money and tabs that broken freedom in
See her big children burning rags by the riverside
You can hear them on the hilltop laughing
Cursing every bird in the air
Telling her what fun they're having
Driving eyes closed
Godless brother, as far as I can tell
The night won't compensate the blind
She looks lovely as lightning all
But what the hell?
Her big kids all run down the road
With no memories at all
And you can hear them on the hilltop laughing
Cursing every bird in the air
Telling her what fun they're having
Driving eyes closedEmbed
