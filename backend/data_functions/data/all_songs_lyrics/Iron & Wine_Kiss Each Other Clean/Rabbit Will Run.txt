Rabbit Will Run Lyrics
Last I saw mother, she rose from a chair
When they caught me I just finished combing my hair
'Cause the rabbit will run as the colt does along with the mare
We've all learned the earth while we've carried the throne
We dove under the rivers and under our clothes
And I still have a prayer as sure as my settling bones

Last I saw mother, she covered my ears
When they caught me I offered the captain a beer
'Cause the rabbit will run and the lion has nothing to fear
We bricked up the garden and know what it means
And we've all kissed a virgin as if she were clean
And I still have a prayer despite all the colors I've seen

And judgment is just like a cup that we share
I'll jump over the wall and I'll wait for you there
Well past the weeds in our vision of things to come
We've all heard the rooster and all been denied
And we've seen through the haze and the spit in our eyes
And I still have a prayer, a well-weathered word to the wise
Last I saw mother, she smelled like a rose
When they caught me, the captain, he opened my nose
'Cause the rabbit will run and the wind takes a bird where it blows
We've all traded lovers and woke up alone
And we clapped for the king though our fingers were cold
I still have a prayer cause I love what I cannot control

Last I saw mother, she acted surprised
When they caught me, the captain, he cried like a child
'Cause the rabbit will run, and good dogs together go wild
We've all lived in grace at the end of the day
And we've armed all the children we thought we betrayed
I still have a prayer but too few occasions to pray

Judgment is just like a cup that we share
I'll jump over the wall and I'll wait for you there
Well past the weeds in our vision of things to come
And we've all found a reason for hiding a gun
We've helped out a few if we've hurt anyone
I still have a prayer and so be it, I've done what I've done
Last I saw mother, she blew me a kiss
When they caught me, the cuffs cut the blood from my wrist
'Cause the rabbit will run and the pig has to lay in its piss
We've all given half to the hand in our face
We've all taken a stone from the holiest place
And I still have a prayer and I've furthered the world in my wakeEmbed
