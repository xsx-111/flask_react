Lean Into the Light Lyrics
We're not happy most of the time
We're not sad too often
We'll keep walking blind in the sun
While the rain is falling

But we'll laugh by the raging riverside
Laugh just as long as we're side by side
Laugh as we lean into the light
We're no better off than we were

We're no worse for trying
We'll keep walking blind by the rain
And all the church bells chime in
But we'll laugh as the tears roll from our eyes

Laugh holding hands and our knuckles white
Laugh as we lean into the light
Every morning, every goodnight
For very wrong word our mouths do make

We'll say a couple right
Every welcome, every goodbye
For every dark move our bodies make
We'll lean in towards the lightEmbed
