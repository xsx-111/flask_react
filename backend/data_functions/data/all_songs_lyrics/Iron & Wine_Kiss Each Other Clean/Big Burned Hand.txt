Big Burned Hand LyricsWhen the arrogant goddess of love came to steal my shoes
She had a white-hot pistol and a homemade heart tattoo
Singing, "one's to give and one's to take away
But neither of them will keep you off your knees"
Her children bowed and bolted off the stage
While the lion and the lamb kept fighting for the shade tree
When the winsome god of war came to set me free
He had a couple of coke bottles full of gasoline
Singing, "all I love is all that I allow"
And he blew me a kiss off a big burned hand
I nearly choked with smoke and fell down
While the lion and the lamb kept shooting at a tin can
When the gun shy goddess of love came back to patch things up
She had a purple heart and mother's milk in a plastic cup
Singing, "one will lay you gently in the grave
And one's the flag you fold before you go"
When the curtain rose the crowd was blown away
While the lion and the lamb kept fucking in the back rowEmbed
