Glad Man Singing Lyrics
Yeah, I've become a glad man singing a song
About a soldier want a boot and a fallen angel
Naked as a fish at night
About a sad man climbed up a willow bough
And the cops are on the fence 'round a dog in the manger
And the mouth of the river is wide

Wide, wide

Yeah, I've become a glad man singing a song
About the bushes by the gas pump gone to flower
And a constant star collides (woo)
About a sad man sayin' they've forgotten how
And the baby quit suckin' when the milk went sour
And the mouth of the river is wide

Wide, wide, wide, wide

About a sad man lost in a hammock sway
When the bridal gown came mama spit out the window
And the cops said the dog won't bite
And the sad man's sayin' they've forgotten how
And the blood runnin' black in the valley shadows
River runnin' all the while

Yeah, I've become a glad man singing a song
About a lover rolled over, said you must be tired
And the truth coming towards the light
About a sad man knocking on a chapel door
And a burned out boat called Trial by Fire
And the mouth of the river is wide

Wide, wide, wide, wide

Woo, woo, woo, wooEmbed
