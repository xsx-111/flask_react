Your Fake Name Is Good Enough For Me Lyrics
Fake watches in your broken hand barely keeping time
Barefoot in the city and your phone is ringing
Bet you're watching all the happy kids climbing on a car
They were singing something, maybe they were singing

Become the weeds, we will become
Become the sea, we will become

Your fake money gave you everything left along the road
You're cursing by the furnace and your phone is ringing
Bet you're watching all the happy kids clapping in the cool
They were singing something, maybe they were singing

Become the weeds, we will become
Become the sea, we will become

Your fake name is not for everyone, good enough for me
Forgotten by the garden and your phone is ringing
Bet you're watching all the happy kids kiss each other clean
They were singing something, maybe they were singing
Become the weeds, we will become
Become the sea, we will become

Become the rising sun
We will become, become
Become the damage done
We will become, become
Become the river's sway
We will become, become
Become the love we made
We will become, become
Become the endless chain
We will become, become
Become the forgotten name
We will become, become
Become the sinner and the saint
We will become, become
Become the bandage and the blade
We will become, become
Become the word and the breath
We will become, become
Become caught in the chest
We will become, become
Become lighten the load
We will become, become
Become the bruise and the blow
We will become, become
Become the fruit and the fall
We will become, become
Become the caress and the claw
We will become, become
Become the glory and the guilt
We will become, become
Become the blossom and the will
We will become, become
Become both right and wrong
We will become, become
Become the sound and the song
We will become, become
Become the tooth and the tongue
We will become, become
Become the target and the gun
We will become, become
Become so cruel and kind
We will become, become
Become wary and wild
We will become, become
Become allegiance and doubt
We will become, become
Become the whisper and the shout
We will become, become
Become the honest and avail
We will become, become
Become hammer and the nail
We will become, become
Become the blessing and the curse
We will become, become
Become, well, there could be worse
We will become, become
Become the blood and the bone
We will become, become
Become an ice cream cone
We will become, become
Become the way and the wall
We will become, become
Become a disco ball
We will become, become
Become both now and then
We will become, become
Become again and again
We will become, become1Embed
