Half Moon Lyrics
Halfway home in the hilltop trees
And all our footprints in the snow
And the evenin' glow leavin'
Low night noise in the wintertime
I wake beside you on the floor
Countin' your breathin'
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap bap)

I can't see nothin' in this half moon (do-wap ba-dap ba, do wap, ba-dap ba)
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap bap)
Lay me down if I should lose you (do-wap ba-dap ba, do-wap ba-dap ba)
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap bap)
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap ba-da-da)

Halfway working on a worn-out house
And all our friends the ragged crows
And aching bones whinin'
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap bap)
Where are we when the twilight comes?
The dark of valley and the breeze
And the frozen leaves chimin'
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap bap)
'Cause I can't see nothin' in this half moon (do-wap ba-dap ba, do wap, ba-dap ba)
(Do-wap ba-dap ba-da-da, do-wap ba-da-da)
Lay me down if I should lose you (do-wap ba-dap ba, do-wap ba-dap ba)
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap bap)
Ooh
(Do-wap ba-dap bap, do-wap ba-dap ba-da-da)

Na na, na na, na na na
Na na, na na, na naEmbed
