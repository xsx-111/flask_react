Tree by the River LyricsMary Ann, do you remember
The tree by the river
When we were seventeen?
The dark canyon wall, the call and the answer
And the mare in the pasture
Pitch black and baring its teeth
I recall the sun in our faces
Stuck and leaning on graces
And being strangers to change
The radio and the bones we found frozen
And all the thorns and the roses
Beneath your windowpane
Now I'm asleep in a car
I mean the world to a potty-mouth girl
And a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds
Time isn't kind or unkind, you liked to say
But I wonder to who
And what it is you're saying today
Now I'm asleep in a car
I mean the world to a potty-mouth girl
And a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds
Time isn't kind or unkind, you liked to say
But I wonder to who
And what it is you're saying today
Mary Ann, do you remember
The tree by the river
When we were seventeen?
The dark canyon road; I was coy in the half moon
Happy just to be with you
And you were happy for meEmbed
