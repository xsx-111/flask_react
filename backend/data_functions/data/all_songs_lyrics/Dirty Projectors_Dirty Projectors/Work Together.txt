Work Together Lyrics
Complex plans and high ideals
But he treats people poorly
Is a ceaseless ambitiousness proxy for a void
He's ignoring

How good
We could have it if we work together
I feel love should be enough to get it easily done
Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar
We better ourselves
We could be so good if we work together

Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together

Crippling fear, assailing doubt
So she blinkers her vision
Is the life she's living not the one she dreamt of and envisioned?

How good
We could have it if we work together
I feel love should be enough to get it easily done
Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar
We better ourselves
I'm just here for the reciprocity to drop
Now we gon' see
Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together

How good
We could have it if we work together
I feel love should be enough to get it easily done
Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar and better ourselves
We could be so good if we work together

Work together, work together, work together, work together

You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competition
You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competition
You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competition
You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competitionEmbed
