I See You Lyrics
Heaven knows we've been to hell
Heavy, hard, and far -- how we fell
And we overwhelmed ourselves with fighting and yelling
Losing and finding dreams we've held
But now the spell is shattered
And now we are on earth
Forgiveness, reconciliation
Gratitude, you know me and I know you
(This) This is the way
(That) We will change
(Time) The ocean wave
(The pain) We will embrace
And what held us together
Is what tears us apart
So I'll let go of the tether
And you let go my heart (you let go my heart)
And it's gonna get better (you let go my heart)
And we could just be in kindness and peace now seeing that the love is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love that we made is the art
And now it is gettin' late
It's time to say the projection is fading away
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you
We won't be afraid to grow
We won't be afraid to grow
What we gave, we will always retain
I remember and I will remain
Proud and glad you were in my life
Forgiveness, reconciliation
Gratitude, you know me and I know you
Time passes away
There'll be other lovers
Forward and into a
Future imagined by neither of us
And what held us together
Is what tears us apart
So I'll let go of the tether
And you let go my heart (you let go my heart)
It's gonna get better (you let go my heart)
And we could just be in kindness and peace now seeing that the love is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love we made is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love we made is the art
And now it is getting late, it's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place
And now it is getting late, it's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place
And now it is getting late, it's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
I can see you1Embed
