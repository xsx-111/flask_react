Death Spiral Lyrics
Hold up, I was reborn the second before the
Plane became shards of glass
And ash when it crashed on arrival I woke up
Feeling like I'm sipping on some Ren√© Descartes
And you're Big Gulping the Bible
Your wings are broken so we fly in a spiral
All I have is my love of love
But now you wanna blow us up
You're so rock 'n' roll suicidal

Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom
Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom

(You spin me around)
In a wild death spiral
(We're hitting the ground)
In a fiery pile
(Whose fault I couldn't fly)
For the dials, only by the eye
(Now the ring is on fire)
Now it's final
Death spiral
What can we say? It's too late
We can't rewind to when we were both open and amazed
Like a wide-eyed child's smile
But it's the end, we're enemies, not friends
I don't know your state of mind, mine's good, bye

Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom
Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom

(You spin me around)
In a wild death spiral
(We're hitting the ground)
In a fiery pile
(Whose fault I couldn't fly)
For the dials, only by the eye
(Now the ring is on fire)
Now it's final
Death spiral

Our love is in a spiral (Death)
Our love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Our love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Spiral
(Death spiral)
Spiral
This isn't 'bout the time you chased me down the street
Face a rictus of misery and pain
You grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Or how I never learned to let you breathe
Condescended relentlessly
These threads need disentangling
So we have thread left to weave
Now our love is spiraling finally down
Now our helix is widening, coming unbound

(You spin me around)
In a wild death spiral
(We're hitting the ground)
In a fiery pile
(Whose fault I couldn't fly)
For the dials, only by the eye
(Now the ring is on fire)
Now it's final
Death spiral

Our love is in a spiral (Death)
Your love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Your love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Your love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Spiral
(Death spiral)
