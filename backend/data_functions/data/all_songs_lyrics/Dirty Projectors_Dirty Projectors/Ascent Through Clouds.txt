Ascent Through Clouds Lyrics
You're alone
Even though you're the same
As everyone
With your ketchup blood and your changeable flame
I go out for a walk
Back way through the fog to the moon with who I talk
I am so myself, I am no one else
You are one who helped me and took my help
I fly fluid and remade
Ascending through the clouds and joining the constellation
There was never more than now
Urge and urge again, newly took and new endowed
I am not contained
In my chest or in my brain
I am energy unconstrained
And even though I want to
I find it hard to stay
In constant contact
Sometimes I go away
Sometimes I go away
Solitude becomes alienation
And leads you to togetherness
Pleasure slides into pain
And into pleasure again
Forgiveness, need, apology
Redemption and surrendering
Strangers become friends
And then strangers again
I become you and you become me
Suddenly we are not who we were
Passion and intellect combine
In human love:
Highest common denomination
The feeling of weariness
The slide in between pain and bliss
The surrender to forgiveness
The happy acceptance of a kiss
Inevitability
Of sadness
The river washing us away
Washing the garbage too and trash
Love and gratitude for the
Opportunity
One more chance maybe
To see the sun raise

Even though I want to
I find it hard to stay in constant contact
I gotta go my own way1Embed
