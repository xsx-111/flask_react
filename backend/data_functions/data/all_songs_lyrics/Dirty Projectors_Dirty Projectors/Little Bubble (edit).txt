Little Bubble (edit) Lyrics
Morning
About the break of day
Here we lay, arm in arm
And cradled by the dawn

How did you sleep?
What did you dream of?
Can you still remember?
Was it the key of love?
The line of light that we both know?
Or a shadow descending from above?

We had our own little bubble
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while

Morning
There's no one else here
I'm alone and the cold October light hits like a black hole
Growling gray pit
Sentry of emptiness
It's not enough, whatever I dreamed of
Dreams are dumb and meaningless
Like the days they refract
Blurred and dull, empty and sad
I want to sleep with no dreams
I want to be dead

We had our own little bubble
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while

We didn't know one way or other
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while1Embed
