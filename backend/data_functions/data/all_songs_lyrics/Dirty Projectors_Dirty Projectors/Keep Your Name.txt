Keep Your Name Lyrics
I don't know why you abandoned me
You were my soul and my partner
What we imagined and what we became
We'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name, you keep your name

There is a place that we both know
It lives in our hearts, we built it together
Fear is a manacle but love is unchained
So we'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)

I wasn't there for you
I didn't pay attention
I didn't take you seriously
And I didn't listen
I don't think I ever loved you
That was some stupid shit
I wanted what you wanted but we never really felt the same
I kept my name 'cause we were just different
Your heart is saying clothing line
My body said Naomi Klein, No Logo
We shared kisses and visions
But like KISS' shithead Gene Simmons said:
A band is a brand and it licks that our vision is dissonant
You always hurried to grow up
I think I'll always just feel kinda the same
(But you say) What I want from art is truth, what you want is fame
Now we'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)5Embed
