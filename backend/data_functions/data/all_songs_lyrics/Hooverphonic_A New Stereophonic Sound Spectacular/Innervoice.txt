Innervoice LyricsFear is talking
In my head consulting
But my innervoice it says
That I'm falling, I'm falling
Could you be the pillow
That solves this problem
Sometimes I want to
Close my eyes and trust you
But my innervoice it says
That I'm falling, I'm falling
Could you be the rock
That solves this problemEmbed
