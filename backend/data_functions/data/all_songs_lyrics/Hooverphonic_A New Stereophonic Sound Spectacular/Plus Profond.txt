Plus Profond LyricsIt enters your veines
It enters your soul
It tries to obsess you
It looks for defaults
Try not to lose not to lose control
Try not to lose not to lose control
It tries to destroy you
It tries to tear you down
Am I lost lost in your backyard
Feel the pain
Yellow takes over
Yellow takes over
Yellow takes over
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
C'était toujours la même chose tu sais
J'étais dans une capsule
Et après quelques semaines
It enters your veines
It enters your soul
It tries to obsess you
It looks for defaults
Try not to lose not to lose control
Try not to lose not to lose control
It tries to destroy you
It tries to tear you down
Am I lost lost in your backyard
Feel the pain
Yellow takes over
Yellow takes over
Yellow takes over
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
C'était toujours la même chose tu sais
J'étais dans une capsule
Et après quelques semaines
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose control
Try not to lose, not to lose controlEmbed
