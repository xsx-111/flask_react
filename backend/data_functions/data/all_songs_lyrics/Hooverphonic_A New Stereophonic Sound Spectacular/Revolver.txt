Revolver Lyrics
Breaker one niner, eruhhh are there any smokies with ears on?
If you want a smokey good buddy, try channel 9.  You're not gonna find any on this one
I've got a 1033 here and I'm looking for a bear
What's your handle good buddy?
My handle is landcraft and I'm pushing an 18-wheeler
Landcraft there's no bears on this interstate.  Is there anyone hurt on that 1033?
Small groove thing invades my veins
Soul deserts and leaves this chain
Here she's coming to me
Revolver excludes this community
Small groove thing take off my chains
Hoover will soften my pain
Here she's coming to you
Floating on a white caribou
Small groove thing invades my veins
Soul deserts and leaves this chain
Small groove thing take off my chains
Hoover will soften my pain
Here she's coming to me
Revolver excludes this community
Here she's coming to you
Floating on a white caribouEmbed
