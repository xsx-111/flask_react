Wardrope LyricsTell me, baby
Tell where did you sleep last night
I heard noises in the cupboard
Were you trying to hide?
Cause you should know
How much I hate this
If you were I'll hit your hiding place
'til sunrise
And I'm falling in love
And I'm falling in love
Cause I need your loving
Every day and every night
And I'm falling in loveEmbed
