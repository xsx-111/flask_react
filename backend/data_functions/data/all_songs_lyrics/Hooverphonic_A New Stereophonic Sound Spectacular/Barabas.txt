Barabas LyricsSomething's changing
Growing in your mind
Can't do a thing 'bout it
Living a normal life
Barabas...
Can't remember
The first light
Must have been something enormous
I'd give anything to travel into time
Barabas...
Must have been something
Something enormous
Something enormous
Something enormous
I'd give anything to travel into timeEmbed
