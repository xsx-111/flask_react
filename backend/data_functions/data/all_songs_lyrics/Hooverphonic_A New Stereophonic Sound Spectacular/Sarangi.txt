Sarangi Lyrics
Suffocate your love
In a barrel full of doubt
Suffocate your love
North, east and south
Here I stand
In front of your imagination
Here I stand...
Hesitate, it's normal
You can't erase mistakes
Hesitate, it's normal
I can't keep awake
Here I stand
In front of your imagination
Here I stand...

Come closer
It's you I want to embrace
Come much closer
It's you I wanna debase
Here I stand
In front of your imagination
Here I stand...1Embed
