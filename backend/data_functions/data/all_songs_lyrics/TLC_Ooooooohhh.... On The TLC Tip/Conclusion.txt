Conclusion LyricsYo, this is Left Eye speakin' for TLC
And as we're closin' out here
You need to know that words cannot
Express to you how important safe-sex is to us
What some of us toy around with can easily
Become a deadly weapon
So take it as serious as it is
And remember that protection is the priority
And that is Ooooooohhh...on the TLC tipEmbed
