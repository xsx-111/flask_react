Bad By Myself Lyrics
Yo, get, get up on the TLC tip
Yo, get, get up on the TLC tip
Yo, get, get up on the TLC tip
Get, get up on the TLC tip
Hey now

You know how to pull my chain
And I believe every word you say
But now it's time for you to say goodbye
Baby, I'm leaving, so don't you cry
I tried to make things work
But now you're gone and your heart got hurt
Well you thought I belonged to you
But you were wrong, so now what ya gon' do?

Bad by myself
I can do bad, bad by my damn self
I can do bad by myself
Yo I done it before and I can do it again
Sure don't need you to be my man

Don't come bangin' on my door
Now you're gone, I don't want you anymore
There is no reason for you to come around
So won't ya step off so I don't have to break it down
I know what I'm doin' now
You think you're gonna change my mind somehow
You cheated me now I'm cheatin' back uhh
I run the show and you can kiss my (you know the rest)
Yo, Left Eye, what it is?

My soda crack, my ackra back ya know
"T" To da "B" to da "O" to Da "Z" and C-H-I wit da double L-I
L-E-F-T-E-Y-E-  E-I-E-I-O
(So yo how's ya livin'?)
I was givin' a nigga piece of time
But my time can't be wasted on B.S
Ahh so never mind

Bad by myself
I can do bad, bad by my damn self
I can do bad by myself
Yo, I done it before and I can do it again
Sure don't need you to be my man

Yo, I can do bad all by myself
I sho' don't need you or anyone else
I ain't gonna be a fool no more
Better take that mess on out the door
Tried to ruin my world
Tried to run my life
Must be crazy thinkin' I'm your wife
Yo, I done it before and I can do it again
Sho don't need you to be my man
Yep, yep (hey) get, get up on the TLC tip
Yep, yep (hey) get, get up on the TLC tip
Yep, yep (hey) get, get up on the TLC tip
Yep, yep (hey) get, get up on the TLC tip

Bad by myself (I-I can do bad!)
I can do bad, bad by my damn self (Ohhh oh I'm bad)
I can do bad by myself (Ooooh!)
Yo, I done it before and I can do it again
Sure don't need you to be my man

Yo if Peter Piper was to pick ya know a peck o' pickled peppers Gave his girly little Shirley half a peck
He coulda kept her but instead da pickle head
Was kicked out da waterbed
And greedy Petey now is needy cuz not one was all he left her
Oooooooh I'm sayin' it once and not twice
Givin' advice to be nice before you fall through the ice
Cuz lately you been slippin' up a lot
Not even givin' half o' what you got
But it's about that time you gave a quarter for a dime
Shovel up and start diggin' to see what you can find
Oh zero then take a trip to ya closet
And come forth wit that security deposit
So like it or leave it but until I receive it
I'll be leavin' my deposit elsewhere
You best believe it
And that way we can both take a trip
Oooh on the TLC tip
Now that's the oneEmbed
