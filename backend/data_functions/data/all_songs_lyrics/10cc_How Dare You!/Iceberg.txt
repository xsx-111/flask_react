Iceberg Lyrics
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride

Iceberg—I've fallen in love with an
Iceberg—it's only the tip of the
Iceberg—I've heard that it's cool
I got class, I got style
But once in a while out on the town
I must go
You'd better wash out your zone
Watch out you stone bone headed woman
Watch out you bone headed man

Iceberg—it's settlin' over Second Avenue
There's not a thing that you can
Iceberg—it's freezin' over Second Avenue
You'd better believe there's nothin'
You can do about it

I was an orphan and I couldn't help it
I've been in and out of trouble
Ever since they left me in a basket
On the freeway
It's me that's been doggin' your shadow
It's me that's been a-shadowin' your dog
You got me hung up lock and stock and barrel
I'll always be behind you in the fog
So you better not annoy me
Or I'll do something that I might regret
You'd better not annoy me or I'll do
Something that you won't forget in a hurry
And I might be back for some sloppy seconds

You've heard me heavy breathing on the telephone
My word they say that I'm belonging
In a home for crazy people
But you know I don't belong there

I was an orphan and I couldn't help it
I've been in and out of trouble
Ever since they left me
In a basket on the freeway

Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
Die die die die die die die die die die die die die die
Hooray hooray ha ha ha
Hooray ha ha ha
Get down get down get down get down
There's really not a lot that you can do
Lay down lay down lay down lay down
There's really not a lot that you can do
There's really not a lot that you can do
And I might be back for sloppy seconds
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride
Life is a roller coaster that we all rideEmbed
