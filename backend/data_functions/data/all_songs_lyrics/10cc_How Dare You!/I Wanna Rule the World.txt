I Wanna Rule the World Lyrics
I wanna be a boss
I wanna be a big boss
I wanna boss the world around
I wanna be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around
I wanna do it right
I wanna do it right away
I wanna do it right now
I wanna do it right away
I wanna do it now

Don't wanna be a dancer in the Bolshoi Ballet
Don't wanna work for Daddy
In Daddy's shop, OK
I get confused, so confused
I get a pain, I get a pain up here
In the Shirley Temples
Whatcha gonna do?
How ya gonna do it?
Whatcha gonna do?
How ya gonna do it?
Little by little (ooh ooh)
Little by little (bit by bit)
Sssh! Not too loud, don't tell everybody
Don't give away the game
Oooh, oooh
I ain't quite ready to reveal my campaign
This is not the time
My heroes are alive and well in a cave
I'm keepin' them on ice in suspended animation
Till the very right occasion comes along

To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along
To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along

A brave new world will rise from the ashes
And there upon a rock titanic, I'll cast a giant
Shadow on the face of the deep
And never again will they dare to call me
A freckled, spotty, specky, four-eyed
Weedy little creep!
No more tremblin' and quakin' in the gym
No more 'Come on, fellas, let's get him'
Whatcha gonna do?
How ya gonna do it?
Whatcha gonna do?
How ya gonna do it?
Little by little (ooh, ooh)
Little by little (bit by bit)
Little by little (ooh, ooh)
Little by little (bit by bit)
Bit by bit
Bit by bit

Everyone's going to be free
But they have to agree to be free
They'll have to agree to be less free than me
'Cause I rule the world you see
So wait for the army of kiddy-winkies
And terrible, tiny tots
In armoured school buses
Firing poisoned pea-shooters
And sinking their milk teeth into your thighs
Delapsus resurgam! When I fall I shall rise!
Wanna be a boss
I wanna be a big boss
I wanna boss the world around
I wanna be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around
I wanna be a boss
I wanna be a big boss
I wanna boss the world around
I wanna be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around
I wanna be a boss
I wanna be a big boss
I wanna boss the world around
I wanna be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around
I wanna be a boss
I wanna be a big boss
I wanna boss the world around
I wanna be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around
I wanna be a boss
I wanna be a big boss
I wanna boss the world around
I wanna be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world aroundEmbed
