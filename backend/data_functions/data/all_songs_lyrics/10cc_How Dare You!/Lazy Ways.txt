Lazy Ways Lyrics
Hazy days
With lazy ways
You got less done but more
Out of your days
How can you work yet avoid
Getting out of your lazy ways?

You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around
You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around

Hazy days
Lazy ways
We got less done but more
Out of our days
How can we ever recapture the feeling
Of lazy ways?

You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around
Where nobody cares and nobody tries
'Cause a daydream's resting on the back of your eyes
On the back of your eyes
Taking five
Bring love to me
With your body
Let me hold you
Endless, endlessly

You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around
Where nobody cares and nobody tries
'Cause a daydream's resting on the back of your eyes
On the back of your eyes
Ooh

Hazy days
With lazy ways
You get less done but more
Out of your days
Crazy days
Lazy waysEmbed
