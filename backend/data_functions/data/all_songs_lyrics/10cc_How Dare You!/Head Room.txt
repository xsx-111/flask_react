Head Room Lyrics
I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cause it's far too wet to woo
When Mummy and Daddy play
They tell me to go away
But by hanging around
I can learn all the rules
Now I got the technique
I'm away

Develop a taste for it
A time and a place for it
Although on the face of it, it's a crime
I've nibbled the cheese of it
The birds and the bees of it
Are weak at the knees
From making honey
Every time
I'm throwing my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the boys
Gimme girls
And it's time I was breaking away
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need some leg room
Just a little bitta leg room
I see myself, oh Lord
I see a mess

I'm making a meal of it
I'm breaking the seal of it
I'm getting the feel of what to do
It's got a good ring to it
I'm getting a thing for it
And if there's a sting in it
I'll have met my Waterloo
My Mummy and Daddy said
You're liable to wind up dead

Oo, they've been shooting me a line
Maybe it doesn't exist at all
Oo, I've been towing the line
Now I'm hook line and sinkered

I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
Cause it's far too wet to woo
I've thrown all my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the girls that you get
For a dollar a day
When you pull on their strings they say
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need a ball room
Up against the wall room
I need the rest, oh Lord
I need the rest
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
Take me to your bedroom
Show a little bitta leg room
I need the rest, oh Lord
I need the rest


Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need the rest, oh Lord
I need the rest
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need the rest, oh Lord
I need the rest
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need the rest, oh Lord
I need the restEmbed
