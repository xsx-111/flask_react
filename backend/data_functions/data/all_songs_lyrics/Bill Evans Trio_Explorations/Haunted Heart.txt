Haunted Heart LyricsIn the night, though we're apart
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance
Haunted heart, won't let me be
Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me
Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart, be still my haunted heart
Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart, be still my haunted heart
My heartEmbed
