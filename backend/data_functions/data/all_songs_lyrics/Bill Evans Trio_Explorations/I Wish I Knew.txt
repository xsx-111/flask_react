I Wish I Knew LyricsI wish I knew
Someone like you could love me
I wish I knew
You place no one above me
Did I mistake this
For a real romance?
I wish I knew
But only you can answer
If you don't care
Why let me hope and pray so?
Don't lead me on
If I'm a fool, just say so
Should I keep dreaming on
Or just forget you?
What shall I do?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew
Someone like you could love me
I wish I knew
You place no one above me
Did I mistake this
For a real romance?
I wish I knew
But only you can answer
If you don't care
Why let me hope and pray so?
Don't lead me on
If I'm a fool just say so
Should I keep dreaming on
Or just forget you?
What shall I do?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew
Someone like you could love me
I wish I knew
What shall I do?
I wish I knew
Someone like you could love meEmbed
