How Deep Is The Ocean LyricsHow much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?
How many times in a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel just to be where you are?
How far is the journey from here to a star?
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?
How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?
How many times in a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel just to be where you are?
How far is the journey from here to a star?
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?Embed
