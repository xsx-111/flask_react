Who Feels It (Knows It) Lyrics
Every man think his burden is the heaviest
But, ooh, yeah, come on, they know because they feel

Who feels it, knows it Lord (Who feels it, knows it Lord)
Who feels it, knows it Lord (Who feels it, knows it Lord)
Who feels it, knows it Lord (Who feels it, knows it Lord)

Don't sit by your window, gazing at the streets
Get up and move, get right on your feet
Just get up and move brothers (Brothers)
Get right in the groove sisters (Sisters)
Just get up and move Brothers (Brothers)
Get right in the groove sisters (Sisters)

You linger, you linger
Die, must die (Die must die)
So, don't point your fingers and
You'll get by (You'll get by)
No, no, no, don't lie
No, don't lie (Don't lie)
Don't cry
Every man think his burden is the heaviest
But, ooh, yeah, come on, they know because they feel

Who feels it, knows it Lord (Who feels it, knows it Lord)
Who feels it, knows it Lord (Who feels it, knows it Lord)
Who feels it, knows it Lord (Who feels it, knows it Lord)

I said: "I feel it, and I know it" (I feel it, and I know it)
I said: "I feel it, and I know it" (I feel it, and I know it)
Said: "I feel it, and I know it" (I feel it, and I know it)
I said: "I feel it, and I know it" (I feel it, and I know it)
If you feel it, then you know it (If you feel it, and you know it)
If you feel it, then you know it (If you feel it, and you know it)Embed
