Turnstyled, Junkpiled Lyrics
Well, I've been turnstyled, junkpiled, and railroaded too
I've been laid low, but don't you know I'm still in love with you
I've been took down many a road, if anybody says I ain't, they lie
But I ain't got no plans 'cept to be your man and love you till I die

Well, you got me under your spell
Won't you tell me all about your wonderful charms?
I got time to burn and a lot to learn
Mama, take me in your lovin' arms
Well, I know that probably you feel quite oddly
About the words you hear me say
But if you hold me tight, it's gonna be all right
Mama, chase my blues away

Well, I've been turnstyled and junkpiled, railroaded too
Laid low but don't you know
I'm still in love with you
I've been took down many a road
If anybody says I ain't they lie
But I ain't got no plans 'cept to be your man
Mama, love you till I die

Well, I've been turnstyled and junkpiled and railroaded too
Laid low, but don't you know I'm still in love with you
I've been took down many a road, if anybody says I ain't, they lie
But I ain't got no plans 'cept to be your man, Mama, love you till I die
Well, I've been turnstyled and junkpiled and railroaded too
I've been laid low, but don't you know I'm still in love with you
I've been took down many a road, if anybody says I ain't, they lie
But I ain't got no plans 'cept to be your man, I wanna love you till I dieEmbed
