Brand New Companion Lyrics
I got a brand new companion, man, I wanna do right this time
I got a brand new companion, man, I'm gonna do right this time
Man, she cools me with her breathing
Chases away those howling bottles of wine

She fits just like my guitar, man, she's near as tall as me
She fits just like my guitar, man, she's near as tall as me
She lives way out the D train
Ah, but she's Texas as can be

She got a homespun disposition just as gentle as you please
She got a homespun disposition, well, just as gentle as you please
She got arms just like two rattlesnakes
Legs like a willow in the breeze

I got a brand new companion, man, I wanna do right this time
I got a brand new companion, man, I'm gonna do right this time
I'm gonna to track her with my mind
And I'm gonna trace her with my bodyEmbed
