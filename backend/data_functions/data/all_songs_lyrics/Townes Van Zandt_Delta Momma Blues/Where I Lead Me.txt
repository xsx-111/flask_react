Where I Lead Me Lyrics
Where I lead me, I will travel
Where I need me, I will call me
Well I'm no fool, I'll be ready
God knows I will be
And in the meantime
Make a little money and buy a little mercy

Well, met this morning, now she loves me, says she loves me
It must be easy, look around you, all around you
But you see the motion, you're not moving
And you don't know how to hold on
Just keep it loose, don't get excited
You know it's gonna pass 'fore long

Well one is going, one is staying
One is silent, one is saying
Well, here's your coat, take care of yourself
I'm sorry you're leaving
And a little sad, you're all I had
Will you be returning?

Well, the boys upstairs, they're getting hungry
You can shout in the wind about how it will be
Or you can clench your fist and shake your head
Head to the country
Well, I got no doubt about it, friends
That's where they'll find me, ah
Well, ask the boys down in the gutter
Well, they won't lie cause you don't matter
Yeah the street's just fine, if you're good and blind
But it ain't where you belong
Roll down your sleeves
Pick up your money and carry yourself home
Roll down your sleeves
Pick up your money and carry yourself homeEmbed
