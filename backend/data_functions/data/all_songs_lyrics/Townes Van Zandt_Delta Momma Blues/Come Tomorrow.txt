Come Tomorrow Lyrics
Could it be the season's changing
The winds of winter rearranging
All the leaves like falling queens of sorrow
Could be the freezing rain a-falling
Could be sad September calling
Or maybe it's knowing she'll be gone come tomorrow

Well, it's strange how many tortured mornings
Fell upon us with no warning
Looking for a smile to beg or borrow
It's over now, there's no returning
A thousand bridges sadly burning
And light the way I'll have to walk alone come tomorrow

Well, I guess that no amount of lying
To myself will stop the crying
I guess I have to take things like they are
The facts are plain to see, it's only
That I ain't used to being lonely
Like I'm going to be without you come tomorrow
Come tomorrowEmbed
