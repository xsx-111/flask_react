Rake Lyrics
Well I used to wake and run with the moon
I lived like a rake and a young man
I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds
My laughter, the Devil would frighten
The sun, she would come and beat me back down
But every cruel day had its nightfall
I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars
Full of fire and forgetful

My body was sharp, my dark hair clean
And outrage my joyful companion
And whispering women, how sweet did they seem
Kneeling for me to command them
And time was like water, but I was the sea
I wouldn't have noticed it passing
Except for the turning of night into day
And the turning of day into cursing

Well, you look at me now, don't think I don't know
What all your eyes are a-saying
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies
They're just tricks that his brain's been a-playing?
A lover of women, he can't hardly stand
He trembles, he's bent, and he's broken
I've fallen, it's true, but I say to you
Hold your tongues until after I've spoken

I was taking my pride in the pleasures I'd known
I laughed and said I'll be forgiven
But my laughter turned round, eyes blazing, and said
"Friend, we're holding a wedding"
I buried my face, but it spoke once again
The night to the day we're a-binding
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blinding
Now the dark air is like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blindingEmbed
