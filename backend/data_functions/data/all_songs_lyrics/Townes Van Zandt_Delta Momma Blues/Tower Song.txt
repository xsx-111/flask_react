Tower Song Lyrics
So close and yet so far away
And all the things I'd hoped to say
Will have to go unsaid today
Perhaps until tomorrow
Your fears have built a wall between
Our lives and all that lovin' means
Will have to go unfelt, it seems
And that leaves only sorrow

You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall someday?

Close your eyes and speak to me
Of faith and love and destiny
As distant as eternity
And truth and understanding
The wind blows cold outside your door
It whispers words I've tried before
But you don't hear me anymore
Your pride's just too demanding
You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall someday?

The end is coming soon, it's plain
A warm bed just ain't worth the pain
And I will go and you'll remain
With the bitterness we tasted
A mother's breast, a newborn child
A poet's tears and a drunken smile
Can't help thinkin' all the while
Their meaning won't be wasted

You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall someday?3Embed
