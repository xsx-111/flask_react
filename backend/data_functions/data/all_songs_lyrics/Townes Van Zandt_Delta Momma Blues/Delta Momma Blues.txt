Delta Momma Blues Lyrics
Come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
And if you stay, well you'll see that I can bring you lots of joy
I can turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, if you're blue, don't cry, just wander right downtown
You can find your delta momma waiting there
Well, I thought you knew that I would never let you down
I can ease your mind and take away your cares

Well, come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
And if you stay, well you'll see that I can bring you lots of joy
I can turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, if the grass goes brown, don't you hang your head too low
Well, there ain't no need for you to sit and pine
If you'll just ask around, well I'm sure someone will know
Just exactly what it takes to get you back to feeling fine

If you don't know by now what I've been trying so hard to say
Well, my delta boy, I'm afraid you're up too tight
But you take it slow and somehow you'll come meandering out my way
And I'll take you in my arms and make it right
Aw, come away with me, my little delta boy
I want to be your delta momma for a while
And if you stay, well you'll see that I can bring you lots of joy
I'll take you in my arms and make it rightEmbed
