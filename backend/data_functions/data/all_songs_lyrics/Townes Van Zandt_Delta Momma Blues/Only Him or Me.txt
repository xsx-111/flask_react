Only Him or Me Lyrics
Don't go saying I'm leaving you
I'm thinking I never got close enough to stay
Time runs in and then runs out
Starts again and it's always been that way
You're gonna drown tomorrow
If you cry too many tears for yesterday
Tomorrow's half of all you've got
Treat him good 'cause when I'm gone, he'll stay

I won't be forgetting you
And you won't be forgetting me, I know
With memory comes a summer cloud
Rains her sweetness down to me below
Well, I'll see you like you look right now
Maybe wonder why I had to go
But Heaven is the way she is
And rain falls and rivers flow

So here's to feeling good
And here's to feeling bad
Here's to being thankful
Sorry for the pleasures that we had
And autumn days and window panes
God forgive us if you feel deceived
The clock don't know you like I do
It's only him or me you got to believeEmbed
