Crimson Tide LyricsI was like the laziest river
A vulture predisposed to eating off floors
No wait, I take that back
I was more like an ocean
Stuck inside hospital corridors
My condition in general
Despite what they say, improves
So I could care less on a night like this
I'm on the lookout for anything that moves
Crimson tide
I know when to hold 'em
And I know when to leave
I know where to go
And I know how to breathe
I know how you blow bubbles
You can look at the world
'Til you don't know what you done
You can follow a salary to the bottom of the ocean
Is that yours? Throw it in the pot
I thought I was smart, I'm not
I thought I was sick and dying
Chicken-shit singers paying their dues
A circus mongrel sniffing for clues
You watch the blonde make mincemeat of the brunette
An actress pays her debt
To Satan again and again
I say it, I don't know, just 'cause
A child coos sweet nothings to a box of fuzz
He's not a child, he's twenty-five
He's never felt so alive, crimson tide
One more dead rich runaway, who gives a shit?
Must be nice, must be the rain
When lightning strikes twice
The funeral goes completely insane
The funeral's insane
The funeral's insane
The funeral's insane
Vicious stampede, a vile promenade
But in china teacups, two fools find love
Back at Hotel ParalÂ·lel, hysteria, I can feel it
She says "Get into the zone," the zone is brimstone and wire
You open your mouth to watch your teeth shudder
At the mirror, at the clutter
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
Crimson tide
