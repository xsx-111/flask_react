Foolssong Lyrics
And with what shall I fix?
The hole in the bucket, dear Liza
Where the honeyed diamonds of the light leaving your eyes were?

Shall I cancel the play? What, three showings a day?
It was shitty, we couldn’t stay longer
Beneath the bridge we kissed
I was busy eating mama's wrist before that

I walked into the room and was made sick by the room
I painted a painting known as "A Girl And Her Broom"
Its figures all lit up
Nagasaki, At Night, At War With The Devil


It ain’t easy being a baby like you
It ain’t easy being a baby like me
It ain’t easy being a baby like you
It ain’t easy being a baby like me

Duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
Duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
Duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
Duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duhEmbed
