The Television Music Supervisor LyricsThe Television Music Supervisor said
"I can't believe what I've done
I can't believe that I said what I said"
The Television Music Supervisor said
"I can't believe what I've done
I can't believe that I said what I said"
Clickety click click
The music makes a musical sound
Measured in echoes
By famous novelist brothers
Shithead number one and shithead number two
The Television Music Supervisor said
"I can't believe what I've done
I can't believe
I can't believe
I can't believe"Embed
