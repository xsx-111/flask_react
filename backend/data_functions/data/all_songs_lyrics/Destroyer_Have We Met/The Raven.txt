The Raven LyricsJust look at the world around you
Actually, no, don't look
Just look at the world around you
Actually, no, don't look
But if you only knew how
I cry foul every hour of every day
Well, I hope you've enjoyed your stay
Here in the City of the Dying Embers
The petite Terror Train that thought that it could
We throw the game and oh how it feels so good
To be drunk on the field again
To be drunk on the field
Again
Come out, come out, wherever you are
But you don't, the dead don't come out
The dead twist and shout in an invisible world
The Grand Ole Opry of Death is breathless
Breathless
Breathless
Breathless
Breathless
What do you do with it?
For whom have you been saving?
What do you do with it?
For whom have you been saving?
Oh yes, you've been good to me in your way
That's what I'll write about when I write about The Raven
That's what I'll write about when I write about The Raven
That's what I'll write about when I write about The Raven
That's what I'll write about when I write about The Raven
That's what I'll write about when I write about The RavenEmbed
