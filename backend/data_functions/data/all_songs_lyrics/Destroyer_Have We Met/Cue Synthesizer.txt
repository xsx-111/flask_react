Cue Synthesizer Lyrics
Did you realize it was hollow?
Like everything that's come before, you are gone
The idiot's dissonant roar
That exquisite gong struck dumb

Cue synthesizer
Cue guitar
Bring in the drums
Cue fake drum

The idea of the world is no good
The terrain is no good
The sea's blasted poem
A twinkle in the guitar player's eye

Cue synthesizer
Cue guitar
Cue synthesizer
Wherever you are

Open door policy and not a goddamn thing at night
Death threat scrawled in invisible ink's alright
Been to America, been to Europe, it's the same shit
Went to America, went to Europe, it's all the same shit
I look around the room, I see a room of pit ponies
Drowning forever in a sea of love
I look around the room, we are a room of pit ponies
Drowning forever in a sea of love
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Oh, oh, cue synthesizer
Oh, oh, cue synthesizer
Oh, oh, cue synthesizer
