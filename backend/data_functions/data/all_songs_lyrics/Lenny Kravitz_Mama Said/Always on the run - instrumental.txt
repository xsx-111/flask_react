Always on the run - instrumental LyricsMy Mama said
That your life is a gift
And my Mama said
"There's much weight you will lift"
And my Mama said
"Leave those bad boys alone"
And my Mama said
"Be home before the dawn"
And my Mama said
"You can be rich or poor"
But my Mama said
"You can be big or small"
But I'm always on the run
(Always on the run)
But I'm always on the run
My Mama said
"That it's good to be fruitful"
But my Mama said
"Don't take more than a mouthful"
And my Mama said
"That it's good to be natural"
And my Mama said
"That it's good to be factual"
But I'm always on the run
(Always on the run)
But I'm always on the run, oh
Slash
Yea
And my Mama said
"Baby don't ride that crazy horse"
And my Mama said
"You must push with much force"
And my Mama said
"Go get all that you're after"
And my Mama said
"That loves all that matters"
But I'm always on the run
(But I'm always on the run)
But I'm always on the run
(Oh, run)
But I'm always on the run
(Always on the run)
But I'm always on the run
Aa, what's up Mama?
You mind
Aha, right now?
Hold down
YeaEmbed
