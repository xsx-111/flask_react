What Goes Around Comes Around Lyrics
My pockets were full now my money's gone
My friends come around and now they're gone
Things come and they come and then they go
And where they go nobody knows

It's going to come around
What goes around comes around
It's going to come around
What goes around comes around

My cup over runneth with fullness and grace
Yet people push bullshit in my face
The future can't hold what your money can't buy
My brother keep striving your child relies


This world keeps on spinning does the future know ?
We're destined to screw ourselves one blow
We've ruined what's pure down from nature below
You'd better look back it'll all be gone

So children please listen this world is yours
This message is too deep to ignore
Your forefathers said but they did not do
The things that would show that they cared for you


Comes around comes around comes around 
Comes around yeah

Going to take you higher
I'm going to take you higher 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm going to take you higher
Going to take higher
Yeah yeah yeah
Going to take you higher higher
Higher higher higher higher
Going to take you higher
Going to take you higher, yeah
Going to take you higher
Higher high higherEmbed
