More Than Anything in This World (live in Rotterdam) LyricsMore than anything in this world
I just want you to be my woman
More than anything in this world
I wanna be your man, hey
I'd walk through fire
Stand in the rain
I'll go to hell and back
On a plane
I'd scale the mountains
Swim the seas
I beg for mercy
Down on my knees
More than anything in this world
I just want you to be my woman
More than anything in this world
I wanna be your man, hey
I caused you sorrow
I've caused you pain
But love is all we
Will have to gain
I searched the whole world, oh I
And I want you to be my baby, hey
More than anything in this world
I just want you to be my woman
More than anything in this world
I wanna be your man, hey
More than anything in this world
I just want you to be my woman
More than anything in this world
I wanna be your man, hey
More than anything in the world
More than anything in the world
I want you, hey hey
More than anything in this world
I wanna be your man, ho
More than anything in this world
I wanna be your man, yeah
Anything, anything
Anything, anything
Hey, heyEmbed
