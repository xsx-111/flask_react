What The...Are We Saying? (Live in Japan) Lyrics
Will we ever understand?
Or is the fate of man at hand?
Will we live or shall we die?
How will we ever know if we never try?

The government's the devil's hands
It's a lie and it's a scam
They wind us up, put us down and watch us go
And if you close your eyes
There's a big surprise

What the fuck are we saying?
Do we feel what we dream about?
We've got to keep on praying
And one day we'll see the light

I've been lost in the name of love
And we kill our brothers daily in the name of god
We'd better chill before we take on some tribulation
And if we realized
Then we'd make a little love now sing (Sing it)
What the fuck are we saying?
Do we believe what we read about?
We've got to keep on praying
And one day we'll see the light
And one day we'll see the light
And one day we'll see the light
And one day we'll see the light, oh


Everybody
What the fuck are we saying?
Do we feel what we dream about?
We've got to keep on praying
And one day we'll see the light
And one day we'll see the light
And one day we'll see the light
And one day we'll see the light


Yeah, yeah
What the fuck
Are we saying?
Welcome
YeahEmbed
