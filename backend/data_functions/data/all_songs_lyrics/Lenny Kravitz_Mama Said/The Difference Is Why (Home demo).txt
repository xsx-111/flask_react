The Difference Is Why (Home demo) LyricsI'm just a human
I never said I was God
And each day I wonder
Where you are, uh
How could our lives once be so together?
Now we're apart
I know we can make it
But where do we start?
Sometimes the scales, they get unbalanced
Don't you know the reason why?
The difference is why
The difference is why
You say you can't trust me
Have you tried?
You say you don't love me
That's a lie, ah
There are so many, so many rainbows
That we were to climb
But baby, baby
Why can't we survive?
We've got to get our heads untangled
And free our state of mind
The difference is why, hey
Ooh, the difference is why
Sometimes the scales get unbalanced
Don't you know the reason why?
The difference is why, yeah
The difference is why
Does this have to be goodbye?Embed
