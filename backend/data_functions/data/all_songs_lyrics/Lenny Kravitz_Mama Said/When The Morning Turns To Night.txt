When The Morning Turns To Night Lyrics
Little girl with heroin so blue
You've got to find the future in you
Your scepters and needles will put you away
Forever and a day

Your future will haunt you before you get there
Imagine a planet with no air
All mute no light no sun only night
As far away as neverland
As the sky comes tumbling down to the head
And the valleys are all filled up with dirt
As many people as there are sands in the sea
Will die the morning after
Yeah
So little girl with heroin so blue
I guess our future is all up to you
Through the battle sequence you must fight
'Til the morning turns to night
So imagine our world with no air
Just follow the son, He'll take you where
The night and the seas are all full of light
Until the morning turns to night
Until the morning, yeah, turns to nightEmbed
