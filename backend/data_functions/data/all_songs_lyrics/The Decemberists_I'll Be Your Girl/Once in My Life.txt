Once in My Life LyricsOh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?
Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?
I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
My life
My life
Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?
I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
My life
All my life
All my life
I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
My life
Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
All my life
All my life
Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
All my life
All my life
Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
All my life
All my life
Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
I could wait for hours
I could wait and never fall down
Never fall down
Never fall down
Lay us down
Beside the river
Face down
Beside the riverEmbed
