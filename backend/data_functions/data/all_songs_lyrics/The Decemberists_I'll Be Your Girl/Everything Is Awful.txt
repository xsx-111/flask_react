Everything Is Awful Lyrics
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Oh everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Everything is awful, everything is...

What's that crashing sound
That follows us around?
That's the sound of all things good breaking
Put your fears to rest
You know it's for the best
As a choir of angels sings:

Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Oh everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Everything is awful, everything is...

I know you've worked so hard
To hoist your own petard
Must be so nice; the point caught in your side
Lay down your heavy head
It's safer hid in bed
And let those voices ring:

Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Oh everything, everything, everything, everything, every little thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Everything is awful, everything is...
La la la la la
La la la la awful
Everything is...
La la la la la
La la la la awful
Would you kindly keep it down?
La la la la la
La la la la awful
Just trying to get some sleep
La la la la la
La la la la awful
Everything is...Embed
