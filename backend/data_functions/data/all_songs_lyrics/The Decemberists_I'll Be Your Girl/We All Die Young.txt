We All Die Young Lyrics
It was late one night, I was counting out my stitches
Laying by the side of the road
I was a long time gone, slipping off my britches
Feeling like it's time to go home
Yeah, feeling like it's time to go home
And in this dream, Bill Tecumseh Sherman
Glowered at the foot of my bed
He was long and lean, he spoke in perfect German
And I recorded all that he said
Yeah, I recorded all that he said

And he said:
"We all die young
We all die young
We all die young
We all die young"

When I woke next day, layered in the lashings
Feeling for the hole in my head
I was thinking 'bout my dad, thinking 'bout the nashings
Of all the bitter things that he said
Yeah, all the withering things that he had said
And he said:
"We all die young
We all die young
We all die young
We all die young"
Son, he said:
"We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die, we all die young!
We all die young"

When he came to pass it everything had ended
The world was just a grubby balloon
And I spoke up, said "sorry if I've offended"
This voice came from the back of the room
Oh, screaming from the back of the room
It said:
"We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die, we all die young!
We all die young"
One more time!
"We all die young
Bill Tecumseh Sherman
We all die young!
We all die young
Sorry if I've offended
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die, we all die young!
We all die young"
We all die young!
We all die young!
We all die, we all die young!
We all die young!
We all die young!
We all die, we all die young!Embed
