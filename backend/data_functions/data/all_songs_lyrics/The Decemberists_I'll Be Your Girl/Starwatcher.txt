Starwatcher LyricsStarwatcher, starwatcher in the night
Starwatcher, starwatcher bend the light
There's a rider on the road
There's calamity a-waiting to unfold
There is poison in the well
There's the augur of a distant ringing bell
It says: hold, hold, hold your ground
Skywatcher, skywatcher rules the day
Skywatcher, skywatcher cruel and fey
There are figures on the shore
At the laundromat, they're whispering of war
There's a lady on the stair
All a-shambling with thistles in her hair
Singing: hold, hold, hold your ground
Hold, hold, hold your ground
Starwatcher, starwatcher in the nightEmbed
