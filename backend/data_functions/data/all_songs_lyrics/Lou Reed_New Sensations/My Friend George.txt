My Friend George LyricsRead in the paper 'bout a man killed with a sword
And that made my think of my friend George
People said the man was five foot six
Sounds like George with his killing stick
Hey bro, what's the word
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
You talkin' 'bout my friend George
I knew George since he's eight
I always thought that he was great
And anything that George would do
You know that I would do it too
George liked music and George liked to fight
He worked out in a downtown gym every night
I'd spar with him when work was done
We split lips but it was all in fun
Hey bro, what's the word
You talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
Next thing I hear George's got this stick
He's using it for more than kicks
I seen him down at Smalley's bar
He was wired up, I tried to calm him down
Avenge yourself he says to me
Avenge yourself for humanity
Avenge yourself for the weak and the poor
Stick it to these guys right through their heads
Well, the fight is my music, the stick is my sword
And you know that I love you, so please don't say a word
Can't you hear the music playing, the anthem, it's my call
And the last I seen of George was him
Running through the door, I says -
Hey bro, what's the word
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
You talkin' 'bout my friend George
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
You talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
What me saying 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
Hear you talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
I hear talkin' 'bout my friend GeorgeEmbed
