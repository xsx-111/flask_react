Turn to Me LyricsIf you gave up major vices
You're between a hard place and a wall
And your car breaks down in traffic
On the street
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
You can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
Baby, turn to me
If your father is free basing
And your mother turning tricks
That's still no reason
You should have a rip
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
You can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
Turn to me
When your teeth are ground down to the bone
And there's nothing between your legs
And some friend died of something
That you can't pronounce, ah
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
Hey baby, you can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
Turn to me
You can't pay your rent, your boss is an idiot
And your apartment has no heat
And your wife says, "Maybe
It's time to have a child"
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
And you can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
Turn to me
When it's all too much you turn the TV set on
And light a cigarette
And then a public service announcement
Comes creeping on
And you see a lung corroding
Or a fatal heart attack
Turn to me, turn to me
Baby, turn to me, I'm just a phone call away
Turn to me, turn to me
Hey, turn to me, one tenth of a dollar
Turn to me, baby
Turn to me
(Turn to me, turn to me
Turn to me)
(Turn to me, turn to me
Turn to me)Embed
