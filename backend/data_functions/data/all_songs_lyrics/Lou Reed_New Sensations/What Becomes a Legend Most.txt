What Becomes a Legend Most LyricsWhat becomes a legend most
When she's alone in a hotel lobby
What becomes a legend most
Some bad champagne and some foreign bottled beer
What becomes a legend most
When the musicians have come and then leave her
What becomes a legend most
Besides being a legendary star
What becomes a legend most
Lying in bed cold and regal
What becomes a legend most
Lying in bed watching a talk show on TV
What becomes a legend most
Fifty days in fifty cities
And everyone says she looks pretty
At least as pretty as a legend should
Fifty days can wear you down
Fifty cities flying by
A different man in each different hotel
And if you're not careful, word can get around
What becomes a legend most
Not a bed, that is half empty
Not a heart, that is left empty
That's not pretty, not pretty at all
What becomes a legend most
When she's lying in her hotel room
What becomes a legend most
Well baby, tonight it's you (tonight it's you)
Baby, tonight it's you
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) maybe tomorrow
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)Embed
