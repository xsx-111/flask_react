Out of My Mind Lyrics
Judging by the look on the organ-grinder
He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit
It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder
He's waiting for the day when he gets me

But I don't need no alibi - I'm a puppet on a string
I just need this stage to be seen
We all need a pantomime to remind us what is real
Hold my eye and know what it means

(CAUSE)
I'm out of my mind (8x)

Judging by the look on the organ-grinder
He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit
It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder
He's waiting for the day when he gets me

But I won't be your concubine - I'm a puppet not a whore
I just need this stage to be seen
Will you be a friend of mine to remind me what is real?
Hold my heart and see that it bleeds
I'm out of my mind (12x)Embed
