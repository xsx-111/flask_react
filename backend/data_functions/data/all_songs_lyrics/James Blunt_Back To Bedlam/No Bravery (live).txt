No Bravery (live) LyricsThere are children standing here
Arms outstretched into the sky
Tears drying on their face
He has been here
Brothers lie in shallow graves
Fathers lost without a trace
A nation blind to their disgrace
Since he has been here
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
Only sadness
Houses burnt beyond repair
The smell of death is in the air
A woman weeping in despair says
He has been here
Tracer lighting up the sky
It's another family's turn to die
A child afraid to even cry out says
He has been here
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
There are children standing here
Arms outstretched into the sky
But no one asks the question why
He has been here
Old men kneel to accept their fate
Wives and daughters cut and raped
A generation drenched in hate says
He has been here
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
Only sadnessEmbed
