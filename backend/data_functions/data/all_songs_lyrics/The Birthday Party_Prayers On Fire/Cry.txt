Cry Lyrics
When ya walk outta here
When ya walk out
I gotta fill up that space
Or fill up that no-space
I'll fill it up with tears
I'll fill it up with tears
I'll fill it up with tears
I'll fill it up with tears and

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can
Cry, cry, cry, cry

When ya slam that door
When that door slams
I gotta fill up that space
An' I'll pack my suitcase
I'll fill it up with no-clothes
Fill it up with no-clothes
Fill it up with no-clothes
Fill it up with no-clothes
I'll fill it up with tears
I'll pack it up with tears
I'll fill it up with tears
I'll pack it up with tears and
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can
Cry, cry, cry, cry

When ya slam that door
When that door slams
I'll dig my-self a hole
And I'll fill up that space
I'll fill it up with no-flesh
An' I'll fill it up with flesh
I'll fill it up with no-flesh
An' I'll fill it up with flesh
I'll fill it up with tears
I'll pack it up with tears
I'll fill it up with tears
I'll fill it up with tears and

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can swim
Where no fish can
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Fish, swim, cry, fish, cry, cry, cryEmbed
