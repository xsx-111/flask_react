Blundertown LyricsBlundertown is drowned in no brainstorm
Smothered in mud at the foot of the river
The color vague is slapped around stupid
Blood dries to a very dull color
I'm drowning and there is no relief from
It's only 12,000 miles to heaven
But the car is broken and we're all well-spoken
I've met three people but I don't think they like me
And we all talk about the state of the weather
I'm drowning and there is no relief from
And everything I say are my own thoughts
Don't listen to my very dull brother
I'm drowning and there is no relief fromEmbed
