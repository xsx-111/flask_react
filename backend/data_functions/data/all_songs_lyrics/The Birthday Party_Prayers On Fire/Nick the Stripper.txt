Nick The Stripper
A-hideous to the eye
A-hideous to the eye
Well he's a fat little insect
A fat little insect
A fat little insect
A fat little insect
And oh, here we go again

Nick The Stripper
A-dances on all fours
A-dances on all fours
He's in his birthday suit
He's in his birthday suit
He's in his birthday suit
He's in his birthday suit
And oh, a-here we go again
Nick The Stripper
A-hideous to the eye
A-hideous to the eye
Well he's a fat little insect
A fat little insect
A fat little insect
A fat little insect
And oh, here we go again
Well he's a fat little insect
A fat little insect
A fat little insect
A fat little insect
He's in his birthday suit
He's in his birthday suit
He's in his birthday suit
He's in his birthday suit
