King Ink LyricsKing Ink strolls into town
He sniffs around
King Ink kicks off his stink-boot
Sand and soot and dust and dirt and
He's much bigger than you think

King Ink
Well, king Ink
A King Ink
A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a King Ink
A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a get up, a get up, get up, get up
Up, up, up, up, up up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up

A bug crawls up the wall
King Ink feels like a bug
And he hates his rotten shell
He says: "cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha"

A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a King Ink
A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a get up, a get up, a get up, a get up
What's in that room?
What's in that house?
What's in that room?
What's in that house?
Say something, express thyself, say something, express yourself
Express, say something loudly, ah
A what's in that room?
What's in that house?
Sand and soot and dust and dirt and sand and soot and dust and dirt
And d-d-d-d-d-dirt
Di-di-di-di-di-di-di, di-di-di-di-di-dirt
King Ink feels like a bug
Swimming in a soup-bowl
He says "Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, Fats Domino on the radio
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, Fats Domino on the radioEmbed
