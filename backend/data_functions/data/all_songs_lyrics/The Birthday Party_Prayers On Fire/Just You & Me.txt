Just You & Me LyricsFirst: I tried to kill it with a hammer
Thought that I could lose
The head
Sure! we've eaten off the silver
(when even food was against us)
And then I tried to kill it in the bed
Second: I gagged it with a pillow
But awoke the nuns inside
My head
They pounded their goddy-goddy fists
(from the inside - so from the outside)
I got good: I stuck it. dead
Thirdly: I put my lips upon it
And blew a frost across
Its flat
I wrote upon it's outside-surface
Tonight we're on the outside-surface
Just you and me girl: you and me and the fat2Embed
