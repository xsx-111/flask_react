A Dead Song LyricsThis is true
Oh, this is true, it's true
Mister forever said nothing said
I can sing
Hit it
And make it a dead one
With words like, with words like
Blood and soldier and mother
Ok, ok
I want to, I wanna sleep before the end
Which is most impolite
Hit it
Make it a dead one
If nothing crops up
I'll give you a ring
You can sing the end
Ok, ok
Then I could get
All the little animals out of my room
Hit it
With a broom, with a broom!
Ok, ok, ok, ok
Put them in a big white sack
No visitors came
Hit it
With words like
Like hit it
Like hit it
Oh yeah
Yeah hit it, yeah hit it like, like, like hit it
Thou thou shalt not um like
Thou shalt not
This is the end
This, this really is the living end
This really is the living end
Like really, this is the end and it's still livingEmbed
