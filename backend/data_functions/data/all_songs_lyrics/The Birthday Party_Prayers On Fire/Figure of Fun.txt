Figure of Fun Lyrics
Wow!

I am a figure of fun
Obsessive, dead-pan and moribund
Green at the gills, seasick
I am a figure of fun

Innocent, I baked in the sun
I have no luck in love
I have no luck in anything
I am a figure of fun

And I'm impressed by everyone
But I impress no-one
It's irritating
I am a figure of fun
Rock

I am a figure of fun
I have money
But money isn't everything to a figure of
Oh, fun, fun, fun
I love you baby, I love you
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, funEmbed
