Zoo Music Girl Lyrics
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl

Our life together is a hollow tooth
Spit out the shells, spit out the shells
You know exactly what we're talking about
Don't drag your orchestra into this thing
Just rattle your sticks, rattle your sticks

Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl

My body is a monster driven insane
My heart is a fish toasted in flame

Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl

The sound is beautiful, it's perfect
I call out her name in the night
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
I call her by her family name
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Oh God, please let me die beneath her fists
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl

Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girlEmbed
