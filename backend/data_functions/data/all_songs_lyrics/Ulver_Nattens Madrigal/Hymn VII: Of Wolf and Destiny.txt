Hymn VII: Of Wolf and Destiny LyricsNu har han ey meer sin Drackt
Saa rød som Viin & Blod
Fro Viin & Blod vaer paa hans Haand
Ved Sængen der han stood
Hos Liiget aff sin elskede
Dend Stund man fandt de to
No more he wore his constume
Red as bloode & wine
For wine & bloode was on his hands
As he stoode by her bed and corpse
When the two of them were foundEmbed
