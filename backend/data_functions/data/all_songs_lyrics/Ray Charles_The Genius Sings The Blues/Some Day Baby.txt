Some Day Baby Lyrics
Oh Lordy Lord, oh Lordy Lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part

But some day baby
I am not going to worry my life anymore

So may mornings since you been gone
I been worrying and grieving my life alone


So many days since you went away
I had to worry both night and day

But some day baby
I am not going to worry my life anymore
No boy, I am not going worry my life no more

You on my mind every place I go
How much I love you nobody knows
But some day baby
I am not going to worry my life anymore

So that's my story, that is all I have to say to you
Goodbye baby and I don't care what you do
