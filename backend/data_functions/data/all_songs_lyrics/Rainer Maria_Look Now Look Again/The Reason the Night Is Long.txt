The Reason the Night Is Long LyricsOh the reason the night is long
Is very simple
Oh i miss you when i'm at work
Oh and i miss you when we fight, and you leave
Honey, i confess, i stole your heart
And honey, i confess that it was criminal
But i've been captured, i'm paralyzed
And i've been disarmed by your charm
Oh the reason the night is long is very simple
I imagine, tonight, that we can get along
That nothing i can do with you is wrong, tonight
But if i'm careful at sunset, if i'm mindful at dawn
(clouded minds up north could
Sometimes produce rain and lightning. )
If it's ok to touch you
It's alright to think "electricity"
Oh the reason the night is long is very simple
Maybe it hasn't been so long
Maybe this dim time is just twilightEmbed
