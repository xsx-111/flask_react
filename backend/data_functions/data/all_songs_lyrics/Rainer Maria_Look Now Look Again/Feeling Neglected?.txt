Feeling Neglected? LyricsHalfway home
And ready to turn around
But i can't turn around my dream
(five days a week
I go to sleep at dawn
And feel alone although you're warm. )
Halfway home
And ready to drag it out
Because this slowing down
Suits me
(oh what way did i take to come to this place?
Oh what way did i take to get here?)
Halfway home
And ready to turn around
But i can't turn around my dreams
(five days a week
I drive you home from work
And see the way
Your face is marked with fatigue
Fatigue suits me.)
I can't turn around and this slowing down suits me
And i'm feeling neglected anyway
It's the reason i'm leaving youEmbed
