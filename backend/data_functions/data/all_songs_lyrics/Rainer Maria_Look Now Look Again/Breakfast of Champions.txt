Breakfast of Champions Lyrics
Wake me up this morning
And take me down to the corner
Place before the shade
Where we eat and that's where we talk
Retreats behind the wall and
And that's when i decide to stay here
Wake me up this morning
And take me down to the corner
Place before the shade
Where we eat and that's where we talk
Retreats behind the wall and
And that's when i decide to stay here

Cup of tea, blackberry
Golden Gate Bridge
Everything's alright now
Don't let me sleep

It was warm and pleasant (It was so)
And over in an instant (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I feel like i dreamt it (But I'm not there now)
But I'm not there now
Easier to drive
Leave the oven on
Burn the house down

Cup of tea, blackberry
Golden Gate Bridge
Everything's alright now
Don't let me sleep
Cup of tea, blackberry
Golden Gate Bridge
Everything's alright now
Don't let me sleep

It was warm and pleasant (It was so)
And over in an instant (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I feel like i dreamt it (But I'm not there now)
But I'm not there now

When he left me, we drove into a snowstormEmbed
