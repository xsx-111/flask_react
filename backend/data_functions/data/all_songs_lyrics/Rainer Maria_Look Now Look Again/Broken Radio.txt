Broken Radio LyricsTraffic lights
Turning yellow
A kiss and a slap on the roof
Traffic lights
Turning yellow
A kiss and a slap on the roof
Traffic lights
Turning yellow
A kiss and a slap on the roof
Traffic lights
Turning yellow
A kiss and a slap
I taught you that superstition
Driving downtown
With the windows down
Late at night
Talking over
A broken radio
And I kiss my fingers
And our single headlight
Winks out for the last time
We talk about
The last time it felt right to make out
And I'm certain, if I drive into those trees
It would make less of a mess
Than you've made of me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oohEmbed
