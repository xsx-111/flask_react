Planetary LyricsThe skyline is two gazes long
And i crane my neck
To take it all in
The skyline is two gazes long
And i bump my head
Against the windshield
(trying to find the sun
It runs ahead of us
I don't know what direction that is.)
I can see you craning your neck
But momentum makes my head
Ponderous and heavy
Planetary rotation
Is time winding down?
The light from our bodies precedes us
I want to go to far away places2Embed
