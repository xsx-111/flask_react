Rise LyricsSometimes
Offer more than talking
Say, I like you very much
Say, what when cut grows over
Pink and white?
Carnations
Skinny daisies
For each inch cut
The roots grow ten
Where we can't see them
Devise
A way of saving your words
Say nothing
If it's forced
For each inch cut
The roots grow ten
Where we can't see them
I'm laying in the soil
Is it time for me to rise?
I've pulled up my stakes again
Is there someone who can take me in?Embed
