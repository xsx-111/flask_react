Centrifuge LyricsExpert opinions
Amount to rumors
As far as you're concerned
And documentation
Of your medical condition
Won't do us right
Won't help you sleep tonight
There's so little way to help you
And i only have two arms
With needles drawing out my wishes
Centrifuge them back to you
Case studies
Amount to rumors
As far as you're concerned
And scott and sloan
Are your guardian angels
But are you better off?
Are you?
Risperadal, rohypnol, progesterone
I've gone away
But i can't escape the fact
That you're not homeEmbed
