Lost, Dropped, And Cancelled Lyrics
Expect me like one waits for mail, alll lost dropped and cancelled
Like foreign post, I leave twice a day but take a week to get there
Expect me like one waits for rain or sleet or hail or snowfall
Like foreign post, I’m lost on the way and take a week to get there

I want to be delivered 'til I’m gone, gone, gone

The way it’s sealed in my--
The way it’s sealed in my--
The way it's sealed in my heart
It’s guaranteed that I--
It’s guaranteed that I’m in your hands
By morning, when you’re ready to read between the lines
And the paper isn’t telling you anything
By morning, when you’re ready to read between the lines
And the paper isn’t telling you anything

If you miss me, drop me a line, in care of fin de siecle
Mit Luftwaffe, it's the end of the end of the end

I want to be delivered, I want
I want to be delivered 'til I’m gone, gone, goneEmbed
