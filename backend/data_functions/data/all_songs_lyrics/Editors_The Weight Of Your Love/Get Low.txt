Get Low Lyrics
The rally cry, the call to arms
Another lame excuse
So bite your tongue, ‘cause where’s the fun
In another truce

So get low
Get low

Only the last glow lights up an atmosphere, an atmosphere
Only the last glow lights up an atmosphere, an atmosphere
I am blinded here

I wish I could solve this, solve this
I just can’t
I wish I could solve this, solve this
I just can’t

I do believe
Your bible states your crime
I do believe
Your hate justifies mine
Now get low
Get low

Only the last glow, lights up an atmosphere, an atmosphere
Only the last glow, lights up an atmosphere, an atmosphere
I am blinded here

I wish I could solve this, solve this
I just can’t
I wish I could solve this, solve this
I just can’t

Now get low
Get low
Get low
Get low

I wish I could solve this, solve this
I just can’t
I wish I could solve this, solve this
I just can’t
I wish I could hold this in my hands
I wish I could solve this, now solve this
I just can’tEmbed
