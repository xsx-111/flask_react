Two Hearted Spider Lyrics
I wanna come over
I want to come over
And tear the place apart
With you
In the arms of a lover
A two hearted spider
I'm just a mess for you

All my naivety
Oh, my fickle views
I feel my blood boil
As our shadows fuse

Every move you make
Breaks me, breaks me
Every smile you fake
Breaks me, breaks me

Let's build ourselves an island
I want it now
If they build a prison
I'll knock it down
All my naivety
Oh, my fickle views
I feel my blood boil
As our shadows fuse

Every move you make
Breaks me, breaks me
Every smile you fake
Breaks me, breaks me

I saw our shadows dance before the dawn
I saw our shadows dance before the dawn
And it breaks me
Breaks me, breaks, breaks me, me, me, me

Every move you make
Breaks me, breaks me
Every smile you fake
Breaks me, breaks me now

Every move you make
Breaks me, breaks me
Every smile you fake
Breaks me, breaks, breaks
(Breaks me, breaks me)
Every move you make
(Breaks me, breaks me)Embed
