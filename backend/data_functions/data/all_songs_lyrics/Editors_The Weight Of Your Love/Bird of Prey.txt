Bird of Prey Lyrics
Every lie you've ever been sold
The greatest story ever told
The circling bird of prey
Above a church on a Sunday

I'll wrap myself in you
A little something that I can cling to
Oh, there you are, my love
There you are, my love

Rain down through my hands
Scream out like children
My heart is a church bell ringin'
You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
My heart is a church bell ringin'

Every lie you've ever been sold
The greatest story ever told
The circling bird of prey
Above a church on a Sunday
Rain down through my hands
Scream out like children
My heart is a church bell ringin'
You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
My heart is a church bell ringin'

To the birds, to the birds, to the birds
To the birds, to the birds, to the birds

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)Embed
