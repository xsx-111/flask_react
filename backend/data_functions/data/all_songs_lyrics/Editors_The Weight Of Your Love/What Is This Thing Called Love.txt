What Is This Thing Called Love Lyrics
I've been your lover for the last time
All the pretending, God knows that we tried
I've been the doctor for the last time
If we weren't so good at it, we'd have both been fine

I knock you down
Bruise you with my words
I patch you up
Now it's your turn

What is this thing called love that you speak?
We're out of it, we're out of it
What is this thing called love that you speak?
We're out of it, we're out of it

We built this city, now we tear it to the ground
This fight is over
Hear the bell ringing out at the end of the final round
All right

And you knock me down
Cut me with a stare
You patch me up
Now it's my turn
What is this thing called love that you speak?
We're out of it, we're out of it
What is this thing called love that you speak?
We're out of it, we're out of it

Ah
Ah
We're out of it

What is this thing called love that you speak?
'Cause we're out of it, we're out of it
What is this thing called love that you speak?
'Cause we're out of it, we're out of it

We're out, we're out of it
We're out, we're out of it2Embed
