Sugar Lyrics
Don't leave, don't leave
I want you to realise when I'm gone
My my, my my
You are the only thing I wanna own

There's sugar on your soul
You're like no one I know
You're the light from another world
You swallow me whole
With just a mumbled hello
And it breaks my heart to love you
It breaks my heart to love you

Don't leave, don't leave
When you're lost in a moment, I am home
I try, I try
To make you realise when I'm gone, gone, gone

There's sugar on your soul
You're like no one I know
You're the light from another world
You swallow me whole
With just a mumbled hello
And it breaks my heart to love you
It breaks my heart to love you
There's sugar on your soul
There's sugar on your soul

There's sugar on your soul
You're like no one I know
You're the light from another world
You swallow me whole
With just a mumbled hello
And it breaks my heart to love you
It breaks my heart to love you

Don't leave, don't leave
I want you to realise when I'm gone5Embed
