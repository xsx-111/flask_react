The Sting Lyrics
Danger, we don’t always hide around here
Now in here, I see my old friend disappear
In tonight, in tonight

People don’t change
And I know your story so well
I know your faith, it’s my favorite tale to tell

You wanted to make me believe in love
You wanted to make me believe in love
You bring the money and I will be waiting
I’m in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat
Throw the money down, you never ran this town
I’m in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat

Whisper to me, we’ll want to escape
Now what have you got, what you got that’s so great

You wanted to make me believe in love
You wanted the things you dream of
You bring the money and I will be waiting
I’m in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat
Throw the money down, you never ran this town
I’m in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting

You bring the money and I will be waiting
I’m in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat
Throw the money down, you never ran this town
I’m in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat
(You bring the money and I will be waiting)
(Throw the money down, you never ran this town)Embed
