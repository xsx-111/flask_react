Formaldehyde Lyrics
Would you butcher my love
To understand it?
To know where it lies?
Cut a hole in my heart
Fill a hole in your life
I'm yours to dissect

Now, does every heartbeat burn a white heat in your blood?
Formaldehyde

The tissue and bone
And my soul has on loan
Aches to be near you
Are you listenin' carefully?
Then we shall begin

Now, does every heartbeat burn a white heat in your blood?
I hope it doesn't matter, I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (Until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (My formaldehyde)
Smother my love, entertain it
My mind's gonna wander
Are you listening carefully?
Then we shall begin, oh

Now does every heartbeat burn a white heat in your blood?
I hope it doesn't matter, I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (Until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (My formaldehyde)

I'm lost to a love that's a mile wide
Drowned in a bath of formaldehyde

Now, does every heartbeat burn a white heat in your blood?
I hope it doesn't matter, I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (Until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (My formaldehyde)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (Until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (My formaldehyde)

I'm lost to a love that's a mile wide
Drowned in a bath of formaldehyde

I'm lost to a love
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
