The Weight Lyrics
For a moment I felt the strength of your love
It was lightning, it was lightning
Strike down on me

I'm a lump of meat with a heart beat
Electricity restarts me
Strike down on me, on me

Every day I pray I'm the first to go
Without you I would be lost
I promised myself I wouldn't talk about death
I know I'm getting boring

I'm a man holding the weight of your love
But without it my strength just isn't enough
So, strike down on me, on me

Every day I pray I'm the first to go
Without you I would be lost
And I promised myself I wouldn't sing about death
I know I'm getting boring now
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

For a moment I felt the weight of your love
It was lightning, it was lightning
Strike down on me1Embed
