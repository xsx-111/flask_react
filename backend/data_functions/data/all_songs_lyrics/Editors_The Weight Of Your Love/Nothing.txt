Nothing Lyrics
The sun said nothin'
About my demise, my fall to the floor
Sparks from your stare
Cascade into mine
Started a war
Started a war

Monday morning
Hungover, red eyes
Hide it all the way
We walk through a crowd of strangers
Two minutes from your door
You lived there all your life

Every conversation within you
Starts a celebration in me
Till I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left

Out of it, you handle it for everyone
Take a poisoned dart to my heart and then I'm done
Every conversation within you
Starts a celebration in me
Till I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

These floorboards creaking, my body's old
The sun casts a shadow at dusk
That cuts through your bones
Your body and soul

Every conversation within you
Starts a celebration in me
Till I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left

I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left
Oh, oh, oh
I got nothin' left
I got nothin' left1Embed
