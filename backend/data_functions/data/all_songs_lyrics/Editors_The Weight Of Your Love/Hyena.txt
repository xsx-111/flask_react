Hyena Lyrics
Call me and tell me you care
There's a country to flatten over there
Don't bore me with the truth
I live alone, don't you?

Write down the things I should say
There ain't enough hours in the day
Perfect my cold stare
Tell your friends I did a dare

But don't you understand?
The hunger makes the man
With all that lies in front of us
The world looks so ridiculous to me

Laugh with me, hyena
Laugh with me, hyena
Laugh with me, hyena
Laugh with me now

I love you, I love my black eye
These knots I'll never untie
They'll believe us in who we are
There's history in a scar
But don't you understand?
The hunger makes the man
With all that lies in front of us
The world looks so ridiculous to me

Laugh with me, hyena
Laugh with me, hyena
Laugh with me, hyena
So, laugh with me now

Laugh with me now
Laugh with me now
Laugh with me now

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Laugh with me, hyena (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Laugh with me, hyena (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Laugh with me, hyena (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So, laugh with me now
So, laugh with me somehowEmbed
