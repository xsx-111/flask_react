Comrade Spill My Blood Lyrics
I don't wanna go quietly, I don't wanna tread softly
I'm a dog with a scent
I saw the staring faces of the crowd
I did not see the event

Sincerity and subtlety
Will I miss my son?
Comrade, spill my blood, comrade, spill my blood
We fight a war that can be won

Soul, lives on, silence
Soul, lives on, silence

I don't wanna pray quietly, I don't wanna tread softly
I'm a dog with a scent
I saw the staring faces of the crowd
I did not see the event

Sincerity and subtlety
But I miss my son
Comrade, spill my blood, comrade, spill my blood
We fight a war that could be won
Soul, lives on, silence
Now soul, lives on, silence

Soul, lives on, silence
Now soul, lives on, silence
Now soul, lives on, silence
Now soul, lives on, silenceEmbed
