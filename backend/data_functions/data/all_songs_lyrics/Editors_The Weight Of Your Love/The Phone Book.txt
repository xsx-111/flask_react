The Phone Book Lyrics
I'm on watch here
So close your eyes and get some rest
I'm here to watch your heart
It's been faulty from the start
I'm the ribs in your chest

I'm not an angel
I never mean to make you cry
Jumping through my hoops
With dissension in the troops
And a smile and a sigh

What's that over your shoulder?
Fear of getting older?

Stay with me

Sing me a love song
From your heart or from the phone book
It don't matter to me
I'm an apple, you're the tree
I won't fall when you're shook
What's that over your shoulder?
Fear of getting older?

Stay with me

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na


It ends with a kiss
It ends with a tear
It ends with the lights out
Bathed in our fear
Tell me nonsense
I don't want sincere
I saw the lightnin'
Cut through the last winter sky of the year

Stay with me
Keep with me

Ah, ah
Ah, na, na, na, na
Ah, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, laEmbed
