Honesty Lyrics
Don't you want me to stay?
Make a rocking horse getaway
The radio says we're in for a fall
The TV says nothin' at all
Nothin' at all
Nothin' at all

Out of my window, it echoes my heart
I've been checking for change since the start

Collide into me, I could do with a fight
Collide into me, 'cause it feels right

Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party
Take it out on me
'Cause all the honesty
Shuts this place down

Your bowling ball eyes have nothing to say
They knock me over again, anyway
Collide into me, I could do with a fight
Collide into me, 'cause it feels right

Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party
Take it out on me
'Cause all the honesty
Shuts this place down

The broken hearts of my neighborhood
Lay cast aside like dreams in Hollywood
With the boarded-up windows and the closing sales

Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party
Take it out on me
'Cause all the honesty
Shuts this place down

Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party
Take it out on me
'Cause all the honesty
Shuts this place down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
