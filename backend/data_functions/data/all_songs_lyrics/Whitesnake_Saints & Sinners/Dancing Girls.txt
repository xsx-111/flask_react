Dancing Girls LyricsI don't need a doctor
I don't need a priest
I don't need no superstitious cures
For my release
I'm flesh an' blood
Skin an' bone
A little petticoat company
Can't get me stoned
So just gimme the night
Skin it back to the bone
Turn on the spotlight
C'mon
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
You can dance
Dance
Dance for me
Dance for your daddy all night
I got a one track notion
On a feminine squeeze
A sackfull of love
A mindful of fantasies
A midnight rider
On a stallion steam
I got an old man's weakness
Hangin' on a young man's dream
So just gimme the night
Skin it back to the bone
Turn on the spotlight
C'mon
C'mon
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
You can dance
Dance
Dance for me
Dance for your daddy all night
So just gimme the night
Skin it back to the bone
Turn on the spotlight
C'mon
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girlsEmbed
