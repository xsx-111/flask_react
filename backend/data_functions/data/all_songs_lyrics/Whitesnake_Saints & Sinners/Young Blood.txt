Young Blood LyricsIf you feel the rollin' thunder
An' your eyes see lightnin' strike
Don't be afraid to call on me
I'll bring you shelter from the night
When the wind is howlin', I'll hold you near
An' soothe your troubled mind
With a little bit of this an' a little bit of that
I'll make you leave all your worries behind
Don't try to hold on to what you got, uh
'Cause I got what you need
Don't try to hold on for anyone
Come on, give it to me, oo
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood
When you're burnin' hot with fever
An' you shake down to your bones
Don't get yourself into a cold sweat
It's just your bad blood throwin' stones
The Devil has got your number
He wants you hangin' on a line
But, before the night is over, baby
I'm gonna make you mine
Don't try to hold on to what you got, uh
'Cause I got what you need
Don't try to hold on for anyone
Come on, give it to me
I'll make you run for your
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
I'm comin' to get you
Don't try to stop me, baby
Don't try to hold on to what you got
'Cause I've got what you need
Don't try to hold on for anyone
Come on, give it to me
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
I'm gonna make you mineEmbed
