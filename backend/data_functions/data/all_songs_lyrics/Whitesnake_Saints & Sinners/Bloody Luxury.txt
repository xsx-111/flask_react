Bloody Luxury LyricsNow when I first met you
I was rollin' along
Just a bar room crooner
Singin' heartbreak songs
And I supposed I could never get next to you
But you seemed quite happy with my company
You kept my body heat steady at hundred and three
With your mouth full of gimme
Your body full of much obliged
It's bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
Bloody luxury
What you do to me?
It's bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
'Cos no matter what you do to me
It's bloody luxury
Bloody luxury
(Ha ha)
You're a five star woman
And you know what to give
To fill a part time loser
Full of reasons to live
There's no doubt about it
I'm takin' a chance on you
Because you get my heart beatin' heavy
Make my knees go weak
You get me so damn nervous
I can hardly speak
But nothin's gonna stop me
Hangin' on my good luck charm
It's bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
It's bloody luxury
Honey, what you do to me?
It's bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
'Cos no matter what you do to me
It's bloody luxury
Bloody luxury
(God, oh get the boys we gonna play it)
It's bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
Bloody luxury
Honey, what you do to me?
It's bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
'Cos no matter what you do to me
It's bloody luxury
(Ha)
Bl-bl-bloody
Bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
Bloody luxury
Honey, what you do to me?
It's bloody luxury
What you mean to me?
'Cos no matter what you do to me
No matter what you do to me
No matter what you do to me
It's bloody luxury
Bloody luxury
(Ha, ha)
Bloody luxury, hmmEmbed
