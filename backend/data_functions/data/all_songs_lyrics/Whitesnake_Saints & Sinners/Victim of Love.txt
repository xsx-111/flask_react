Victim of Love LyricsI'm down on love an' I don't give a damn
I take my chances whenever I can
Like a lamb to the slaughter, another sacrifice
For givin' love to a woman with a heart stone cold as ice, huh
I'm down on love an' I'm clean out of pain
I ain't no stranger to the cryin' game
Too scared to suffer an' too blind to see
But I played with fire an' got what was comin' to me
Now one more heartache
(Ooh)
Don't bother me
(Ooh)
Just one more lonely night
(Ooh)
To drown in misery
(Ooh)
I am a victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
I'm down on love an' I feel like a fool
To beg for mercy 'cause I broke the rules
So do me no favors with your cool advice
I know the losing cost and I'll pay the price
Now one more heartache
(Ooh)
Don't bother me
(Ooh)
One more lonely night
(Ooh)
To drown in misery
(Ooh)
I am a victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Huh, uh
Now one more heartache
(Ooh)
Don't bother me
(Ooh)
One more lonely night
(Ooh)
To drown in misery
(Ooh)
I'm a victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Victim of love
Victim of love
Lord, I never thought I'd be a victim of love
(Ooh)
Victim of love
