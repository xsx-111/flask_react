Forget It Lyrics
But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine
And af-ter that's said
Forget it

Don't be inane
There's no one to blame
No reason why, you should stay here
And lie to me

Don't say anymore
Just walk out the door
I'll get along fine
You'll see

But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine
And af-ter that's said
Forget it

If there was a word, but magic's absurd
I'd make one dream come true
It didn't work out, but don't ever doubt
How I felt about you
But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine
And af-ter that's said
Forget it2Embed
