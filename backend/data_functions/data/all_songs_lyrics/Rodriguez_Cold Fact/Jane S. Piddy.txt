Jane S. Piddy Lyrics
Now you sit there thinking, feeling insecure
The mocking court jester claims there is no proven cure
Go back to your chamber, your eyes upon the wall
'Cause you got no one to listen, you got no one to call

And you think I'm curious

Drifting, drowning in a purple sea of doubt
You wanna hear she loves you
But the words don't fit the mouth
You're a loser, a rebel, a cause, without

But don't think me callous

Dancing Rosemary, disappearing sister Ruth
It's just your yellow appetite
That has you choking on the truth
You gave in, you gave out, outlive your dreams of youth

And I can't get jealous
So go on, you'll continue with your nose so open wide
Knocking on the door that says "Hurry, come inside"
But don't bother to buy insurance
'Cause you've already died

And you can't be serious

I saw my reflection in my father's final tears
The wind was slowly melting, San Francisco disappears
Acid heads, unmade beds, and you Woodward world queers
I know you're lonely

I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely

Thanks for your time
And you can thank me for mine
And after that's said
Forget it
Bag it, man
