Before Hollywood LyricsMake me last, make me last
Through our love, make me last
New masquerade to be absorbed
I had to act before, now I talk
And make me last, make me last
Through our love, make me last
Bring the microphones hidden under stones
Record my sobs in baritones
And make me last, make me last
Through our love, make me last
In the new west, the orange groves grow like a plague
Wherever you go, I told the heads we'll show the world
We'll film ourselves in history and chrome
And I said that, just not sure
Make me last through our love
Box office law, simple and grand
An endless stream one can draw
The flicker of light, piano keys
A silent screen, a silent star
Make me last, make me last
Through our love, make me last
In the new west, the orange groves grow like a plague
Wherever you go, I told the heads, we'll show the world
We'll film ourselves in history and chrome
And I said that, just not sure what's to be done
It's thunder town, they'll do what they can to hold you down
It's thunder town, they'll do what they can to hold you down
It's thunder town, they'll do what they can to hold you down
It's thunder town, they'll do what they can to hold you downEmbed
