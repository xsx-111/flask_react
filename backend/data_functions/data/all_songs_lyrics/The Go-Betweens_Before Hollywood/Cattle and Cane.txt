Cattle and Cane Lyrics
I recall a schoolboy coming home
Through fields of cane to a house of tin and timber
And in the sky, a rain of falling cinders
From time to time the waste, memory wastes

I recall a boy in bigger pants
Like everyone just waiting for a chance
His father's watch he left it in the showers
From time to time the waste, memory wastes
And the waste, memory wastes

I recall a bigger brighter world
A world of books and silent times in thought
And then the railroad, the railroad takes him home
Through fields of cattle, through fields of cane
From time to time the waste, memory wastes
And the waste, memory wastes

I recall the same, a reply
A plan you once had, from time down to mind
That time was bad, so I knew where I was
Alone, and so at home
Further
