Two Steps Step Out LyricsI haven't heard a voice that I can trust
And all this sweetness turns a throat to rust
I'm standing on a quay wrapped up in mist
The steamer's left with someone that I miss
I'd walk a hundred miles
Sold my horse, got fired by the consul
A testament to flags, I was hostile
Tried faith and drugs and gold
It didn't work, I couldn't fill the hole
I'd walk a hundred miles
A thousand miles, a million miles
Two steps step out towards your door
I'll be calling round
Round, two steps step out, I'm on my way
Here I am now
I started cutting marble in a quarry
I worked my hands, I wasn't in a hurry
The time I did to pass the time
The time I did to pass the time
I'd walk a hundred miles
So now I'm loading wool down at the wharf
The ships unload and then they head back north
And every time the mist comes in
I sit and watch the mist come in
I'd walk a hundred miles
A thousand miles, a million miles
Two steps step out towards your door
I'll be calling round
Round, two steps step out, I'm on my way
Here I am nowEmbed
