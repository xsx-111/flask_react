On My Block LyricsAlright... come on... no-w-w-w-w
The main gate to the mansion is locked
It's on my street on my block, I went in but I got chased off
The store-keeper said 'why don't the cars stop?'
But the mansion's not the attraction it once was
And it's on my, it's on my, on my
On my block, on my block
Girl I've been called names times before
It happens cause it happens here
And nobody said they'd ever hear
The garden is unkept and in bloom
There is wilderness and flowers in my room
The caretakers kept to be fired soon
On my block, on my block
Girl I've been called names times before
It happens cause it happens here
And nobody said they'd ever hear
The main gate, the mansion is locked
I'm standing on the spot
And it's on my, oh my my
On my block
On my blockEmbed
