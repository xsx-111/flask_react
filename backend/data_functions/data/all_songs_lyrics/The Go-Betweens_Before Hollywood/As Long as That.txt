As Long as That LyricsWere you born or just conceived?
Whatever comes, crosses me
There's no routine, I've never lived like this
What can I say, there's lightning on the hill tonight
Over in the west the colour changes shape and slides
I'm not stuck to be inspired by her or by me
Get this, and how, I'm lifted way way down
Too tired to say too weak to speak
I've got a feeling, it sounds like a fact
It's been around as long as that
There is a notion you've got it too
It's been around as long as that
Where can you go, the thunder settles in and waits
Trams on the rattle, windows banging shut like gates
Slap my face use your lungs, she brought me more to life
You think I'm young I'm not half those things
Why did it rain, the days ran away from us
Heaven never knew the chances that it left for us
Fast and slow, breeze to wind wrapped beneath her
You take charge, I'll put you at ease
Too tired to say too weak to speak
I've got a feeling, sounds like a fact
It's been around as long as that
There is a notion you've got it too
It's been around as long as that
What can I say, there's lightning on the hill tonight
Over in the west the colour changes shape and slides
Think of someone and double it, that's what I did
Get this and how, I'm lifted way way down
Too tired to say too weak to speak
I've got a feeling, sounds like a fact
It's been around as long as that
There is a notion you've got it too
It's been around as long as that
As long, as long, as long
As long as that
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong
What's wrong with thatEmbed
