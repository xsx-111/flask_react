A Bad Debt Follows You LyricsStand off, a stand off, we're off to the send-off
You sit on the stairs, lost in your hair
What's that you're wearing, looks like a necklace?
Oh, how the stars shine on your face
I won't stand, I won't wait
I won't stand for that, I won't wait now I say
Another time in another room
Skin turned and held sweat, lost all its feeling
I fell in your eyes, I fell for your eyes
Pull back the curtains, let in the dark
I'll lie and watch while your hair sparks
I won't stand, I won't wait
I won't stand for that, I won't wait now I say
Another time in another room
I won't stand, I won't wait
I won't stand for that, I won't wait now I say
Another time in another room
You told me stars would fall
You told me ice would melt
You told me everything!
Now and again
A bad debt won't wait
I won't waitEmbed
