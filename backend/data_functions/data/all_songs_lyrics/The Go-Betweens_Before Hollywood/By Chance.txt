By Chance LyricsMy head fits
Into my hands
I roll it around
And nothing comes out
By chance, we fight
By chance, struck a chord
We'll stand tonight
Who broke who
Who screamed who
There's no two things
Lovers can do
By chance, we fight
By chance, struck a chord
We'll stand tonight
Who's your tall friend?
He's built like a song
The valley of Tin Pan
Is where he belongs
By chance, we fight
By chance, struck a chord
We'll stand tonight
Bye-bye-bye-bye-byeEmbed
