Dusty in Here LyricsLike a ghost, a ghost of something old
It's cold and dusty in here
Just twenty years and six feet down, I'm told
I know your face, I share your name
In the dark when shadows have their way
A finger's a chimney and the moon's on fire
Then sleep arrives, he's got his bags and wares
The dragon sleeps and St. George stares
You won't write, no you won't write
That's all I ask, that you just write
And you say no, that you can't speak
You've lost your voice, you let it go, you let it go
Like a ghost, a ghost of something old
It's cold and dusty in here
It's in your hand it sits, just like a glove
The finger traces the lines of love
It's cold and dusty in here
Someone you knew is watching you
I'm someone you knewEmbed
