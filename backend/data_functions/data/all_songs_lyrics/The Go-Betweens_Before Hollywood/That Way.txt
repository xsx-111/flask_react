That Way LyricsIn search of a new voice, you burnt all your lyrics
And flew to a new town
"One of the has been's," that was your phrase
But what about show-biz?
That way, that way
That way
That way, that way
That way
In my apartment, six white horses
Wood turns electric
Inspired by shadows, driven by tears
You won't rest till you're back on the boards
That way, that way
That way or nothing at all
That way, that way
That way or nothing at all
I hear it's cold now, the worst one on record
Hope that you keep warm
I guess I'll be leaving, now is the best time
On the Atlantic we'll all climb
That way, that way
That way or nothing at all
That way, that way
That way or nothing at all
It's only time away, it's only time away
It's only time away
It's only time away, it's only time away
It's only time away
There'll come a time one day, someone will turn and say
It doesn't have to be that way
There'll come a time one day, someone will turn and say
It doesn't have to be that way
There'll come a time when someone will say it wasn't that way
There'll come a time when someone will say it wasn't that wayEmbed
