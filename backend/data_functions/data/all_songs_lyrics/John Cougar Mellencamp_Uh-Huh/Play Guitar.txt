Play Guitar Lyrics
Oh!

You may drive around in your town
In a brand new shiny car
Your face in the wind and your haircut's in
Friends think you're bizarre
You may find a cushy job and I hope that you go far
But if you really want to taste some cool success
Better learn to play guitar

Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah
Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah

Well you got your eyes on the cheerleader queen
And you're walkin' her home from school
You know that she's only seventeen
But you know that she'll make you a fool
You know you can't touch that stuff
Without money or a brand new car
Let me give you some good advice young man
You better learn to play guitar
Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah
Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah

All women around the world want a phony rock star
Who plays guitar

You can pump your iron and shine your shoes
And wear your hair just right
You go down out on cruisin' street
'Cause you want to score tonight
Ra da ra da ra da da
And you really want to show your scars
Forget all about that macho shit
And learn how to play guitar

Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Play guitar, play guitar
Play guitar, oh yeah
