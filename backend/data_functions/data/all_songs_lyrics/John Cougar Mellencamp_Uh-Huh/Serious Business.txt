Serious Business LyricsYou ain't goin' nowhere
Gonna sit by this pool until you fall in
Didn't know what you were getting into
When you walked in to this room now did you kid
We got some girls over here
We got some boys over there
And they're here just for your fun
So have some dinner, baby, play some records
But just remember one thing son
This is serious business
Sex and violence and rock and roll
This is serious business
Sex and violence and rock and roll
You know my head is sweating
I can't dance and I can't relax
Outside is too threatening now
I've come this far and I can't go back
Call up some old friends
Call up some strangers
Get me used to that French telephone
Donna Donna educate me
But tell those girls that I'm not alone
This is serious business
Sex and violence and rock and roll
This is serious business
Sex and violence and rock and roll
Take my life
Take my soul
Put me on the cross for all to see
Put my name around my neck
Let those people throw stones at me
This is serious business
Sex and violence and rock and rollEmbed
