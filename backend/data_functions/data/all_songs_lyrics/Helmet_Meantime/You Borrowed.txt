You Borrowed LyricsI'll throw you scraps
And talk the bad things
The language or the motive
Affected shown is
Self-imitating
Trust the dying breed
Yeah, the pitch I made has been
On my end
I trust in
What's left here
To lie is
Admired
You trust in
Without fear
You borrow
My world of one
Speak up the good things
The guidelines let me follow
Offense is borrowed
Self-imitating
Trust the dying breed
Yeah, the pitch I made has been
On my end
I trust in
What's left here
To lie is
Admired
You trust in
Without fear
You borrow
