Turned Out LyricsCome off crisp and play up to cynic
Clean and schooled, right down to the minute
You need to hear that your life is rough
Speaking out and cold that you've had enough
You know how to live, and your heart's gone "bi"
Substance rush, giving art a try
Your righteous squat's been burned to the ground
Pass the buck
Never utter a sound
High times, hard times
Downtown Julie Brown
High times, hard times
Downtown Julie
You turned out
Wasted time
Need escape me
Missed it, right?

High times, hard times
Downtown Julie Brown
High times, hard times
Downtown Julie
You turned out
Wasted time
Need escape me
Missed it, right?Embed
