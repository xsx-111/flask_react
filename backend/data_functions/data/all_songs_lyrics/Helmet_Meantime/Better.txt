Better LyricsGet it right
My last word sins
I taste it now
Omission wins
For keeping down
My better side
I still ignore
And try to hide
So get out
Get out
The easy word
Will never slip
I brought it down
To take the lip
Don't need to know
Don't have to feel
Your better side
I had to steal
Get out
Get out
Get out
You better die
You better die now
You better die
You better
Write down the day
Expend it
Work it in again
Death ends it
Die
You better die now
You better die now
You better dieEmbed
