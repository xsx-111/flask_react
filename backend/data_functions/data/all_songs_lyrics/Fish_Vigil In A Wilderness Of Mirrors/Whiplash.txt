Whiplash LyricsHang a left, turn a right
We're driving through the night
We're on the road with Fred
Anytime, anywhere but he's sure to get you there
That's the road with Fred
With his foot right to the floor
There's a corner coming on
Whiplash!
He'll overtake anywhere he doesn't really care
That's the road with Fred
Through rain and snow and fog
You sit and pray to God and place your faith in Fred
You gotta close your eyes
So you never get surprised by whiplash!
Chew your nails right to the bone
You're on the wrong side of the road
On the right side of Fred
A collision coming on
You pray the brakes are gonna hold on the road with Fred
The nut is loose behind the wheel
Hear that rubber squeal - whiplash!
Hang a left, turn a right
Driving through the night
On the road with Fred
Anytime, anywhere he's sure to get you there
On the road with Fred
He's got a mobile telephone
But you pray that no-one calls for whiplashEmbed
