Jack and Jill LyricsMe and my old lady we got a dream coming true
Me and my old lady just bought some room with a view
We kept our options open it was the only way we could deal
Living life on our own terms we took a house on the hill
But if it all comes tumbling down, just a dream gets broken
But our souls stay sound, we can hold our heads high
And look back with no shame
With a conscience as clear as our ideals and aims
'Cause where do you go at the end of the day
When your world comes tumbling down
Can you climb to your feet, wipe the tears from your eye
'Cause its only the foot of a hill
Some people take a mortgage down on memory lane
Hide their heads in the sand and hope their troubles go away
Detach themselves from living a life that they can never afford
Lock their hearts and their spirits behind heavy golden doors
But if it all comes tumbling down, a dream gets broken
But do your souls stay sound, can you hold your heads high
And look back with no shame?
With a conscience as clear as your ideals and aims
Where will you go at the end of the day
When your world comes tumbling down
Can you climb to your feet, wipe the tears from your eyes?
Can you climb your way back up the hill?Embed
