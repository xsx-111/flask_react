Internal Exile  LyricsI saw a blue umbrella in Princes Street Gardens
Heading out west for the Lothian Road
An Evening News stuffed deep in his pocket
Wrapped up in his problems to keep away the cold
Grierson's spirit haunts the dockyard
The only men working, documentary crews
Shooting film as the lines get longer
As the seams run out, as the oil runs dry
Hey there, laddie, internal exile
When will you see that we got to let go?
Hey there, lassie, internal exile
When will you realize we got to let go?
Starlings wheeling, Georgian spires
And the fires of Grangemouth burn the skies
A lion sleeps in a tenement close
In a country that's tired and deaf to his roar
Hey there, laddie, internal exile
When will you see that we got to let go?
Hey there, lassie, internal exile
When will you realize we got to let go?
We got to go now
Oh, would you please let us go now?
They bury the wasteland deep in the wilderness
Poison the soil and reap the harvest
Of blind indifference, greed and apathy
Sowed way back in our history
The fish are few and the harbors are empty
The keels now rot on our oil slicked shores
The sheep are gone, the farms deserted
It sounds out of sight and we're out of mind
Hey there, laddie, internal exile
When will you see that we got to let go?
Hey there, lassie, internal exile
When will you realize we got to let go?
We're gonna go now
We're gonna go now
Like our fathers before us we've eyes for America
Dream of a new life on foreign shores
Wherever we go we will always know
That the land we stand on is never our own
Hey there, laddie, internal exile
When will you see that we got to let go?
Hey there, lassie, internal exile
When will you realize we got to let go?
We're internal exile, we got to, got to let go
We're internal exile, we simply got to let go
Got to let go
We got to go now
Would you please let us go now?
Internal exile, internal exile
Would you please let us go?Embed
