Vigil LyricsListen to me just hear me out, if I could have your attention
Just quieten down for a voice in the crowd
I get so confused I don't understand
I know you feel the same way you've always wanted to say
But you don't get the chance, just a voice in the crowd
I don't know the score anymore; it's not clear anymore
I can't tell right from wrong anymore; I just don't understand
I was sitting here thinking of exchanging a new world for old
Like changing channels on the tv, or the dirt we stand in to gold
When I was young, my father told me just the bad guys die
At the time just a little white lie
It was one of the first but it hurt me the most
And the truth stung like tears in my eye
That even the good guys must die
There's no reasoning no crimes and I never knew why
Even now it still makes me cry
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line
Just a little helping hand just a little understanding
Just some answers to the questions that surround me now
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you
I keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors
Where nothing here is ever what it seems
You stand so close but you never understand it
For all that we see is not what it seems, am I blind?
And you sit there and talk revolution
But can you tell me just who's in command?
When you tell me the forces we are fighting
Then I'll gladly join and make plans
But for now only our t-shirts cry freedom
And our voices are gagged by our greed
Our minds are harnessed by knowledge
By the hill and the will to succeed
And if that's not what you believe
Would you let me know I'm not standing alone
That I'm not just a voice in the crowd
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line
Just a little helping hand just a little understanding
Just a little understanding to the questions that I'm asking you
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you
I'll keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors
Where nothing here is ever what it seems
I'm scared to shout in case I draw attention from the powers
That preside over our minds and our lives
When they find what I want is the deadliest weapon, that is truth
Day by day it's getting louder
And day by day it's getting stronger
But when I can't scream no more and I need reassurance
I listen to the crowd
(And the boy stood, and stared at the hill. And the hill stared back)Embed
