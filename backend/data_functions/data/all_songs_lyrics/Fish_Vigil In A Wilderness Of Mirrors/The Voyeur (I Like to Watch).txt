The Voyeur (I Like to Watch) LyricsI like to watch
Track down a satellite, beam in the action
Life lies bleeding live in your living room
Your senses on remote control
It's overkill in overload
From Lockerbie to Lebanon's getting closer every day
From Hollywood to Hungerford's an impression away
I like to watch, implausible pledges of polite politicians
I like to watch, them even more than my video nasties
I like to watch
I like to watch
The bleating of a bimbo, a back-stabbing beauty queen
Titillating tabloids trigger off a wet dream into action
A fatal attraction, private lives are up for auction
A cupboard full of skeletons are coming out to play
I like to watch, disasters in re-run and replay in slow-mo
I like to watch, on the spot interviews, kicking in front doors
I like to watch
I like to watch
To watch
To watch as my face is reflected in blank TV screens
The programmes are over
I like to pretend that that's me up there making headlines
Camera closeups, Catching my right side
I don't care if it's only a moment
As long as it's peak-time
Just as long as, all of my friends and my family they see me
The world, will know my name
Come on down

I like to watch, psychologists speculate, analysts analise
I like to watch, my methods and motives, the topic of talk shows
I like to watch
I like to watch
I like to watch
I
I like
To watch
I like to watch
I like to watch
I like to watch
I like to watch
Just like to watch
I like
To watchEmbed
