Family Business LyricsI heard a battle ragin
On the other side of the wall
I buried my head in a pillow and tried to ignore it all
Every night when I hear you
I dream of breakin down your door
An avengin knight in shinin armor to rescue you from it all
From this family business
Family business
How long does it stay
Family business
Oh, it's nobody's business
This family business
But tell me how long it should stay
Family business
When I see you in the supermarket
Sunglasses in the shade
Avertin your eyes from those starin questions
How were those bruises made
The children clutch tight to your legs
They've got so much they want to say
But daddy's sittin home drunk again
So they bite their lips and pray
Cause daddy don't like people pryin
Pokin in his family affairs
And if anyone ask from the social well
You fell down the stairs
It's family business
Keep it in the family business
Can you tell me how long it remains
Family business
Oh, it's nobody's business
This family business
Can you tell me how long it should stay
Family business
She's waitin at the bus stop
At the bottom of the hill
She knows she'll never catch it
She knows she never will
The kids are all she lives for
She's got nothin left to lose
Nowhere to escape to
But she knows she's got to move
Cause when daddy tucks the kids in
Its takin longer every night
And the heaven that she's waitin for
Through the hell it lasts all night
It's family business
Keep it in the family business
Can you tell me how long it remains
Family business
Oh, it's nobody's business
Oh, this family business
Can you tell me how long it should stay
Family business
So I become an accessory
And I don't have an alibi
To the victim on my doorstep
The only way I can justify
It's family business
Family business
How long do we keep it
Family businessEmbed
