Song for Leigh LyricsSo it begins
Another blessed hymn
Walk around the world
Singing to my girl
Patience will keep you alive
Rock to the rock
Roll to the roll
If you follow me where I'm going
Might take some time but you'd never know
My gun still shoots and my bird still sings
These tricks are tricks I learned from a king
And I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about you
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about you
Rock to the rock
Roll to the roll
If you follow me where I'm going
Might take a while but you'd never know
My gun still shoots and my bird still sings
These tricks are tricks I learned from a king
And I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about you
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about youEmbed
