Heartbreaker Lyrics
I have no business asking you the words
I know the reason you exaggerate
I know the answers to all your demands
I have no secrets

I'm not your heartbreaker
Some tender ballad player
I'm not your heartbreaker

These are the good years
The best we'll ever know
These golden light-years

I'm not your heartbreaker
Some tender ballad player
I'm not your heartbreaker

You know I'm hopeless
Oh no, no you're wrong
It's not the singer
It's the song
You know I'm helpless
Oh no, no you're wrong
It's not the singer
It's the song
On these short days
Like the Chinese stars
Let's dance in our uniforms
These are the good years
The best we'll ever know
These golden light-years

I'm not your heartbreaker
Some tender ballad player
I'm not your heartbreaker
I'm not your heartbreaker
Some tender ballad player
I'm not your heartbreaker
I'm not your heartbreakerEmbed
