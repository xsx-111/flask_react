The Love You Love LyricsYou don't love me, just the kissing
Don't trust the facts, trust the fiction
I'll take the fiction
I'll take the fiction
What it is and what it should be
Baby, I want everything
What it is and what it should be
Baby, it's the love you love
Baby, it's the love you love
Not me
Baby, it's the love you love
Baby, it's the love you love
I wanna stay up all night again
I wanna work hard
Don't wanna play again
Don't want to
Where we are and where we should be
Baby, I want everything
Where we are and where we should be
Baby, it's the love you love
Baby, it's the love you love
Not me
Baby, it's the love you love
Baby, it's the love you loveEmbed
