Southern Heart LyricsFamily comes from Kentucky
And there's bourbon in the blood
They left the country for the city
In 1951
Me, I'm in between two worlds
Saw you on TV last night
Life looks easy on the TV
Where you ride into some blue evening
I fill my evenings with images of
Hazy hereafter
I don't even know your name
It's your southern heart I'm after
It's your southern heart I'm after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were afterEmbed
