Nightingales LyricsLock me up and throw away my name
Mock our love, it don’t break
Wind and grind
It’s only wind and grind
It’s how the days go by
It’s only wind and grind
Mark this laugh in front the under-porch
Slap the arm, break my fall
I’ve got eyes, man, I’ve got eyes
Throw my ashes in the air when I die
No desire for a headstone site
Wind and grind
It’s only wind and grind
It’s how the days go by
It’s only wind and grind
So, so still man
Oh, so still man
No one to come
No one to comeEmbed
