The Witch LyricsIt starts like this, the kiss is a kiss
The kiss is a kiss, smiles are all smiles
Say your goodbyes 'cause love will decide
Your life in hand, you made your demands
And now what else can you do?
'Cause that won't mean love, love will decide
Your world was always mine
Your world was always mine
It's dark on me, driving through central Michigan
Listening to the country station
And wandering where I stand
Love will decide, love will decideEmbed
