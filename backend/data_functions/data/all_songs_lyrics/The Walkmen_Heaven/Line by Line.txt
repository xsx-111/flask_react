Line by Line LyricsNow I know how the story goes
The wicked all will die
How do you know it
I just know it
I just know it
Oh, I've seen how this whole thing ends
The honest man survives
How do you know it
I just know it
I just know it
Not in line with history or
Not in line with make-believe
Line by line
We all scrape by
Line by line
Oh, we all scrape byEmbed
