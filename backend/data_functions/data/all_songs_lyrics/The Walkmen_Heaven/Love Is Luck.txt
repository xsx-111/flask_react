Love Is Luck LyricsGone are the flames
Gone is the world of mystery
The slaughter that
Is gonna stay that way
One man he waits
One man's a-dancing to his grave
Who do I follow?
Who do I blame?
You can't deny it
The poets are old
You can't deny it
They wrote it wrong
After the fun
After all the bubble gum
There is no sweetness
Left on my tongue, oh
After the fun
After all the bubble gum
There is no sweetness
Left on my tongue, oh
You can't deny it
The poets are old
You can't deny it
They wrote it wrong
'Cause love is luck
'Cause love is luck
'Cause love is luck
And love is luck
And love is luck
'Cause love is luck
'Cause love is luck
'Cause love is luckEmbed
