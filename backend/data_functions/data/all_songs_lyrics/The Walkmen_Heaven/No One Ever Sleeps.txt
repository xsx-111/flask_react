No One Ever Sleeps LyricsSee the yards, tender goats
Up in wonder for you know
Can’t continue on this way
No one ever sleeps
Here among these laughing faces
Sing of our love and hate
I can’t continue on this way
No one ever sleeps
No one ever sleeps
See the wallets time and go
I'll be up, oh you know
Can’t remember all the stuff
To show
Run children run
Run children run
Run children run
No one ever sleepsEmbed
