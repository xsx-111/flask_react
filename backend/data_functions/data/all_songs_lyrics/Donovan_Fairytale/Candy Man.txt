Candy Man LyricsCandy man, he's been and gone
My Candy man, he's been and gone
My Candy man, he's been and gone
Now I love everything in this Godalmighty world
God knows I do
Peppermint stick got a little brass band
I got a peppermint stick I got a little brass band
I got a peppermint stick I got a little brass band
And I'm goin' down to the gate to score the Candy man stand
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
'Cause I love everything in this Godalmighty world
God knows I do
Candy man, he's been and gone
My Candy man and his name was John
My Candy man he's Morocco bound
Now I'd give everything in this Godalmighty world
To bring my Candy man home
Black skin man give me some bad brew
Oh black skin man give me some bad brew
Oh black skin man give me some bad brew
Now I'd give everything in this Godalmighty world
To bring me my Candy man home
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
Run fetch a pitcher get the baby some beer
'Cause I love everything in this Godalmighty world
God knows I do
Candy man, I love the man
Yeah the Candy man, he gets me high
My Candy man, yeah I love the man
And I'd give everything in this Godalmighty world
To bring my Candy man homeEmbed
