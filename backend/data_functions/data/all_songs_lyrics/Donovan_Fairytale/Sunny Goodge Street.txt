Sunny Goodge Street LyricsOn the firefly platform on Sunny Goodge Street
A violent hash-smoker shook a chocolate machine
Involved in an eating scene
Smashing into neon streets in their stonedness
Smearing their eyes on the crazy Kali goddess
Listenin' to sounds of Mingus mellow fantastic
My, my, they sigh
My, my, they sigh
In doll house rooms with coloured lights swingin'
Strange music boxes sadly tinklin'
Drink in the sun, shining all around you
My, my, they sigh
My, my, they sigh

My, my, they sigh
My, my, they sigh
The magician, he sparkles in satin and velvet
You gaze at his splendour with eyes you've not used yet
I tell you his name is Love, Love, Love
My, my, they sigh
My, my, they sigh
My, my, they sigh2Embed
