The Little Tin Soldier LyricsOnce in a town in the black forest a little white toy-shop stood
And the little tin soldier with only one leg lived in a castle of wood
And across the room on another shelf stood a little glass case
And a tiny ballerina lived in there all in her dress of lace
And from where the little tin soldier stood they could see each other so clear
And the little tin soldier watched over her with a love that was so dear
Then one day sadness came: the tiny ballerina was sold
The little tin soldier was thrown away and into the gutter he rolled
The water carried him to the sea and many far-off lands
He made many children happy as he passed through their tiny hands
And then one day they met again in a house in the land of Eire
And when the clocks on the wall struck the midnight hour
They jumped into a fire
And in that fire they shall stay
Forever in the day
For the fire, Lord, is the fire of love
Just like the peaceful doveEmbed
