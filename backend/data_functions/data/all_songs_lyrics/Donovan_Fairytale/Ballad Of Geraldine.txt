Ballad Of Geraldine LyricsOh, I was born with the name Geraldine
With hair coal black as a raven
I travelled my life without a care
Ah, but all my love I was savin'
Oh, the winds blew high and the trees did sway
Not much from life was I askin'
Till I met someone to give all my love
All my love, so long an' lasting
Oh, good were the parts we played in our game
And a long ways off was tomorrow
But my love was a rambler and restless as the sea
And in the tide came sorrow
Oh, a child of the night is goin' to be born
I can't explain my confusion
Is my love thinkin' to marry me at all
Or of the freedom he thinks he'll be losin'?
I sit with my friends in the gay crowded room
My friends they're smokin' and a-talkin'
But it all seems so empty, my love is not there
So I'll go into the streets a-walkin'
My baby is a-growin' as a-growin' it must
If I were to lose it, it would grieve me
My love is so helpless and I'm wonderin' what to do
Oh, how I yearn to help him
Oh, we could go to the land of your choice
Where the false shame won't come knockin' at our door
I've a feeling in my heart and it's crushing all my hopes
I think I'm gonna be hurt some more
Oh, I was born with the name Geraldine
With hair coal black as a raven
I travelled my life without a care
Ah, but all my love I was savin'Embed
