Oh Deed I Do LyricsNow, it makes no difference what you do, I love you, babe
Well, I need your love, I need it bad, oh deed I do
Now, you don't believe me when I say I love you, babe
I wanna know the score, all I want is more, oh deed I do
I wanna lay you down, prove to you I love you, babe
I wanna turn you on to my lovin', babe, Oh deed I do
I got the blues like a Gypsy Dave never has, babe
I got a jealous dream of losing you, oh deed I have
Now I can never say I'd ever miss you, gal
'Cause I'm proud as a king, I wanna hear you sing Oh deed I do
Won't you break my mind and take your time to love me, babe
You've shattered my brain drivin' me insane oh deed you have
And you've taken every thought of love I'm thinkin', babe
You've hung them high, gonna let them dry beneath the sun
I'm gonna bend the bones that hold my blues together, babe
I'm gonna stretch the string that my troubles bring to me each night
I'm gonna sing a song with words that say I love you, babe
I say I need your love and need it bad, Oh deed I do
Now, it makes no difference what you do, I love you, babe
Well, I need your love, I need it bad, oh deed I doEmbed
