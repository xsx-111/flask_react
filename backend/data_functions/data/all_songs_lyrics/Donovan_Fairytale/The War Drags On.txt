The War Drags On Lyrics
Let me tell you the story of a soldier named Dan
Went out to fight the good fight in South Vietnam
Went out to fight for peace, liberty and all
Went out to fight for equality, hope, let's go
And the war drags on

Found himself involved in a sea of blood and bones
Millions without faces, without hope and without homes
And the guns they grew louder as they made dust out of bones
That the flesh had long since left just as the people left their homes
And the war drags on

They're just there to try and make the people free
But the way that they're doing it, it don't seem like that to me
Just more blood-letting and misery and tears
That this poor country's known for the last twenty years
And the war drags on

Last night poor Dan had a nightmare it seems
One kept occurring and re-occurring in his dream:
Cities full of people burn and scream and shoutin' loud
And right over head a great orange mushroom cloud
And there's no more war
For there's no more world
And the tears come streaming down
Yes, I lie crying on the groundEmbed
