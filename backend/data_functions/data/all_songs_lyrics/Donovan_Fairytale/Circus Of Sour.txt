Circus Of Sour LyricsCircus of Sour
Holds shows every hour
The lion is eating the bars, hey the bars
High wires erected
The poor man is expected
To climb to the stars
Balanced just on one knee
Look out your window and see
Look out your window and see
The clown chases spotlights
The bear faces hot lights
Pelted with peanuts and coke, hey the coke
And high in the tent-top
The lady just went up
To hang by a rope
From her teeth gracefully
Look out your window and see
Look out your window and see
Ba ba ba bom bom bom? da da da
Admission is paid up
Until you are laid up
There's only one catch to the fun, hey the fun
To hell if you're willin'
Your name's on the billing
And it seems that you're wanted
In ring number three
Look out your window and see
I look out my window and see
I look out my window and see, coa coaEmbed
