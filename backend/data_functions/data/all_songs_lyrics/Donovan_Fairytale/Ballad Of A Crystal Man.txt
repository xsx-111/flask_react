Ballad Of A Crystal Man LyricsWalk along and talk along and live your lives quite freely
But leave our children with their toys of peppermint and candy
For seagull I don't want your wings
I don't want your freedom in a lie
Your thoughts they are of harlequin, your speeches of quicksilver
I read your faces like a poem, kaleidoscope of hate words
For seagull I don't want your wings
I don't want your freedom in a lie
On the quilted battlefields of soldiers dazzling made of toy tin
The big bomb like a child's hand could sweep them dead just so to win
For seagull I don't want your wings
I don't want your freedom in a lie
As you fill your glasses with the wine of murdered negroes
Thinking not of beauty that spreads like morning sun-glow
Seagull I don't want your wings
I don't want your freedom in a lie
I pray your dreams of vivid screams of children dying slowly
And as you polish up your guns your real self be reflecting
For seagull I don't want your wings
I don't want your freedom in a lie
Vietnam, your latest game, you're playing with your blackest Queen
Damn your souls and curse your grins, I stand here with a fading dream
For seagull I don't want your wings
I don't want your freedom in a lieEmbed
