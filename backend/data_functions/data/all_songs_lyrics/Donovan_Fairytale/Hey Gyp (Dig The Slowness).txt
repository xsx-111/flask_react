Hey Gyp (Dig The Slowness) LyricsI'll buy you a Chevrolet
Buy you a Chevrolet
I'll buy you a Chevrolet
Just give me some of your love
Just give me some of your love
Just give me some of your love, gal
Just give me some of your love
I don't want your Chevrolet
I don't want your Chevrolet, yeah
I don't want your Chevrolet
Just give me some of your love, man
Just give me some of your love
If you just give me some of your love, man
Just give me some of your love
I'll buy a Ford Mustang
I'll buy you a Ford Mustang
I'll buy you a Ford Mustang
Just give me some of your love now
If you just give me some of your love, man
Yes, just give me some of your love, man
If you just give me some of your love
I'll buy you a Cadillac
I'll buy you a Cadillac
I'll buy you a Cadillac
If you just give me some of your love, gal
If you just give me some of your love
If you just give me some of your love, gal
Just give me some of your love
I don't want your Cadillac car
'Cause you're all shiny black
I don't want your Cadillac
If you just give me some of your love, gal
If you just give me some of your love, gal
If you just give me some of your love, gal
If you just give me some of your love, gal
Well, I'll buy you sugar cube

If you just give me some of your love, gal
If you just give me some of your love, gal
If you just give me some of your love, gal
If you just give me some of your love, gal
I don't want to go for no trip
I don't want to go for no trip
