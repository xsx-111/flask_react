Who Would Leave Their Son Out in the Sun? Lyrics
It's time that all these things that I do, no matter what
Become things of the past
It's time that all these things that I wish I could forget
Join in the ranks
Of things I regret
But there aren't enough archangels in the sky to come down (and)
To make me feel right
I'm miserable whenever I think of it
And I think of it all the time
You could part their feathered wings and have your way with them
Just like you do to all of us, all the time
What point is there in pushing on
When all you push against is a brick wall?
Everyone spends some time on the cross
I just want to make sure it's not a total loss
So maybe I'll get tanned
And lose some weight while I wait
Everyone spends some time on the cross
I just want to make sure it's not a total loss
So, deny me three times
Or hurry up and fucking decide7Embed
