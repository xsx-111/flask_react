The River Lyrics
You are my river, keep on flowing through
You are my river, keep on flowing through
Filling my life with all of you
You are the freedom I've been searching for
You are the freedom I've been searching for

That's why I love you just for who you are
Oh, how I love you just for who you are

There will be hard times everyone must go through
Testing his love just to see if it's true
But the hard times will come, but they all pass away
I have seen the light in my life today

That's why I love you just for who you are

You are my river, keep on flowing
You are my river, keep on flowing
You are my river
Oh yeah, keep on flowing
Would you keep on flowing?
River, flowing river
Just, just keep on flowing
Just, just keep on flowing
Just, just keep on flowingEmbed
