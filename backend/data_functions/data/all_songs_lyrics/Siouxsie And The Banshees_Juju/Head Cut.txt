Head Cut LyricsThe head is the best part
My head cut, my woodcut
I saw you in the gallery
With your torso and family
A huge smiling central face
With eyes and lips cut out
But smiling and eating
Lots of other lips
A beautiful mask in plaster cast
Such a beautiful mask in plaster cast
Can I take it back with me?
Back to the flat with me?
Can I take it back with me?
Back to the flat with me?
Oh severed head
I'll feed your head with bread
And paint your lips bright red
I'll keep it fresh on ice
It will look very nice
Can I take it back with me
Back to the flat with me
Can I take it back with me
Back to the flat with me
Shrunken heads under the bed
The flies are humming
There's a red under the bed
The spit is turning, roasting burning
Shadows dancing by the fire
Flickering flames laugh with desire
The head is the best part
My head cut, my woodcut
The head is the best part
My head cut, my woodcut
Can I take it back with me
Back to the flat with me
Can I take it back with me
Back to the flat with me
Can I take, can I take it, can I take it
Back with me
Back to the flat with me
Back with me
Back to the flat with me
Can I take, can I take it, can I take it
Back with me
Back to the flat with me
Can I take, can I take it, can I take it
Back with me
Back to the flat with me
Back with me
Back to the flat with me
Back with me
Back to the flat with me1Embed
