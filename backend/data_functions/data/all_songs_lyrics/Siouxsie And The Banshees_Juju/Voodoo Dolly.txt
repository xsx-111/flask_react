Voodoo Dolly LyricsShe's your little voodoo dolly
And she's gonna make you lazy
Like the little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear
And now she's transfixed in your fear
And you know she's gonna stay there
Because her nails are deep in your hair
And she made you so unaware
Are you listening to your fear?
The beat is coming nearer
Like that little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear
She's such an ugly little dolly
And she's making you look very silly
When you listen in to her ear
You get paralyzed with her fear
Oh, down, down, down, down in your fear
Down, down, down, down in your fear
Now this little voodoo dolly
Has made you very lazy
You're anaemic from her sucking
And when you're dead, she'll find another
Better break that little dolly
And sling her in the corner
Now she's a sorry little dolly
Such a sorry little dolly
Are you listening to your fear?
The beat is coming nearer
Like that little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, Listen, listen, listen to your fear
Listen, listen
Lis-listen, lis-listen, lis-listen
Listen, listen, listen to your fear
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
(Listen to your fear
Listen to your fear)
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen to your fear, oh
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
She, she, she, she
She, she, she, she
She, she, she, she
She's your little voodoo dollyEmbed
