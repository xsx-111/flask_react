Into the Light LyricsInto the line I see it fine
Into the line our hearts entwine
Remember when, your time again
Remember when, your time again
Standing in the light, always sitting on the line
Never on a side, always wanting to be right
Standing in the light I never wanted to be right
Now I'm attracted by the light and blinded by the sight
Into the light, into the light
Into the light, into the light
Into the light I see it fight
Into the light a new horizon
Bleached into white, kept out of sight
Bleached into white, kept out of sight
Standing in the light, always sitting on the line
Never on a side, pushing out the light
Standing in the light I never wanted to be right
Now I'm attracted by the light and blinded by the sight
Remember when, your time again
Remember when, your time again
Into the line, I see it fine
Into the line our hearts entwine
Remember when, your time again
Remember when, your time again
Dead ahead in the night burning in the light
And knowing that it's right, driving in the night
Dead ahead in the night burning in the light
And knowing that it's right driving in the night
Remember when, your time again
Remember when, your time again
Into the light, into the light
Into the light, into the light
Into the light, into the light
Into the light, into the light
Into the light, into the light1Embed
