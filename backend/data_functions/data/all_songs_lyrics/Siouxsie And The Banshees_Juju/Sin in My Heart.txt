Sin in My Heart LyricsSin in my heart, sin in my heart
Sin in my heart, sin in my heart
Sin in my heart, flying like a dart
Oh, sin in my heart
It's beginning to start, it's beginning to start
It's beginning to start, when you're lying like a tart
Oh, sin in my heart when you grovel at my feet
Oh, sin in my heart, it's short and sweet
Sin in my heart, sin in my heart
Sin in my heart, sin in my heart
Swift as a dart, sin in my heart
Oh, sin in my heart
When you grovel at my feet keep it short and sweet
Sin in my heart, sin in my heart
Sin in my heart, sin in my heart
Oh, ohEmbed
