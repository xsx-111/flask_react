Halloween Lyrics
The night is still
And the frost, it bites my face
I wear my silence like a mask
And murmur like a ghost

"Trick or treat", "trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet
"Trick or treat", "trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet

The carefree days are distant now
I wear my memories like a shroud
I try to speak, but words collapse
Echoing, echoing

"Trick or treat", "trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet
"Trick or treat", "trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet

I wander through your sadness
Gazing at you with scorpion eyes
Halloween, Halloween
A sweet reminder in the ice-blue nursery
Of a childish murder of hidden lustre and she cries

"Trick or treat", "trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet
"Trick or treat", "trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet

I wander through your sadness
Gazing at you with scorpion eyes
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, HalloweenEmbed
