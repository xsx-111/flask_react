Monitor LyricsMonitor outside
For the people inside
A prevention of crime
A passing of time
They come and they go
It's a passing of time
They come and they go
Whilst we sit in our homes
Sit back and enjoy
The real McCoy
Our new air of authority
Our sentinel of misery
His face was full of intent
And we shook with excitement
Then the victim stared up
Looked strangely at the screen as if her pain was our fault
But that's entertainment
What we crave for inside
No more second rate movies
From those people outside
Monitor outside
For the people inside
A prevention of crime
A passing of time
A monitor outside
A monitor outside
They come and they go
It's a passing of time
They come and they go
Whilst we sit in our homes
Sit back, sit back, sit back
Sit back and enjoy
The real McCoy
Our new air of authority
Our sentinel of misery
Monitor outside
(His face was full of intent)
Monitor outside
(And we shook with excitement)
Monitor outside
(Then the victim stared up)
Monitor outside
Looked strangely at the screen as if her pain was our fault
But that's entertainment
What we crave for inside
No more second rate movies
From those people outsideEmbed
