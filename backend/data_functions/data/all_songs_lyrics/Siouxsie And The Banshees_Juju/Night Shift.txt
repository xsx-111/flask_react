Night Shift LyricsOnly at night time, I see you
In darkness, I feel you
A bride by my side
I'm inside many brides
Sometimes I wonder
What goes on in your mind, always silent and kind
Unlike the others
Fuck the mothers kill the others
Fuck the others kill the mothers
I'll put it out of my mind because
I'm out of my mind with you
In heaven and hell with you
My Night Shift sisters
Await your nightly visitor
They don't bother me, no
No they don't bother me
The cold marble slab submits at my feet
With a neat dissection
Looking so sweet to me
Please come to me
With your cold flesh, my cold love
Hissing, not kissing
A happy go lucky chap, always dressed in black
He'll come to you, he'll come to you
My Night Shift sisters
With your nightly visitor
A new vocation in life, my
My love with a knife
Fuck the mothers kill the others
Fuck the others kill the mothers
I'll put it out of my mind 'cause
I'm out of my mind with you
In heaven and hell with you
I'm out of my mind with you
They don't bother me, no
They don't bother me, no
Night shift sisters
With your nightly visitor
Night shift
Waiting for the night shift
Night shift
Waiting for the night shift
Waiting for the night shift
Waiting for the night shift1Embed
