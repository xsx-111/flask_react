Special Care LyricsYou there in the corner
Staring at me
Do you think I'm blowing my cool
Playing the fool?
You there in the window
Staring at me
Do you think I'm trouble?
Would you like to shoot me down?
(Shoot me down, down, down, down)
Now, now, now, special care
(Special care)
Has been taken
To make you aware
(Special Care)
You're forsaken
If you don't care
(Special Care)
They're gonna come burn your house down
(Burn it down, down, down, down)
Woaaaaa. Wooooaaaaaa
(Guitar Magic)
Ooaaaa
(Special Care)
Oo-hoo-hoo
(has been taken to make you aware)
Oo-hooooo
(You're forsaken. If you don't care)
Ohh-huh, they're gonna come and burn it down
Down, oh, yeah, oh yeah, oh, do it, do it, do it
(Special Care)
(Special Care)
(Special Care)
