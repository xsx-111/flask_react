Thinking of You LyricsYou, thinking of you
Afraid to make you mine, and cross the line
It's true, being with you
I need you more each day, in every way
I do
What can I say?
I want to run the other way
Lovin's such a game
Lovin's such a game
I've been here before
But I keep rushing back, wanting more and more
Fanning the flame
I wonder how we met, as I forget your name
What can I do?
I need to love more than I need you
Lovin's such a game
Lovin's such a game
Right or wrong, it's beautiful
To laugh and love and feel this way
Take it any way
Take it any way
Thinking of you
You, thinking of you
Dancing through the day in that special way
You do leave me with more
Than I've ever felt or given up before
What can I say?
I want to run the other way
Lovin's such a game
Lovin's such a game
Lovin's such a game
Thinking of youEmbed
