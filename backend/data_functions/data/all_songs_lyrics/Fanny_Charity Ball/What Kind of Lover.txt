What Kind of Lover LyricsWhat kind of a lover do you think you are?
You drink me dry, then you tell me you're thirsty
You get me thinking I'm a superstar
Then you try hard as you can to hurt me
You're making me lose my mind
What kind of a lover do you think you are?
What friend in trouble do you think you'd be?
You put me down, then you tell me you need me
You get me living in a fantasy
Then you come 'round and I let you bleed me
You're driving me past my prime
What kind of a lover do you think you are?
(Tell me)
People say you love me
You talk about me all time
I want one straight answer
You ain't making like a friend of mine
Oh no, nah
I ain't gonna let you get too far
(Some lover, some kind of lover now)
(Some lover, some kind of lover now)
You're running me out of time
What kind of a lover do you think you are?
If I said you love me
Talk about me all the time
I want one straight answer
You ain't making like a friend of mine
Oh no, nah
I ain't gonna let you get too far
(I ain't gonna let you do it to me now)
You're driving me up the wall
What kind of a lover do you think you are?
You drink me dry, then you tell me you're thirsty
You get me thinking I'm a superstar
Then you try hard as you can to hurt me (Sure do)
You're making me lose my mind
What kind of a lover do you think you are?
(Some lover, some kind of lover now)
(Some lover, some kind of lover now)
You're making me lose my mind
What kind of a lover do you think you are?Embed
