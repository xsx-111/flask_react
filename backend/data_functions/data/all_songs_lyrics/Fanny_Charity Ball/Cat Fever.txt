Cat Fever LyricsWell there's a new element
Around the neighborhood
And the old ones don't approve
And so the word's being sent
And it is understood
That the young ones got to move
They got to keep their influential name
They're not allowing us to stake a claim
It isn't whether you can play the game, believe me
It's whether you shine your shoes
Well I was home alone
When they told me about your arrival
On the tube
And I was glad to know
That the rumors about your survival
Weren't true
But now they're calling you a superstar
You're on the air no matter where they are
It isn't whether you can play guitar, believe me
It's whether you make the news
I threw a penny down the well
So I could find out
Why I was turning for the worse
You put me under such a spell
It blew my mind out
And now I'm burning - call a nurse
'Cause I believe I'm gonna fade away
They will be coming for me any day
There's nothing more that I can do or say, believe me
I've certainly got the blues
(Oh yes I do)
I got the fever
Sure got the fever
Cat fever
Cat fever
