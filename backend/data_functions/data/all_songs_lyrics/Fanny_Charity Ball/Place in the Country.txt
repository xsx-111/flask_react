Place in the Country Lyrics
Standing on a hilltop
Wishing on a quick star
Enemies all around me
Got to make a rest stop
Wonder where my friends are
It's about time they found me

Well, I'm caught in the middle of a shooting war
Can't even gather what I'm fighting for
Hate to imagine what they got in store
Somebody put the heat on me
Who could it be now?
Who could it be?

Stranded by the seaside
Waiting out the high tide
Taking a short vacation
Wading through the hot crowd
Laughing at 'em out loud
Crying in desperation

Well, I'm caught in the current and I'm going down
Ain't got a will and I'm about to drown
Hope they can forward all my bags to town
Somebody wants to blow my mind
They're doing fine now
Doing so fine
All I need is some time to myself
And a place in the country (Place in the country)
Now, that's what I got to find myself (Place in the country)

All I need is some time to escape
And a place in the country (Place in the country)
Now, that's what I need (Place in the country)
I got to find me (Place in the country)
I just got to find me (Place in the country)
Baby, do be telling now, huh
