A Person Like You LyricsYou ain't the kind of friend
I'd like to take home to my mother
She wouldn't understand
Someone I could love like a brother
And me, I must admit
You are not like any other
Yeah, I have never known a person like you
When I come home at night
You're always there waitin' for me
Climb in, turn out the lights
And tell me a bedtime story
And me, I feel so right
I know I don't have to worry
It comes easy with a person like you
My folks say they're doubting your intention
You don't live according to convention
That's all right, I can make it with a friend like you
My folks say I've lost my inhibition
We're not in the usual position
That's all right, I can take it with a friend like you
True, I don't understand
What comes as your motivation
But when you take my hand
We make a good combination
And if the laughter's canned
I won't complain to the station
I can take it from a person like you
You're not the kind of friend
I'd like to take home to my mother
She wouldn't understand
Someone I could love like a brother
And me, I must admit
You are not like any other
Yeah, I have never known a person like you
I have never known a person like you
