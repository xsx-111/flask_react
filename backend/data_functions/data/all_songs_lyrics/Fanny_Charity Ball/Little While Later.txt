Little While Later LyricsA little while later we drifted off to sleep
Still puzzled by our conversation
Been a long time talking
I was getting in too deep
Maybe just too far above my station
You tried to tell me a fairy tale or two
In twisted words beyond my reason
Your coach is waiting
There's nothing I can do
And I think it's time that you were leaving
It's not like you give me the only thing I need
Nor yet the only love I've tasted
But I'd mistaken the plans you had for me
And it's a shame to see them wasted
Ooh - And I ain't got a hand to guide me
Ooh - And I ain't got a friend beside me
And I do need a place to hide me
From all of the troubles that bother my head
For some time lately I've been noticing a change
In the way you feel about me
Doesn't bother me greatly, no, it isn't very strange
I knew you'd learn to do without me
You say you want me to give some time to you
To set your thoughts a little straighter
I do believe you, believe me, yes I do
But I would like to see you later
Ooh - And I ain't got a hand to guide me
Ooh - And I ain't got a friend beside me
And ain't got a friend to hide me
From all of the troubles that bother my head
A little while later we drifted off to sleep
Still puzzled by our conversation
Been a long time talking
I was getting in too deep
Maybe just too far above my station
Ooh - And I ain't got a hand to guide me
Ooh - And I ain't got a friend beside me
Ooh - And ain't got a friend to hide me (oh, no, no)
Ooh - And ain't got a hand to guide me
Ain't got a friend to guide me
Ooh - Ain't got a friend to hide me
Ain't got a hand to guide meEmbed
