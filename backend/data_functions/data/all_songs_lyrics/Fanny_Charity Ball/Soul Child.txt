Soul Child LyricsBaby come easy
She's been around for a long time
Don't try to please her
She'll bring you down at the wrong time
Well she says she won't but you know she will
'Cause she's going to school on her daddy's bill
And she knows she's cool 'cause she's on the pill
You better
Look out, girl
You got to learn how to get along in this world
Go on and play, girl
Taking a swing on a slide
What do you say, girl
How does it feel on the inside?
Well she keeps a stash that she's got for free
Doesn't need the cash, doesn't pay the fee
Thinks it's gonna last 'cause she's got the key
You better
Look out, girl
You got to learn how to get along in this world
Look out, girl
Look out, girl
Look out, girl (Hey)
Look out, girl (Hey)
Baby don't know it
She's gonna pay for the high time
Tries not to show it
But she's unable to buy time
Well she sells her sweets and she names her price
But between the sheets she's as cold as ice
And the ones who know never come back twice
You better
Look out, girl
You got to learn how to get along in this world
Look out, girl
Look out, girl
Oh, look out, girl
Hmm, look out, girl
Whoa, look out, girl
Look out, girl
Oh, look out, girl
Look out, girlEmbed
