Gloomy Sunday LyricsSunday is gloomy my hours are slumberless
Dear is the shadows I live without
None the less little white flowers will
Never awaken you not where the
Black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever
Returning you would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday
Gloomy Sunday
Gloomy Sunday
Sunday is gloomy with shadows I
Spend it all my heart and I
Have decided to end it all soon they'll
Be candles and prayers that are said
I know let them not weep let them
Know I'm glad to go
Death is no dream for in death I'm
Caressing you with the last breath
Of my soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming I was only dreaming
I awake and I find you asleep
In the deep of my heart dear
Darling I hope that my
Dream never haunted you
My heart's telling you
How much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday
Gloomy Sunday
Gloomy Sunday
