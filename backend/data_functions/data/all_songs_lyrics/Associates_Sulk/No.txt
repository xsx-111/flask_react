No LyricsTore my hair out from the roots
Planted them in someone's garden
Then I waited for the shoots
Then I waited for the shoots
Bit my nails down to the quick
Worrying myself sick about you
Tearing facial marks in bed
What kind of sequel is this that you dread
Tear a strip from your dress
Wrap my arms in it
Tear a strip from your dress
Wrap my arms in it
Shaved and cut myself again
Should have let it slip down further
Crushing sour stones taste sour
Every minute hears a medal
No no no no
Tear a strip from your dress
Wrap my arms in it
Wrap my arms in it
Tear a strip from your dress
Wrap my arms wrap my arms in itEmbed
