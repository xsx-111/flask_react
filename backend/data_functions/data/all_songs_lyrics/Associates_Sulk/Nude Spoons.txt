Nude Spoons LyricsI wrote a note and dug it underground
I dug it underground
I found a tool to scrape away the soil
I found a wooden soil
It lies there canistered for future reference
It lies there canistered
It lies there canistered for future reference
It lies there canistered with nude spoons Euphoria
I found a coin a washed away the silt
I found a shiny coin
A coin whose head was slightly to the tilt
Who'd leave it there in there in guilt/silt
It skimmed itself into the silvery Tay
Deep into the Tay
It's aging happing silvery in the Tay
It is still there today with nude spoons
Euphoria it lies there with nude spoons Euphoria
Just forget about it
Just forget about it
Just forget about
Nude spoons Euphoria
Nude spoons Euphoria
Nude spoons Euphoria
I'm glad I had this vital heart attack
It clears psoriasis
I'm glad I had this vital heart attack
It makes me want to
Wrote a note and dug it underground
I dug it underground
I found a tool to scrape away the soil
I found a wooden soil
It lies there canistered for future reference
It lies there canistered
It lies there canistered for future reference
It lies there canistered with nude spoons Euphoria
Just forget about it
Just forget about it
Just forget about
Nude spoons Euphoria
Nude spoons Euphoria
Nude spoons EuphoriaEmbed
