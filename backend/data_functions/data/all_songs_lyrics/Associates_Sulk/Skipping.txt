Skipping LyricsDoors lead to other doors
Roads lead to other roads
They are simple they just happen
They are simple they take care of themselves
They are simple they just happen to be there
Embarrassed try one too
Whatever times left of day
Marvelous lousy could this be your safest way
Ancestral in its own deficiency a deficit of skipping
Skipping
Skipping I left you there skipping
Ripping ropes from the Belgian wharfs
Breathless Beauxillous griffin once removed seemed dwarfed
They're simple in that they happen to be there
Embarrassed try one too
Whatever times left of day
Marvelous lousy could this be your safest way
Ancestral in its own deficiency a deficit of skipping
Skip skip skipping
Skipping skipping
Skipping skipping
Skipping skipping
Skipping skipping
Skipping I left you there
Skipping I left you there
Skipping I left you there
Skipping skippingEmbed
