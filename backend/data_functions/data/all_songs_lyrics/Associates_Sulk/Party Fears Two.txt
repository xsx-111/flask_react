Party Fears Two Lyrics
I'll have a shower and then phone my brother up
Within the hour, I'll smash another cup
Please don't start saying that, or I'll start believing you
If I start believing you, I'll know that this party fears two

And, what if this party fears two?
The alcohol loves you while turning you blue
View it from here, from closer to near
Awake me!

Don't turn around. I won't have to look at you
And what's not found is all that I see in you
My manners are failing me. I'm left feeling ugly
And you say it's wonderful to live with: I never will

So, what if this party fears two?
The alcohol loves you while turning you blue
View it from here, from closer to near
Awake me!

I'm standing still and you say I dress too well
Still standing still: I might but it's hard to tell
Even a slight remark makes nonsense and turns to shock
Have I done something wrong
"What's wrong"s the wrong that's always been wrong
I'll have a shower
And then phone my brother up
Within the hour
I'll smash another cup1Embed
