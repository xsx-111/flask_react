Bap De La Bap LyricsBap de la bap it's a milestone around your neck
Bap de la bap is checking who in retrospect
Crrunching and chewing its way into the bone
Congealing itself with a toy from a splintered home
Bap de la bap it's an animal
Bap de la bap with its left foot off
Bap de la bap it follows you around
Bap de la bap it splutters and it coughs
It splutters and it coughs
It splutters and it coughs
It's not your fault if you're seeing it stripped and bared
Vasco de Gama only travelled with intent to stare
A burst of hunger leaves it feeling satisfied
A labrador sits on the bed
With its tsetse tied
Bap de la bap it's an animal
Bap de la bap with its left foot off
Bap de la bap it follows you around
Bap de la bap it splutters and it coughs
It splutters and it coughs
It splutters and it coughs
How does an antelope feel when it's getting chased
The same as a man with a geiger pointing in his face
Bap de la bap disregards all intelligence
Bap de la bap runs througgh us like a barded wire fence
Bap de la bap it's an animal
Bap de la bap with its left foot off
Bap de la bap it follows you around
Bap de la bap it splutters and it coughs
It splutters and it coughs
It splutters and it coughs
It splutters and it coughs
