Lay Low LyricsWell I probably should be
Drug out to sea
I can't hurt no one
And no one can hurt me
At least I'd be free
And probably I'd see
What caused me to be so detached completely
Jumpin' rope
Through a thick cloud of smoke
Fumblin' through all of the letters and notes
The ones that you wrote
Do they keep me afloat
Or just wrap around my throat like a noose on a rope?
(Probably both)

So lay low
Baby
I won't be back anytime soon
If it gets too lonely
I will follow you around in this tune
I don't know what to do
What I'd do if I knew
But we go through our day
And get by, and get through
But my heart is with you
You probably knew your love is like glue

So lay low
Baby
Just for a little while more
If you can't keep waiting
I will find my way back to your doorEmbed
