This Means War LyricsWell I had an awful dream
Laid your bones by a shallow stream
And I carved your name in a willow tree
And I beat the ground
With water clear and sun abright
I let the tears alone to dry
I raise my arms up to the sky
And I challenge God
He had no prose
He had no right
To take my dove, my little light
Half of my soul, half of my sight
My beatin' heart, my precious wife
Have you no answers?
I'll follow you no more
I'm on my own
This means war
When I awoke
When I came to
My whole perspective was brand new
I made a vow, and I keep it true
Hold very close what's given you
Keep very close what's given to youEmbed
