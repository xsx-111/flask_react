Vibrating right out of my skin
Pounding on the butcher's wall
Somebody come and let me in

Carrying a rolling pin
But your man's got a secret
But she knows where he been

And it'll be a long time before the sun shines on Shank Hill Street again
You see early in the morning
Before the warm wind of the dawn

Like a heartbeat in the air

With a handshake like a hammer and a suicide grin
That wooden door creaked open
And the butcher man let me in
Yes, just like that he let me in
But I wasted not a minute
I was on him like a whip
And for one last minute he'd feel that hot red drip
Drip, drip, ...
