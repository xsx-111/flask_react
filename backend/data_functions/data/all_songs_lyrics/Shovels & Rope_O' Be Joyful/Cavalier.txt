Cavalier Lyrics
She was a live wire, she was stuck in the past
I was holding the middle, you was waking up fast
It was four in the morning, she's holding on tight
To a David Bowie lookalike, circa '85

Now he's turning up his amplifier, staring at his toes
Even when he's looking at you, he's still looking down his nose
Sounds like surf music maybe more than just a little
But to me it's just another form of California dribble
Keep the top and bottom straight and keep it shaky in the middle

Well there's something to be learned here
Though it may seem a little insincere
Like a cruel clown grinning ear to ear
You're a country singer, I'm a cavalier

Well I wanna know the whole story over
Where you came from, where you going
However long it takes to know you
With your heavy metal heartbeat
Salty but you seem sweet
Tippy toes on both feet
Rockin' to the teen beat
Well, ice cream, soda pop, bourbon on top
Some people call it rock and roll, and some people call it pop
Sounds like country music every time you use a fiddle
How am I supposed to know if that's a fact or just a riddle?
Keep tight around the edges, leave a little room to wiggle

Well there's something to be learned here
Though it may seem a little insincere
Like a cruel clown grinning ear to ear
You're a country singer, I'm a cavalier
Oh

Well there's something to be learned here
Though it may seem a little insincere
Like a cruel clown grinning ear to ear
You're a psycho killer, I'm a cavalierEmbed
