Hail Hail LyricsHail, hail Rock and Roll
Well, hail, hail Rock and Roll!
Well, hail, hail Rock and Roll!
I love you till you slit my throat and swallow me whole
You're a bad, bad boy
With a selfish little soul
Rock and Roll
Can't put my finger on exactly what it is that you stole
You like it low, lower than I thought that I could ever go
You took my deep, red heart
To a deep, dark hole
Rock and Roll
Bop, bop, bop!
Oh, oh, oh!
Hail, hail, thirty-three
Well, hail, hail thirty-three!
Well, hail, hail thirty-three!
Your violent hiss sounds so sweet to me
You got a copperhead kiss
Hidden up your sleeve
Thirty-three
You'd burn me down like an old oak tree
You wanna turn my love into an enemy
You mighta fooled everybody
But you won't fool me
Thirty-three
Bop, bop, bop!
Oh, oh, oh!
Bop, bop, bop!
Oh, oh, oh!
Bop, bop, bop!
Oh, oh, oh!
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Well, hail, hail wrecking ball!
Well, hail, hail wrecking ball!
When it gets out of control I'm gonna give you a call
Have you come down here
Make some sense of it all
Wrecking ball
It woulda got filled up, it woulda got too tall
It's breathin' up your neck and burnin' down you hall
It took years in the makin'
Just a second to fall
Wrecking ballEmbed
