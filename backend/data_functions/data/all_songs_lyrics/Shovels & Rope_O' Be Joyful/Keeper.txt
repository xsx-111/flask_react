Keeper LyricsWell Lulu's by the river and she got herself a good good man
Spent half a year offshore in ole Alabam'
Her friends said she should leave him and come join them in the west coast sand
But she knows she's got a keeper and they'll never really understand, understand
She put a line in the water when the sun comes up
Starts drinking when its going down
Dancing all alone to the radio till her man come back around
She might go down to Pensacola, maybe lay out on the old Gulf Shore
But she don't go to bars at home without him anymore
She don't care about what they say, she don't listen anyway
All the roughneck rounders playing cards around the TV set
Waiting around for something hasn't happened yet
Joking with a dancer she said "I could help you to forget"
But he knows he's got a keeper so he smiles and lights a cigarette and tips his hat
He put his head on the pillow when the sun comes up
Starts working when its going down
Melting hot steel down in Bienville just waiting on the turnaround
He starts thinking about Pensacola, he could be fishing on the old Gulf Shore
But he don't like to do those things without her anymore
He don't care about what they say, man he don't listen anyway
They put their lines in the water when the sun comes up
Start drinking when it's going down
Dancing real slow to the radio cause her man come back around
They might go down to Pensacola, do a little fishing on the old Gulf Shore
But they don't like to stay out all night the way they did before
They don't care about what they say, she never listens anywayEmbed
