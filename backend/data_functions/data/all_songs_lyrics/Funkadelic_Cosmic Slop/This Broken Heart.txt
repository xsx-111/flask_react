This Broken Heart LyricsAre you mad, at me, darling?
Are you sorry that we, we, we met?
Have you learned to love another?
Has he told you to for, for-for-forget
But no other heart can love you
Like this broken heart
Of mine
{spoken}
Yeah, I've been diggin' on your vibes lately
Yes, and you've been finding more faults
Than Carter got liver pills
And I'm hip to all that Gemini material laying around, heh
And I ain't no Gemini
I just want to make sure you ain't half-steppin', and short-strokin'
Can you get to that?
{sung}
Well, no other heart can love you
Like this broken heart of mine
Like this broken heart
Of mineEmbed
