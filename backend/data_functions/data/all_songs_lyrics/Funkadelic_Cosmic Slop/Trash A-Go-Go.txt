Trash A-Go-Go LyricsYour honor
I didn't do it
I didn't pimp her just for money
What's wrong with making her call me daddy?
Your honor
I didn't do it
Oh, your honor
She is lying
I don't care what she said
I didn't make her sell head
Your honor
I didn't do it
The judge and jury just frowned at me
They said, "For exploiting your lady
Just for a payday
Is a sin, and you will pay."
When getting over is high above your head
And gettin' high can get you dead
What are you supposed to do?
I didn't pimp her to support my high
Pick up my car and keep me fly
No, your honor
I did not do it
The judge and jury still frowned (Your honor)
And said, ah, "Ten to twenty."
Your honor
I still did not do it
Your honor
I still did not do it
Your honorEmbed
