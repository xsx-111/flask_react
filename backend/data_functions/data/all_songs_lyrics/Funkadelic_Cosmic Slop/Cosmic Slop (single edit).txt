Cosmic Slop (single edit) LyricsAaaaaaaaaah hear my mother call
Aaaaaaaaaah hear my mother call
I was one of five born to my mother
An older sister and three young brothers
We seen it hard
We seen it kinda rough
But always with a smile
She was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough
I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
And at night I hear her call
All the night I hear her call
"Father, Father it's for the kids
Any and everything I did
Please please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong...
Lord knows I meant no wrong."
Then the devil sang:
Would you like to dance with me?
We're doing the cosmic slop
Would you like to dance with me?
We're doing the cosmic slop
Would you like to dance with me?
We're doing the cosmic slop
She was well known through the ghettos
Tricks would come and then they go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile
She was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell
Hey
Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Late at night I hear her call
To the lord I hear her call
She says "Father, Father it's for the kids
Any and everything I did
Please please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong..."
Lord
Oh oooooh oh hear my mother call
Oh oooooh oh hear my mother call
She said "Father, Father it's for the kids
Any and everything I did
Please don't judge me too strong"
Hear my mother call
Hear my mother call
Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Hey

I can hear my mother call
Hey
Oh yeah alright yeah I hear her man
Hey hey hey hey heeeey
Hear my mother call

Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Late at night

Call on the Lord
