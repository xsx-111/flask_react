Hole In My Pocket (1989)
I got a hole in my pocket and I can’t go to the fair
I got a hole in my pocket and I can’t go to the fair
Well I’m blue cause I gotta take and meet my baby there
Well if I don’t show up what’ll my baby do?
But when I don’t show up what’ll my baby do?
She’ll travel through the Tunnel Of Love with somebody new
Well ooh, ooh, ooh what will I do?
My money’s all gone and maybe baby is too
I got a hole in my pocket and I don’t know what to do
I got a hole in my pocket and my money just runs on through
I got a hole in my pocket and my money just runs on through
Can’t seem to save a dollar like my baby kind-a wants me to
Yeah I told my baby we could have a little fun tonight
Yeah I told my baby we could have a little fun tonight
Well it won’t be so funny when there ain’t a bit of money in sight
Well ooh, ooh, ooh what will I do?
My money’s all gone and maybe baby is too
I got a hole in my pocket and I don’t know what to do
Well ooh, ooh, ooh what will I do?
My money’s all gone and maybe baby is too
I got a hole in my pocket and I don’t know what to do
Yeah I got a hole in my pocket and I don’t know what to doEmbed
