The Glow of Love Lyrics
Flower's bloomin', morning dew
And the beauty seems to say
It's a pleasure when you treasure
All that's new and true and gay
Easy living and we're given
What we know we're dreaming of
We are one having fun
Walking in the glow of love
Walking, ooh, whoa, ho...oh...whoa...

Smiling faces, going places
It's a wonder, it's so clear
By a fountain, climbing mountains
As we'll hold each other near
Sipping wine, we try to find
That special magic from above
As we share our affair
Talking in the glow of love
Oh, oh, ooh...
In the glow of love
Ooh...ooh...ooh...
(Here in glow of love) You're a shining star
(Here in glow of love) No matter who you are
(Here in glow of love) So I want to let you know you move me, yeah, yeah
(Here in glow of love)
(There is no better way to be) Hold me, caress me
(I'm yours forever and a day) We are a sweet bouquet, oh hey
(Seasons for happiness are here) Can you feel it all around you?
(Reason we're filled with cheer is we're in rapture in the glow of love)
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh...oh yeah...

Finding meaning while we're dreaming
Of the splendor of it all
We're surrounded and abounded
Summer, winter, spring, and fall
All the people meeting people
Laughing, dancing 'til the dawn
And we'll always be like this glowing in the glow of love
Hey hey hey hey hey
In the glow of love
Ooh ooh...

(Here in glow of love) Gotta let you know you move me, yeah
(Here in glow of love) You really really do, yeah
(Here in glow of love) I gotta let you know you move me, yeah
(Here in glow of love)
(There is no better way to be) Honey, I...love you
(I'm yours forever and a day) We are a sweet bouquet
(Seasons for happiness are here) Happy, we're so happy
(Reason we're filled with cheer is we're in rapture in the glow of love)
Never lonely, with you only
Time will always be our friend
Reaching far to find a star
Our destiny is heaven-sent
Make it known, this loving tone
Will never part the two of us
We will always reminisce, kissing in the glow of love
In the glow of love
Flower's bloomin', morning dew
And the beauty seems to say
It's a pleasure when you treasure
All that's new and true and gay
Easy living when we're given
What we know we're dreaming of
We are one having fun
Walking in the glow of love, yeah...2Embed
