Searching Lyrics
Hit the town in the cold of the night
Looking 'round for the warmth of the light
There was fog on the road
So I guess no one saw me arriving
I was tired and awake for some time
Then my lights hit a welcoming sign
It said if you're alone
You can make this your home if you want to
Oh...

Searchin', searchin' (For so long)
Searchin' (Searchin')
Searchin', searchin' (I just wanted to dance)
Searching

Stepped outta the night
It was brighter inside
Someone come and asked me my name
Taken back by surprise
When I saw with my eyes
A girl in love's disguise

She said stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
Haven't got a lot
But play the part
Mister, stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
What I've got's hot stuff
The night is ours
Caught the glass as it fell from my hand
Like a child, couldn't quite understand
What was I doing there?
Far away from nowhere, on my own
I was tired and awake for some time
Just the light playing tricks with my mind
Was she there in a crowd?
Was the music too loud?
Was I dreaming?

Searchin', searchin' (For so long)
Searchin' (I don't want romance, I just want my chance today)
Searchin', searchin' (Yeah)
Searchin'

Just came by here by chance
Only wanted to dance
No news, no bye, no how, no why
Taken back by surprise
What's in front of my eyes
This girl in a love's disguise

She said stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
Haven't got a lot
But play the part
Hey there, mister, stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
What I've got's hot stuff
The night is ours
Searchin', searchin' (For so long)
Searchin' (Found someone)
Searchin', searchin'
Searchin'

She said stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
Haven't got a lot
But play the part
Hey there, mister, stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
Ooh, what I've got's hot stuff
The night is ours
She kept saying stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart (I just can't believe it, I really must be dreaming)

Hit the town in the cold of the night
Looking 'round for the warmth of the light
There was fog on the road
So I guess no one saw me arriving
I was tired and awake for some time
Then my lights hit a welcoming sign
It said if you're alone
You can make this your home if you want to, oh...
Searchin', searchin' (For so long)
Searchin' (Ooh ooh)
Searchin', searchin' (For so long)
Searching
(I just can't believe it, I sure must be dreaming)
Searchin', searchin'
Searchin' (I just wanna dance)
Searchin', searchin' (Yeah, yeah)
Searching

She said stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
Haven't got a lot
But play the part
Hey there, mister, stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
Ooh, what I've got's hot stuff
The night is ours
She said stop! stop! stop!
Get out your heart
(I just can't believe it, I sure must be dreaming)
Haven't got a lot
But play the part...Embed
