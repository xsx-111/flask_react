Mu Empire Lyrics
Mr. Shiver, I'm glad you sent a line
Euphoria's endearing
But it's cold
We might as well retire
To the drawer where all used things resign

Mr. Shiver, in the river
You were sold
You were told
I do, I do
If we make it over the mountain

Dressed in leather, red ball and vault attire
The most ironic place to be is easy, yeah
Between my finger and the blade, right before I let the used resign

Mr. Shiver, in the river
You were sold
You were told
I do, I do
If we make it over the mountain
You might lose the one you choose
You might lose who won you times ten2Embed
