Cosmopolitan Bloodloss Lyrics
Many ways, many days, many phases down the line
When people whisper, it makes her nervous
It's you from the airport, addressing most littlest
In several days, I just might prove worth it

So after all, after all
They let you decide?
After all, after all
They let you decide?

Anyways, in a way, walk the wire, walk the line
When people whisper, it makes her nervous
And it's you from the airport, addressing most littlest
Several days too late to unearth it

So after all, after all
They let you decide?
After all, after all
They let you decide?

We are the most impassioned ugly people
Ugly people, ugly people, say
We are the most impassioned ugly people
Ugly people, ugly people, say
After all, after all
They let you decide
After all, after all
They let you decide, yeah
After all, after all
They let you decide, hey
After all, after all
They let you decide3Embed
