El Mark Lyrics
Who the fuck wants to live forever?
Remorse..
When you stab me in the back
With your dream

To keep this body sober
I show my life for all to see
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
In a battle inside of my soul
Always better a fashion show
Than no show at all

Driving me crazy
You're driving me, you're driving me
You're driving me crazy
Your driving me insane

Be you, would it be you?

And when the runway rovers
Grease back their manes, for our own sake
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
In the battle inside of my soul
Always better a fashion show
Than no show at all
Driving me crazy
You're driving me, you're driving me
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me until
Blue as I write this
For you marked
Blue as I write this
Once more

Be you
Would it be you
Be you
Would it be you

Napalm the children
Napalm the children
You've got to learn
You've got to learn
You won't believe what your not told
You've got to feel, what you steal

Driving me crazy
You're driving me, you're driving me
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me until
Blue as I write this
For you marked
Blue as I write this
Once more
Be you
Would it be you?
Be you
Would it be you?Embed
