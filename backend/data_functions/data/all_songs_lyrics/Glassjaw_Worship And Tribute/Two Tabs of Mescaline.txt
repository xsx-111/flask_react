Two Tabs of Mescaline Lyrics
I smell the sound of a growing gash
With pop sensibilities
KQED
"It's a tune that equals you."
I feel
Hallelujah
I fail
Bulimia
I'm frail
Hallelujah
I fell
Salting the back of a snail

This is worship and this is tribute
Am I crumbling, ripping or failing?
Knowing you fit in

KQED
"It's a tune that equals you."
I fell
Hallelujah
I fail
Bulimia
I'm frail
Hallelujah
I fell
Salting the back of a snail
And am I worshiping or am I tributing?
Or am I crumbling, ripping or failing?
My Turkish prison is knowing I fit in

Feeding time
An old friend of mine
At the leper zoo
Que sera
Erotic hurrah
With no rescue, girl
Feeding time
An old friend of mine
At the leper zoo
Que sera
Erotic hurrah
It's cool
Be cool, girl
Sailor, sailor

Worship
Tribute
Crumbling, ripping and failing
Knowing you fit in
Feeding time
An old friend of mine
At the leper zoo
Que sera
Erotic hurrah
With no rescue, girl
Feeding time
An old friend of mine
At the leper zoo
Que sera
Erotic hurrah
It's cool
Be cool, girl
