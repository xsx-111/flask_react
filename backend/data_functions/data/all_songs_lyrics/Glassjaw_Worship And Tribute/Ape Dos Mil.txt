Ape Dos Mil Lyrics
Yeah, it's over
You can bet in mid-October
I will still be ranting 'bout most early May
Yeah, he's a winner
He's a goddamn sinner
While he dines, I'm on the wrong side of the day
And I said, "I don't understand why I'm fumbling after."
You're the reason I cannot forget this season
Or the letter when you first referred to it
And I said

"It's all calypso
But it's not easy to know
You walk around with your shoulders down frowning
It's not easy to know."

Yeah, it's over
You can bet when mid-October ends
I'll still be ranting 'bout most early May
See yeah, he's a winner
He's a goddamn sinner
While he dines, I'm on the wrong side of the day
And I said, "I don't understand why I'm fumbling after."
Yeah, you're the reason I cannot forget this season
Or the lesson how an ape shall not kill ape
And I said
"It's all calypso
But it's not easy to know
You walk around with your shoulders down frowning
It's not easy to know
It's just a tango
But it's not easy to show
I walk around with my horns out now
But it's not easy to know."
I am going under

You can't trust a man who's a governor
Ape can't trust man
You can't trust a man with a gun at all
Ape can't trust man
You can't trust man

"It's all calypso
But it's not easy to know
You walk around with your shoulders down frowning
It's not easy to know
It's just a tango
But it's not easy to show
I walk around with my horns out now
But it's not easy to show."
How could you heal if you don't ease back the blame?
Knowing you're right, won't you heal?
How could you heal if you don't ease back the blame?
Knowing you're right, won't you heal?2Embed
