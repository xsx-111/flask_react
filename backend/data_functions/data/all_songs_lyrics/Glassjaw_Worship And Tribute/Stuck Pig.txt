Stuck Pig Lyrics
Way down in this latrine, a nail bomb
In the city of Molotov
In the province of gun
In a route off the highway
In the land of two suns
Sometimes I get pissed when
My blow goes like a quickie in the snow
But I'm sure I'll go down inside

I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
On the seed of a bastard
Alone in the sun for sticking it in too long
On the feet of a dragon
Last last night the wind pipe's covered in hope
I pray it'd be covered in rope
Me, me, me
Grief, grief, grief
Beat the heat

I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
On the seed of a bastard
Alone in the sun for sticking it in too long
On the feet of a dragon
Last last night the wind pipe's covered in hope
I pray it'd be covered in rope
Way down in this latrine, a nail bomb
In the city of Molotov
In the province of gun
In a route off the highway
In the land of two suns
Sometimes I get pissed when
Grunt fuck
Grin fuck
Push her in the snow fuck
The dope fiend splashes gash like a nail bomb1Embed
