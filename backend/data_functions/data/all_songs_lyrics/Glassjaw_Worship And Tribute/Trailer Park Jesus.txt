Trailer Park Jesus Lyrics
Put the needle to the record
And hit me with your style
Soon enough, I'll learn to unload my mouth
Can't you see it's getting blacker?
The vibe up in this place
When I displaced what made me turn my face
I can't wait

I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball
Atom bomb

It was quite a dirty habit
When the last thing I do
Has a swine slewn
Down martyr avenue
Am I driftwood or hosanna?
I'm knee-deep in disease
I'm the body
Laid anonymously
On the beach, girl
On the beach
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball
Atom bomb
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball
Killed a shark

Denial is a river in Egypt
Division is a reunion in the south
Soon enough I'll learn to
Denial is a river in Egypt
Elusive as the communion in my mouth
Soon enough I'll learn to

I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball
Atom bomb

Tell the one about the man
Who dug out holes so deep
He lost sight of his word1Embed
