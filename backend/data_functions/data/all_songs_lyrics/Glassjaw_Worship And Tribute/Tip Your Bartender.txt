Tip Your Bartender Lyrics
Hit it one more
Time for our men in uniform with a price upon their heads
This is a war, sober up
You call it what you want, the color changes up in the sun

Not throwing stones at you anymore
Your name's in lights and I don't wonder anymore

All my exes live with hexes
This is why I hang
Myself with jealousy upon a fence post half mast
Fashion: war between the guilty and the guilty and the guilty and the guilty and the teens

Not throwing stones at you anymore
Your name's in lights and I don't wonder anymore

Oh yeah, I would like to see you die like mice do
I'm crying in the beer of a drunk man
I'm crying
Crying
Crying
Not throwing stones at you anymore
Your name's in lights and I don't wonder anymore

Yeah, I'd like to
Yeah, I'd like to die like fucking mice do
I'm crying in the beer of a drunk man
I'm crying in the beer of a drunk man
Fashion
Buy it
Load it
