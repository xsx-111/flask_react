Radio Cambodia Lyrics
I'm not impressed
I guess I'm not impressed
With which dialect, which dialect marches best
And who reaches heaven in what order
When our kids are baptized in mortar

It's a shame that our messiahs move their pawns from different mountains
And we're left to dance these bodies 'round the fountain
If a leader preaches worship to the sheep within the valley
Who'll be riding in a tank that says "just married"?

I'm not impressed
I guess I'm not impressed
With which dialect, which dialect marches best
We found that ultimately, you can make it snow in the summer

It's a shame that our messiahs move their pawns from different mountains
And we're left to dance these bodies 'round the fountain
If a leader preaches worship to the sheep within the valley
Who'll be riding in a tank that says "just married"?

Contrary to what you believe
We oscillate and vary speed
The food in jail is sulphury
How do Inuits spell relief?
Summer's trudging closer and a flurry of white as well
It's the heart of nuclear winter and I'm scared as hell

It's a shame that our messiahs move their pawns from different mountains
And we're left to dance these bodies 'round the fountain
If a leader preaches worship to the sheep within the valley
Who'll be riding in a tank that says "just married"?1Embed
