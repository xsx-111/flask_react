The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports Lyrics
And I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
A round and a bout down
I'm scared
To throne nowhere
And I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
A round and a bout down
I'm heir to throne nowhere

Here's where the train ride ends
Screaming, "Is this your decision?"
We were the best of friends
And I'll go nowhere

This isn't where
This isn't where I found you

And my life is such a ball that I run the world from city hall
And I knew you all
And my life is such a ball that I run the world from city hall
And I own you all
Here's where the train ride ends
Screaming, "Is this your decision?"
We were the best of friends
And I'll go nowhere

This isn't where
This isn't where I found you
In this Holiday Inn
This isn't where
This isn't where I found you
"Well, welcome back race fans
It's Cavalcade sport time again
Here at the jamboree
Home of the hits
How you doing, Bob?
It's the last stretch
And my heart... my heart stays in the lead
And we see first, second behind my heart is my mind
Third behind my mind is my body
Fourth behind my body is my soul
And my heart stays in the lead
Coming around the stretch
That was a good one, Bob."
No dutch

This isn't where
This isn't where I found you
In this Holiday Inn
This isn't where
This isn't where I found you
"Home is where the heart is..."
"On the bus!"Embed
