Pink Roses Lyrics
You like to carry my heart
In a bag that's broken
You're asking when do I stop?
When the bottle's empty
Blacker than my father's soul
Drunk enough to raise us all

Pink, pink
Roses, roses

Nomad
Drowning rat
Black, black
So black you can't even grasp the fact
Blacker than a beggar's soul
Rich enough to save us all
Lead with your need as God descends

Pink, pink
Roses, roses

Cold in the ground
What gets me this down?
The smell of magnesium
The smile of a clown
I want to drench you, stab you
Fuck you and film you

Pink, pink
Roses, roses

And if it ain't sold
Platinum or gold
This'll be the biggest lie you ever lived1Embed
