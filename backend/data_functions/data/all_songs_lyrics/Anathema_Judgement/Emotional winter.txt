Emotional winter Lyrics
Speak to me
For I have seen
Your waning smile
Your scars concealed
So far from home
Do you know you're not alone
Sleep tonight
Sweet summerlight
Scattered yesterdays
The past is far away

How fast time passed by
The transience of life

Wasted moments won't return
And we will never feel again

Beyond my dreams
Ever with me
You flash before my eyes
A final fading sigh
But the sun will (always) rise
And tears will dry
Of all that is to come
The dream has just begun
And time is speeding by
The transience of life

Wasted moments won't return
And we will never feel again3Embed
