Make It Right (F.F.S.) Lyrics
I know that I want you, I know that I need you
But I can't pretend that this'll make it right
You whisper your name but I can't hear you
Don't leave me behind, lend me your hand


I can feel them, I think they're closing in
Don't leave me behind, lend me your hand
Let me feel you by my side
Be where I can hear you, I long to feel
