Parisienne Moonlight LyricsI feel I know you
I don't know how, I don't know why
I see you feel for me
You cried with me, you would die for me
I know I need you
I want you to be free of all the pain you hold inside
You cannot hide
I know you tried to be who you couldn't be
You tried to see inside of me
And now I'm leaving you
I don't want to go away from you
Please try to understand
Take my hand
Be free of all the pain you hold inside
You cannot hide
I know you tried to feel...to feel...4Embed
