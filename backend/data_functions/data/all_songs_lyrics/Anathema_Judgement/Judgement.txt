Judgement LyricsThe inequity of fate
The pains of love and hate
The heart-sick memories
That brought you to your knees
And the times when we were young
When life seemed so long
Day after day
You burned it all away
All the hate that feeds your needs
All the sickness you conceive
All the horror you create
Will bring you to your kneesEmbed
