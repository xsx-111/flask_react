One Last Goodbye LyricsHow I needed you
How I grieve now, you're gone
In my dreams I see you
I'm awake, so alone
I know you didn't want to leave
Your heart yearned to stay
But the strength I always loved in you
Finally gave way
Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
And somehow I knew you could never, never stay
And in the early morning light after a silent peaceful night
You took my heart away and I grieve
In my dreams I can see you
I can tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can hold you
And it feels so real
I still feel the pain
I still feel your love
I still feel the pain
I still feel your love
And somehow I knew you could never, never stay
And somehow I knew you would leave me
And in the early morning light after a silent peaceful night
You took my heart away, oh I wish, I wish you could have stayed8Embed
