Pitiless Lyrics
Is it the emptiest of all your broken hearted feelings
A serious misconception to choose a path that led to ruin

I live for today
Can't get away from the burning inside
Ashes to ash - dust to dust

So quick to point the finger when you're the source of your condition
Why should I feel sympathy when you only show me nothing

I live for today
Can't get away from the burning inside
Ashes to ash - dust to dust

I could stare for a thousand years
Penetrate your deepest fears
Leave you cold with a faceless embrace
Then disappear without a trace

I live for today
Can't get away from the burning inside
Ashes to ash - dust to dustEmbed
