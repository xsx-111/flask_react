Jungle Man LyricsI'm the jungle man
That's what I am
I'm the jungle man
That's what I am
In the jungle
I'm the king
Of love
Jungle man
I'm the jungle man
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man
Got my home
Don't need to roam
The jungle is where I live
Peace and love and harmony is what I have to give
I'm friends with a monkey
I'm friends with a bird
I'm close with the lion
They all got the word
I'm the jungle man
That's what I am
In the jungle
I'm the king
Of love
Jungle man
I'm the jungle man
That's what I amEmbed
