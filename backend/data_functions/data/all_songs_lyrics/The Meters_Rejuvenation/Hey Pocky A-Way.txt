Hey Pocky A-Way LyricsLittle bitty boy, with a heart of steel
You can't boogie now but your sister sure will
Feel good music, I've been told
Good for your body and it's good for your soul
Gonna do it now
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Lie back grooving, riding in your car
Makes no difference where you are
Feel good music in your soul
Makes your body do a slow boogie roll
Let me hear you say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Big chief
Spy boy
Uptown ruler
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Huh
Big chief
Keep on grooving
Keep on getting
Lie back grooving, riding in your car
Makes no difference where you are
Feel good music, I've been told
Good for your body and it's good for your soul
Gonna get it now
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, pocky a-way
Uptown ruler
Bayou on the bayou
Everybody sing
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, pocky a-way
Hey, pocky a-wayEmbed
