Love Is for Me LyricsSkin so soft
Smile so new
It's all these things
I see in you
Hearts' so warm
And you're mind's so clear
It's things like these
I see in you my dear
I believe everything about you baby
(I believe x10)
So many things in you
To appreciate
Like an impatient child
I can hardly wait
My silent love (love) is goin' round?
Because of you girl
I'm so proud (baby)
It don't matter how foolish I might sound
It would be even more senseless not havin you around
I believe everything about you baby
(I believe x10)
Love is for me
You oughta' be
Right here in my loving arms
Please don't you wait
Don't hesitate
Turnin' on your love?
Turnin' on it mama
Give me your lovin' baby
I don't mean
To impose on you
Such a prize to my eyes
What else could I do
Help me climb the mountain
Of success
The cliff that leads
To your happiness
I believe everything about you baby
(I believe x7)
Love is for me
You oughta be
Right here in my lovin' arms
Please don't you wait
Don't hesitate
Turnin on your love
Lemme break it down
Let me love you baby
That's the part I wanna do
Give me your sweet, sweet sweet love
Got to give it to me
I really do love you (x2)
Said I know you're mine
Sweet sweet sweet lovin'Embed
