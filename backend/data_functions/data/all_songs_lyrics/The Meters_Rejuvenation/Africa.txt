Africa Lyrics
Aw, take me back
To the motherland
Take me back
Take me on back, yeah
To the motherland
I want to go
To the motherland, now children, huh
I want to go, I want to get up and go
Motherland, huh, man

(Africa)
Oh, Africa
(Africa)
Beautiful, huh
(Africa)
Oh, Africa
(Africa)
Huh

Ooo, take me back
(Take me back) 
To the motherland
Take me back
(Take me back) 
To the motherland
Where the woman is a woman
And the man is a man
Where a woman is your woman
And your man is your man

(Africa)
Oh, Africa, 
(Africa)
Huh
(Africa)
Oh, Africa
(Africa)
Sing it
God bless the child
Black as he could be
Africa's for me, yeah yeah
