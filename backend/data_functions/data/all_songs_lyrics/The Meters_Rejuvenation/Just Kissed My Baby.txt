Just Kissed My Baby Lyrics
I feel like a king
Cause I just kissed my baby
And money don't mean a thing to me, no
Cause I just kissed my baby
Feels so good, ha
Cause I just kissed my baby
Right, right, right, I'm no 
Cause I just kissed by baby, yeah
Well, well, well, well ya
I know I can't go wrong
All we ever do, ha
Is try to get along, yeah

I feel brand new
Cause I just kissed by baby, Lord have mercy
And I'm going back for number two
Cause I just kissed by baby
And I feel so doggone great
It just can't wait
Just kissed by baby
Me and my girl need to hibernate
Cause I just kissed by baby
Loose booty
Well, well, well
(Just kissed my baby) 
(Wait on)

I feel so good inside
Cause I just kissed my baby
Ooh lord, lord, lord, get it, get it
The power is on my side, that's right it is
Cause I just kissed by baby
Good 
Just kissed my baby 
Keep a-walking, keep a-moving
Just kissed my baby
Good God
Just kissed my baby Embed
