The Yearning Loins LyricsYou see that boy, so simply pale
All his dreams unspoken
Now in her arms, he'll quickly heal
The yearning loins have woken
Take out and wave
Your ankle socks
The white flags of surrender
She tried so hard not to let it show
But he's the first one, first one to know
He makes a vow to stay fancy free
But that's the last thing, last thing he'll be
She knows his name but she asks him who
That's the worst thing, worst thing to do
Sha-da-da-da-da-day
You college boy, you've read it all
All your questions loaded
Describe for me, the point at which
The yearning loins exploded
Take out and wave
Your ankle socks
The white flags of surrender
She tried so hard not to let it show
But he's the first one, first one to know
He makes a vow to stay fancy free
But that's the last thing, last thing he'll be
She knows his name but she asks him who
That's the worst thing, worst thing to do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Who lets you go out untidy?
Who lets you sit very near?
Who lets you fancy her mother?
Who puts her tongue in your ear?
What makes that girl, the lovely swirl
Here where the poor are hurtin'
Not her shoes, not their shine
The yearning loins are stolen
And what they say, hope you're not shy
Will get you swift and swooning
She tried so hard not to let it show
But he's the first one, first one to know
He makes a vow to stay fancy free
But that's the last thing, last thing he'll be
She knows his name but she asks him who
That's the worst thing, worst thing to do
She tried so hard not to let it show
But he's the first one, first one to know
He makes a vow to stay fancy free
But that's the last thing, last thing he'll be
She knows his name but she asks him who
That's the worst thing, worst thing to do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oohEmbed
