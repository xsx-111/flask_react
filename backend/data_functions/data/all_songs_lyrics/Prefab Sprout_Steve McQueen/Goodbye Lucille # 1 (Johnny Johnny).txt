Goodbye Lucille # 1 (Johnny Johnny) LyricsOoh Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
There is a time for tears
Ooh Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
You won't make it any better
Ooh Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
You might well make it worse
Ooh Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
I advise you to forget her
Ooh Johnny, Johnny, ooh
You're not the first though it hurts
Johnny, Johnny, ooh
What are you, twenty-one?
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Why don't you give it a rest
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
The world is a million
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
There can be no contest
Ooh Johnny, Johnny, ooh
Life's not complete
Till your heart's missed a beat
And you'll never make it up
Or turn back the clock
No you won't, no you won't
No you won't, no you won't
Johnny, Johnny, ooh
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
She is a person too
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
She has her own will
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Why don't you join the foreign legion
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
You're still in love with Hayley Mills
(Ooh, Johnny, Johnny, ooh)
Life's not complete
Till your heart's missed a beat
And you'll never make it up
Or turn back the clock
No you won't, no you won't
No you won't, no you won't
Johnny, Johnny, ooh
Johnny, Johnny, ooh
(Johnny, Johnny)
Johnny, Johnny, ooh2Embed
