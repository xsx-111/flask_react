When The Angels LyricsWhen the angels take the angel voice away
Some lower their eyes, some of us shout, "Cheats!"
For cheating on the deal, for pulling off the sting
For tuning up the harps, for dishing out the wings
If they can dance on, on the head of a pin
Don't that tell you something about their skin
Heart faced little bastards
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see the sometimes man you'd be
Must get so blas√©, knowing you'll never die
Lounging on a cloud, polishing the sky
The memories are blue, but borrowed for the day
They sit around ignored, till someone goes away
If they can dance on, on the head of a pin
Don't that tell you something about their skin
Heart faced little bastards
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see the sometimes man you'd be
The memories are blue, but borrowed for the day
They sit around ignored, till someone goes away
For cheating on the deal, for pulling off the sting
For tuning up the harps, for dishing out the wings
If they can dance on, on the head of a pin
Don't that tell you all about their skin
Heart faced little bastards
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see the sometimes man you'd be
When the angels take the angel voice away
Jealously they see the sometimes man you'd beEmbed
