Moving The River LyricsYou surely are a truly gifted kid
But you're only good as
The last great thing you did
And where've you been since then
Did the schedule get you down?
I hear you've got a new girlfriend
How's the wife taking it?
If it's uphill all the way you should be used to it by now
You must know me, Father it's your son
And I know that you are proud of everything I've done
But it's the wonders I perform
Pulling rabbits out of hats
When sometimes I'd prefer
Simply to wear them
If it's uphill all the way you should be used to it and say
My back is broad enough sir
To take the strain, and it's...
Hello mother, it's your son
And aren't you proud, of all I've done
But I'm turkey hungry, I'm chicken free
And I can't breakdance on your knee
But it's stay right there son, baby do
While I is itchin' for something new
So watch me hawkeye, understand
The force of will, the sleight of hand
Movin' the river
I'm turkey hungry, I'm chicken free
Movin' the river
And I can't breakdance on your knee
Movin' the river
Bucket by spoon
And do you think that they'll like me when they learn what I do
Movin' the river
Money for jam, but it takes such an effort to stay where I am
And it's...
Stay right there son, baby do
While I is itchin' for something new
Watch me hawkeye, understand
The force of will, the sleight of hand
Movin' the river
I'm turkey hungry, I'm chicken free
Movin' the river
And I can't breakdance on your knee
Movin' the river
Movin' the river
Movin' the river
Movin' the river
Movin' the riverEmbed
