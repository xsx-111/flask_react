Begin the Begin LyricsBirdie in the hand for life's rich demand
The insurgency began and you missed it
I looked for it and I found it
Myles Standish proud, congratulate me
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Life's rich demand creates supply in the hand
Of the powers, the only vote that matters
Silence means security, silence means approval
Watching zenith on the TV, tiger run around the tree
Follow the leader, run and turn into butter
Let's begin again, begin the begin
Let's begin again like Martin Luther, Zen
The mythology begins the begin
Answer me a question, I can't itemize, I can't think clearly
Look to me for reason, it's not there
I can't even rhyme in the begin
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Example, the finest example is you
A birdie in the hand for life's rich demand
The insurgency began and you missed it
I looked for it and I found it
Miles Standish proud, congratulate me
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Let's begin again, begin the begin
Let's begin again1Embed
