What If We Give It Away? Lyrics
On the outside, underneath the wall
All the money couldn't buy
You're mistaken, no one's standing there
For the record, no one tried

Oh, I try to
What if we give it away?

Overlooking with a hollow eye
What's pretending isn't right
Eye for order, a hand for what's in line
Couldn't follow, couldn't write

Oh, I try to
What if we give it away?

And our life is fine here
Stitch it on your tie here

Here's the trailer, Tom, a year has come and gone
We're not moving, wasn't right
Take the order, sew it on your tie
We couldn't follow, couldn't try
Oh, I try to
What if we give it away?

What if we give it away?Embed
