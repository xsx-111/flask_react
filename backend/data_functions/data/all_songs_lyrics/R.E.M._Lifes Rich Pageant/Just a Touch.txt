Just a Touch Lyrics
Oh well, what in the world? Women in black
Don't you remember? Sonny's packed
A day in the life, well, nobody laughed
Look to the days, how long can this last?

Kevin heard it on the radio, Hugh informed word of mouth
Carla read it in the news, caught it all, just a touch

You set the pace of what was to come
I have to carry on now that you're gone
A day in the life, nobody laughed
Look to the days, how long can this last?

Kevin heard it on the radio, Hugh informed word of mouth
Oh, Carla read it in the news, caught it all, just a touch

There's someone in our dreams, in our pre-assembled dream
Lord, Dave, William

Well, what in the world? Women in black
Don't you remember? Sonny's, Tyrone's packed
A day in the life, well, nobody laughed
Look to the days, how long can this last?
Kevin heard it on the radio, Hugh informed word of mouth
Carla read it in the news, caught it all, just a touch

Can't see where to worship Popeye, love Al Green
I can't see
I'm so young, I'm so goddamn youngEmbed
