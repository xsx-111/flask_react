(I Am) Superman Lyrics
This is a special news report: Godzilla has been sighted in Tokyo Bay! The attack on it by the Self-Defense Force has been useless! He is heading towards the city!
AAAAAAAAAGH--!

I am, (I am) I am Superman
And I know what's happening
I am, (I am) I am Superman
And I can do anything

You don't really love that guy
You make it with, now, do you?
I know you don't love that guy
'Cause I can see right through you

I am, (I am) I am Superman
And I know what's happening
I am, (I am) I am Superman
And I can do anything

If you go a million miles away
I'll track you down, girl
Trust me when I say I know
The pathway to your heart
If you go a million miles away
I'll track you down, girl
Trust me when I say I know
The pathway to your heart

(I am, I am Superman)
(And I know what's happening)
I am, (I am) I am Superman
And I can do anything (Hey, hey)

I am, (I am) I am Superman
And I know what's happening (Hey, hey)
I am, (I am) I am Superman
And I can do anything1Embed
