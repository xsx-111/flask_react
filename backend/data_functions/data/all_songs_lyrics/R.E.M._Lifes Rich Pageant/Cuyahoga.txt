Cuyahoga Lyrics
Let's put our heads together
And start a new country up
Our father's father's father tried
Erased the parts he didn't like
Let's try to fill it in
Bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me
We knee-skinned that river red

This is where we walked
This is where we swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir

This land is the land of ours
This river runs red over it
We knee-skinned it you and me
We knee-skinned that river red
And we gathered up our friends
Bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me
Up underneath the river bed
This is where we walked
This is where we swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Let's put our heads together
And start a new country up
Up underneath the river bed
We'll burn the river down

This is where they walked, swam
Hunted, danced and sang
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Rewrite the book and rule the pages
Saving face, secured in faith
Bury, burn the waste behind you
This land is the land of ours
This river runs red over it
We are not your allies
We cannot defend
This is where they walked
This is where they swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, goneEmbed
