These Days Lyrics
I'm not feeding off you, I will rearrange your scales
If I can, and I can
March into the ocean, march into the sea, had a hat
I put it down and it sunk, reached down
Yanked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden, we are young despite the years
We are concerned, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days, happy throngs, take this joy
Wherever, wherever

I wish to eat each one of you, and you, me, you
If I can, and I can
We have many things in common, name three (three, three, three)
I had a hat and it sunk, reached down
Yanked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden, we are young despite the years
We are concerned, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days, happy throngs, take this joy
Wherever, wherever you go
And I'm not feeding off you, I will rearrange your scales
If I can, and I can
I wish to eat each one of you, and you, me, you
I had a hat and it sunk, reached down
Yanked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden, we are young despite the years
We are concerned, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days, happy throngs, take this joy
Wherever, wherever you...
Carry each his burden, we are young despite the years
We are concerned, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days, happy throngs, take this joy
Wherever, wherever you goEmbed
