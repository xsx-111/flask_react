Hyena Lyrics
Night time fell at the opening
In the final act of the beginning of time
Hyena, take your role, the stage is set
The town is safe again tonight

Hyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (And all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you?)

Hyena, sister, look to your hand
Man, you serve communal interest
She'll tell you when and where and how and why you'd hurt
A beautiful young lady

Hyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (And all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you?)
Oh

The only thing to fear is fearlessness
The bigger the weapon, the greater the fear
Hyena is ambassador to here
Nighttime fell like the closing
Meager pay, but recognition
Hyena crawls on his belly out
The town is safe again tonight, oh
Hyena (I see the changes, man)
Hyena (Going on across the way)
Hyena (I see my road ahead)
Hyena (Don't know if I should stay)

Hyena (I see you holding him)
Hyena (And all that i've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you?)
OhEmbed
