I Love You (Miss Robot) LyricsI love you, Miss Robot
Programmed just to please
I love you, Miss Robot
Electronic tease
You make love like a metronome
Don't drive too fast when you take me home
Touch the seam on your silver skin
I feel so hard when you take me in
I love you, Miss Robot
Programmed just to please
I love you, Miss Robot
Electronic tease
We talk of love on the telephone
When your voice fades there's a paying tone
Force the coin and you're there again
D.I. the loneliness brain to brain
I love you, Miss Robot
Programmed just to please
I love you, Miss Robot
Electronic tease
I must leave, Miss Robot
Give your love to me
I love you, Miss Robot
Do you love me?
I love you, Miss Robot
Electronic tease
I love you, Miss Robot
Programmed just to please
I must leave, Miss Robot
Give yourself to me
I love you, Miss Robot
Do you love me?1Embed
