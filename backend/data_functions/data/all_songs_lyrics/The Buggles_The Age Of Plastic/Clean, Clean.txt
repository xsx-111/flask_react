Clean, Clean LyricsPogo Johnny kicked me in the head
Aimin' for the floorboards but they picked me up instead
Through the ringing of the night before
Said the engine's running, gotta pay a call
Johnny drove the halftrack 'cause we could not find the jeep
Wake me in the morning, gotta get some sleep
Driving all night out of fear
Got it in the ribs every time I changed gear
I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team
Gonna go where we've never been
I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team
(pickin' up, pickin' up the team)
God you know it's hard to keep the fighting clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Pogo Johnny gonna fight the war
Chaplain in the morning at the local liquor store
Pogo coughin' bad from diesel fumes
Johnny tell the chaplain go and polish his tombs
Lying on the wasteground with a blanket on his face
Indicating that he's left the human race
Helmet open where the world came in
Gotta keep your head if you wanna win
I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team
Gonna go where we've never been
I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team
(pickin' up, pickin' up the team)
God you know it's hard to keep the fighting clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Clean, clean
Lost a million in the very first attack
Don't you worry cause we know we'll get them back
Lost a million in the very first attack
Don't you worry cause we know we'll get them backEmbed
