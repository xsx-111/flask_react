Elstree Lyrics:
Action!
:
I had a dream on a back lot
And saw my life like a long shot
Of smiling faces in a picture parade
Of all the stills from the films that you made
That we would see in the Essoldo
After drinking coffee at the Giocondo
:
Elstree, remember me?
I had a part in a B-Movie
I played a man from history
Elstree, ah look at me
Oh-o-oh
Now I work for the BBC
Oh-o-oh
Life is not what it used to be
:
I took no dives in the fight scene
I had a stuntman, keep my suit clean
There’s no technology to fake-up a song
They stop the orchestra if you get it wrong

Elstree
:
They made a field into a war zone
I beat the enemy on my own
All the bullets just went over my head
There’s no reality and no one dead, in


Elstree
Oh-o-oh
Oh-o-oh
Elstree
Oh-o-oh
Oh-o-oh
Elstree
Elstree
Oh-o-oh
Oh-o-oh
Elstree
