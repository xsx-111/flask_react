Kid Dynamo LyricsThough today you might be riding
The engines of progress
Working in the media factory
Call me if you ever feel like letting go
And we'll remember the days of
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Dynamo-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
Oh-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
Swimming in the sound waves
Of the playback from the eight-track
I think your mind was born with water wings
And now when I see you
All our generation screams
I remember the dreams of
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Dynamo
Kid Dynamo - I remember you
Kid Dynamo - The hours I spent with you
Kid Dynamo - 'Cause I invented you
All that we said
How media builds stars
And our minds won't change
Only our cars
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, I remember you
Kid Dynamo - Because I speak of you
Kid Dynamo - 'Cause I invented you
Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid Dynamo
Kid Dynamo, Kid DynamoEmbed
