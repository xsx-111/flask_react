Johnny On The Monorail LyricsDown, down, they pause and walk away
Even in the streets your feet don't move
See their faces through the Perspex
Turn to stare back up at you
You--your eyes are green and mine are blue
In the subway darkness I am watching you
Oh, my, my, you are so sci-fi
Please will you let me ride?
Johnny, riding on the monorail
Johnny, riding on the monorail
Monorail
You--you know that life is terminal
It's the Paris Pullman in your mind again
Eyes like cameras move their lenses
Take this dream I offer you
Johnny, riding on the monorail
Johnny, riding on the monorail
Johnny, riding on the monorail
All we cannot see we call invisible
Tracks that move on pylons through the sky
Oh, my, my, you are so sci-fi
Please will you let me ride?
Johnny riding on the monorail
Johnny riding on the monorail
Johnny riding on the monorail
Johnny on the monorail
Johnny on the monorail
Johnny on the monorail
Johnny on the monorail (Johnny goes home...)
Johnny on the monorail (Johnny goes home...)
Johnny on the monorailEmbed
