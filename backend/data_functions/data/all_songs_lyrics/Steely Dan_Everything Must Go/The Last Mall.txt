The Last Mall Lyrics
Attention all shoppers
It's Cancellation Day
Yes the Big Adios
Is just a few hours away

It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall

You'll need the tools for survival
And the medicine for the blues
Sweet treats and surprises
For the little buckaroos

It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall

We've got a sweetheart Sunset Special
And all of the standard stuff
'Cause in the morning—that gospel morning
You'll have to do for yourself when the going gets tough
Roll your cart back up the aisle
Kiss the checkout girls goodbye
Ride the ramp to the freeway
Beneath the blood orange sky

It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
At the last mall

We've got a sweetheart Sunset Special
And all of the standard stuff
'Cause in the morning—that gospel morning
You'll have to do for yourself when the going gets tough
(Going gets tough)

Roll your cart back up the aisle
Kiss the checkout girls goodbye
Ride the ramp to the freeway
Beneath the blood orange sky

It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mallEmbed
