Slang of Ages LyricsLet me put it this way, doll
I know it's getting late
I can tell from the planes of your face
That you're from out of state
But here in the Willows, now, here's the deal
Tomorrow's for squares, and tonight's for real
Drop me off in groove time
Do you hear the slang of ages?
Show me how it's done
Now, did you say you were from the Netherlands
Or was that "nether world"?
If you grew up in Amsterdam
Well, then I'm the Duke of Earl
These tabs look iffy, but you say they're good
Let's roll with the homeys and knock on wood
Drop me off in groove time
Soothe me with the slang of ages
Show me where I turn
You are part of the dreaming
The end of my life so far
Or something halfway in between
You ought to know
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Damn, she skipped dimensions
Was it something that I said?
Or something I was thinking
When she opened up my head?
Let me make it right, babe, never mind how
There's a crazy little place I know called "Be There Now"
Drop me off in groove time
Do you hear the slang of ages?
Show me how it's done
Drop me off in groove time
Soothe me with the slang of ages
This is where I turn
That's right
Slang meEmbed
