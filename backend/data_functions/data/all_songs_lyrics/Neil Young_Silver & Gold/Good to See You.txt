Good to See You Lyrics
Good to see you
Good to see you again
Good to see your face again
Good to see you

I'm the suitcase in your hallway
I'm the footsteps on your floor
When I'm looking down on you
I feel like
I know what my life is for


I've been down the endless highway
I've passed on the solid line
Now at last I'm home to you
I feel like making up for lost time
