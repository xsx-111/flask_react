Horseshoe Man Lyrics
In the land of the broken hearted
People looking
For the horseshoe man
They've been
Picking up little pieces
They've been
Putting them all in his hand
And the way the story started
Two lovers long ago
Took a vow to live with heartbreak
Took a chance
But how could they know

...love?
How could they know love?
Love
How could they know love?

Horseshoe man's
Been working his magic
Fixing heartbreak everywhere
He's the one we all can count on
When we're lost
And don't know where love is
He takes the pieces in his hands
And shakes 'em up
Like he doesn't care
He says that there
Will always be heartbreak
Because love is everywhere
