Silver & Gold Lyrics
Working hard every day
Never notice how
The time slips away
People come, seasons go
We got something
That'll never grow old

I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold

I used to have a treasure chest
Got so heavy that I had to rest
I let it slip away from me
Didn't need it anyway
So I let it slip away

I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold
I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and goldEmbed
