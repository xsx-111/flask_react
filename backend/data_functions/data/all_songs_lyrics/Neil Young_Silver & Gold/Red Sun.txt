Red Sun Lyrics
When the red sun sets
On the railroad town
And the bars begin to laugh
With a happy sound
I'll still be here
Right by your side
There'll not be anyone
In my heart but you

And the dreams that you're having
They won't let you down
If you just follow on
Cause you know
Where you're bound
The well will be flowing
And the words will come fast
When the one who is coming
Arrives here at last

On the grassy hills
Of the railroad town
Where we cut through the fences
And over the crown
Where wind was blowing
Right through your hair
I dreamt that my Momma
And Daddy were there
