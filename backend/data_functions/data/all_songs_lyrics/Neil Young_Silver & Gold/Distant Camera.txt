Distant Camera Lyrics
The flash of a distant camera
Reconnecting
Thoughts and actions
Fragments of our missing dreams
Pieces from here and there
Fall in place along the line
Disappearing between you and me
Life is changing everywhere I go
New things and old both disappear
If life is a photograph
Fading in the mirror

All I want is a song of love
Song of love to sing for you
All I need is this song of love
To sing for you

On the floor where daylight dances
With the ones
That missed their chances
When they couldn't let it show
Lies the land of sweet surrender
Like a dream
It might have ended there
But we didn't even know
Now forever we will live as one
Floating in love's atmosphere
If love is a piece of dust
Shining in the sun

Song of loveEmbed
