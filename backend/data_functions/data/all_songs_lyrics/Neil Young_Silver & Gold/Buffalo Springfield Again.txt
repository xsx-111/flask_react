Buffalo Springfield Again Lyrics
Used to play
In a rock 'n' roll band
But they broke up
We were young and we were wild
It ate us up
Now I'm not saying
Who was right or wrong
Looking out on a big green lawn
Girls and boys
Playing in the afternoon sun
Life's a joy
I heard an old song
Playing on the radio

Buffalo Springfield again

I'd like to see those guys again
And give it a shot
Maybe now we can show the world
What we've got
But I'd just like to play
For the fun we had
