Let the Music Take You Lyrics(You got to move me...)
Another song about dancing
Nightclub chance romancing
Feel the rhythm - let it flow
Energise you - let it go
Free your body, yeah!
Free that spirit in there
Let the bassline move you
With a groove that can soothe you
Work it till you drop - never let it stop
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
All you disco divas
(Is it a song)
Just shake your thang
(Ooo yeah)
In a dancefloor fever
(Get up everybody and dance)
Yeah - it's happening!
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
Energise you
Get inside you
Work it out
Moving out
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
Just let the music take you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That one step higher
Make you, shake you, wake you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With your desire
Energise you
Just let it get inside you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Energise you
Energise youEmbed
