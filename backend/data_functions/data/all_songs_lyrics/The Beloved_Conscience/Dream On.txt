Dream On LyricsJust close your eyes
Open your head
Set the inside of you
Full speed ahead
Believe in your inner sense
And all that you feel
Because nothing's impossible
And everything's real
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believing
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believing
Floating up high
You can reach for the sky
Set your pulse racing
Heaven-embracing
Sunshiny days
Eachways and anyways
All your tomorrows
Bye, bye yesterday
Unwilling or willing you
From the beginning to...
Feel it cloaking you
Tripping you
Guiding you
Calling you in
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believing
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believing
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believing
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believing
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believing
Don't stop dreaming
Dream on
You've got to keep on keeping on
Always believingEmbed
