Celebrate Your Life LyricsWhere is the hope today
Where is the passion?
It seemed just like yesterday
Love was in fashion
A rumour that was spread around
All the answers had been found
And then it felt like moving on
And suddenly was gone
You want a reason
I'll give you reason
Don't change your ideals
With every season
Just look inside yourself
For explanation
And make your own life
A celebration
Do you dream of better days
Gazing through your purple haze
Bathed in ultra-violet rays
Or do you want your conscience raised?
You want a reason
I'll give you reason
Don't change your ideals
With every season
Just look inside yourself
For explanation
And make your own life
A celebration
You've got the power
Power to be strong
An education
That should be lifelong
So don't be a victim
Of expectation
Just make your own life
A celebration
You want a reason
I'll give you reason
Don't change your ideals
With every season
Just look inside yourself
For explanation
And make your own life
A celebration
You've got the power
Power to be strong
An education
That should be lifelong
So don't be a victim
Of expectation
Just make your own life
A celebration
You want a reason
I'll give you reason
Don't change your ideals
With every season
Just look inside yourself
For explanation
And make your own life
A celebration
You've got the power
Power to be strong
An education
That should be lifelong
So don't be a victim
Of expectation
Just make your own life
A celebrationEmbed
