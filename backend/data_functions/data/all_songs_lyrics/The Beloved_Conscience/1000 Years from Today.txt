1000 Years from Today LyricsToday I woke up smiling
In a misty morning mood
Watched your face as you were sleeping
I felt sure you understood
Well you know
You know how I love you so
More than ever now
With each single day
And you know
That I'll still be loving you
One thousand years from today
Got that deeper kind of feeling
That a younger me kept pushing aside
Let me be for you all that I'm longing to
Right by your side
Well you know
You know how I love you so
More than ever now
With each single day
And you know
That I'll still be loving you
One thousand years from today
Yes you know
A lifetime to be with you
Seems so little now
Yet so far away
But you know
That I'll still be loving you
One thousand years from today
Yeah
All of my longing
And all my belonging
All I can give you
All my life with you
Oh, well you know
You know how I love you so
More than ever now
With each single day
And you know
That I'll still be loving you
One thousand years from today
Yes you know
(All of my longing)
A lifetime to be with you
(All my belonging)
Seems so little now
(All I can give you)
Yet so far away
(All my life with you)
Oh, but you know
(All of my dreaming)
That I'll still be loving you
(All my believing)
(All my emotion)
One thousand years from today
(All my devotion)
Yes you know
(All of my longing)
Yeah, you know how I love you so
(All my belonging)
More than ever now
(All I can give you)
With each single day
(All my life with you)
Oh that you know
(All of my dreaming)
That I'll still be loving you
(All my believing)
One thousand years from todayEmbed
