Spirit LyricsSo welcome back again
On the right track again
You finally made it
Pushed it to the limit
Can't live within it
You can't do without it
Where's the surprise?
Don't settle for compromise
You know how you feel
There's still spirit in your eyes
You know that it's real
Have you been having fun
Being the only one
On the right wavelength?
Chasing the time
Walking the line
Watching your life slipping by
Don't settle for compromise
You know how you feel
There's still spirit in your eyes
You know that it's real
Don't settle for compromise
You know how you feel
There's still spirit in your eyes
You know that it's real
You've only got one life
Open your eyes
Use it up gently
We're all back to nature
Sooner or later
What's the hurry?
Where's the fire?
Don't settle for compromise
You know how you feel
There's still spirit in your eyes
You know that it's real
Don't settle for compromise
You know how you feel
There's still spirit in your eyes
You know that it's real
Don't settle for compromise
You know how you feel
There's still spirit in your eyes
You know that it's real
Don't settle for compromise
You know how you feel
There's still spirit in your eyes
You know that it's realEmbed
