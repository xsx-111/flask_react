Lose Yourself in Me LyricsYou, with that look in your eyes
Who do you think about
As you fantasize?
Oh, how I need your caress
Anything you want
The answer is yes
Lose yourself
In me
Lose yourself
In me
Oh, how I long for your touch
How you tantalise me
So much
Just one fevered kiss from your lips
Sends me heaven bound
Permanent bliss
Lose yourself
In me
Lose yourself
In me
Lose yourself
In me
Lose yourself
In me
Yeah you, girl of my dreams
Well you turn me inside out
Apart at the seams
Just give me yourself body and soul
Be forever mine
Yeah, forever mine
Lose yourself
In me
Lose yourself
In me
Lose yourself
In me
Yeah, lose yourself
In meEmbed
