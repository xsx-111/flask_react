Folding Lyrics
A walk on the surface
Down the light-footed path
A darkening canopy
A day that won't last

I wanna stay next to you
I can't remember your name
Do you feel the tremors here?
Do you feel the same like you used to?

The safety of artifacts
An arc moving fast
A circle that slows down
And the day that can't last
But we still do

Do you feel the hemisphere
Do you feel the same like you used to?

These fields will wither and die
This temple will burn
And I'll make excuses to the listener
And I'll never learn
Dragging my feet through the ashes
Lost in the aftermath
I could never be two
I have it in for you
I could never be two
And I've got it in for youEmbed
