Desert Rambler Lyrics
Halcyon days long wasted, departing our shores
A respite from thought that was useless and I get no more
A window to you that is narrowed and not yet shut
A trip through a sickening distance that I need so much

As we dream of our descent upon the surface
I see settlement fires
Gift of water that we carry
Lies in slumber under magnifiers

Where is the rescue?
It didn't show
Where is the bottom?
I wouldn't know
I missed you so

As we brake for our descent upon the surface
I see settlement fires
This start we carry for your oceans
Lies in waiting under magnifiers

You can't know the hours that kept me awake
Awake with a start and the instruments say I've come so far
A stag and a doe and a surface here are being lost
Hope wasn't here, but it slept in the seeds of our own dust
Do you feel loved?Embed
