Step into You Lyrics
Wanting to see for myself again
It's a race to the ground back to you again
I am lost
Path is unclear and the air is thin
I am over it
And everything here isn't true

Remember how
Your voice was an echo to me
Your arms were just out of reach
And the years that spilled by were meant for no one
Remember when
We sought comfort in the sand
And we moved on
Under trees that meant their shade for no one else

Wanting to see for myself again
I have to come to the ground next to you again
It can talk
And it listens and hears if you want it to
And it's telling me
Everything here isn't true
It's coming down
Sheets of wasted promise
My arms are just out of reach
And the years that poured out were meant for no one
Remember when
We found comfort in the sand
And we reside
Under trees that meant their shade for no one else

So Zion moves in a dusty haze
It's a desert that blooms in our darkest days
I am lost
Chasing thoughts and a dying moon
I am over it
I'm a dried up, wind blown cocoonEmbed
