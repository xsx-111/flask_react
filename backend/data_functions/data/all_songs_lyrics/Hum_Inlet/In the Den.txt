In the Den Lyrics
Do you feel the ground move that you walk upon?
Did you feel the sky still like everything, it's done?
What did you think you would find me in pieces of?
And what can we make here out of nothingness and love?

I hear them clicking across the stones
I feel they know that I'm all alone
The stars are strange and this isn't home

In an echo left on the mountainside
If anywhere I reside
And the gifts of the years I wasted here on the battle lines
I am still alive and what's coming true
Is the signal to my return, oh
Find me here on the ground and in need of you

False is the dawn that promises anything
False is the hope and the talk of eternity and spring
To lie on the grass here and be swallowed in
To speak to the ground, through the trees of the suffering again

I hear them clicking across the stones
I feel they know that I'm all alone
The stars are strange and this isn't home
In an echo left on the mountainside
If anywhere I reside
And the gifts of the years I wasted here on the battle lines
I am still alive and what's coming true
Is the signal to my return, oh
Find me here on the ground and in need of youEmbed
