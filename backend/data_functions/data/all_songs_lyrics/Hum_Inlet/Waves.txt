Waves Lyrics
Waves of lost hope, venom is in my head
They fill my days with sorrow
And to blow on embers left inside of me
To burn me up in tomorrow
The sunlight drips from the trees and forms in pools
I'm wading through them oblivious and warm
Comfort then will come to no one
And stones will speak and they seek to misinform

Unwinged and flightless
And difficult to see
You collect me

Placing markers so that I can't win
They don't know of my solitary days
For the host of upturned feasting summer leaves
And spirit light beams for later stowaways
Ground will give, the heart will suffer
And the traces of morning will lead us to the end
Where the dying landscape meets the water
And the waves of you roll over me again

Unwinged and flightless
And difficult to see
You collect me
And now I see the end is near
It's true, the host is never cleared
And I don't believe in anything except
Dreams still come, but now they're so
And in them I am yet to go
Anywhere I haven't already been
An empty space where all is wrong
And maps to where I don't belong
And another dark path that ends, but never gives
Innocence death, was I the one?
To see beyond the boiling sun
To the other side
And the wonders didn't endEmbed
