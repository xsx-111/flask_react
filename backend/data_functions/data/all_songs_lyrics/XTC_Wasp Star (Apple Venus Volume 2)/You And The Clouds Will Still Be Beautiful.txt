You And The Clouds Will Still Be Beautiful LyricsAnd every morning before I'm awake
I walk around the world to make sure she's alright
And every evening 'fore I bolt the door
I give the stars a stir to make sure they will spin all night
For I see people who will scratch and spit and kick and fight
And I see nations war about whether right is left and whether wrong is right
And I know storms inside your head can amplify the blight
But no matter what the weather, you and the clouds will still be beautiful
No matter what the weather, you and the clouds will still be beautiful
And every Troy with wooden horse
I take to peaceful waters but can't make him drown
And every Bastille that gets stormtroopered
"Hail to the Chief" comes rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin' down
And I've seen people conduct lightning down to a summer's day
And I've seen nations playfully hurl snowballs packed with stones and clay
And I know rain inside your head can seriously put a stop to play
But no matter what the weather, you and the clouds will still be beautiful
No matter what the weather, you and the clouds will still be beautiful
So let it rain
And when we see flying saucers, flying cups, and flying plates
And as we trip down lover's lane we sometimes bump into the gate
And I know thunder in your head can still reverberate
But no matter what the weather, you and the clouds will still be beautiful
No matter what the weather, you and the clouds will still be beautiful
No matter what the weather
Yeah
So let it rain
So let it rain
You know you still be beautiful
So let it rain
It doesn't matter what the weather you know you're beautiful
Just let it rain
You're just, you're beautiful
So let it rain
Yeah, since the clouds all part the clouds just rose
So let it rain
From your pretty little mouth to your pretty little nose you're beautiful
So let it rain
It doesn't matter if the rain wants to fail if the rain wants to fall
Just let it rain
So let it rain
So let it rainEmbed
