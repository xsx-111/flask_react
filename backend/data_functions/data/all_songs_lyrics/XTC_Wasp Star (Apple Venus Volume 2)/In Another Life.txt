In Another Life LyricsWell, would you want me in your afternoons
If I seduced you in your Mills and Boon?
Well, I'll be the master, if you'll be the maid
But don't you get those headaches in another life
I'll bring your milk tray from a parachute
I'll play the Hollywood hunk, you can dye your roots
Well, I'll be your Burton if you'll be my Liz
There might be flying pigs in another life
It's how we're built, love, don't let it wilt, love
I'll take your flat feet well if you'll take my habits
It all works out in the end
Ah but in another life
I'll be the stranger in your horoscope
The cheeky builder calling with his quote
Or maybe a Chippendale on girls night out
Make mine the biggest pouch in another life
It's how we're built, love, don't let it wilt, love
I'll take ya mood swings well if you'll take my hobbies
It all works out in the end
Ah but in another life
Well, I'll be your Burton if you'll be my Liz
There might be flying pigs in another life
And you'd give up the cigs in another life
And beer tastes good in tins
Test matches we might win
And your mother buys her ginEmbed
