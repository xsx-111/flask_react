Wounded Horse LyricsWell, I stumbled and I fell like a wounded horse
When I found out you'd been riding another man
Well, I staggered round in circles on a loser's course
When I found out you'd been riding another man
Well, my friends all said just climb back in the saddle
And you know that everything will turn out right
Well, my friends all said you won't sink if you paddle
But my ship drifts on into an endless night
Well, I bit out my own tongue like a wounded horse
When I found out you'd been riding another man
Well, my friends all said just climb back in the saddle
And you know that everything will turn out right
Well, my friends all said you won't sink if you paddle
But my ship drifts on into some endless night
Well, I bit out my own tongue like a wounded horse
When I found out you'd been riding another man
When I found out you'd been riding another manEmbed
