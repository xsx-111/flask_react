Standing In For Joe LyricsI'm standing, standing in for Joe
Joe called 'round to ask me, would I do a favor
While he's gonna be out of town
Says his girl needs company, she gets so restless
Would I keep her safe and sound
Softly, softly, in the night
Well, you can guess the rest
Now, these shoes fit all too well
Standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe
I'm standing in for Joe
Joe said, we've been friends so long
But I would be the one he would trust with his life
Now, those words run 'round my brain
As darkness falls as I turn out his bedroom light
Who could resist her tender charms?
So the story goes
This actor, he plays all the parts
Standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe
Oh, I'm standing in for Joe
Love is like a river, you cannot stop its flow
Joe called 'round to ask me, would I do a favor
While he's gonna be out of town
Says his girl needs company, she gets so restless
Would I keep check that she's safe and sound
Softly, softly, in the night
Well, you can guess the rest
Now, these shoes fit all too well
Standing in for Joe, I'm standing in for Joe
Oh yeah, I'm standing in for Joe
Standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe
Standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe
Standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe
Standing in for Joe, standing in for Joe, standing in for JoeEmbed
