Playground LyricsI climb up, spending daylight
Slide down, bankrupt on the other side
Some sweet girl, playing my wife
Runs off with a boy whose bike she'll ride
Playground, it's a playground
Marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies
In the playground, every day ground
Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square world
Bells will ring, door flies open
Hare and Greyhound in the old kiss chase
You've been caught, game is ended
Smack on kisser from her slap on face
Playground, it's a playground
Marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies
In the playground, every day ground
Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square world
Watch the leaves all tear away (One by one)
Leaving you but lined like an exercise book
What did your report once say? (Know the one)
This boy must try harder to please from down on his knees
Playground, playground, careful what you say ground
Playground, playground, gonna make you pay ground
Brain gets bent, heart gets broken
You can't jump off once the pages turn
School is out but never over
That's the only lesson you can learn
Playground, it's a playground
Marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies
In the playground, every day ground
Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square
Playground, it's a playground
You're for the high jump, if you let 'em push you
In the playground, every day ground
There's no escaping, escaping from their big square world
You may leave school but it never leaves youEmbed
