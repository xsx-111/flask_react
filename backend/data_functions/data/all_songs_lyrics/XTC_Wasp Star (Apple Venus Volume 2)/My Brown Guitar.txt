My Brown Guitar LyricsIn my heart, in my heart
You want some lovely, I got some lovely
In my head, in my head
Where the lions wear the right tie
Where the gems roar, there be lovely
You want some lovely, I got some lovely
In my bed, in my bed
Where the ocean wears the shore down
Where's the on switch, there be lovely
Laying waiting naked for you
We can play every day
We can play at being lovers
We can play every day
We can play on my brown guitar
We can play every day
We can play at being lovers
We can play every day
We can play on my brown guitar
You want some lovely, I got some lovely
In my yard, in my yard
There be inchworm, there we football
Take my yardstick, stir some lovely
Laying waiting naked for you
You want some lovely, I got some lovely
In my field, in my field
There be green grass, there be pink skies
There be bluebirds, come and nest there
We can play every day
We can play at being lovers
We can play every day
We can play on my brown guitar
We can play every day
We can play at being lovers
We can play every day
We can play on my brown guitar
You want some lovely, I got some lovely
In my heart, in my heart for youEmbed
