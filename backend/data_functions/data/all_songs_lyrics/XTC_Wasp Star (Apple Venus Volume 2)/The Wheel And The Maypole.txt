The Wheel And The Maypole LyricsI've got the plow if you've got the furrow
I've got the rabbit if you've his burrow home
I've got the pen if you've got the paper
Time is but clay and I'll see you and the wheel turn
You and the wheel turn
Chorus:
And if the pot won't hold our love
If the pot won't hold our love
If the pot won't hold our love
Then we'll dash it to the ground
And if the pot won't hold our love
If the pot won't hold our love
If the pot won't hold our love
We'll build one bigger all around
Goes the wheel
I've got the seed if you've got the valley
I've got the big stick if you've Aunt Sally's head
I've got the time if you've got the motion
Time is but clay and I'll see you and the wheel turn
You and the wheel turn
Chorus
Chorus 2:
Maypole
Maypole
Maypole you've spun me round and knocked me off my axis mundi
Maypole
Maypole
Maypole the ties that bind you will unwind to free me one day
And everything decays
Yes, everything decays
Forest tumbles down to make the soil
Planets fall apart
Just to feed the stars and stuff their larders
And what made me think we're any better
And what made me think we'd last forever
Was I so naive?
Of course it all unweaves
Chorus 2
Pyramids and palaces to dust
Empires crumble in
Wedding cake begins to must and molder
And what made me think we're any better
And what made me think we'd last forever
Was I so naive?
Failing to perceive
Maypole (round goes the wheel)
Maypole (round goes the wheel)
Maypole (the ties that bind you will unwind to free me one day)
Maypole (if the pot won't hold our love)
