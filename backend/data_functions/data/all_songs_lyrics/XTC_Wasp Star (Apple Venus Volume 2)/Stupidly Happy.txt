Stupidly Happy LyricsI'm stupidly happy
Everything's fine
I'm stupidly happy
My heart pumping wine
I'm stupidly happy
With idiot grin
I'm stupidly happy
It's surely a sin
All the birds of the air call your name
As they land on my kitchen roof
All the fish in the lake do the same
Should you need extra proof
I'm stupidly happy
My vision is skewed
I'm stupidly happy
I'm coming unscrewed
And if the devil walks up
Dressed in any disguise
I'd take him by the collars
Look him in the eyes
I'm stupidly happy
Now you're my defense
I'm stupidly happy
This world's making sense
I'm stupidly happy
I roll like a train
I'm stupidly happy
With you in my brain
All the lights of the cars in the town
Form the strings of a big guitar
I'm a giant to play you a tune
For wherever you are
I'm stupidly happy
Like the words to that song
I'm stupidly happy
No, nothings not wrong
And should the devil drive up
With his business card out
I'd tear it to confetti
With a grin and shout
Stupidly happy
All of the time
I'm stupidly happy
Now you're mine
Stupidly happyEmbed
