Church Of Women LyricsA lie for a lie, but a truth for the truth
Church of women is made out of milk
Which their love turns to butter
Church of women will have you give praise
With a laugh, bark and stutter
Like us men like us men
They are nothing like us men
Men have gargoyles 'round their hearts
I'm on my knees but dancing
Want to worship at the church of women
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around
Want to worship at the church
Let me worship at the church of women
Church of women is making donations of loving and giving
(Church of women is making donations of loving and giving)
Church of women performing that miracle raising the living
(Church of women performing that miracle raising the living)
Like us men like us men
Will they ever like us men?
Men have thorns around their minds
I'm on my mountain preaching
Want to worship at the church of women
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around
Want to worship at the church
Let me worship at the church of women
Lie for a lie, but a truth for the truth
Give 'em back their house, the walls, the doors, the floors and roof
And stop tryin' to diet on the wafers and wine and submit we're in control
Now let's put things right
Let's multiply the loves and kisses
'Til we have enough to love and eat forever
Want to worship at the church of women
(I want to worship at the church of women now)
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around
(I'll breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning 'round)
Want to worship at the church
Let me worship at the church of women
(Worship at the church of women)
Want to worship at the church of women
(I want to worship at the church of women now)
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around
(I'll breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning 'round)
Want to worship at the church
Let me worship at the church of women
(Worship at the church of women)
Want to worship at the church of women
(I want to worship at the church of women now)
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around
(I'll breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning 'round)
Want to worship at the church
Let me worship at the church of women
(Worship at the church of women)
Want to worship at the church of women
(I want to worship at the church of women now)
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around
(I'll breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning 'round)
Want to worship at the church
Let me worship at the church of womenEmbed
