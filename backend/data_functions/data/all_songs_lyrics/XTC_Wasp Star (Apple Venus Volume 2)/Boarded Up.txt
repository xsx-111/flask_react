Boarded Up LyricsBoarded up
Yeah, we're boarded up
Nailed up shut
Yeah, we're boarded up
Music venue has had it's day
Death watch Beatle band moved in to play
Groups don't come down from London way
'Cos we're boarded up
Yeah, we're nailed up shut
Two by four'ded up
Yeah, we're boarded up
Touring companies stay away
Rats and mice take the center stage
Carpenter's mate have a field day
Boarded up
Yeah, we're nailed up shut
(Don't mind me at all)
Two by four'ded up
Yeah, we're boarded up
Pubs and clubs had the chop
Making way for a superstore plot
Some town planner didn't know when to stop
Boarded up
Come and see us
Boarded up
Don't wait too long now 'cause we're
Boarding up
Yeah, boarded upEmbed
