Marion Lyrics
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Well, I thought that this was half a love, love
Follow to the rising sea
Well, I thought that this was half a love

Well, I thought that this was half a love
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Follow to the rising sea
Well, I thought that this was half a love

Whoo
When I'm falling to the rightEmbed
