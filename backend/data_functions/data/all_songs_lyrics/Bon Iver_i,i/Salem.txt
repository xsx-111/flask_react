Salem Lyrics
Salem burns the leaves
Then she
Returns to cure and see
Heavy fate
After years of waiting

'Cause abnormalities
Surely
Are everywhere you see
So what I think we need
Is elasticity, empowerment and ease

So I won't lead no lie
With our hearts the only matter why
How long it's lasted
I've not received reciprocity

To speak supportively
Big guy
There's no automatic peace
But I bet you'd keep
All these in-betweens that bar my youth
There's no anorberic dream
Far as I know
I tried too hard to see
What I thought itâ€™d be
Asking constantly
How's it gonna be?

So I'm gonna weep a while
You don't even know how hard
I learned a lesson
Don't ask me, I've
