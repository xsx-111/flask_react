Jelmore Lyrics
Well, angel, morning Sivanna
Well, ain't been gone too far
But heading out towards Ponoma
Where you won't be alone

Where there's thrift store manager in a poke camadee
And a gas mask on his arm
And one by one by one
We'll all be gone

We'll all be gone by the fall
We'll all be gone by the falling light

Brick layer
With a hat down on his feet
I'll say no more
I won't lead no Calvary

How long
Will you disregard the heat?
Half beat
It's no misnomer though
I've the feeling that I better go
So
I slide right out the door, oh4Embed
