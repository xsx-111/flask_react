Double Bubble Trouble LyricsUH OH you’re in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble
UH OH you’re in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble
UH OH you’re in trouble
I step up in the game and I burst that bubble
Bought up a baby in a bandana
I boarded a boeing eating a banana
Bounce on the bed
Battling with heads
It’s based on a story that nobody read
(people see me as trouble see me see me as trouble)
See me see me as trouble
UH OH
(people see me as trouble see me see me as trouble)
See me see me as trouble
COZ I got a reputation
GOT A GOT A reputation
And I got a reputation
GOT A GOT A reputation
Played in the park
Packed with piranhas
I jump in puddle
Singing NIRVANA
Passed by the past and I end at the start
Now I’m living the life and I’m gonna raise the bar
Do you know my name
Do you know my number
Do you know by summer I will make you a member
I know you're busy running round with Linda
If I don’t get you now then I’ll get you by december
You're dancing styles out dated like tinga
These girls in caps MAMI snap your finger
I drift in deserts from bumper to bumper
We can rock a dress or we can rock a jumper
You want that pain so I set you on fire
These girls are high but I take you lot higher
So get your beer it’s tiger or corona
We throw up heat like a bunsen burner!
You know my badman style
Coz I’m from Lanka
Eat up a falafel
Say danke danke
If I’m in street fighter
I’ll be like blanka
Roll like a ball and I’ll bleed you like a banker
Do you know my name name name name name name
