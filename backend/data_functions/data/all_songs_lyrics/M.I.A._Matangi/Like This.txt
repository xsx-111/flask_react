Like This Lyrics
I could give it to you like this
Give it to you like that
Give it to you like this
Give it to you like that

People, they come for
Want a piece of what I got
Got the key in my coat
Got a secret, you want more?
Pick a home, pick a door, pick a lock
Pick a club, pick a fold, pick a show
Pick a hair, pick a coat, pick a car
Pick a fuck

Watch me go in, watch me go in
Watch me go in, watch me go in
 x2

They all know how I go
When they see me, they want more
What you see is what you get though
We're hitting that smoke from the hydro
What you see is what you get though
How we do it is same as the next bro
In a war where we put up where we get though
How we do it is the same as the next bro
Pick a home, pick a lock, pick a door
Pick a club, pick a flow, pick a show
Pick a hood, pick a curb, pick a car

 x2
I got the key, I got the secret
I got the key, I got the secret
I got the secret, I got the secret
Secret, secret, secret, yea se-se-se-se
