Go low, go slow
Roll like a pollo
Up and down a pole
Like you’re glowing up a yo-yo
Go low, go slow
Roll like a pollo
Up and down a pole
Like you’re glowing up a yo-yo

Yeah yeah, YOLO
Yeah yeah, YOLO
Alarms go off when I enter the building

YALA
YALA
YALA

I drink some Cointreau
Keep it in my poncho
Light up like Castro
Blow it up from get go
Pro when I set, go
Grow like an afro
Play like Ronaldo
Hard like I'm Death Row
Weight in kilo
Light as a pillow
Dance on my tip-toe
Like I tae-box though
Yeah we come come come
Yeah we come with some some
Get a glass of rum
With a gun and some pun pun
Oh fun fun fun
Let's get 'em undone
Take a hit on the bong
It’s been so long since we hung

Go low, go slow
Roll like a pollo
Up and down a pole
Like you’re glowing up a yo-yo
Go low, go slow
Roll like a pollo
Up and down a pole
Like you’re glowing up a yo-yo

YALA
YALA

Anti war war
M.I.A. underscore
I got the law law
Searching for me on tour
Bankin offshore
Take a trip to Singapore
I need to earn like
I'm Julianne Moore
For the hour poor
Don’t wanna ignore
That’s why I say shit
So they can explore
My baby, I amore
My mommy I adore
I tried to stay pure
Can’t take it anymore
Yeah we come come come
Yeah we come with some some
Get a glass of rum
With a gun and some pun pun
Oh fun fun fun
Let's get 'em undone
Take a hit on the bong
It’s been so long since we hung

Go low, go slow
Roll like a pollo
Up and down a pole
Like you’re glowing up a yo-yo
Go low, go slow
Roll like a pollo
Up and down a pole
Like you’re glowing up a yo-yo


YALA
YALA
YALA
YALA, YALA
I’m rolling solo
You can't take a photo
I’mma keep it raw raw

YALA
YALA

Yeah we come come come
Yeah we come with some some
Get a glass of rum
With a gun and some pun pun
Oh fun fun fun
Let's get 'em undone
Take a hit on the bong
It’s been so long since we hung

Go low, go slow
Roll like a pollo
Up and down a pole
Like you’re glowing up a yo-yo
YOLO? I don’t even know anymore, what that even mean though
If you only live once why we keep doing the same shit
Back home where I come from we keep being born again and again and again
That’s why they invented karma22Embed
