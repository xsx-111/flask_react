Karmageddon LyricsThings do move like sound
Waves do move like round
It don't go up and down
It spreads circle bound
Running like a hound HA
Look at what I found
Where they threw me down
Where they threw me down
On ten we're on
They're an opening ceremony and we all start the same
Cells grow to cell phones
Some form cells
Some get put in cells
Sex fucking sells
Now you know the drill so
Hear me sound the bells
You use new keys to type old deeds
Set up by old needs
What world peace?
What was in ya read? Yeah what was in ya feed?
Where do you get to with the internet lead?
Things do change and change can have a range
Systems shouldn't operate by sticking me in a cage
Ain't Dalai Lama
Ain't Sai Baba
My words are my armor and you're 'bout to meet your karma10Embed
