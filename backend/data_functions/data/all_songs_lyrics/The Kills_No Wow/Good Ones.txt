Good Ones LyricsTook a car to the part of the city
Where the city runs out of street lights
God knows, it's the way that it goes
That we're never gonna catch any daylight
My little sister's eyes so wide
They must have been the size of the city moon tonight
My little sister's eyes so wide
Must have been the size of the city
Did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
Did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
Did you got me the good ones
The real good ones, what you got
Take a water full, the water tastes good
I took the water and the water was hot
Once in a while, once in a while
You got to burn your lips, keep your feelings alive
Once in a while, once in a while
You got to burn down your house, keep your dreaming alive
So, did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
Oh, did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
Did you get the good ones
Did you get the good ones
Oh, did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
Did you get the real good ones
Did you get me the good ones
Oh, did you get the real good ones
Did you get me the good ones
Did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
Oh, did you get the real good ones
Did you get me the good onesEmbed
