Passion Is Accurate LyricsI engineered a heavy heart
You carried the weight of it
I engineered the awkward look
You carry a trace of it
My passion is accurate
My passion is accurate
I engineered the long silence
I engineered the bored Kiss
I calculated the nights you missed
You carried the weight of it
My passion is accurate
My passion is accurate
I move in mathematician fashion
I move the problem around a fraction
My passion is accurate
You carried the weight of it
My passion is accurate
My passion is accurate
My passion is accurate
My passion is accurateEmbed
