Rodeo Town LyricsIf I'm so evil
Then why are you satisfied
If I'm so evil
Why are you satisfied?
I had a dream about your ghost
You're breathing down my neck
Baby it starts in the shower
By letting your ashes down the drain
You were telling me how
This ain't no Rodeo Town
I caught the gun
But you made me set it down
You were telling me how
This ain't no Rodeo Town
I caught the gun
But you made me set it down
If I'm so evil
Then why are you all satisfied?
If I'm so evil
Why are you satisfied?
When you left you said
I'm gonna keep an eye on you
Well I don't mind if you do
But you can't keep quiet
You were telling me how
This ain't no Rodeo Town
I caught the gun
But you made me set it down
You were telling me how
This ain't no Rodeo Town
I caught the gun
But you made me set it down
You were telling me how
This ain't no Rodeo Town
I caught the gun
But you made me set it down
You were telling me how
This ain't no Rodeo Town
I caught the gun
But you made me set it down1Embed
