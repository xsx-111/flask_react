Dead Road 7 LyricsThis dead road leads down
To that dead road and back
To the road where the oldest road
Met the first dead road that cracked
Made the second and curved the third
Forked the forth and said to the fifth
"If you walk just a couple of miles
You're gonna come across the sixth, the sixth, the sixth"
It runs into a ditch
Dead road seven is a bitch
Dead road seven is a bitch
Floating belly flush
Floating belly up, up, up, up
Go down there if you wish
Go down there if you wish
This dead road leads down
To that dead road and back
To the road where the oldest road
Met the first dead road and cracked
Made the second and curved the third
Forked the forth and said to the fifth
"If you walk just a couple of miles
You're gonna come across the sixth, the sixth, the sixth"
Dead road seven is a bitch
Dead road seven is a bitch
Floating belly flush
Floating belly up, up, up, up
Go down there if you wish
Go down there if you wish
Go down there if you wish
Dead road seven is a bitch
Dead road seven is a bitch
Floating belly flush
Floating belly up, up, up, up
Go down there if you wish
Go down there if you wish
Go down there if you wishEmbed
