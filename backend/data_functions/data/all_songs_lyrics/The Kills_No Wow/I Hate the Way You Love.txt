I Hate the Way You Love LyricsI, I, I can't get full
Please could you take my shakes
And would you hold them still
My words fell into the road
I saw it starting to happen
And I could not collect them
Before they were rolled
I could not collect them
Before they were rolled
You love, you love, you love
I hate the way you love
I hate the way you love
May I look into your glass
Because I need some reflection
Yeah, I know it won't last
And look it's over already over
And I did not have the heart
No I did not have the heart
I was loosing a button
Right from the start
I was loosing a button
I was coming apart
I was coming apart
You love, you love, you love
I hate the way you love
I hate the way you love
I know I've seen you before
You bored me then and now you just bore me some more
The clock gets locked, locked
Tick tick, tick-tick-tick, stop, stop!
And now I can't get full
Please could you take my shakes
My eyes feel spikey and small
And I can't get no picture on them at all
I can't get no picture on them at all
You love, you love, you love
I hate the way you love
I hate the way you loveEmbed
