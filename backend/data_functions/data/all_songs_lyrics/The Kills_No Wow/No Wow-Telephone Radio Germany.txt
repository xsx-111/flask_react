No Wow/Telephone Radio Germany LyricsYou're gonna have to step over my dead body
Before you walk out that door
You charmed me with your magic
Landed looking tragic
"Forever" is the feather you ain't got no more
And all the people you see coming by to save you
You're make-believing-on in your mind
Your eyes are holy rollin', looking, beating, knocking
The ceiling gets closer to you all the time
This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more
You're gonna have to step over my dead body
Before you walk out that door
You charmed me with your magic
Landed looking tragic
"Forever" is the feather you ain't got no more
This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end of the night
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end of the night
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end at the end of the night
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end at the end of the night
This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore
This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore
This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
There ain't no wow now ...Embed
