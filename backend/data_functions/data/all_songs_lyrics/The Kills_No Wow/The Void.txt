The Void LyricsFlying too close to the sun
Is this where the earthquakes come from?
Walked on with helium legs
Weigh yourself - see what you've done
Every looker keeps you lookin', no one ever told me there'd be scenes like this. Cruisin' through the cars, now will you, what will you fly over us next?
Been 'round, I seen the mess
Saluted no replace
There's nothing here for you to know
Beauty in the belly of zero
Every looker keeps you lookin' back and forth, lights are patient
Cruisin' through the cars, now how will you, no one ever told me there'd be scenes like this
Every looker keeps you lookin', cruisin through the cars now, how will you, what will you fly over us next? No one ever told me there'd be scenes like this
What's it taste like, what's it taste like now?
Every looker keeps you lookin', cruisin through the cars now, how will you, what will you fly over us next? No one ever told me there'd be scenes like this
What will you fly over us next? No one ever told me there'd be scenes like thisEmbed
