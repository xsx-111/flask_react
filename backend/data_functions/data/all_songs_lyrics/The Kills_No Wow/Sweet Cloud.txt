Sweet Cloud LyricsShe upset the weather
She upset my sweet cloud
Growing black
Thick and heavy
Strike me now gonna put me down
She upset my brother
She upset his sweetheart
I love him so I do not kill
I know no words to make it right
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool
She upset his morning
She upset his afternoon
I see no way
I see no right
The night calls it stays on the night
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killingEmbed
