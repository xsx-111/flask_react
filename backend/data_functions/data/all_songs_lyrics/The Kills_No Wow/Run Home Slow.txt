Run Home Slow LyricsYou play with the dogs
You lay with the dogs
Like it or not man
You lay with the dogs
Chewin' your fingers
Rottin' your mouth
Fallin' in twenty hours
Just to wait for the sound
It's easily done my friend
It's easily done my friend
And you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
And you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
You lay with the dogs man
You lay with the dogs
Little too long man
You lay with dogs
Chasing the taillight
So jump in the bones
Fallin twenty hours
Till they take you on home
It's easily done my friend
Just take it and run my friend
It's easily done
It's easily done
I'd easily do it again
And you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
And you holler and cry
And you run home slow
And you're hit and you're down
And you run home slow
Little bone head
Took the cherry
Took my twenty
Took my skin
And took my bone
Took a car
And took a hit
And took myself
Far away from home
Took your car
Took your messages
And took a look in
To the wall
Turn around
And took a look again
You took my boots
You took my keys
You took a twenty
Took a ten
You'd take a thousand
If you wanted to
Without calling me again
And you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
And you holler and cry
And you run home slow
And you're hit and you're down
And you run home slow
Little bone head
It's easily done my friend
Just take it and run my friend
It's easily done
It's easily done
I'd easily do it again
And you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
And you holler and cry
And you run home slow
And you bitch and you whine
And you run home slow
Little bone head
Took your car
Took your messages
Took a look
To the wall
Turn around
And took a look again
You took my boots
You took my keys
You took a twenty
Took a ten
You'd take a thousand
If you wanted to
Without calling me again
When you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
When you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
When you're wild for the night
And you run home slow
Little bone head
Little bone head
Little bone head
Little bone head
Little bone headEmbed
