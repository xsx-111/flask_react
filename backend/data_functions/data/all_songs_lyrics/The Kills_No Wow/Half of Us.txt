Half of Us LyricsThe night, after the night, after the night is gone
And after they're gone, after they're gone, they're gone
And half of us is lovers missing lovers
And half of us is lovers missing out
And after the night, after the night, the eye of the storm in your mouth and you're gone
And after they're gone, after they're gone, it's out
And half of us is lovers losing lovers
And half of us is lovers losing out
The heartbroken sound of my town beats the heartbreaking sound of your town
After they're gone, after they're gone, after they're gone, they're gone
A happy accident, the eye of the storm in your mouth, a happy house
And half of us is lovers missing lovers
And half of us is lovers missing out
Happy now?
The heartbroken sound of my town beats the heartbreaking sound of your town
And half of us is lovers losing lovers
And half of us is lovers losing out
Happy now?
The heartbroken sound of my town beats the heartbreaking sound of your town
The heartbreaking sound of my town beats the heartbreaking sound of your townEmbed
