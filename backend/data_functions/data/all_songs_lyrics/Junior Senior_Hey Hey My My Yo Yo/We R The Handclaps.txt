We R The Handclaps LyricsWe R the Handclaps
We R the Handclaps
We R the Handclaps
Keep talking
We R the Handclaps
When the music's playing
Words don't mean a thing
So what you gonna do girl?
Let's stop talking honey
So we can hear the girl sing
So what you gonna do boy?
But I'm bad bad dancer (bad bad dancer)
But it feels alright (feels alright)
I'm such a bad bad dancer (bad bad dancer)
And I don't care too much
What you wanna say girl?
Dancing slow (I fall in love with the music)
Let it show (I fall in love with the music)
Time to go (I fall in love)
Never wanna-wanna-wanna-wanna go home
When the music's playing
On the radio
What you wanna say boy?
My fright is showing
I can't think and let yourself go
What you wanna say girl?
But I'm bad bad dancer (bad bad dancer)
But it feels alright (feels alright)
I'm such a bad bad dancer (bad bad dancer)
And I don't care too much
What you wanna do girl?
Dancing slow (I fall in love with the music)
Let it show (I fall in love with the music)
Time to go (I fall in love)
Never wanna-wanna-wanna-wanna go home
We R the Handclaps (x3)
Can you feel the handclaps? (a-ha)
We R the heartbeats (x2)
We R the backstreats
Can you feel the heartbeat? (I think so)
I am the bass
We R the space
Between the notes and the place (Alright)
But it feels alright
I'm such a bad bad dancer (bad bad dancer)
And it heartbeats all night
Dancing slow (I fall in love with the music)
Let it show (I fall in love with the music)
Time to go (I fall in love)
Never wanna-wanna-wanna-wanna-wanna-wanna-wanna go homeEmbed
