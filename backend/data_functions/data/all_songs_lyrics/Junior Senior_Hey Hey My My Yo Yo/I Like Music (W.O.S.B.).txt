I Like Music (W.O.S.B.) LyricsHey! Do you like music
Cos here's a song about makin' music (yeah)
I wanna write a song (whoo!)
Now let's see watcha can, do, do do
All the records you embrace
They take you to a magic place
And take your magic place along
And put that feelin'in the song
And keep on workin' through the morning
Workin' through the night
Until you see the light (That's right yeah)
Cos' you can hold it in your hands
And try to understand
If you would, you would, you would
Get down
Cos it's music, not just sound
Keep on working on something better(x3)
Better Bay - bay!
Hmmmmmmm mmmm mm mmm
Ooohh yeah
Keep, keep on, keepin' on
Workin' day and night
Workin' overtime, but it feels so right
Cos' you've been, tryin this for too long
The way to write a perfect song
Just, you just let your fingers play (yeah yeah)
And let the good vibrations come your way (whoo)
And keep on workin' through the morning
Workin' through the night
Until you see the light
You can have it you can lose it
Music gets you through it, find it to the music
Yeah yeah
Get the beat inside you wrote, to find a secret note
If you would, you would, you would
Get down
Cos it's music, not just sound
Keep on working on something better(x2)
Cos we're working on something better
Better Bay - bay!
Working on something better
Keep on working on something better(x2)
Cos we're working on something better
Keep on working on something better
Keep keep keep keep work(fade out)Embed
