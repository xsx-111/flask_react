Hip Hop A Lula LyricsLet's go
Hip Hop A Lula, she's she's my baby
Heard it all before, and it's driving me crazy
But look what I found, just lying in the street
A little piece of rhyme in the middle of a beat
A take me down to the parallel city
Where the music is loud and the boys are pretty
I wanna go, I really wanna go
But excuse me, honey, I'm late for the show
A break it, break it, break it up
Girls say
A break it down
Boys say
A break it up
Girls say
A break it down, yeah!
Well you can say we commit the perfect rhyme (crime)
Looking for a hi-fi moment in time (time)
Setting high, we've been setting low
Cuz nobody told us exactly where to go go go
Hello darling, pardon my French
We've been looking for a guy with a monkey wrench
Hey, talking trash?
Talk into a can
Or into a record and then you can dance
A break it, break it, break it up
Girls say
A break it down
Boys say
A break it up
Girls say
A break it down
Boys say
A break it up
We've been so tired of the booty shakes
So please do something new 'cause you keep us awake
Of ten girls with wrecked their behinds
Giving us the chills up and down our spines
Don't wanna be polluting the airwaves
Send your shockwaves down your spiral staircase
We mix it up, music to your thoughts
Too much good stuff out there to ignore
Cause there's too much good stuff out there to ignore
Too much good stuff out there to ignore (x 4)Embed
