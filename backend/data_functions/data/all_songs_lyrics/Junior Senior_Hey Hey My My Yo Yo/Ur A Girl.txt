Ur A Girl LyricsI know a girl
And I know her name
I'd like to know her better
We're hanging out
And I'm hangin' in
All I can do is try girl
There goes my baby
Down, down the street
She tells me maybe
She wants to meet
A little later
But my ears are still ringing
My heart keeps singing your name
When I close my eyes
Woah you're my girl!
A little later
Later that night
You rollerskater
You roll into sight
We started dancin'
But I don't recall kissin'
So how come I'm missin'
The way that you held me tight
Woah you're my girl!
Keep, keep, keep on rockin'
Yeah!
Take me down
And for the first time
Alone by your side
We hear the wind chimes
And rainfall outside
You move in closer
And the thunder and lightning
Can seem so frightening
But the scariest thing of all
That sure is love
Cuz you're a girl
Woah you're my girl!
Keep!
Keep, keep, keep on rockin'
Yeah!
Oooo!
Just take me down
To the other side of town
Just take me down
To the other side of town
Just take me down
To the other side of town
Just take me down
To the other side of town
Just take me down
To the other side of townEmbed
