Dance, Chance, Romance LyricsOh no, here comes the new girl in town! Uh!
I told you all night how to get the girl
I'll show you how you can make toes curl
But for once I'm gonna try not to cramp my style
You know you're really pretty but I like that smile
And you wanted to dance
So I might take a chance
Hoping for a little romance
Singing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hallelujah, hallelujah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wonder what you're doing tomorrow night
Wonder if we'll ever hold each other tight
Coming to the party standing by the gate
Did I get here early, did I get here late?
And you wanted to dance
So I might take a chance
Hoping for a little romance
Singing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I just wanna be your boyfriend (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mirror mirror on the wall, tell me who's the cutest one of them all
You're looking down, I'm looking up
Walking right past you, my heart begins to stop
And you wanted to dance
So I gave you that glance
And we ended up holding hands
Singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Singing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh hallelujah, hallelujah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We had some good good times at the borderline
When you held my hand
We had some good good times with our new found love
Yeah, I think you understand
But then you let me go
But then you let me go
But then you let me go (Let me go again)
But then you let me go (Let me go again)
But then you let me go (Let me go again)
But then you let me go (Let me go again)
But then you let me go (Let me go again)Embed
