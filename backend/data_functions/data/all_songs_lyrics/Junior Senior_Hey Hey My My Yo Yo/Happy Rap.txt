Happy Rap LyricsWe're going one step forward, two steps back
One step forward, two steps back
We're going one step forward, two steps back
Four steps forward, back on track!
Whoo! (Back on track!)
(Ba-Ba-Back on track! Ooh, yeah!)
We're going one step forward, two steps back
One step forward, two steps back
We're going one step forward, two steps back
Four steps forward, back on track!
Whoo! (Yeah! Haha! C'mon!)
(Ooh! Ow!)
My spelling is bad 'cause I'm so street
And we once made a song called Move Your Feet
We just pass the beat like you pass the meat
Mm! And it's straight from the concrete
From the concrete (Yeah!)
From the concrete
The King Kong concrete
Been running up and down, halls and corridors
From ugly duckling straight to dark horse
Trying to come up with the perfect metaphors
I will show you mine if you show me yours
If you show me yours
If you show me yours
If you show me yours
Still making up the words as we go along
But if we just stick together we can't go wrong
But if you're sitting there thinking this ain't the bomb
Give us a minute and we'll wrap up this song (Ow!)
Wrap up this song (Wrap, wrap)
Wrap up this song
Tryin' to make some sense
In a world that has no answers
My baby, sweet baby
Been tryin' to make some sense
In a world that has no answers
My baby, sweet baby
Hey! Hey!
Whoo! Whoo!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yay! Whoo!
We're going one step forward, two steps back
One step forward, two steps back
We're going one step forward, two steps back
Four steps forward, back on track!
And if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
And if you can't fix it, don't break it!
Ow!
Don't break it! Don't break it!
Don't break it! Uh, don't break it!
Tryin' to make some sense
In a world that has no answers
My baby, sweet baby
We're going one step forward, two steps back
One step forward, two steps back
Oh, baby, sweet baby
I hear a bell ringin' and a voice singin'
Somewhere in my head
And it feels so good to know at least my brain isn't dead
Yeah, 'cause suddenly I remembered what I forgot to forget
That I've been thinking a lot lately about swimming pools
'Cause swimming in one would be really cool
Thinking a lot lately about swimming pools
'Cause swimming in one would be really cool
Yee!Embed
