All We Know Lyrics
We've tried so hard to understand
But we can't
We held the world out in our hands
And you ran away

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all

Now we could follow you back home
But we won't
Is this what you had waited for?
Just to be alone?

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all
You never
You never said
This wasn't what you wanted
Was it? Was it?
This isn't what you wanted
This isn't what you wanted

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all7Embed
