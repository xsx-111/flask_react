Whoa Lyrics
I've hoped for change, it gets better everyday
I've hoped for change but still I feel the same

There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh

We're doing fine and it gets better every time
We're doing fine but I'll let you decide

There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh
And I'll confess that I can be a little selfish
Yeah, I'll admit I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again

And we got everybody singing

And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh
And we got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh

And I'll confess that I can be a little selfish
I can, I can
Yeah, I'll admit I don't want you to get me through this
I don't want to start over again3Embed
