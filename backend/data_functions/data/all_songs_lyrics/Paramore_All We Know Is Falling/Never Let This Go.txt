Never Let This Go Lyrics
Maybe if my heart stops beating it won't hurt this much
And never will I have to answer again to anyone

Please, don't get me wrong

Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you
Whoa

One day you'll get sick of saying that everything's alright
And by then I'm sure I'll be pretending just like I am tonight

Please, don't get me wrong

Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you
Let this go
Let this go

But I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you
And I'll never let this go (Never let this go)
But I can't find the words to tell you
That now I feel like I don't know you5Embed
