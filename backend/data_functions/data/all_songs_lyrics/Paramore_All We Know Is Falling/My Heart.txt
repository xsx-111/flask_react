My Heart Lyrics
I am finding out
That maybe I was wrong
That I've fallen down
And I can't do this alone

Stay with me
This is what I need, please

Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
Oh-oh

I am nothing now
And it's been so long
Since I've heard a sound
The sound of my only hope

This time
I will be listening
Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you (Sing it back to you)
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
Oh, oh

(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)

This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you, oh
(Yeah)
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours
(My heart, it beats for you)
This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours
(Please, don't go now)
This heart, it beats
(Please, don't fade away)
Beats for only you
(Please, don't go now)
My heart
(Please, don't fade away)
My heart is yours
(Please, don't go now)
(Please, don't fade away)
My heart is yours
(Please, don't go now)
(Please, don't fade away)
My heart is yours
(Please, don't go)
(Please, don't fade away)
(Please, don't go now)
(Please, don't fade away)
My heart is...5Embed
