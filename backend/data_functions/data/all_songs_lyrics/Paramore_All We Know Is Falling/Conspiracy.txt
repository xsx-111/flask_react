Conspiracy Lyrics
Please, speak softly for they will hear us
And they'll find out why we don't trust them
Speak up, dear, 'cause I cannot hear you
I need to know why we don't trust them

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

Where can I turn? 'Cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty, I'm so unsure
Tell me why I feel so alone
'Cause I need to know to whom do I owe

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

I thought that we'd make it
Because you said that we'd make it through
And when all security fails
Will you be there to help me through?
Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh

I've lost my power8Embed
