Franklin Lyrics
And when we get home, I know we won't be home at all
This place we live, it is not where we belong
And I miss who we were and the town that we could call our own
Going back to get away after everything has changed

'Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive
Everything has changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?
Everything has changed
'Cause you help me push aside all that I have left behind
Everything is changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

So we stand here now and no one knows us at all
I won't get used to this, I won't get used to being gone
And going back won't feel the same if we aren't staying
Going back to get away after everything has changed

'Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive
Everything has changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?
Everything has changed
'Cause you help me push aside all that I have left behind
Everything is changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?
(Taking up our time)
(Taking up our time)
(Taking up our time)
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
Taking up our time

'Cause you remind me of a time
When we were so alive
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?6Embed
