Here We Go Again Lyrics
And here we go again
With all the things we said and not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret so we just take it back
These words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not

And here we go again
With all the things we did and now I'm wondering
Just who would I have been to be the one attached
At all times to your hip?
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Oh-oh
(No, I'm not)

I'll write you to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not
(No, I'm not)
I'm not
I'm not

(And here we go again)
(With all the things we said and not a minute spent)
(To think that we'd regret so we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
No
(So we just take it back)
I'm not
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
I'm not
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back...)2Embed
