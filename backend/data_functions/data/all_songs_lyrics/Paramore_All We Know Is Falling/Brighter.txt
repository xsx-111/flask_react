Brighter Lyrics
So this is how it goes
Well, I, I would have never known
And if it ends today
Well, I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

Well, this is not your fault
But if I'm without you then I will feel so small
And if you have to go
Well, always know that you shine brighter than anyone does

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time
If you run away now
Will you come back around?
And if you ran away
I'd still wave goodbye watching you shine bright

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

(You shine bright)
And I'll wave goodbye watching you shine bright  (You shine bright)
(You shine bright)
And I'll wave goodbye tonight5Embed
