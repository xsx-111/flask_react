Centre for Holy Wars Lyrics
Such a dreamlike view from the ceiling
Where every feeling is part of the fall, uh-huh
Kneeling out on the front lawn
Rise to occasions, grass stains and all, uh-huh

Exactly where we are
At the Centre for Holy Wars
Hope it never comes down again
Floating in the air
With the stars of the holy wars
Hope it never comes down again

Nearly but never arrested
But oh, Contessa, asleep in the stall, uh-huh
Still you somehow have bested
The other contestants, grass stains and all, uh-huh

Exactly where we are
At the Centre for Holy Wars
Hope it never comes down again
Floating in the air
With the stars of the holy wars
Hope it never comes down again

Exactly where we are
At the Centre for Holy Wars
Hope it never comes down again
Floating in the air
With the stars of the holy wars
Hope it never comes down again

'Cause hope grows greener than grass stains
Hope grows greener than grass stains
Hope grows greener than grass stains
Hope grows greener than grass stains (Grass stains and all)
Hope grows greener than grass stains (Grass stains and all)
Hope grows greener than grass stains (Grass stains and all)
Hope grows greener than grass stainsEmbed
