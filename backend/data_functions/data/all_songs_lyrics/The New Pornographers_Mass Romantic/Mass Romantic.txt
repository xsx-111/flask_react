Mass Romantic Lyrics
Mass romantic fool wears Foster Grants
His books on tape ring true
Like everyone wants to say "I love you"
To someone on the radio, radio
His choice of the hallowed stars
Now the one true loves, and author of
"My Life Among the Kids Who Go to Shows"
This is not the way

In the streetlight dawn
In the streetlight dawn
This street turns on

Mass romantic fool, separated by sheets
When the curtain calls you speaking
On the themes of stolen virtue
Missing from the radio, radio
Now this romantic duel's into the streets
Bon appetit, you've eaten me alive you realize
This is not the way
In the streetlight dawn
In the streetlight dawn
This beat turns on

Mass romantic fool, separated by sheets
When the curtain calls you speaking
On the themes of stolen virtue
Missing from the radio, radio
Now this romantic duel's into the streets
Bon appetit, you've eaten me alive you realize
This is not the way

In the streetlight dawn
In the streetlight dawn
This beat turns on

This boy's life among the electrical lights
This boy's life among the electrical lights
This boy's life among the electrical lights
This boy's life among the electrical lights
This boy's life among the electrical lights
This boy's life among the electrical lights
This boy's life among the electrical lights2Embed
