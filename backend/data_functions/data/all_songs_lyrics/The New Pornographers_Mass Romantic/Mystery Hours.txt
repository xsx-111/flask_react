Mystery Hours Lyrics
Always the true one, calm, selective
Staking a claim among the young defectives
Far off under the nighttime, baby
Crawl into the wave
Got to be cool now, unprotected
You come around every day to collect me
Far off into the nighttime, baby
Crawl into the wave
Come on, give it to me

Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours

But officers
The rumbling
The sound of the collective crumbling
Around to the ground
Surrender the town
I call out the numbers
The rumble of collected thunder
Today, hey, the wages are down
Come on, give it to me
Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours

Mystery hours
Mystery hours
Mystery hours
Mystery hours

But officers
The rumbling
The sound of the collective crumbling
Around to the ground
Surrender the town
I call out the numbers
The rumble of collected thunder
Today, hey, the wages are down
Come on, give it to me

Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hours
Yes, those mystery hoursEmbed
