The Body Says No Lyrics
People of Earth, we have heard your station
Sold your song to the United Nations
All on a debt to the heads of state, yeah
What could you do in this situation?

Throw the voice you know
Wouldn't say yes, the body says no, no no no
The body says no, no no no
I said, "Man, can you believe she didn't need me?"

Heavens to Betsy, come on, let's see
What could be worse than the wheel of history
Rolling up over the rooms you've prayed in?
What could you do in the situation?

Throw the voice you know
Wouldn't say yes, the body says no, no no no
The body says no, no no no
I said, "Man, can you believe she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her, too?"
Man, can you believe she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her, too?
Man, can you believe she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her, too?
Than I needed her, too
Am I repeating myself to tell you
Dreaming is what's left of psychedelia?
Caught in the laugh of an outlaw nation
What can you do in the situation?

Throw the voice you know
Wouldn't say yes, the body says no, no no no
The body says no, no no no
I said, "Man, can you believe she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her too?"
Man, can you believe she didn't need me
Anymore than I needed her too?
Than I needed her, too
Than I needed her, too
Than I needed her, too
Man, can you believe she didn't need me
I said, "Man, can you believe she didn't need me?"
I said, "Man, can you believe she didn't need me?"Embed
