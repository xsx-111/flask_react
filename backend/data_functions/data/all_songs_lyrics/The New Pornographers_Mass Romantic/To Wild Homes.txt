To Wild Homes Lyrics
First my trusty voice cracked, like it's not plain to see
A sidewalk step defaults on my debt to the order of society
Behold our first rate lady, as if you hadn't guessed
The homemade queen of every homecoming not so gently laid to rest
And then outside her courtyard after entering your plea
You strike the right ingredient and chew the scenery

How many times must we say, this kind of inflation cannot kill us
Our backers use versions we used to unwind with
The threads of an argument lost
How many times must we say, this kind of inflation cannot kill us
Our backers use versions we used to unwind with
The threads of an argument lost

To wild homes we go
To wild homes we return
To wild homes we go

To wild homes we go
To wild homes we return
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we return
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we return
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we return
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we go
To wild homes we return
To wild homes we goEmbed
