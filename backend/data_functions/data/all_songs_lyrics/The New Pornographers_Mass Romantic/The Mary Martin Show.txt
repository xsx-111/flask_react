The Mary Martin Show Lyrics
With a map of the end times
I can follow a straight line
To the old Mary Martin Show
Should we go?
Since we learned the guitar parts
To the music that once started it off

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now
Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now

With the musical guest on
You were singing the theme song
To the old Mary Martin Show
Did you know?
With your cameras in action
With your network connections, it's go

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now
Mary Martin, the hope of every actor in their role
To aim far too, far too low
To aim far too, far too low
To aim far too, far too low

All the rain on that morning
Was so shiny and boring
It was gold, Mary Martin, know
It was gold
With a book of guitar chords
Some alright to good words, it sold

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now
Mary Martin, the hope of every punchline that you throw

To aim far too, far too low
To aim far too, far too low
To aim far too, far too low

Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now
Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now
Mary Martin, they don't come any closer than that now
The Mary Martin Show
The Mary Martin Show
The Mary Martin, they don't come any closer, closer Embed
