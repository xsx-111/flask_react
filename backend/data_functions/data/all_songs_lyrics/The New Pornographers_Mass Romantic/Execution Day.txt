Execution Day Lyrics
Oh blast, I drank the wrong draft down
Two sips from your crown
The drops you left for me
Am I so easily appeased?
Madrigal, why didn't you come out today, you promised to play
Marigold, why didn't you come out today, we promised to play fair

You were already there
You were ready to cast our fate to the wind
To try your hand at everything
What a cinch it would have been had we been there
Those trials are held for tuning in, and smiles are stretched to be shown
So when you claim to see for miles, it's not that I believe is true
Yes, trials are held for tuning in, and smiles are stretched to be worn
So when you claim to see for miles, you don't, but I believe you do

On this day which began as Execution Day
And sure enough became Execution Day

On this day which began as Execution Day
And sure enough became Execution Day
On this day which began as Execution Day
And sure enough became Execution Day
On this day which began as Execution Day
And true to form became Execution DayEmbed
