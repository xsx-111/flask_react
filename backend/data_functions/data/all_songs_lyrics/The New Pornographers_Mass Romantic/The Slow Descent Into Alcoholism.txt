The Slow Descent Into Alcoholism Lyrics
I say, my, my slow descent
Into alcoholism it went
To my head, where I really need it
With the views that remain untreated

I say my, my, my, my slow descent
Into alcoholism it went

Something like this song
Something like this song
Something like this song
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central

I say my ever loosening grip
On the commonest courtesies slipped
From my hands, where I really need her
When I need change for the parking meters

I say my, my, my, my slow descent
Into alcoholism it went
Something like this song
Something like this song
Something like this song
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central

Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central

Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Salvation holdout central
Ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huhEmbed
