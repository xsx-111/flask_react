When This Is Over LyricsI wake up
Beside you, in mom's car
I try to get you out
You're strapped to the backseat
I am too
The car is rolling into water
Why are we
Strapped to our seats
Trapped
What did we do?
I cleaned my room just as she asked me to
Filling up, dirty water
My chin's up, going under
You're still asleep, baby brother
I'll wake you up when this is over
The car is rolling into water
Why are we
Strapped to our seats
Trapped
What did we do?
I brushed my teeth just as she asked me to
This is it, baby brother
One more breath together
We're almost under water
Where is mom?
I miss her
The car has rolled into the water
Why are we dying in this way
What did we do?
I was nice to him
Her boyfriend, this is stupid
When people come to search the lake
We'll be found in our pajamas
They will see
A big mistake is all that this must beEmbed
