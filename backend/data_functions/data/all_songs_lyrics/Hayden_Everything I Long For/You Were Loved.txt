You Were Loved LyricsAnalyzed, thought it over too much
Criticize myself way too much
I will utilize the energy I have left
To say goodbye
To you and I will survive
Cause I lost what I once found in you
Take your smoke
Coughing choking, there is no hope
Take your records away
I hate folk
Pack your bags and don't forget your coat
It's cold outside, but you'll survive
Cause I lost what I once found in youEmbed
