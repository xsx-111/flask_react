In September Lyrics
I don't need to take this shit from you
I don't want you calling me up at two
Just to tell me that some guy you met who
While at a party, told you that he loved you

And I don't need to know this, need to know this
And I don't wanna know this, wanna know this
Tell me the way they are with you
Tell me exactly what they do
Things that you say don't need to prove
That what I have is much to lose

And I don't need to take this shit from you
And I don't want you calling me up at two
Just to tell me, that some guy you met who
While at a party, came just looking at you

And we never should have said that, in September
We shouldn't go away but stay together
Tell me the way to be with you
Tell me exactly what to do
Things that you say don't need to prove
That what I have is love for you
For you
For youEmbed
