Hardly Lyrics
Could I be the one thing
Missing from your life
And from your everyday?
I need you to be beside me
Why don't you call me and we'll see?
I see you having coffee
You are almost beside me
Laughing with your friends
I tell Lorraine to look at you
I tell her I need to tell you

I don't know you
But I want to
I just can't leave here
Without telling you --
Just how lonely I've been lately
You are just as lonely, maybe?
We should go out for some coffee

I wonder how I can
Give you my phone number
And not be so afraid?
I ask Lorraine to give it to you
When I go to the washroom
I return to the table
I look, but I'm unable
To find you anywhere
I ask Lorraine to look for you
I tell her I need to tell you
Don't know you
But I want to
I just can't leave here
Without telling you --
Just how lonely I've been lately
You are just as lonely, maybe?
We should go out for some coffee

On the way out the door
Lorraine lets me know that she went up to you
And gave you my number and said
'call him or else he'll be sad.'
And I waited, for two weeks and
I realized that you'd never call me
How could I have been so stupid
I should have gone up to you and
Told you myself how you make me feelEmbed
