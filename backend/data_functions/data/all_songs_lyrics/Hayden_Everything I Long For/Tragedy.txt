Tragedy LyricsBroken bottle won't hurt me
Nothing worse than I have dreamed
Gunshot in my chest you'll leave
I can take that, you will see
Late at night is when I dream
Horrible things are what I see
Hard for me to believe
I wake up and I want free
Car crash highway tragedy
Nothing worse than I have dreamed
Loss of my best friend I grieve
I can take that, you will see
Late at night is when I dream
Horrible things are what I see
Hard for me to believe
I wake up and I want freeEmbed
