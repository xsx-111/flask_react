Celebration LyricsWe are moved by your radiance
I have brought you this gold crown
I spliced its flowers together
Only the bees looking for flowers in spring go freely through the cool grass
Your voice is distinct in my ears
Your voice is distinct in my ears
Now blessed lady
Now blessed lady
Now blessed lady, take this!
Embellish your gold hair
No man alive approaches my good luck to ride with you
Though your face I never see, may my love go throughout life
As strong at the finish as now, at the turning point
This comes from a faithful handEmbed
