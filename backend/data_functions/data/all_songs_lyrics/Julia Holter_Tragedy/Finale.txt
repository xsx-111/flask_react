Finale LyricsCould you shift my weight a little
And prop my head straighter?
Ah! What I most want
What I have spoken aloud
Is eating me alive
Hold me up by my wrists, please
My delicate wrists
Let my hair loose down my shoulders
Something has melted in my limbs
Ah! What I most want
What I have spoken aloud
Is eating me alive
Hold me up by my wrists, please
My delicate wrists
The combs, take them off, please
Let my hair loose down my shoulders
Something has melted in my limbs
Ah! What I most want
What I have spoken aloud
Is eating me alive
Hold me up by my wrists, please
My delicate wrists
What I most want
All leave in silence
All leave in silence
All leave in silence
All leave in silence
All leave in silence
Could you shift my weight a little
What I most want
What I have spoken aloud
And prop my head straighter?
What I most want
What I most wantEmbed
