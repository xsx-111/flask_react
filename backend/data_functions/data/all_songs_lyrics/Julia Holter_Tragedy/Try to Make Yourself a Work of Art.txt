Try to Make Yourself a Work of Art Lyrics
Try to make yourself a work of art, like me
You can't! See?
Only me
What your mind, so sound and safe, cannot know
Only me
What your mind, so sound and safe, cannot know
Try to make yourself a work of art, like me
You can't! See?
Only me
What your mind, so sound and safe, cannot know
This was my plot

Try to make yourself a work of art, like me
You can't! See?
Only me
What your mind, so sound and safe, cannot know
(A mind, so sound and safe)
What your mind, so sound and safe, cannot know
This was my plot

A mind, so sound and safe
Only me
A mind, so sound and safeEmbed
