So Lillies Lyrics
So lillies, so tenderly
When my dreams reflect them
Seeming fragrant, ah!
Were sun in their grief!
Your white
Of the dream
Unbinding my hands with my head
While enclosed in your violet grace
So lillies, so tenderly
When my dreams reflect them
Seeming fragrant, ah!
Were sun in their grief!
Your white
Of the dream
Unbinding my hands with my head
While enclosed in your violet grace
So lillies, so tenderly
When my dreams reflect them
Seeming fragrant, ah!
Were sun in their grief!
Your white

So lost
Boredom and fountains
Wickedly, eyes
When will they turn around?
When will they turn around?
So lost
Boredom and fountains
So lost
