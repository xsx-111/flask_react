Because of You LyricsYou toss your head and turn your eyes when storm clouds brew
You look around to quick relate to a good time you knew
Then the dark clouds break away and a rainbow comes on through
The sun I see only shines for me because of you
Before this time we both saw blind in spite of fact
We lost our place and made no haste to make contact
Now by what we gain the taste of one and two
I'm satisfied beneath my pride because of you
And now the worth of living wealth is more in the end
And now the price of simple things is not so much to spend
So close your eyes and pick a place to fly away
And think of reasons why this warmth is here to stay
Then the dark clouds break away and a rainbow comes on through
The sun I see only shines for me because of you
Yes, the sun I see only shines for me because of youEmbed
