Where My Love Lies Asleep LyricsWhere my love lies asleep
There's no chains to her spirit
As she enters the doorway
Of dreams drifting free
Lightning's flash, rivers roar
Round the island she's sleeping
And the echoes soul
That speaks where she's sleeping
Where my love lies asleep
There's no past nor tomorrow
Only treasures to keep
There's no fears there to borrow
(Harmonica break)
Through the hallways of wonder
Down the steps of the deep
And the secrets that drum
Where my love lies asleep
Past the suns in the morning
Past the stars in their sleep
And the worlds that are near
Where my love lies asleepEmbed
