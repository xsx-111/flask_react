One in a Hundred LyricsDon't you come down
Don't you feel bad
Even though your dreams are of
The things you've never had
Close to the earth
Near to the sun
Reflecting your own life
You can see that you
Can be more than one
Hear the bells ring, morning has come
Over the town the morning star fades in the dawn
Voices of time bringing surprise
Voices that sing in waking moments
To look into life's eye
Aren't you glad it's another day
Look and tell
So you thought you would run away
But you know that way too well
Rhythms of rhyme
Seasons shall say
To look at a longer life now
A longer yesterday
Don't you come down
You know you're the one
Looking at tomorrow
Let your your troubles
Fade and fly into the sunEmbed
