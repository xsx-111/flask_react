I Left My Heart In San Francisco LyricsThe loveliness of Paris
(applause)
(Bravo! This guy can really sing.)
Seems somehow sadly gay
(applause)
(Thank you so much, you're really wonderful. We're very lucky-)
The glory that was Rome
Is of another day
I've been terribly alone
And forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going back to my city by the BayEmbed
