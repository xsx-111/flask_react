Death Cab For Cutie LyricsThat night Cutie called a cab
-Baby don't do it
She left her East Side room so drab
-Baby don't do it
She went out on the town
Knowing it would make her lover frown
-Death cab for Cutie
-Death cab for Cutie
Someone's going to make you pay your fare
The cab was racing through the night
-Baby don't do it
His eyes in the mirror, keeping Cutie in sight
-Baby don't do it
When he saw Cutie it gave him a thrill
Don't you know Baby, curves can kill
-Death cab for Cutie
-Death cab for Cutie
Someone's going to make you pay your fare
Cutie, don't you play with fate
Don't leave your lover alone
If you go out on this date
His heart will turn to stone
Bad girl Cutie, what have you done
-Baby don't do it
Slipping sliding down Highway 31
-Baby don't do it
The traffic lights changed from green to red
They tried to stop but they both wound up dead
-Death cab for Cutie
-Death cab for Cutie
Someone's going to make you pay your fare
Someone's going to make you pay your fare
Someone's going to make you pay your fare
Someone's going to make you pay your fare1Embed
