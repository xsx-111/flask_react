Piggy Bank Love LyricsShe
Runs a Green Shield library
Saves
Everything she's got
For her wedding day
Save all day
That's okay
But give me some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Piggy bank love
Piggy bank love
She
Dreams of cheap land, children, towels
Labelled 'his' and 'hers'
Plaster ducks in pairs
Flying up the stairs
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Piggy bank love
Piggy bank love
Doo-doo-doo-doo-dooh
Doo-doo-doo-doo-dooh
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-oo-ooh
That's okay
Save all day
We'll
Make a mother happy with
Tinted photographs
Of her wedding day
Smile all day
Make them laugh
But give me some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Piggy bank love
Piggy bank love
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'
Some
Of that piggy bank lovin'Embed
