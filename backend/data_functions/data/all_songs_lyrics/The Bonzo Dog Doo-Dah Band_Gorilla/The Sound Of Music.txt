The Sound Of Music LyricsSpoken:
Life's like that isn't it?
Only the other day I was walking in the West End
And suddenly I was set upon by hordes of fans and admirers who wanted to touch my clothes
So I took sanctuary in a nearby cinema
And normally of course I don't go in but
That day I saw something that really moved me
I'd like to share this wonderful experience with you
It was "The Sound of Music"
Sung:
The hills are alive with the sound of music!Embed
