The Equestrian Statue LyricsThere once was a very famous man
On his famous horse he'd ride through the land
The people used to see him everywhere
When he died, they put a statue in the square
(hooray)
Here comes the Equestrian Statue
Prancing up and down the square
Little old ladies stop 'n' say
"Well, I declare!"
Once a month on a Friday there's a man
With a mop and bucket in his hand
To him it's just another working day
So he whistles as he rubs and scrubs away
(hooray)
Here comes the Equestrian Statue
Prancing up and down the square
Little old ladies stop 'n' say
"Well, I declare!"
It's a sight to bring you joy, you feel so gay
And it's guaranteed to brighten up your day
If it's gray
(hooray)
Here comes the Equestrian Statue
Prancing up and down the square
Little old ladies stop 'n' say
"Well, I declare!"
It's a sight to bring you joy, you feel so gay
And it's guaranteed to brighten up your day
If it's gray
Feel so gay
Feel so gay
Feel so gay
Feel so gay
Feel so gayEmbed
