I Just Shot John Lennon LyricsIt was the fearful night of December 8th
He was returning home from the studio late
He had perceptively known that it wouldn't be nice
Because in 1980, he paid the price
John Lennon died, John Lennon died, John Lennon died
John Lennon died, John Lennon died, John Lennon died
With a Smith and Wesson .38
John Lennon's life was no longer a debate
He should have stayed at home
He should have never cared
And the man who took his life declared, he said:
"I Just Shot John Lennon!"
He said: "I Just Shot John Lennon!"
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight
It was a sad and sorry and sickening night
Oh a sad and sorry and sickening sight
It was a sad and sorry and sickening night
"I Just Shot John Lennon!"
He said, "I Just Shot John Lennon!"
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight
It was a sad and sorry and sickening night
Oh a sad and sorry and sickening sight
It was a sad and sorry and sickening nightEmbed
