The Rebels LyricsSeems like yesterday we were sixteen
We were the rebels of the rebel scene
He wore Doc Martens in the sun
Drinking vintage cider having fun
We were drinking vintage cider having fun
It wasn't often, that we'd fight at all
It wasn't often
It wasn't often, that we'd fight at all
It wasn't often
We wore Doc Martens in the snow
(We will never go)
Paint our toe-nails black and let our hair grow
(We will never grow)
What I am now's what I was then
(We will never know)
I am not more acceptable than them
But, I am not more acceptable than them
It wasn't often, that we'd fight at all
It wasn't often
It wasn't often, that we'd fight at all
It wasn't often
It wasn't often. 
Seems like yesterday we were sixteen
We were the rebels of the rebel sceneEmbed
