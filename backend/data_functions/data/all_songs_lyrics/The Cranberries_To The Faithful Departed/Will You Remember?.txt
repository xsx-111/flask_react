Will You Remember? LyricsWill you remember the dress I wore?
Will you remember my face?
Will you remember the lipstick I wore?
This world is a wonderful place
Will you remember the black limousine?
Will you remember champagne?
Will you remember the things that we see?
I will return here again
Will you remember the flowers in my hand?
Will you remember my hair?
Will you remember the future we planned?
The world is not waiting out there
I won't remember the dress I wore
I won't remember champagne
I won't remember the things that we swore
I will just love you in vain
Will you remember?
Will you recall?
Will you remember?Embed
