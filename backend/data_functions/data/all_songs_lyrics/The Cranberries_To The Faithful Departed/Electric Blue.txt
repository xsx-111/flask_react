Electric Blue LyricsElectric blue eyes, where did you come from
Electric blue eyes, who sent you
Electric blue eyes, always be near me
Electric blue eyes, I need you
Domine, Domine, Deus
Domine, Adiuva Me
Domine, Domine, Deus
Domine, Adiuva Me
Hey, eh, hey, eh
If you should go, You should know I love you
If you should go, You should know I'm here
Always be near me, guardian angel
Always be near me, there's no fear
Domine, Domine, Deus
Domine, Adiuva Me
Domine, Domine, Deus
Domine, Adiuva Me
Hey, eh, hey, ehEmbed
