Dayton, Ohio - 1903 Lyrics
Sing a song of long ago
When things were green and movin' slow
And people'd stop to say hello
Or they'd say "hi" to you

Would you like to come over for tea
With the missus and me?
It's a real nice way
To spend the day
In Dayton, Ohio
On a lazy Sunday afternoon in 1903

Sing a song of long ago
When things could grow
And days flowed quietly
The air was clean and you could see
And folks were nice to you

Would you like to come over for tea
With the missus and me?
It's a real nice way
To spend the day
In Dayton, Ohio
On a lazy Sunday afternoon in 1903
