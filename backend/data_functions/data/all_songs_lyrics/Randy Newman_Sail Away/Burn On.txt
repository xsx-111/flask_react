Burn On Lyrics
There's a red moon rising on the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake
There's a red moon rising on the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake

There's an oil barge winding down the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake
There's an oil barge winding down the Cuyahoga River
Rolling into Cleveland to the lake

Cleveland, city of light, city of magic
Cleveland, city of light, you're calling me
Cleveland, even now I can remember
'Cause the Cuyahoga River goes smoking through my dreams

Burn on, big river, burn on
Burn on, big river, burn on

Now the Lord can make you tumble
The Lord can make you turn
The Lord can make you overflow
But the Lord can't make you burn
Burn on, big river, burn on
Burn on, big river, burn on1Embed
