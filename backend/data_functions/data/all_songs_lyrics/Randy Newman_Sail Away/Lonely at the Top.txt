Lonely at the Top Lyrics
I've been around the world
Had my pick of any girl
You'd think I'd be happy, but I'm not
Everybody knows my name
But it's just a crazy game

Oh, it's lonely at the top

Listen to the band play, they're playing just for me
Listen to the people paying just for me
All the applause and all the praise
And all the money I have made

Oh, it's lonely at the top

Listen all you fools out there
Go on and love me, I don't care
 
Oh, it's lonely at the topEmbed
