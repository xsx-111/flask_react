He Gives Us All His Love Lyrics
He gives us all his love
He gives us all his love
He's smiling down on us from up above
And he's givin' us all his love

He knows how hard we're tryin'
He hears the babies cryin'
He sees the old folks dyin'
He gives us all his love

Now if you need someone to talk to
You can always talk to him
And if you need someone to lean on
You can lean on him

He gives us all his love
He gives us all his love
He's smiling down on us from up above
And he's givin' us all his love
He's smiling down on us from up above
And he's givin' us all his loveEmbed
