Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others) Lyrics
Don't want to judge nobody, don't want to be judged
Don't want to touch nobody, don't want to be touched
Don't want to hurt nobody, don't want to be hurt
Don't want to treat nobody like they was dirt

But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

Don't want to shoot nobody, don't want to be shot
Don't want to buy nobody, don't want to be bought
Don't want to bury nobody, don't want to be buried
Don't want to marry nobody if they're already married

But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

Don't want to burn nobody, don't want to be burned
Don't want to learn from nobody what I got to unlearn
Don't want to cheat nobody, don't want to be cheated
Don't want to defeat nobody if they already been defeated
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

Don't want to wink at nobody, I don't want to be winked at
Don't want to be used by nobody for a doormat
Don't want to confuse nobody, don't want to be confused
Don't want to amuse nobody, I don't want to be amused

But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

Don't want to betray nobody, don't want to be betrayed
Don't want to play with nobody, don't want to be waylaid
Don't want to miss nobody, don't want to be missed
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist

But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto youEmbed
