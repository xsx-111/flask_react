When You Gonna Wake Up Lyrics
God don’t make no promises that He don’t keep
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat and Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think He’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold
They tell you, “Time is money,” as if your life was worth its weight in gold

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

There’s a Man up on a cross and He’s been crucified for you
Beleive in  His power, it's all about you got to do

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?Embed
