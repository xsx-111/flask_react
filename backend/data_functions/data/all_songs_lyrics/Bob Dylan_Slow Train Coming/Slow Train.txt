Slow Train Lyrics
Sometimes
I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions
Are they lost or are they found?
Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
All their earthly principles they're going to have to abandon?
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

I had a woman
Down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, "Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic"
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

All that foreign oil
Controlling American soil
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walking around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and Paris
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
Man's ego is inflated
His laws are outdated,
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turning over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

Big-time negotiators
False healers and woman-haters
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

People starving and thirsting
Grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say, "Lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions"
They talk about a life of brotherly love; show me someone who knows how to live it
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
Well, my baby went to Illinois
With some bad-talking boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it
I don't care about economy
I don't care about astronomy
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend1Embed
