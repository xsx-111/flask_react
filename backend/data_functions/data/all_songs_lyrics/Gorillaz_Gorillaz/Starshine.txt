Starshine Lyrics
Starshine, never gonna find me
Starshine, they ain't gonna find me
Starshine, never gonna find me
Starshine never gonna find me

Stand easy with myself, oh, myself
Jumping up, I'm low, low, low, low
Show me down

Starshine, never gonna find me
Starshine, they ain't gonna find me
Starshine, never gonna find me
Starshine, never gonna find me7Embed
