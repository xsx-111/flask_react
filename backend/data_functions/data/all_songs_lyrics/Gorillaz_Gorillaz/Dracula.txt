Dracula Lyrics
I am a vampire!
(Percentage of us tow the line
The rest of us is out of reach
Everybody, party time
Some of us will never sleep again)
Rest is good for the blood!

Percentage of us tow the line
The rest of us is out of reach
Everybody, party time
Some of us will never sleep again

Dracula
Dracula, Dracula
Dracula, Dracula

Percentage of us tow the line
The rest of us is out of reach
Everybody, party time
Some of us will never sleep again

Dracula
Dracula, Dracula
Dracula, Dracula2Embed
