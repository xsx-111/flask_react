Punk Lyrics
Try to see myself what goes on
Make it up myself, I'll never
Always told my thoughts aloud
Then another day I shut up

Back to the sand
Doing what you can
Bound to be gone
Damned a loser

Found out right then they were fed up
Cause everybody said to shut up

Yeah!

Thought that you might care what goes on
Try to say "what up?"; I'm fed up
Everybody said I shoot up
But I just gotta tell them what up?

Down with the sun
I knew that I was done
Did it to my self
Did it to my self, and then
Everybody's stirring shit up
Cause everybody tells me "shut up"11Embed
