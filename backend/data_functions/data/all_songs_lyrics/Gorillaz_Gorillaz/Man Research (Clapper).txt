Man Research (Clapper) Lyrics
This is a breakfast club!

Bring me coffee on the node
I see the tafil in the sand
I got sunshine, I got you
Eh-eh-eh-eh
There's nothing, nothing I can do (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (You're here, oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (You're here, oh)

Bring me junkie in the lawn
He said nothing in the tongue
Keep that man away from my door
To kill that model from my door
Oh, yeah
Must kill that mongrel from my door (From my door)
