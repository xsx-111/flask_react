Tomorrow Comes Today Lyrics

Everybody's here with me
We've got no camera to see
Don't think I'm all in this world
The camera won't let me roll
The verdict doesn't love our soul
The digital won't let me go

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today

Stereo, I want it on
It's taken me far too long
Don't think I'm all in this world
Don't think I'll be here too long
Don't think I'll be here too long
(Don't think I'll be here too long)
I don't think I'll be here too long
(I don't think I'll be here too long)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today

(Don't think I'm not all in this world)
(Don't think I'm not all in this world)
(Don't think I'm not all in this world)
(Don't think I'm not all in this world)17Embed
