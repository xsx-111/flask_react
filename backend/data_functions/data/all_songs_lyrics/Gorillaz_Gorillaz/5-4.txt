5/4 Lyrics
Magic for me
Magic makes no sound
It good for me
It good for me underground
Magic on me
Really got me down
Invade the city
It made my heart beat no sound

Beat no sound
Beat no sound (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Beat no sound
Beat no sound
Beat no sound (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And let me tell myself
Tell on

She turned my dad on
She turned my dad on, dad on, dad on

Magic for me
Magic, get me through
With magic money
People seem to walk through you
Magic's funny
Magic, get me through
All good for me
When people seem to always walk through you
Walk through you (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you

And let me tell myself
Tell on

She turned my dad on
She turned my dad on, dad on, dad on

She made me kill myself
Come on
Come on

She turned my dad on
Come on
She turned my dad on
Come on
She turned my dad on
She turned my dad on, dad on, dad on22Embed
