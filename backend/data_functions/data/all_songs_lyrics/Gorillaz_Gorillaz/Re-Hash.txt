Re-Hash Lyrics
It's a sweet sensation over the dub
A one-off situation that don't wanna stop
It's the drugstore soul boy over the dub
With the sweetest inspiration, he don't wanna stop

'Cause it's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
(It's, yeah) It's the money, or stop
It's a sweet sensation over the dub
A one-off situation that don't wanna stop
It's the drugstore soul boy over the dub
With the sweetest inspiration, he don't wanna stop

It's money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
It's the money, or stop
(It's, yeah) It's the money, or stop
