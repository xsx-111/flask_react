Sound Check (Gravity) Lyrics
Gravity-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay on me
Never let me down gently
Never lea-lea-lea-lea-lea-leave with me
Never let me go no, no
Gravity-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know love-love-love-love
I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know love-love-love-love

I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you

I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know love-love-love-love
Gravity-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay on me
Never let me down gently
Never lea-lea-lea-lea-lea-ay with me
Never let me go no, no
Gravity-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay on me
Never let me down gently
Gravity-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay with me
Never let me go no, no
Gravity-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay on me
Never let me down gently
Gravity-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay with me
Never let me go no, no

I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you

I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know, love is breaking
I don't know love-love-love-love12Embed
