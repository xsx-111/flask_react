Slow Country Lyrics
City life
Calling me all the time
Me and my soul
Geared to attack
Never get another chance
So what you doing
Gotta get money
Can't quite do it

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

Shit  night life
Be trying not to laugh though
You won't get money
From doing what you loving
I'm moving out of city
Victim of a second chance
Get a lot of problems
We kicked a lot of them
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness, no not the loneliness6Embed
