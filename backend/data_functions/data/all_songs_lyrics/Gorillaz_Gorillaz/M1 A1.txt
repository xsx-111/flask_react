M1 A1 Lyrics
"Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello? Is anyone there?"

M1 A1
Thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz got the bass drum
Gorillaz say they want some, some

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-hey
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-hey
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-hey
La-la-la-la-la-la-wow!
M1 A1
Thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz with the beat, ya'll
So in went the seller

We go, M1 A1
It's a thousand miles an hour
Gorillaz with the bass drum
Keep that sound

Wake it out, check it out, 2001 craze...
D'ya hear that?
I said, M1 A1

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-hey
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-hey
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-hey
La-la-la-la-la-la-wow!
