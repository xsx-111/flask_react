Left Hand Suzuki Method Lyrics
Feel the impact

Katei de mainichi
Gakushuuyou no record wo kikasete
Ongakuteki sense wo sodateru
Sore ni yotte, joutatsu mo hayai
The most important thing
Is listening, the recording of the music
It makes them get, um, musical sense
And uh, that's the point of the fast progress
Tonalization wo mainichi lesson shidou shite
Oto wo rippa ni sodateru
And also, everyday, every lesson
We have to make sure that they learn about tonalization4Embed
