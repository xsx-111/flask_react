Here I Am (Just When I Thought I Was Over You) Lyrics
Here I am
Playin' with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me

Holding you
A feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside

So there's no sense pretending
My heart, it's not mending

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashin' through
And I just can't go on without you

On my own
I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashin' through
And I just can't go on without
Go on without
It's just no good without you

(Just when I thought I was over you)
Without you
(Just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you
(Just when I thought I was over you)
Without you
(Just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you
(Just when I thought I was over you)
Without you
(Just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you
(Just when I thought I was over you)Embed
