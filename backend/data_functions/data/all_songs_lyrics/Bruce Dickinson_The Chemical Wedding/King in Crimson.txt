King in Crimson LyricsIn the darkness, the raven's head
In the courtyard clothed in fear
I see gates that are opening
There's only one way out of here
Daylight has gone
The night has come
See his twisted sons and daughters
Writhing slowly in Satan's mire
If you only could see the visions
Trembling world I now despise
As the veil reveals the outer darkness
I am sucked into the halls of flame
Arise, awake
The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake
The king in crimson, crimson comes
He knows the weakness
That you can't fight
The stone of night
That weighs you down
If only you could see the visions
His hand is death if you take it now
As you scream into the web of silence
There is nothing that can save you now
Arise, awake
The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake
The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake
The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake
The king in crimson, crimson comes
As you scream into the web of silence
There is nothing that can save you now
Arise, awake
The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake
The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake
The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake
The king in crimson, crimson comes
To your window I come
At your window I comeEmbed
