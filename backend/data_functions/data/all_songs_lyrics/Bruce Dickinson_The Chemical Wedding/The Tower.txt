The Tower LyricsThere are twelve commandments
There are twelve divisions
Twelve are the pagans who have mapped the sky
In the outer circle
To the inner sanctum
From the octave at the end of time
The fountain, the trinity
The pilgrim is searching for blood
(searching for his blood)
To look for his own free will
The stone of infinity, washed in the flood
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, and the hanged man smiles
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, let the fool decide
In the atom circle
Where we break the stars
Hammer into anvil, stuffing out the sun
Witness all the killing
See the birth of Mars
Our religion thrown into the fire
The fountain, the trinity
The pilgrim is searching for blood
(searching for his blood)
To look for his own free will
The stone of infinity, washed in the flood
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, the hanged man smiles
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, the magician laughs
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, and the priestess kneels
(priestess kneels)
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, let the fool decide
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, and the hanged man smiles
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, let the fool decide
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, the priestess kneels to receive
Lovers in the tower
The moon and sun divided, the magician laughsEmbed
