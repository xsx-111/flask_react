The Alchemist LyricsWash away the blackness
With the silver rain
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Wash away the blackness
With the silver rain
Don't turn away, don't try to hide
Sulfurous and burning
Spitting out the sun
The beginning of creation
Of the golden one
A window to the west
A blazing star above
In Taurus we begin it
And the ladder has begun
Don't try and blame me for your sins
For the sun has burnt me black
Your hollow lives
This world in which we live
I throw it back
Four-headed dragon
For the four degrees of fire
Purify the insane
Bring the solution ever higher
Bring me all the elements
Spread them round my head
Bring me madmen's bodies
I will break them all like bread
Don't try and blame me for your sins
For the sun has burnt me black
Your hollow lives
This world in which we live
I hurl it back
Don't try and blame me for your sins
For the sun has burnt me black
Your hollow lives
This world in which we live
I throw it back
Don't try and blame me for your games
Your games are death
My world is light
The Angels fill my eyes
With every breath
And so we lay
We lay in the same grave
Our chemical wedding day
And so we lay
We lay in the same grave
Our chemical wedding day
And so we lay
We lay in the same grave
Our chemical wedding dayEmbed
