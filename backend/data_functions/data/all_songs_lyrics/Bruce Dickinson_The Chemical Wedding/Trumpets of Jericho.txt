Trumpets of Jericho LyricsThis is the maze of life
This is the maze of death
This is the matrix of eternity
The Demon never sleeps
The Demon never lies
He beats my heart and leaves no echo
What heavy burden holds me back
Every step along the track?
Fear that reaches deep inside of me
At the trumpets of Jericho
Still the walls remain
At the trumpets of Jericho
Avalon's in chains
This is the river of space
This is the river of time
Chase the dragons of infinity
Atlas stands and laughs
Throws his burden down
Rolls the earth in the inferno
Fingers holding onto cracks
The howling wind that blows us back
Sucked into the grinding wheels of Hell
At the trumpets of Jericho
Still the walls remain
Blow the trumpets of Jericho
Still the walls remain
At the end of a rainbow
There the grail remains
Sound the trumpets of Jericho
Avalon's in chains
As they drag you down
In your clothes of lead
See the golden light flashing overhead
Mocking you
Do you know who you are?
In your robes of skin
How many creatures live inside you?
Man is born forever free
But is everywhere in chains
Trapped inside this earthly prison cell
At the trumpets of Jericho
Still the walls remain
At the trumpets of Jericho
Avalon's in chains
At the trumpets of Jericho
There the grail remains
At the trumpets of Jericho
Still the walls remain
Still the walls remain
Still the walls remain
Still the walls remain
The silence of the tomb
And the wheel of fortune roundEmbed
