Machine Men LyricsBring the toys out for the boys
Let the children make their noise
See the monsters in their metal cages
Turn the lights down in your soul
Cut the power to your heart
See the carcass in its dying rages
Machine men - cannibals of rust
Machine men - iron bites the dust
Machine men - build with feet of clay
I'm coming to sweep you all away
What bitter vampire made you this
Gave you life with its badly kiss
Ground you limbs to bloody stew
Made a new machine of you
Turn the nightmare into day
Suck your breath, take your life away
Beating harder trough your veins
Someone else's cold remains
Machine men - cannibals of rust
Machine men - iron bites the dust
Machine men - build with feet of clay
I'm coming to sweep you all away
They're coming to sweep you all away
Machine men - cannibals of rust
Machine men - iron bites the dust
Machine men - build with feet of clay
I'm coming to take you all away
Machine men - cannibals of rust
Machine men - iron bites the dust
Machine men - build with feet of clay
I'm coming to take you all away
They're coming to sweep you all away
Away
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soul
Iron in the soulEmbed
