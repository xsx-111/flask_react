Killing Floor LyricsSo this is dreamtime and all is quiet
So this is dreamtime and all is night
You've never been held by the hand of God
Who's rocking the cradle if he is not
He turned the oil into his blood
Panzer divisions burning in the mud
The stain of freedom, he's washed it out
Who's rocking the cradle, I have no doubt
Sleeping eyes awake, to see his hooded gaze
Whispers on the wind, the darker side of ecstasy
Satan - has left his killing floor
Satan - has left his killing floor
Satan - hell fires burn no more
Satan - has left his killing floor
So now it's dreamtime for you tonight
So now it's dreamtime and all is quiet
You've never been held by the hand of God
Who's rocking your cradle if he is not
Sleeping eyes awake, to see his hooded gaze
Whispers on the wind, the neverending breath goodbye
Satan - has left his killing floor
Satan - has left his killing floor
Satan - his fires burn no more
Satan - is coming back for more
Satan - has left his killing floor
Satan - has left his killing floor...Embed
