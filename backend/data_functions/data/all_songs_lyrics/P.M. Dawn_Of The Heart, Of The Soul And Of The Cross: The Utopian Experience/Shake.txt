Shake LyricsShake, shake, shake, shake

It's not about how I've been
'Cuz I've been truly blessed
But through constant battles with reality
I dangle from the strength stress
Maybe you can't call me lucky
Maybe you can't call me lucky

There's a chip on your shoulder
And your weight on the back
There's a thousand pounds and then
Time, okay time
Who composed the PM Dawn place time
Who composed the world and at the same time
Makes your body rhyme with your soul and mind
The world could be over but I'm a soldier
But try me if you like, but you'll get nothin'
'Cuz I

(One time)
Now bring it back again
What would you do in my position?
Would you let them get you down?

Would you let them inside you?
What would you do in my position?
What would you do in my position?
Stop
Yeah!
'Cuz I
