To Serenade a Rainbow LyricsI think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
Sitting on top of the setting sun
Trying to capture at age twenty-one
? beauty's only skin deep
But love likes to sail when I exhale my lungs
Fine wines, good times...
To try to be an angel's pantomime
That's the ticket but a different definition than the soul defines
Does "X" mark spot on a single heart
When it's borne the billion's of Cupid's darts?
To try to spread love to the multitude...
But then there's the few that tears things apart
Moonbeams condition my dreams
To its current shades of purple and green
I'm convinced that my aura has the same glow
And this produces my affection toward rainbows
Wondering why...
Why only my eyes embrace you?
As if I was blind, I persist to chase you
Through my window I'm watching you smile at me
And I live for the times when you profile for me
The breeze, the wind...
It fluctuates my adrenaline
See, it's an ode to the fact you've put your colors on
Now all I've got to do is tell you it's wrong
And counteract my tears with a grin
To balance your feelings in a mind that spins
Is to serenade a rainbow
While riding on the tail of the wind
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
I think I want to fly away
Loving you is easy cause your beautiful
I don't think so. I think that that's a lot of bull
My heart and soul are completely taken over
I'm sick from one of those love hangovers
I watch the comedy called intellect
Which wraps the nooses around our necks
It seems the unreal is becoming more real
They've taken me down to strawberry fields
Leave me at the tip of Orion's nose
And play me a song that your heart composed
Why you can blow me away and I can still see blue
Agape compels me to love you
Break me down until you see the sun
I look at you and smile and you ask, "How come?"
Father, I talk to you for peace of mind
? goes home that makes me blind
It's like a fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm
That fall love in love on the slightest whim
Is to serenade a rainbow
While riding on the tail of the wind
I think I want to fly awayEmbed
