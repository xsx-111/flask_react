Reality Used To Be A Friend Of Mine Lyrics
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Maybe "Why?" is the question that's on your mind
But reality used to be a friend of mine
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Please don't ask me cause I don't know why
But reality used to be a friend of mine

I used to be friends with reality
She used to be a pal real close to me
But she tried to hide from me what was in store
Tried to house me but a house has doors
I was insane and the picture was crazy
So the relevance here seems to be a bit hazy
But I tried to explain this in the simplest terms
But she let the props burn and it was my turn to say
("Roses are red, and violets are blue
And things are gonna stay that way, too")
And I was the nut to believe all of this
I figured life would just hand me bliss
Now I have to worry about certain doom
Or will I be here tomorrow afternoon
Now ask me about the future
"I wonder what tune she'd dance to."

I remember Sandy gave me a hand
Now I'm known as the maniac man
Looking and searching for a shred of proof
Knowing any time this world could go poof
Now what might happen without me knowin'
That's why I find myself always tip-tip toeing
She tried to let prophecy sneak up on me
But I woke up, I told her "Yo, step off me"
What you want me to do?
You want me to sweat blood?
And hang up on your strings like a marionette does?
Go to the PM on the dock of the bay, sit
You need a clue
Go back to the basics
She needs to learn her ABC's
Her and I sail on different seas
She sees different from what I sees

Do you believe!?!
Hell no!

I lost touch with reality
I keep it as far as I can from Prince Be
I just didn't run with the way she flowed
To where I just said "Yo, I gots to go"
But my heart wasn't ill or mad at her
I just chose to laugh at her
And disregard everything she tells me
Believe in her
And she's happy and healthy
What is real, a positive plane
Reality and life are not the same
As to her equivalence to what is real
She doesn't appeal to how I feel
Maybe I should try transchanneling her
(Prince, you're taking this trip to far)
Okay, fine, nevermind
But reality used to be a friend of mine
 X 2
Chase the blues away
Take your mind off reality and leave her aloneEmbed
