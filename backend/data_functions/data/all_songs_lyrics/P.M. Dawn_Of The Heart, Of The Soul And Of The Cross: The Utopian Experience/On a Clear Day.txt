On a Clear Day LyricsThink I could find a better way
Find a sight to see
Find a place that I...belong to
Wandering aimlessly
But I know where I can go
Somewhere across from me
I now realize...
On a clear day, I can see
If only I could hear you
If only you could hear me
On a clear day, baby, I can see
Everything that's cosmic, but you, baby
Oh, maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you
Maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you, baby
I see you baby
I see you baby
I see you baby
I see you...baby
When you open up your eyes
What's in front of you
Is what's supposed to be there
Oh really?
Ask me who I am
Ask me what you are
One nation under God
I'm smiling
On a clear day, baby
I can see, If only I could find you
If only you could find me(find me baby)
On a clear day, baby
I can see, Only God knows where you're going...
Open up your hearts
Open up your minds
Baby how do you feel?
Are you cold here?
Kiss me everyday
I find another way
Brings me in the sky
I don't know you
On a clear day, baby
I can see If only I could see you
If only you could see me
On a clear day, baby, I can see
Forever behind the horizon line
Oh, maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you
Maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you, baby
I see you baby
I see you baby
I see you baby
I see you...baby
Oh, Where was I before?
It doesn't matter now
Maybe it does sometimes...
I don't know
What do ya think of me?
What do ya think of life?
Hold me in my arms
I love you
On a clear day, baby
I can see everyone that loves you
Everyone that loves me
On a clear day, baby, I can see
Whatever's in front of my eyes...
Oh, maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you
Maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you
Maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you
Maybe I'm just another something new
Maybe on a clear day I see you, baby
I see you baby
I see you baby
I see you baby
I see you...babyEmbed
