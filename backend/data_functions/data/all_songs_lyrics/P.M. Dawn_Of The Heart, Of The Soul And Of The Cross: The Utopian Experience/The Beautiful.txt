The Beautiful LyricsYeah!
In a quest to become colorless
I exalt my eyes with a most profound trust
Yet they are masters at deception
I wonder why... A black 4 leaf clover
Prince Be sends a purple valentine again
"How does it feel to be one of the beautiful?"
Once more my feelings have succeeded in confusing me
But what's most amusing is
I like the way it looks
Distorted, isn't it?
But it's beautiful!
Exceptionally beautiful!
Damn
"How does it feel to be one of the beautiful?"
I drift along in a sea of compulsion
Whether or not I'm dead
I have no idea
I'm standing on a hill that overlooks a meadow
And I'm thinking
Of absolutely nothing
My current mood must resemble electric blue
It's always tranquil, but
It makes me bleed
Question marks constantly arrest my persona
Ironic how that creates one for me
Whatever is whatever
A phenomenon that consists of life and death
Hi Mr Experience
How was your trip to the moon?
I tear my thoughts with my own sarcastically piercing blade
I love you
Because you make me sick
Distorted, isn't it?
But it's beautiful!
Exceptionally beautiful!
Damn
