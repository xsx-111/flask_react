Jettisoned LyricsYou can tool around the horn now, maybe
The people never say hello
Who is for indifference, honey?
I'm not sure they know
You can keep your nose buried deep  yeah
Pinched inside a vice
Who likes sugar in their coffin?
The underground is twice as nice yeah
You can fool around the horn now, baby
The people never say hello
Who is for indifference, honey?
I'm not sure they know
You can keep your nose all buried deep yeah
Pinched inside a vice
Who likes sugar in their coffin?
The underground is twice as nice yeahEmbed
