Drowned Beast LyricsOpen up the vault and let us breathe
Air is the only thing I need
I asked the major "Sir, have we food?"
"Soon we will feed...."
Gazing out the window to the sea
Underneath the surface stirred the beast
Foam was high up dancing on the breeze
Soon, we will feast
"Open up the monster", crowd demands
And from the belly, steaming, came a hand
"We're ever so thankful that you're brave"
But you'll be on our table, just the same
We've launched an attack
With only food in mind
The beast did lurch
But he eventually died
Foam was high up dancing on the breeze
Soon, we will feast1Embed
