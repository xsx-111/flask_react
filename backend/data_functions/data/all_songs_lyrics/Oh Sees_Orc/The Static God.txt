The Static God LyricsAh, pardon me
Do you have a cigarette
For me I think
I don't know, I don't know
What's it like?
I'm tuning in
Addressing an urge
Do you satisfy me?
What's it like?
Laugh at the rubble
What's it like?
It's freezing
It's cold out
On the battleground
Lashing me
Blood soaked rags
Are the clothes upon my back
I don't know, I don't know
What's it like?
I'm leaning in
Into the whip
Does it satisfy me?
What's it like?
Close to the cannon
What's it like?
Attacking
And retreating
On the battleground
Ah, pardon me
Do you have a cigarette
For me I think
I don't know, I don't know
What's it like
I'm tuning in
Addressing an urge
Do you satisfy me?
What's it like?
Laugh at the rubble
What's it like?
It's freezing
It's cold out
On the battleground1Embed
