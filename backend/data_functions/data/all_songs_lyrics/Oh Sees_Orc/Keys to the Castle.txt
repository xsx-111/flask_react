Keys to the Castle LyricsThis parade of candied people
Turns the bend in castle's steeple
Flood the tower with your body
Fling yourselves from upper belfry
Let's witness the whole occasion
Piles of bodies fill the garden
Smash the hedgerow with their plummet
Stop with panic, ugly banquet
Floating in the vile moat yeah
Crack their skulls upon the cobbles
Ringing home their lemming's message
Fill the streets with awful messes
Please hand over keys to castle
Make the change without the hassle
Start a new crop of good people
Lock the door to castle's steepleEmbed
