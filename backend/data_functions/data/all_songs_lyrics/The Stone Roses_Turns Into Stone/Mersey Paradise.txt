Mersey Paradise LyricsRiver splashes against the rocks
And I scale a slope, I hope the tracks won't
Lead me down to dark black pits
Or places where we fall to bits
If she were there I'd hold her down
I'll push her under while she drowns
And couldn't breathe and call for air
She doesn't care for my despair
Or is it me?
Or the one that's wrong
You see it in the sea
River Cool's where I belong
In my Mersey paradise
As I stare an oil wheel comes
Sailing by, and I feel like
Growing fins and falling in
With the bricks, the bikes, the rusty tin
I'll swim along without a care
I'm eating sand when I need air
You can bet your life I'll meet a pike
Who'll wolf me down for tea tonight
I want to be (I want to be)
Where the drownings are (drownings are)
You see it in the sea
River Cool's where I belong
In my Mersey paradise
I want to be (I want to be)
Where the drownings are (drownings are)
You see it in the sea
River Cool's where I belong
Oh, yeah
I want to be (I want to be)
Where the drownings are (drownings are)
You see it in the sea
River Cool's where I belong
In my Mersey paradiseEmbed
