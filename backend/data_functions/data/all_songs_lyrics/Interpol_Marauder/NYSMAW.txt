NYSMAW Lyrics
Like Prince sang in Tennessee
I wanna ride with you down there
To alphabet street
And we can whisper with the stars
Like when the world began
And we can leak some beliefs skyward

Sinking in
Driving
Moving in
Cool climates

Give me the oversight inside the other
Give me the oversight inside the fantasy

And with these inclinations
They will design a little box for you to play in
Oh, aimless sharks don’t react to soft attentions
They know how to wait

Swooping in
Silent
Moving in
Cool
Firing
Give me the oversight inside the other
Give me the oversight inside the other’s dream

Is it safe, are we far for the mountains?
We walk through the trees
Is it safe, sing a song for the zeros
Nothing is memory
Blind like the censors seeking my surround

Give me the oversight inside the other
Primitive over mind designs of ecstasy
You’re reaching into my heart
And grinding fists in my soul
Give me the oversight inside the other’s dream

Now you’ve seen me at work
Now you’ve seen me at work
Are you excited, dear?Embed
