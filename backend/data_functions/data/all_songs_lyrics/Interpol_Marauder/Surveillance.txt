Surveillance Lyrics
Surveillance, we’ve seen it all again
Frame by
For real man, look at your 75
You were starring

This shit is made up
Somebody paid for it
Out on a limb that echos forward
Adding up

Surveillance
We see you when you’re on again
Frame by frame
Do I stand on my life?
Tired of making shit older a touch
Stand on my rights
Be out of cuts

Be famous, but still technically fine
Falling the rain man
Great hesitations of mind will stay
This shit is made up
Somebody paid for it
Out on a limb that echos forward
Not enough

Surveillance, we’ve seen it all again
Frame by frame
Can I stand on my life?
Tribal me would get over and such
Stand on my rights
Be over

Dangerous ingrained in us
The RIP strain
Mine the will recall and filter
Some great mind game
There’s still time to change my way
These eyes see it frame by frame

We are living something frame by frame
We are leaving something frame by frame
We are living something frame by frame
We are leaving something frame by frame
We are leading something frame by frame
Making little adjustments frame by frame
We are living something frame by frame
We are leaving something frame by frameEmbed
