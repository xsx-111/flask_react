Good and Evil Lyrics
Caught you walkin' like a gangster
Saw you grabbin' the controls
Now you're almost outta batteries
You gotta sweater much too small
Pokin' at your navel
Pointin' your finger too
You say your lips don't even stick together
When the dust comes up
Blowin' 'cross the plains
Pictures are fallin' in and outta their frames!
Singing : Good and evil, good and evil
They turn 'em loose and they turn into people
Singing : Good and evil, good and evil
They turn 'em loose and they turn into people
You know that roses and lilacs are funky too?
Let 'em go at it, let's see what they do
Now they're wrestlin' with the forces of good and evil
They turn 'em loose and they turn into people
I have seen you do things backward
You don't believe a word I say
Now you're holdin' sticky paper
Money never fades away
Talkin' like a monster
Smellin' like a baby
You got a head like a bowl of cherries now
Don't be surprised
You got what it takes
Messin' round like monkeys and apes
Singing : good and evil, good and evil
They turn 'em loose and they turn into people
Singing : good and evil, good and evil
They turn 'em loose and they turn into people
You know that roses and lilacs are funky too?
Let 'em go at it, let's see what they do
Ah - they're messing with the forces of good and evil
They turn 'em loose, they turn into peopleEmbed
