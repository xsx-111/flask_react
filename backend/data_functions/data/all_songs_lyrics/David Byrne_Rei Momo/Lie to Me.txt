Lie to Me LyricsIt's a beautiful world and a beautiful dream
And you know I don't care if things are not what they seem
Making up stories that you know aren't true
But you know it's all right 'cause I know it too
Who is the lady with the sno-cone eyes?
Who has the candy with the soft insides?
Talk show religion and
Soap opera love
Whatever happened to
Heavens above?
Well you can lie to me
And I imagine you do
If nothin's right
What's wrong?
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
Birds are flying from east to west
Dogs are running a political race
Twinkle twinkle
Little star
How I wonder
Who you are
Well you can lie to me
And I imagine you do
If nothin's right
What's wrong?
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
It's a beautiful world and a beautiful dream
And you know I don't care if things are not what they seem
I wanna be happy, I can't stand the pain
I wanna believe, so tell me again
I'm like a chicken without a head
I'd like to fly, but I walk instead
Emotional junkies
How blind we must be
I'm just a fool for your
Las Vegas tears
Well you can lie to me
And I imagine you do
If nothin's right
What's wrong?
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about youEmbed
