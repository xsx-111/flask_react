Office Cowboy LyricsI can see an office cowboy
How he turns and smiles, watching the girls go by
(Ride'em cowboy)
He knows how to ride a pony
If laughter makes you well, what if the well runs dry?
(Ride'em cowboy)
Batom - a bala bate no meu coração
Dentes espalhados pelo chão
Natural
E a vezes social
All night long, the great pretender
Sat upon his throne
Nothing can stop him now
(Vai la cou boi)
Vão suadas, ammarrotadas
Nota de dez, nota de vinte vai
(noite cai)
Hey now! it was a little taste of paradise
Always riding in the circle line
This poor cowboy's always on the run
Coyotes howling at the moon
Cowboys are singing out this lonesome tune
Duas selas, dois de raça
Dois irmãos e dois urubus
(sobra um)
Não e
It's just enough to whet my appetite
And every cowboy needs to take a bite
Copo d'agua
Que caiu no chão
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
'Tou roubando más não sou ladrão
E demais
E demais
E demais
Ev'ryone's a cowboy in this townEmbed
