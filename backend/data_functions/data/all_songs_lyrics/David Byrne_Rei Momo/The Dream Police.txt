The Dream Police LyricsCombing the snakes in his head
Reading a book in his bed
Getting ready for the night to begin
Waiting for daylight to end
In this court of law
This court of common pleas
The crimes that you've committed
You claim were only a dream
Ev'ryone has the same dreams
On diff'rent days of the week
We are the watchdogs of your mind
We are the dream police
The judge has closed his eyes
The court begins to dream
Of crimes that you committed
While you were lying asleep
Ev'reyone has the same dreams
On diff'rent days of the week
We are the watchdogs of your mind
We are the dream police
Combing the snakes in his head
Reading a book in his bed
Getting ready for the night to begin
Waiting for daylight to end
Getting ready for the night to begin
Waiting for daylight to endEmbed
