Marching Through the Wilderness LyricsYeah, we are the noise
The noise between stations
Yeah it's a kinda strange
Oh boy! A strange situation
I walk like a building
Never get wet
I'm looking at ladies
I'm talking like men
Don't work for the city
I don't work for the state
It's none of your business
I'm doin' all right
(Chorus)
Marching through the wilderness
Crying out for tenderness
They call me Mr. Pitiful
But everything is wonderful
I'm workin' real steady
I'm workin' real hard
I'm building a monster
In my backyard
Money doesn't matter
Babies never lie
I'm going in the out door
I'm doing all right
Marching through the wilderness
Crying out for tenderness
They call me Mr. Pitiful
But everything is wonderful
I walk like a building
I never get wet
I'm looking at ladies
I'm talking like men
Marching through the wilderness
Crying out for tenderness
They call me Mr. Pitiful
But everything is wonderful
Marching through the wilderness
Crying out for tenderness
They call me Mr. Pitiful
But everything is wonderful
Soy el galán de las penas
Llorando
Sin compasiónEmbed
