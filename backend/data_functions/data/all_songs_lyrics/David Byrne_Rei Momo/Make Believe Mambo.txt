Make Believe Mambo Lyrics
It was a pretty picture
It almost made me cry
He's got Big imagination
It's better than real life
He can be a macho man
And now he's a game show host
Well one minute hilarious comedian
Now he's an undercover cop
Say
Oh - let the poor boy dream
Oh - livin' make-believe
So how can we be strangers
He's got no personality
It's just a clever imitation
Of the people on TV
A line for every situation
He's learnin' trivia and tricks
Havin' sex and eatin' cereal
Wearin' jeans and smokin' cigarettes now
Oh - let the poor boy dream
Oh - livin' make-believe
Oh - let the poor boy dream
Oh - livin' make-believe
I can be you and you can be me
In my mundo, todo el mundo
Everyone's happy and everyone's free
Todo el mundo, mundo mambo
Here in my mundo where nothing is wrong
Todo el mundo, in my mundo
I'm a lady and you are a man
Mundo mambo, todo mundo
Oh - let the poor boy dream
Oh - livin' make-believe
In my mundo, todo mundo
Mundo mambo, in my mundo
Todo el mundo, mundo mambo
Mundo mambo, Todo mundo
Oh - let the poor boy dream
Oh - livin' make-believe
Mundo mambo, todo el mundo
In my mundo, todo mundo
Todo el mundo, mundo mambo
In my mundo, mundo mamboEmbed
