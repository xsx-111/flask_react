Women vs. Men LyricsShe had psychic defenses
He had animal dreams
They moved closer together
He said "Lets make a deal"
Does not the law forbid it?
It's a treacherous act
We all must suffer
We all must do our part
No one knows how it started
And God knows how it'll end
The fightin' continues
Women versus Men
Women have their world
And men, we have ours
We're into sports
And they're into flowers
The women are talking
We do not understand
They speak in a language
We do not comprehend
No one knows how it started
And God knows how it'll end
The fightin' continues
Women versus Men
Fightin' in the parkin' lots
Is this what nature intends?
Armies of ladies
Fightin' armies of men
So remember be careful
Should one cross your path
One innocent movement
And it could be your last
No one knows how it started
And God knows how it'll end
The fightin' continues
Women versus Men
No one knows how it started
And God knows how it'll end
The fightin' continues
Women versus Men
Women versus Men
Women versus Men
Women versus MenEmbed
