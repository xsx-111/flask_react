Carnival Eyes LyricsGone away
Someone else son's gone
What a day
For dreaming
Hard hurt heart
That holds the door
Buried in time
In hallways bleeding
And all the time they walk the line
And all the time in asking land
Who's that girl who likes to dance all day?
Beauty is always so strange
Carnival girl
Where do those eyes come from?
What is inside there?
So far away
Any day
When soldiers come
Women pray
I lie here
There's a flame
Whose light still shines
Leading us on
Through fields and bridges
And all the time they walk the line
And all the time in asking land
I've seen grasses grow through rock and stone
Nature is always so strange
Carnival girl
Where do those eyes come from?
What is inside there?
So far away
And all the time they walk the line
And all the time in asking land
One man throwing questions to the stars
Is there anyone there?
Carnival girl
Where do those eyes come from?
What is inside there?
So far away
Carnival girl
Where do our lives come from?
She'll keep on dancing
The night away
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
OhEmbed
