I Know Sometimes a Man Is Wrong Lyrics
I know sometimes I can be wrong
I know sometimes I do believe
I know sometimes I can be wrong
I'll be wrong until you're next to me
I'll be wrong until you're next to me
I know sometimes the world is wrong
I know sometimes I do believe
I know sometimes the world is wrong
They'll be wrong until you're next to me
They'll be wrong until you're next to meEmbed
