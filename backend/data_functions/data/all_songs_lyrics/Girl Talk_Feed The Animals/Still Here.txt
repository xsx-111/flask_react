Still Here Lyrics
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (HEY)
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (HEY)
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (HEY)
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (HEY)
Don't start no shit it won't be no shit
Don't start no shit it won't be no shit
Don't start no shit it won't be no shit
Don't start no shit it won't be no shiit!

A-oo (Hey!)
(Don't start no shit it won't be no shit!)
A-oo (Hey!)
(Don't start no shit it won't be no shit!)

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I pulled into Nazareth
I was feelin' about half past dead (It's goin' down)
I just need someplace
Where I can lay my head (It's goin' down)
Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where a man might find a bed? (It's goin' down)
He just grinned and shook my hand
"No," was all he said
(Anywhere you meet me, guaranteed to go down)
Take a load off Fannie
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And...

They wanna be like me, recreate my flow
Imitate my flow, then relate my flow
But while they try and take my flow, I make my dough
Ayo, I can make it rain, 'cause I been making it snow
But yo, I been takin' it slow I wasn't around
But the car crash couldn't lay the hustla down
I'm still here, for real, I'm still here
It wasn't looking pretty, but Swizzy I'm still here
They said I coulda been brain-dead in a wheelchair
But I'm standin' in the booth and the skills are still here
Yeah, the hustla home, the hustla home
Let's celebrate a toast with a cup of patron
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patron and tell them that it's on
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patron and tell them that it's on

Oh shit! (Beat, beat knockin')
(Club, club rockin')
Oh shit! (Beat, beat, knockin')
(Club, club knockin')
Oh shit! (Beat, beat knockin')
(Club, club rockin')
Oh shit! (Beat, beat, knockin')
(Club, club knockin')
(Oh shit!)
(Oh shit!)
(Oh shit!)
(Oh shit!)
That's not it...

All the hoes jock-jockin, beat steady knock-knockin
Middle of the stage got the whole club rock-rockin
(I get money, I get money, I get money)
All the hoes jock-jockin, beat steady knock-knockin
Middle of the stage got the whole club rock-rockin
(I get money, I get money, I get money)Embed
