FORWARD MARCH!!!
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baabyy
Coolin, coolin, coolin by day then at night
Workin' up a sweat!
1, 2, 3 burrr!
Coolin, coolin, coolin by day then at night
Workin' up a sweat!
Yeah!
Salt and Pepa's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it, babe
Coolin' by day then at night working up a sweat
C'mon girls, let's go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show
Now push it
Yeahhh
Yeahhh
Yeahhh
Champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce
To support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous
Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome
So If you ain't got no money take yo'broke ass home
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Now we say ba de ya
Take your broke ass home
Ba de ya!
Take your broke ass home
Ba de ya!
Take your broke ass home
Yeahhh
Take your broke ass home
If you ain't got no money
If you ain't got no money
If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home
If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home
If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home
If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home
God only knows what I'd be with-
God only knows what I'd be with-
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows - God only knows
Dj, Dj pump this partyEmbed
