Set It Off Lyrics
Booty, booty droppin, droppin
Naughty, naughty poppin' knockin'
Playas eyes out their socket
Drop it, drop it, poppin', knockin'
(M-m-m-make them clap to this)
Booty, booty droppin, droppin
Naughty, naughty poppin' knockin'
Playas eyes out their socket
Drop it, drop it, poppin', knockin'
(M-m-m-make them clap to this)

Speech!
First of all I wan' thank my connect
The most important person with all due respect
Thanks for the duffle bag, the brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash
Boys in blue who put greed before the badge
The first pusher whoever made the stash
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling life
Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your bafoonery
Thanks to the pastor rapping at your eulogy
To Lil Kim and them, you know the women friend
Who, carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
And most importantly you, the customer
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling, I'm feeling life
You don't even gotta bring ya paper out
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house
(We in the house, hou-, hou-)
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Look at how I'm chilling, I'm killing this ice
You don't even gotta bring ya purses out
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house
(We in the house, hou-, hou-)
We are lovers true and through and though
We made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searchin for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need
Real love
I'm searchin for a real love, someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin for a real love

It's time to set it off! It's time to set it off!
It's time to set it off! It's time to set it off
See the chick over there, she wanna set it off
See homie over here, he wanna set it off

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh....

Get it right, get it right get it tight
Get it right, get it right get it tight
Get it right, get it right get it tight
Get it right, get it right get it tight
Rock to the rhythm of the funky rhyme
So I can get busy just one more time
To the beat and ya don't quit
It's that ol' skool rap with that new skool hit
Peter Piper picked a pepper but Kool rocked the rhyme
And I can still rip up the house
Every God damn time I get on the mic, I go crazy
Peace out to Celo, Flex, and Doug Lazy
I bet 'cha never knew but now ya know
I'm the undisputed king of this disco
And I never let the mic, magnatize me no more
Cuz DJ Kool rip up the whole damn floor
Now I'ma rap a rhyme with the greatest of ease
And swing it like the man on the flying trapeze
And if you don't like it you grab on these
And now I need some help from the maestro pleaseEmbed
