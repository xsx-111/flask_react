Like This LyricsBack to life, back to reality
Don't call it a comeback
Back to life, back to reality
Don't call it a comeback
Body movin' body movin'
A1 sound in the town so soothing
Body movin' body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'
Body movin' body movin'
A1 sound in the town so soothing
Body movin' body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'
Body movin body movin'
Drop, drop, drop
However do you need me
C'mon
Body movin' body movin'
Drop, drop, drop
However do you need me
My eyes is sore, bein the senator
Behind closed doors hittin truths to the seafloor
The rich don't know, ignore, this tug of war
While the kids are poor open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everythin change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in these streets
Ghetto supastar, that is what you are
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh huh
Ghetto supastar
Like this
You're givin' love instinctively
Like this, like this
Ghetto supastar
Like this
You're givin' love instinctively
Like this, like this
Now tell me if you want it like this, like this, like this, like this
Like this, like this, like this, like this
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, I love you I really do
Mac Lorial yep cuz I'm worth it
Love tha way I puts it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway they can't say nothing
Oh oh oh my lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with tha mac mac brushes
Loreal got the most watermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crushes
What you know bout me
What you
What you know bout me
What you know bout me
What you
What you know
They say my lip gloss is poppin'
My lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin'
They chase me after school
What you know bout me
What you
What you know bout me
What you know bout me
What you
What you know
They say my lip gloss is cool
My lip gloss be poppin'
I'm standin' at my locker
And all the boys keep stopping
Break!Embed
