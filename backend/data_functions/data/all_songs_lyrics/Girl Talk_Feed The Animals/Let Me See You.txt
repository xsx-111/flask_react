Let Me See You LyricsLean wit' it, rock wit' it
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Woo-hoo!
Rock wit' it
Yee-ooo!
Rock wit' it
Woo-hoo!
Rock wit' it
Rock wit' it
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit' her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cos (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cos (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cos (I'm a flirt)
our work is never over
Damn you got me wide open
And I know you sayin' that I'm jokin
Cause the boys in the past, they just couldn't last
But for some reason I think you been chosen
(Heaven-sent, don't wanna walk away)
Just hold me tightly up in you arms
And tell me (every day)
That you ain't never gon' leave me heartbroke
Promise to give a good long stroke
Boy this for real and this ain't no joke
Thought I was dreamin' but I know I'm woke
What you done did that got me so gone
Feels so right that this can't be wrong
Hangin' up and right back callin' your phone
Cause I go crazy when I hear your voice tone...
Ahh...
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
Let me see you pop that pussy
Let me see you shake them titties
Let me see you pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, doo doo brain
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Let me see you pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, doo doo brain
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
How many no money boys are crazy
How many boys are raw
How many no money boys are rowdy
How many start a war
How many no money boys are crazy
How many boys are raw
How many no money boys are rowdy
How many start a war
How many no money boys are crazy
How many boys are raw
How many no money boys are rowdy
How many start a warEmbed
