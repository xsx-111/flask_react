Give Me A Beat LyricsOh mama I'm in fear for my life
From the long arm of the law
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lawman has put an end to my running
And I'm so far from my home
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Oh mama I can hear you a crying
You're so scared and all alone
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Hangman is coming down from the gallows
And I don't have very long
Give me a beat!
Ohhhooo!
Ridin big, gettin mine
Two microwaves cook a brick at a time
Bandana on da handle ready for da whip
When I wear da whitest soft watch it disappear
I disappear in da middle of da night
When I reappear bet da boss look so bright
Fo life, dough boy, More strikes, O boy
We ridin low, Gettin high
80 round drum let ya know da time
When you see da Maybachs niggas know its mine
Ridin on da 2 4's runnin ahead of my time
Watch runnin from kind, Anotha one on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand get ya ho on da line
In da hood ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money
I will attack and you don't want that
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Turn it up make it knock, knock
(Sexy boyy)
Gimme, gimme more
Me and yo down your block, block
Gimme, gimme more
Turn it up make it knock, knock
(Sexy boyy)
Gimme, gimme more
Me and yo down your block, block
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Turn it up make it knock, knock
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Me and yo down your block, block
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Turn it up make it knock, knock
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Me and yo down your block, block
Let it drop
Let it, let it, let it drop
Let it, let it, let it drop
Let it, let it, let it drop
Let it, let it, let it drop
Let it, let it, let it drop
Let it, let it, let it drop
Let it, let it, let it drop
Let it, let it, let it
If you got the fattest ass on the block now drop
Let a nigga see the coochie pop now drop
Do the snake do the freak do the pop now drop
Yo dont stop dont stop
Real eyes down south thighs now drop
Waist line five six seven now drop
One time all in together now drop
Yo dont stop dont stop
Bend over, bend over
Bend over, bend over
Bend over, bend over
Bend over, bend over
Bend over, bend over
Bend over, bend over
Bend over, bend over
Bend over, bend over
Let it, let it
Let it, let it
Let it, let it
Let it, let it
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
And forget, forget, forget all of the beauty's wasted
Uh!
Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap cos it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit, jack
Back to the criminals sect
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet
Cos I'm slick as slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad cos I'm the nigga that flaunt it
