Shut the Club Down LyricsOne, one, one, one, one
One, one, one, one, one
Whooo-eee!
(Hey, hey you!)

Ain't nothin' for me to come through and shut the club down
Walk through the club me and mug haters down
Drop a stack at the bar, a hundred Louis thirteen
Posted up camouflage down to my feet, feet
They lookin' at me like, who is, who is he?
I straighten up yo boy, he raised in teh streets
My name's Ramone and you can spell it when I step in your room
Take VI, Chevy go zoom

I hit the club with a mug so mean
Got them niggas like who the fuck is that
Then I hopped up out the car so clean
Got them niggas like who the fuck is that
I'm like right, left, back, forth
Yeah I got the money, nigga that's of course
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance
The club owner like who the fuck is that
Hey, hey, you, you (Get it quick, wanna jack)
No way, no way (No slack)
Hey, hey, you, you
(Get it quick, wanna jack, no slack)

Rich Boy sellin' crack fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight no slack just bought a Cadillac
Took it to the chop shop, got the damn top dropped
Two colored flip flopped, candy red lollipop
There's hoes in the parking lot but i still got my Glock cocked
New money motherfucker don't you see the big knot
Don't you see the big chain, don't you see the big rims
Wonder who they hatin' on lately? Baby it's him
Candy paint, gator skin seats call me Dundee
Pope in your hood I'm the one that you wanna be
Haters wish they could feel the wood in my '83
Ridin' with no tint so the motherfuckers know it's me
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight no slack, just bought a Cadillac
(THROW SOME D'S ON THAT BITCH!) Just bought a Cadillac
(THROW SOME D'S ON THAT BITCH!) Just bought a Cadillac
Rich boy sellin' crack, wanna jack
No slack, sellin' crack
Wanna jack, no slack
What up, lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin
G5 dippin, lui vuitton luggage (ay)
Gotta love it, ya boy so fly
All the ladies go (ohhh) when a nigga go by
Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the shi
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
So boyfriend, she ain't missed him since

And everybody say, I remember way back when
And everybody say, I remember way back when
And everybody say, I remember way back when
And everybody say, I remember way back when
And everybody say, I remember way back when
And everybody say, I remember way back when
And everybody say, I remember way back when
And everybody say, I remember way back when

With a little bit of gold and a pager
(We don't give a fuck)
With a little bit of gold and a pager
(We don't give a fuck)
