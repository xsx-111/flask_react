Hands in the Air LyricsTag Team back again check it
Wreck it - let's begin
Party people let me hear some noise
DC's in the house jump jump and rejoice
There's a party over here
A party over there
Wave your hands in the air
Shake the deriere
These three words mean you're gettin' busy
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Upside down and inside out
I'm about to show all you folks
What's it's all about
Now it's time for me to get on the mic
And make this tag team party hype
I'm talking it back to the old school
Cause I'm an old fool who's so cool
If you want to get down
I'm gonna show you the way whoomp there it is
Let me hear you say
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Yaaa, now hit me
Love me, love me
Do it, do it, do it now
Fool me, fool me
Say it, say it, say it now
Love me, love me
Do it, do it, do it now
Fool me, fool me
Say it, say it, say it now

For people who only need a beat, yeahh
