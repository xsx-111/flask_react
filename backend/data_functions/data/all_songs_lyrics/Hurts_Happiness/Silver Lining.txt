Silver Lining Lyrics
There's a storm on the streets
But you still don't run
Watching and waiting
For the rain to come
And these words wouldn't keep you dry
Or wipe tears from an open sky
But I know but I know
But I know I'm right

I won't let you drown
When the water's pulling you in
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep fighting
The rain's going to follow you wherever you go
The clouds go black and the thunder rolls
And I see lightning, I see lightning

When the world surrounds you
I'll make it go away
Paint the sky with silver lining
I will try to save you
Cover up the gray
With silver lining
Now there's no way back
From the things you've done
I know it's too late
To stop the setting sun
You see the shadows in the distant light
And it's never gonna be alright
And you know, and you know
And you know I'm right

And I won't get left behind
When the walls come tumbling in
I'll keep climbing, I'll keep climbing
The rain's going to follow you wherever you go
The clouds go black and the thunder rolls
And I see lightning, I see lightning

When the world surrounds you
I'll make it go away
Paint the sky with silver lining
I will try to save you
Cover up the gray
With silver lining
When the world surrounds you
I'll make it go away
Paint the sky with silver lining
I will try to save you
Cover up the gray
With silver lining

Silver, silver, silver, silver
Silver, silver, silver lining
Silver, silver, silver, silver
(Thank the sky, thank the sky)
Silver, silver, silver, silver
Silver, silver, silver, silver
Silver, silver, silver3Embed
