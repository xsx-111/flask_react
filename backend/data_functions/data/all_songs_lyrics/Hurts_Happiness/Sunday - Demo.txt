Sunday - Demo Lyrics
There are times when we question the things we know
We never thought that the cracks would begin to show
We both know love is not that easy
I wish I'd known that it would be this hard
To be alone, please come home

Loveless nights they seem so long
I know that I'll hold you someday
Until you come back where you belong
It's just another lonely Sunday

Is this the end of a love that has just begun?
I always hoped that the best, it was yet to come
So please come back, don't you leave me
We're both so young, I know you need me too
And there'll always be times like these

Loveless nights they seem so long
I know that I'll hold you someday
Until you come back where you belong
It's just another lonely Sunday
Maybe we'll see that we were wrong
If ever we look back one day
But till you come back where you belong
It's just another lonely Sunday

If you don't come back tomorrow
I'll be left here in the cold
If you don't come back tomorrow
I'll goEmbed
