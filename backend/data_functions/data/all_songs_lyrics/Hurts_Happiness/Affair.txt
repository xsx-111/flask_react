Affair Lyrics
Rough fleet on the river
Where my troubles belong
'Cause you know I love you
But I know it's wrong
But your body is all that I want

Rosy affair
You took my heart for a little while
Greatest mistake
I ever made was
Loving you
Rosy affair
I gave you my heart for a little while
I wish I could stay with you tonight
I'm going home

And we danced all night in the shadows
Alone we stood in the crowd
But I'm going crazy, now you're not around
And you should find another lover, baby
Won't let you down

So I can love you now, baby
So I can tell you
I talk to you, Rosy

If I stay here tonight
There'll be trouble
But I don't want to pretend
Cause I know that we'll make it
My heart just can't take it no more
But I would rather lose a lover, baby, over it all

Rosy affair
The greatest mistake
I ever made
Rosy affair
For a little while, too long
I wish I could stay with you tonight
