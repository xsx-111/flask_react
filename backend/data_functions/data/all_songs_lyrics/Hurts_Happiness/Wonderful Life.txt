Wonderful Life Lyrics
On a bridge across the Severn on a Saturday night
Susie meets the man of her dreams
He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind
He doesn't want the company

But there's something in the air, they share a look in silence
And everything is understood
Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand
As the rain puts a tear in his eye

She says, don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life

Driving through the city to the Temple Station
He cries into the leather seat
And Susie knows the baby was a family man
But the world has got him down on his knees

So she throws him at the wall, her kisses burn like fire
And suddenly he starts to believe
He takes her in his arms and he doesn't know why
But he thinks that he begins to see
She says, don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life


She says, don't let go
Never give up
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life

Wonderful life, wonderful life
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life
Wonderful life, wonderful life
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life
Don't let go, Don't let go3Embed
