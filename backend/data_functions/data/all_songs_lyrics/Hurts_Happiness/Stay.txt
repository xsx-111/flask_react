Stay Lyrics
My whole life
Waiting for the right time
To tell you how I feel
And though I tried to
Tell you that I need you
Here I am without you
I feel so lost but what can I do?

Because I know this love seems real
But I don't know how to feel

We say goodbye in the pouring rain
And I break down as you walk away
Stay, stay
Cause all my life I've felt this way
But I could never find the words to say
Stay, stay

Alright
Everything is alright
Since you came along
And before you
I had nowhere to run to
And nothing to hold on to
I came so close to giving it up
And I wonder if you know
How it feels to let you go?

We say goodbye in the pouring rain
And I break down as you walk away
Stay, stay
Cause all my life I've felt this way
But I could never find the words to say
Stay, stay

So change your mind
And say you're mine
Don't leave tonight
Stay

We say goodbye in the pouring rain
And I break down as you walk away
Stay, stay
Cause all my life I've felt this way
But I could never find the words to say
Stay, stay
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay, stay, stay
Stay with me2Embed
