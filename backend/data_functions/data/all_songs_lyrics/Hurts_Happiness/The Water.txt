The Water Lyrics
Innocent, they swim
I tell them 'no'
They just dive right in
But do they know?

It's a long way down
When you're alone
And there's no air or sound
Down below the surface

There's something in the water
I do not feel safe
It always feels like torture
To be this close
I wish that I was stronger
I'd separate the waves
Not just let the water
Take me away

There was a time I'd dip my feet
And it would roll off my skin
Now every time I get close to the edge
I'm scared of falling in
Cause I don't want to be stranded again
On my own
When the tide comes in
And pulls me below the surface

There's something in the water
I do not feel safe
It always feels like torture
To be this close
I wish that I was stronger
I'd separate the waves
Not just let the water
Take me awayEmbed
