Blood, Tears & Gold Lyrics
I never thought I could forget you
I never thought I'd be the man I am now
It's 20 seconds since I left you
Cause I could never be your lover
I found another girl to mess me around
So you don't get to make me suffer

Look into my eyes
There's really nothing left to lose
But now I know
That I'm never, coming back to you

Love goes cold
Blood, tears and gold
Won't make it any better
I never let you down baby, baby
I never let you down baby, baby
And it won't get any better
Blood, tears and gold

It's 20 seconds since I left you
And I remember why I never looked back
I got no reason to forgive you
Oh
I see it in your eyes
The suffer and it hides the blue
But I know that it's never gonna hide the truth
The truth, baby

Love goes cold
Blood, tears and gold
Won't make it any better
I never let you down baby, baby
I never let you down baby, baby
And it won't get any better
Blood, tears and gold


Love goes cold
Blood, tears and gold
Won't make it any better

When love goes cold
Blood, tears and gold
Won't make it any better
I never let you down baby, baby
I never let you down baby, baby
And it won't get any better
Blood, tears and gold
(Blood, tears and gold)
(Blood, tears and gold)
(Blood, tears and gold)
Won't make it any better
I never let you down
I never let you down
Baby
Blood, tears and gold3Embed
