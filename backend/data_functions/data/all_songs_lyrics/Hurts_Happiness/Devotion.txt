Devotion Lyrics
Inside the heart of every man
There is a lust you understand
And I'm just the same
When all the love has gone away
And passion stares me in the face
Could I walk away?

Here's hoping
You'll help me to be brave

Devotion, save me now
I don't wanna stray from the hallowed ground
I'll turn temptation down
I'm asking you to take me to safety this time

Forgive my thoughts when I'm asleep
Forgive these words I'm yet to speak
I feel so ashamed
Right now you seem so far away
So much confusion clouds my mind
And I don't know which path to take
Here's hoping
You'll help me to resist


Devotion, devotion
I'm a slave unto the mercy of your love
For so long, I've been so wrong
I could never live without you

Devotion, devotion
Take me to safety1Embed
