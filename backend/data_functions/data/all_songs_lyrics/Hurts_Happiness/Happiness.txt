Happiness Lyrics
Are you looking for happiness?
Are you looking for something better?
Do you ever feel emptiness?
Are you scared it's gonna last forever?

Don't give it away, don't give it away

I don't want your happiness
I don't need your happiness
So never show me happiness
I don't want your happiness

Everybody needs sanctuary
Everybody needs hope and fear
But not everybody needs a preacher
So don't tell me what you want me to hear

And don't give it away, don't give it away

I don't want your happiness
I don't need your happiness
So never show me happiness
I don't want your happiness
I don't want your happiness
I don't need your happiness
So never show me happiness
I hope you find happiness

We don't need your cheap salvation
We don't want your sympathy
We don't need your cheap salvation
Over and over again
We don't need your cheap salvation
We don't want your sympathy
Don't need your cheap salvation
Happiness
