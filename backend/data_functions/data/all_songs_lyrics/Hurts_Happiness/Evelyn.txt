Evelyn Lyrics
I don't mind
If your hands are a little cold
Cause I'm alive
But I got nowhere to go

So stay with me Evelyn
Don't leave me with the medicine

In the night
As you sit and watch me sleep
I know you cry
But I never want to see

So if you go
I don't know what to do
So don't you go
Cause I've got no one but you
 

I see the lights
Casting shadows on my screen
And I don't mind
The lullabies from the machines
But if you go
I don't know what I'll do
So don't you go
Cause I've got no one but you
 

I'm more afraid than I've ever been
So stay with me Evelyn2Embed
