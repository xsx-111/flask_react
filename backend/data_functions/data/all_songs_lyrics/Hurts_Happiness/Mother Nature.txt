Mother Nature Lyrics
In my dreams I see the life she brings to me
But I forget her in the morning
And I don't need her holy blessings to be free
And I can stand it when she's talking, talking back to me

In the shadow of Mother Nature
We find it hard to live our lives
But we never chose the life she gave us
And we don't need her to survive

It's no wonder we grow strong while you grow weak
And that's exactly how you made us
And all your violence makes it harder to believe
And every death just leaves us faithless
Faithless in defeat
