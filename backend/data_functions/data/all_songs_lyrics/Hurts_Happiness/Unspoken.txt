Unspoken Lyrics
Things will never change
And our hearts will always separate
Forget about you
I'll forget about you
The things we never say
Are better often left alone
Forget about you
I'll forget about this time

But it's the same old situation
We made it through this far, oh
We watched the rockets kiss the sky
I saw the flames burn out in your eyes

And nothing that I do
Will ever be enough for you
Whatever I do, whatever I do
Take me as I am
I'll never be the other man
Forget about you
I'll forget about this time

So won't you save this conversation
And find a better time? Oh, oh
Don't you ever understand
That if it hurts I'll do whatever I can?
And if it's set in motion
I'll watch it all pass by
And leave the rest unspoken
I'll never change my mind
 
Leave it unspoken, leave it unspoken
Leave it unspoken, leave it unspoken now

So just let me go
I won't change my mind
I'd rather be lonely
Than be by your side
And nothing you say
Could save us this time
I'd rather be lonely1Embed
