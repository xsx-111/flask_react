Gave Up Lyrics
Perfect little dream, the kind that hurts the most
Forgot how it feels, well almost
No one to blame, always the same
Open my eyes, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up in flames

It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me see the light

Smashed up my sanity
Smashed up integrity
Smashed up what I believed in
Smashed up what's left of me
Smashed up my everything
Smashed up all that was true
Gonna smash myself to pieces
I don't know what else to do

Covered in hope and Vaseline
Still cannot fix this broken machine
Watching the hole, it used to be mine
Just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline
Of the trust I will betray
Give it to me, I throw it away
After everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me see the light

Smashed up my sanity
Smashed up integrity
Smashed up what I believed in
Smashed up what's left of me
Smashed up my everything
Smashed up all that was true
Gonna smash myself to pieces
I don't know what else to do

I tried
I gave up
I tried
I gave up
I tried
I gave up
I tried
I gave up
I tried
I gave up
I tried
I gave up
I tried
I gave up
I tried
I gave up
Smashed up my sanity
Smashed up integrity
Smashed up what I believed in
Smashed up what's left of me
Smashed up my everything
Smashed up all that was true
Gonna smash myself to pieces
I don't know what else to do
(Throw it away)
Smashed up my sanity
Smashed up integrity
(Throw it away)
Smashed up what I believed in
Smashed up what's left of me
(Throw it away)
Smashed up my everything
Smashed up all that was true
(Throw it away)
Gonna smash myself to pieces
I don't know what else to do
(Throw it away)
Smashed up my sanity
Smashed up integrity
(Throw it away)
Smashed up what I believed in
Smashed up what's left of me
(Throw it away)
Smashed up my everything
Smashed up all that was true
(Throw it away)
Gonna smash myself to pieces
I don't know what else to do
Throw it away4Embed
