Physical Lyrics
Eat your heart out, Steve

I want to date you maybe
I want to take you out
I want to wine and dine you
Oh I want to twist and twist and shout
I want you hard in my arms
So soft on my bed
You get the key to my heart
Oh when you wear that sweet dress

But you're too physical, physical to me
You're just too physical, physical no to me

I want your roughhouse baby
I want this right in your ear
You let me feel your danger
I let you make this feeling clear
I want the touch of your charms
The heat of your breath
I wanna say all those things
That would be better unsaid
No
But you're too physical, physical to me
You're just too physical, oh
You're too physical for me
You're too physical to me
You're really just just too just
Too really fuck no

Oh, goddamnit!

You're just too physical
You're just too physical
Too fucking physical
No No No No No No No
Oh you're too physical
Just too physical
