Happiness in Slavery Lyrics
(Slave screams) He thinks he knows what he wants
(Slave screams) Thinks he has something to say
(Slave screams) He hears but doesn't want to listen
(Slave screams) He's being beat into submission

Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see
The devils of truth steal the souls of the free
Don't open your eyes, take it from me
I have found you can find happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery

(Slave screams) He spends his life learning conformity
(Slave screams) He claims he has his own identity
(Slave screams) He's going to cause the system to fall
(Slave screams) But he's glad to be chained to that wall

Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see
The blind have been blessed with security
Don't open your eyes, take it from me
I have found you can find happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness...
I don't know what I am I don't know where I've been
Human junk just words and so much skin
Stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine
Just some flesh caught in this big broken machine

Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness
Happiness
It controls you
Happiness
It controls you4Embed
