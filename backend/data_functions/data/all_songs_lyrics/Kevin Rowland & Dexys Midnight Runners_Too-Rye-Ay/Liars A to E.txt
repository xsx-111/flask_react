Liars A to E LyricsNobody tells you. You end up knowing
Bad habits: you should sleep alone
Open to suggestions, is that the way you feel?
'Cause you're the voice of experience, every word
You choose sweet stolen info' you must never lose
Until you're so secure in your habitat familiar
But you won't want from me
There's nothing else to see
Try smoking your own and don't look at me
No need to explain it, just order dresses
Bad habits: you really shouldn't keep
Quick nip next door to the vendor of charisma
Because the time, the place and the mood is right
And good old Kevin'll be all right
Here comes His Soul" get your pen and notebooks ready
But you won't look like me
You'll never think like me
Try smoking your own and don't follow me
No need to explain it. Just order dresses
Bad habits: you should sleep alone
Open to suggestions, is that the way you feelEmbed
