All in All (This One Last Wild Waltz) LyricsOh, what's the matter?
Oh no. It's no better
I've been thinking it out and it still gets no better
I'm here singing this out and these thoughts get no fresher
All in all I'd say things have turned out good
You still don't smile at me but then I never thought you would
You don't waste time on praise. Do you sir?
But you should be proud to be sure
No sir. It's still no better oh sir, I thought you meant better
Your experience will teach me no more lessons
From lower down you just seemed so much better
All in all I'd say things have turned out good
You still don't smile at me but then I never thought you would
You don't waste time on praise, when you could
Or just tell me something. anything. good
Oh no look it's still no better
No no these thought are no fresher
You see tenderness is the asset here lacking
But won't you join me in this one last wild waltz
Just once again in the one last wild waltz
Anduici tú mé san damsa fión
Anduici tú mé san damsa fión
Round and round, and round and round...
Round and round, and round and round...
Anduici tú mé san damsa fión
Anduici tú mé san damsa fiónEmbed
