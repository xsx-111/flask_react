You sure?
(come on, man, do what you want)
O.K
One, Two, Yeah!
Uhh
Let me go back further, let me go back further if I may
(please do, go on, yeah)
It was uh, It was a rainy afternoon
It was two, maybe three months ago... I, I first started to reminisce
I first, I first started to reflect, you know
I was walking by the Thames at the time and I started to think about the summer of 1980
So what I did, I wrote this down on a piece of lined white paper while I still felt strongly about it
Here's what I recall
It was August 1980, I was searching for the spirit of Brendan Behan in the bars of Dublin
I mean, at this point I had a bit of a reputation as something of a searcher
(I see, I see)
Ya, I mean I still have for that matter but perhaps even more at this point
Anyway, I went from one bar to another
I mean I started off with a couple of friends but after a short while I think they just decided to abandon the search
Well, you know how it is, they probably had other plans or something
(sure) (yeah)
I mean me, I carried on, you know, I was determined, I went from one bar to another
I went, I went to Brannigans, I went to Flanagans
You know like in the song, you know, the one about the donkey You know that one?
(yeah) (yeah yeah I've heard it) (oh yeah, yeah)
I mean like 'cause... the thing is I, I've gotta confess you know, at this point I wasn't feeling on top of the world, you know
(no?)
No. Frankly, no. No sir
(in other words you wasn't exactly laughing)
No, I wasn't exactly walking down the road with a spring in my step. You know, happy-go-lucky wasn't... wasn't my middle name
(I know what you mean)
I mean, I'd heard that blind man, that man with the glasses on, I heard him singing
Uh, I didn't like the song, you understand
(of course, yeah)
No, but I did know what he meant about the higher ground, you know, I knew what he meant about the higher ground
(you did?)
I did, yeah
(you understood)
So anyway, I... I went into this one bar
I can't remember the name of it, it doesn't really matter now
But, I mean, you know by this time I was getting
I was getting really impatient, so I plucked up the courage to ask somebody and... and I noticed a man he was uh probably in his early thirties
He was well built. He had ginger hair and a big fierce powerful face
Ahhh, he looks like the type who'd know I thought, you know
(yeah)
"Excuse me, do you know where I can find the spirit of Brendan Behan," said I
"Brendan Behan?" said he
"Yes," said I
"New York," said he
"New York!" said I
"New York," he said again quickly
(New York!)
Yeah
(why, man, that's three thousand miles due west!)
Yeah
(I mean you were on the wrong side of the world!)
I know
(huh, so what did you do?)
Well, what could I do?
I just got out of there, I put my coat on. I got out of there. I walked straight out of there. I walked down the road, and I started to sing
OoOOOhh OO OOO OOO
