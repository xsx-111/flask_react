Until I Believe in My Soul LyricsI'll need tonight to sit and think about this
Think what to do
(Until I believe in my soul)
I'll take some strength to banish hollow sorrow
Hollow sorrow's nothing new
(Until I believe in my soul)
Just enough strength to last until tomorrow
(Until I believe in my soul)
(Until I believe in my soul)
Tonight I lost sight of your purpose
Despite this trickery you told me was right
(Until I believe in my soul)
I was such a good boy I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's my prize?
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Oh yes, yes, yes
(The same for everyone) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?

(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Oh you must be fucking joking
(The same for everyone) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?
Would you please repeat that? Break this to me gently
Stand over there
(Until I believe in my soul)
I was an arrogant boy, I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's the- *coughing*
(Until I believe in my soul)
I believe it, I believe it
I believe yes, I believe it
Ah, ah
(Until I believe in my soul)
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two and
And, and
Uh, uh, uh
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop, stop! Let me get this clear
(Until I believe in my soul)
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Yes, yes. Ha ha ha
(The same for everyone) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?
I know what this is, it's just the difference between the body and the soul, the spirit
What I'm gonna do now, I'll punish my body, I'm gonna push the body until I believe in the soul, that's what I'm gonna do
Just like this, just like this
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
I believe it's there
Well...
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Ah yes, yes, yes
(The same for everyone) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?
(That's all there ever is) Ha ha ha ha ha ha
(That's all there ever ) Ha ha ha ha ha ha
(The same for everyone) Yes, yes, yes
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah?Embed
