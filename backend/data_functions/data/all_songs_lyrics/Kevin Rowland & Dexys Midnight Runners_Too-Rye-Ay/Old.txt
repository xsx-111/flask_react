Old LyricsOld have memories to keep all cold away
What is that you say?
No sense to dwell
Old, are you ridiculed and fumed away
No attention paid?
I thought as much. Yes and the dumb patriots have their say
Only see their way
Nothing to sell
And worse from us, so obvious
Preposterous, when you think of the time that each has spent
Words heaven sent and truly meant to show
Old, may I sit down here and learn today?
I'll hear all you say
I won't go awayEmbed
