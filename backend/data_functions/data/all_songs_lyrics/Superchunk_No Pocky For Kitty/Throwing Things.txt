Throwing Things LyricsI'm blowing up the street like a leaf
I'll skin my back a few times, you'll see
Head over heels, my hand's on my heart
I'm making a promise, and that's a start
You're leaving a trail for me
I see you up in the tallest tree
You're throwing things down at me
I'm starting to climb, well I started on my knees
Somewhere along the way
The dusk it turned back into day
The sky is orange
The trees lie down against it
You're leaving a trail for me
I see you up in the tallest tree
You're throwing things down at me
I'm starting to climb, well I started on my kneesEmbed
