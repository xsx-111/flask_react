Punch Me Harder Lyrics
Punch me hard
Make me feel it
Could not pivot away
I have to steal it
But I don't wanna take anything
I feel guilty when I buy it
I'm writin' my lines down from now on
Maybe you should try it

Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harder

Check you out
I wish I could, I'm not allowed
If I had the right code
If I smoke the right smokes
There's a little red stone that's breathin'
As you're leavin'
It sinks, it lies at the bottom of a
Non-reflectin' pool
Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harder
Punch me harderEmbed
