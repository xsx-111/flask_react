Tie a Rope to the Back of the Bus LyricsLevel that house, tie a rope to the back of the bus
Suck it all out, take a straw to the rest of the dust
I crack a heater board, taking pictures off the wall
Break this in the corner, shoot it and see if it falls
Make a pile in the center of the room
Plant a flag and let's go
Set a fire to the pile shut the door take a breath real slow
Take a breath real slow
Level that house, tie a rope to the back of the bus
Suck it all out, take a straw to the rest of the dust
To the rest of the dust
Three sticks in the basement
Three upstairs
You cut your fingertips over the edge of the world just tear
And it's amazing but will soon be less than it was today
See me running outside with a box just to prove I'm a fake
Yeah to prove I'm a fake
Level that house, tie a rope to the back of the bus
Suck it all out, take a straw to the rest of the dust
To the rest of the dust
I'll take it they can't
If I don't make itEmbed
