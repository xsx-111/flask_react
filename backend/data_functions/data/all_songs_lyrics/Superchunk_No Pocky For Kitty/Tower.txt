Tower Lyrics
She climbs the tower, gun in hand
Every day at 5 PM
She has a bomb, she has a plan
She kills imaginary men
Kills 'em with her lipstick head
Oh, she's safe from them 'cause they don't understand

My guts fell out the top of my head
I'll live without them
I have my days for sure
But I don't count them
When everything's just right
I'll come down off my mountain
I'm out of sorts right now
By then, I will have found them

Don't call me the weird one
I watch them come and go all night
I serve them, listen to their shit
These people just aren't right

My guts fell out the top of my head
I'll live without them
I have my days for sure
But I don't count them
When everything's just right
I'll come down off my mountain
I'm out of sorts right now
By then, I will have found themEmbed
