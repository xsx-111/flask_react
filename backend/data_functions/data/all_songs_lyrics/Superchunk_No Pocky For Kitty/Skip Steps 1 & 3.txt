Skip Steps 1 & 3 Lyrics
I see you slit your wrist as big as your fist
You take a slow sharp stick and run it through
'Cause if it sound's as good as the action just like a kiss
Well, you hesitate and you waste, why don't you move?

Hit the gas straight on
Run through the lights, run through the tree
Skip steps one and three
Skip steps one and three
You see what you wanna say
Get to the point, you're gettin' to me
Skip steps one and three
Skip steps one and three, yeah

Yeah, you can graze ahead and go home happy
Well, it's your free time in the back of your skull
And that's fine for now, but what comes after?
You've been suckin' wind so long, it makes you feel full

Hit the gas straight on
Run through the lights, run through the tree
Skip steps one and three
Skip steps one and three
You see what you wanna say
Get to the point, you're gettin' to me
Skip steps one and three
Skip steps one and three, yeah
You've been suckin' wind so long
You've been suckin' wind so long
You've been suckin' wind so long
You've been suckin' wind so long

Hit the gas straight on
Run through the lights, run through the tree
Skip steps one and three
Skip steps one and three
You see what you wanna say
Get to the point, you're gettin' to me
Skip steps one and three
Skip steps one and three, yeahEmbed
