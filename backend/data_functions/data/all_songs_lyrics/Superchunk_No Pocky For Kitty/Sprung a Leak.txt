Sprung a Leak Lyrics
My bed is like none you've ever seen
It's deep blue leaves and pools of molten green
Down here where light has never been
Where I stay and that's healthy for my skin

Yesterday, you talked to me
Today, I feel I've sprung a leak
Today, you've got nothin' to say
Today, you just swam away

I know there could be
Well, I know there could be no bond
If you sank with me
Into this lily pond

Yesterday, you talked to me
Today, I feel I've sprung a leak
Today, you've got nothin' to say
Today, you just swam away

If you sank with me
If you sank with me
If you sank with me
Yesterday, you talked to me
Today, I feel I've sprung a leak
Today, you've got nothin' to say
Today, you just swam awayEmbed
