Cast Iron LyricsYou think you see everything with those glasses
My eyes the color of molasses
All you have to do is ask is all
And I'll tell you
I'll tell you from my front porch
I'll tell you from my cast iron chair
I'll tell you about my special friends
I only wish you were there
Don't get uppity with me
I see things that that you never see
I've been seeing them for years
Let me whisper in your ear
I'll tell you from my front porch
I'll tell you from my cast iron chair
I'll tell you about my visitors
I only wish you were there, well
The man in the airplane was looking for youEmbed
