Seed Toss LyricsI put a stake in your spokes
And you better laugh at my jokes
You better memorize this face
You better stay in my good graces
Cause here you come on your broom
Your mood ring's turning brown
You will begin to feel it soon
And you're tossing your seeds around
You better memorize this face
You better stay right in your place
I draw the lines here from now on
And your picture's already drawn
And this movie goes on to long
And this coffee's a little too strong
And I think that I'm running on
Well I guess that I'm running
And here you come on your broom
Your mood ring's turning brown
You will begin to feel it soon
You're tossing your seeds aroundEmbed
