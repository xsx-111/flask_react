Sidewalk Lyrics
If you wanna get out, get out
I'm not sure what you're cryin' about
There's no buried electric wire
There is no lock on this town

Well, you say you feel trapped
Yeah, I bought you a map
Well, I think you'll find
In any other sidewalk
It's the same old cracks
Well, it's the same old cracks

Put that out, you'll burn yourself
Lookin' at me, you'll never learn yourself
I kinda like this place
I wish you'd like it with me

Well, you say you feel trapped
Yeah, I bought you a map
And I think you'll find
In any other sidewalk
It's the same old cracks
Well, it's the same old cracks
Well, it's the same old cracks
Well, it's the same old cracks
Well, it's the same old cracksEmbed
