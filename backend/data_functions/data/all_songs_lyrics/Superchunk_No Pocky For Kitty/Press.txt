Press LyricsI want to know if it could be
I want to know if it was
I want to wrap my arms around your leg
I want to listen to you
In the press the soft bones crush
I want to hear you buzz
I want your fireballs ???
I want to grow inside your coat
I won't stand ankle-deep in the sand
I want to cross the moat
In the press the soft bones crush
I want to hear you buzz...Embed
