Right, wrong or ready LyricsI could have told him about the morning
The daylight always dawning
I could have told him that he'd be resting on my mind
He stays on my mind, he stays on my mind
I could have told him about another time
Another place maybe later, oh
I'm gonna love you better, right, wrong or ready
Right, wrong or ready
If he's right, wrong or ready, he stays on my mind
I could have told him about a man
Who Pays his own dues for his own price
And is home before his own woman
Right, wrong or ready, right, wrong or ready
He stays on my mind, he stays
I could have told him about the morning
The love light always dawning
I could have told him that he'd be resting on my mind
He stays on my mind
If he's right, wrong or ready, he stays on my mind
He stays on my mind, he staysEmbed
