I Love You More Than Words Can Say LyricsPlease, let me sit down beside you
I've got something to tell you, darling
You wanna know
I just can't wait, no not another day
I love you more than words can say
Yes, I do
Living without you is so painful
I was tempted to call it a day
You've got me in your hand
Why can't you understand?
I love you more than words can say
Yes I do
I just can't sleep
When I lay down in my bed
The thoughts of you linger in my head
Without you it's so painful
I was tempted to call it a day
You've got me in your hand
Why can't you understand
I love you more than words can say
Let me sit down beside you
I've got something to tell you, darling
You wanna know
I just can't wait, no not another day
I love you more than words can say
More than words can ever say
Yes, I doEmbed
