Sweet Substitute LyricsMy man went away, my man went away
I said I'd miss him every night and day
And I began to look around
Wish I could show you what I found
Mark substitute, sweet substitute
He tells me that he's mine, all mine
Ev'ry time I tell him
You know love is blind
He's got such lovin' ways
Got my head in a daze
My new recruit is mighty sweet and cute
I'm crazy 'bout my substitute
He's got such lovin' ways
Got my head in a daze
My new recruit is mighty sweet and cute
I'm crazy 'bout my substitute
Crazy 'bout my substituteEmbed
