Little Bit Of Rain LyricsIf I should leave you
Try to remember all the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And if you should look back
Try to forget all the bad times
Lonely blue and sad times
And just a little bit of rain
If I should leave you
Try to remember all the good times
Long days filled with sunshine
Just a little bit of rain
Just a little bit of rain
Just a little bit of rainEmbed
