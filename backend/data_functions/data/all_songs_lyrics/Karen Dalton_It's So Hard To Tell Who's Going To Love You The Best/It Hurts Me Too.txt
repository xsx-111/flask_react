It Hurts Me Too LyricsI love you baby
Ain't gonna lie
Without you darling
I can't be satisfied
If things are going wrong for you
You know it hurts me too
Run here baby
Put your hands on mine
I've got something to tell you, darling
I wanna change your mind
If things are going wrong for you
You know it hurts me too
Hurts me too
I love you baby
Ain't gonna lie
Without you darling
I can't be satisfied
If things are going wrong for you
You know it hurts me too
You know it hurts me tooEmbed
