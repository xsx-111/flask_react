How Did The Feeling Feel To You LyricsHow Did The Feeling Feel To You
Making love has been as much as I could hope it would be
Every night has been like one night to me
You've got me feeling again
The feeling you gave me before
But to you those nights like any other night
Tonight is just one more
Don't try to tell me that you care enough to love me
When you can't even do the things I need you to do
Don't make me listen to words you think will please me
When pleasing me don't mean anything to you
Just one more night makes no difference
As long as there's another night
To make right what you did wrong
The last days we had of one another will have to do
While you're on your way, while you're on your way
How did the feeling feel to you
You've got me feeling again
The feeling you gave me before
But to you those nights like any other night
Tonight is just one more
Just one more night makes no difference
As long as there's another night
To make right what you did wrong
The last days we had of one another will have to do
While you're on your way, while you're on your way
How did the feeling feel to youEmbed
