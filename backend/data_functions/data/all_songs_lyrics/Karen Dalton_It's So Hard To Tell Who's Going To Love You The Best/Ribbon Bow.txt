Ribbon Bow LyricsIf I had a ribbon bow
To bind my hair
If I had a fancy sash
My own true love would find me fair
My red shoes would go dancing
Whe'er my fancy would
My love would wish
That he had taken me while he could
If I were like city girls
And fair with smile
Not a man in all these parts
Would know my heart
My red shoes would go dancing
Whe'er my fancy chose
I'd lark about the sidewalk
And wear them foreign clothes
If I were like city girls
If I had a fancy sash
If I had a ribbon bow
To bind my hair
If I had a fancy sash
My own true love would find me fairEmbed
