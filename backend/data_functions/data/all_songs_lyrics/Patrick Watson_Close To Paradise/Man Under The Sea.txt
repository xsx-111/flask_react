Man Under The Sea LyricsI was hiding underneath the sea here
I was looking out for me
To be a better man, to be a better man
I was hiding underneath the sea
I was looking out for me
Just me, the fish and the sea
Just me, the fish and the sea
Oh 'cause the music was so much louder
Just me, the fish and the sea
Just me, the fish and the sea
Hide from all your apathy
'Cause I was born a noise machine
Wait I still, I was born againEmbed
