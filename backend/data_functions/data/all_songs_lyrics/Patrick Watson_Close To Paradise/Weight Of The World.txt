Weight Of The World LyricsI got my feet knocked off the ground
I got my head knocked off my feet
I tried to swallow all of the world (or "words"?)
And now I'm diving in too deep
And now I'm falling towards the sky
I just don't know how or why
But I got the weight of all the world
I better not let go all at once
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to look ...?
Am I supposed to fall back to the sky?
Or keep on rising for a while? (?)
I think I'm falling down
I got to the very ground
I couldn't hold it anymore
I think ...? I was asking for
I think these much to his hands (??)
Oh, I don't seem like I'm gonna change my words
I was getting the weight of all the world
I think I get what I deserve
I got my feet knocked off the ground
I got my head knocked off my feet
I tried to swallow all the words
I think I've gotten in too deep
I think you know how to go (?)
I think you know what I deserve
Here comes the weight of all the world
And it's coming straight for meEmbed
