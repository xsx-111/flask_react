Bright Shiny Lights LyricsOh, those bright shiny lights
They're shining so bright
Casting a shadow
On all the simple things you used to own
Casting a shadow
On all the simple things you used to own
Oh, those bright shiny lights
They're shining so bright
Blinding the simple man
Oh, what a sorrowful sight
Blinding the simple man
Oh, what a sorrowful sight
Oh, those bright shiny lights
They're shining so bright
They're casting a shadow
Oh, what a sorrowful sight
They're casting a shadow
On all the simple things we used to own
They're casting a shadow
Oh, what a sorrowful sightEmbed
