Sleeping Beauty LyricsShe hangs beneath the sky
Her eyes pass the sea
She talks and explodes
Broken peace
In this beautiful sheet
He chews her back to the crowd to the cold
Starting if you fall
Seeing this secret beauty
He spews her around to the floor
And opens up the door
To the plastic music
Thinking of sleeping beauty chained
To her dress, and to her braid
Thinking of sleeping beauty chained
To her dress and to beauty
She's my sleeping beautyEmbed
