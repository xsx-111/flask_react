Giver LyricsIs it just me or do you feel a little strange?
Is it just me or do you feel a change?
Now, is it me? How about you?
Isn't it strange, at times, a little fast?
Isn't it strange that nothing ever lasts?
Now, is it me? How about you?
Oh, now, is it me? How about you?
Don't be fooled
Well, don't be afraid
Nothing's really ever supposed to last
Well, don't be fooled
Well, don't be afraid
Everybody is to meet the end (or "Everybody needs to breathe the air"?)
Isn't it fun, the very edge of the world
Where talk is like walking on broken glass
No need to fret, I'm in the same hands (or "ends"?) as you
One of these days I'm gonna meet my match-maker too (or "(...) gonna need my love to make it, too"?)
Well, don't be fooled
Well, don't be afraid
Nothing's really ever supposed to last
Oh, don't be afraid
Everybody is to meet the end
Oh, all is fine
All is fine
I feel, I feel so alive
At the edge of the world
Why, now, is it me? How about you?
Why, now, is it me? How about you?Embed
