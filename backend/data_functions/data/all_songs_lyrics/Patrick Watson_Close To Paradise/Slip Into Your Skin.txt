Slip Into Your Skin LyricsSlip into your skin and spend the night
And get out of mine
Walking the streets in dark
Where the lamps are the sunshine
For the dreams
Oh, for the dreams
'Cause everybody needs somebody
To hold them down
Oh, everybody needs somebody
To hold them down
When your feet are leaving the ground
Leaving the ground
Leaving the ground
Leaving the ground
Be the blanket for my bones
Be a place that I call home
Slipped into your skin and spend the night
'Cause I feel like a different man, I feel it
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with youEmbed
