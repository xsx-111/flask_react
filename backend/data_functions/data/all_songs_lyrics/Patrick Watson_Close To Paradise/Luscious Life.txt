Luscious Life LyricsSweet oh luscious life
Celebrate your dreams when you are away
Doesn't it taste so sweet?
Like it's growing on--oh, growing on the trees
Growing on the trees
When you beg me up off the ground
I'll slowly turn you from a frown
Sweet, oh, luscious life
My sweet, oh, luscious life
You taste so sweet
When you are so free
My sweet, oh, luscious life, you taste so sweet to me
Hold time, no need for the moment of the day
I celebrate, I need, I need today
Was wondering of the day
To celebrate
To let it be
To feel so free
When you and me
In a sweet luscious life
For a minute of day
You taste so sweetEmbed
