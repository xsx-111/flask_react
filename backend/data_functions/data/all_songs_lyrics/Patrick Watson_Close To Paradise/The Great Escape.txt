The Great Escape LyricsBad day looking for a way home, looking for the great escape
Gets in his car and drives her away far from all the things that we are
Force a smile and breathes it in and breaths it out; he says
Bye, bye, bye to all of the noise
Oh he says bye, bye, bye to all of the noise
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo
Hey child, things are looking down
That's OK, you don't need to win anyways
Don't be afraid, just eat up all the gray
And it will fade all away
Don't let yourself fall down
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo noo noo noo

Bad day, looking for the great escape
He says, bad day, looking for the great escape
On a bad day, looking for the great escape, great escape5Embed
