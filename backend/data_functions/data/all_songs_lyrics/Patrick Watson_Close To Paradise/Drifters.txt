Drifters LyricsWe are drifting away
Farther every day
Soon we'll have nothing to say;
We'll be too far away
Too far away
Too far away
From where we started today
From where we started today
We'll be too far away
'Cause we're all drifting farther every day
And I will remember…
Even if I'm drifting far away
But I will remember…
Even if I'm fading all away
I dip my hands into the sea
Oh, I'll pour the ocean over me!
And after all the tides had swallowed all the shore
I couldn't find you anymore
We're the great drifters
'Cause we are drifting away
'Cause we're great drifters
We are drifting away
We are drifting awayEmbed
