Close To Paradise LyricsWe're getting close to Paradise
And more than other days
Yes, and were getting closer and closer
But not close enough
Yes, and were getting closer and closer
But not close enough
Waking morning, the sunshine burns
Cause you fall from where your felt you are
You're walking faster and faster
Oh, but the days they ain't slowing down
And don't you, don't you, wanna be there
There right now, ah
Yes, now were getting closer and closer
But not close enough
Yes, now were getting closer and closer
To Paradise
We'll promise that
To Paradise
We'll promise that
Hey lovely people down there
Let's fill that hole up in the sky
Don't be afraid to care
Well I'm sure you'll find yourself there
Hey lovely people down there
Let's fill that hole up in the sky
Don't be afraid to care
Well I'm sure you'll find yourself there
I'm sure you'll find yourself there
When you're down, hold on, hold on
I'm sure you'll find yourself there
When you're down, hold on
I'm sure you'll find yourself there
Close, close to ParadiseEmbed
