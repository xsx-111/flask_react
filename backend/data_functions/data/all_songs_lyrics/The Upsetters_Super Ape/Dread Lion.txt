Dub call "Dread Lion"
Tough like iron

The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots

We're dread lion
Dread lion
King of the forest, King of the jungle, strong like iron
Dread lion
King of the forest

The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots (Hey, hey; Dread lion)
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
The roots, the roots, the roots, the roots
