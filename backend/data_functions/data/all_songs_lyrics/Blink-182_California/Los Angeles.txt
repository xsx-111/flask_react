Los Angeles Lyrics
Day in, day out, up at 3AM with the
Searchlights shining down
Day in, day out, it's the blinding light
Underneath the dirt downtown
Whoa, listen to the sound as they
Bomb the Sixth Street bridge
Whoa, listen to the sound of the
Voices south of Fifth

Hey, Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home

I'm never coming home, I'm never coming

Come down (Come down), I've been awake for days
Knocked out (Knocked out), by the sound of falling rain
Come down, yeah, we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
We'll watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive

Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends

Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, when will you save me?
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home

I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home9Embed
