Kings of the Weekend Lyrics
Can you read my thoughts? I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb, and long night coming
Did you steal my prayers? I don't know where I was
I feel numb, and all or nothing (all or nothing)

It's Friday night, let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go, because we got no control (no control)
Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we
Ever had, thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something to keep going
So just take my hand, only seconds left
The clock's running, our time's coming

It's Friday night, let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go, because we got no control (no control)
Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we
Ever had, thank God for punk rock bands
Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend


It's Friday night, let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go, because we got no control (no control)
Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we
Ever had, thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend5Embed
