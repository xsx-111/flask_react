Bored To Death Lyrics
There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said, "I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down"
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink, and we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh (life is too short to last long)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh...23Embed
