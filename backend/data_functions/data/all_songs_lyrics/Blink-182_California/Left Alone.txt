Left Alone Lyrics
Eyes are open, words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded, cards are folded
Under the moonlight
Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone, we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you, pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to, left alone to wonder

Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight
Can you remember, you remember the last time
I left hungover?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
That I stayed over?
Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone, we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you, pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to, left alone to wonder

Whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh, whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh
Whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh, whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh

Left alone, we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you, pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to, left alone to wonder

Whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh, whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh
Whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh, whoa, we're left alone, whoa oh1Embed
