San Diego Lyrics
Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
And question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline

I can't sleep cause what if I dream

Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket so we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego

To San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego, can't go back to San Diego

Abandoned houses with the lights on (whoa)
Late at night I call your name (whoa)
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face

I can't sleep cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket so we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego

To San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego, can't go back to San Diego

I never needed to hear all of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know how deep these cuts on you go
And like a river, they flow to the ocean blue
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh...

Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket, so we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego

San Diego, to San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego, San Diego, can't go back to San Diego1Embed
