Cynical Lyrics
There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
You said everything you'll ever say
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
Anxiety's calling in my head
Is it back again?
Are you back again?


Ah!


Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed? Woahh
I feel your hand unlock the door
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil, woahh

What's the point of saying sorry now?
Lost my voice while fighting my way out
While fighting my way out
What's the point of saying sorry now?
Not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry
Lost my voice while fighting my way out
Not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now...5Embed
