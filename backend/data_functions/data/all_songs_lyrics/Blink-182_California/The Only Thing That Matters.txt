The Only Thing That Matters Lyrics

Where the hell did you come from?
Outer space or heaven above
Short of breath, my long-lost love
I can't believe my eyes, Are you for real?
My life before was such a mess
There's no use dwelling on the past
My broken heart was in a cast
Then you showed up and it began to heal

Cause you're the only thing that matters
Cause you're the only thing that's real
Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
Cause you're the only thing I feel

Someday
You'll come back to me
And I'll say
Something bitterly
And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
Grab a knife, erase my vision
Take my flatscreen television
And my paintings by Marilyn Manson
Cause you're the only thing that matters
Cause you're the only thing that's real
Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
Cause you're the only thing I feel


Cause you're the only thing that matters (Woah-oh)
Cause you're the only thing that's real (Woah-oh)
Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
Cause you're the only thing I feel1Embed
