Teenage Satellites Lyrics
I can almost see your house from here, but the signal seems to
Disappear, so what's the problem? Houston's calling
Then you hit me like a Friday night, like a handgun in a firefight
Dive in slow motion towards the ocean

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright, we're teenage satellites

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

I'm kind of nervous of the consequence, as we climb over the
Neighbor's fence, the longest summer's nights are numbered
Then you kissed me like a storm at sea, like I'm the only one you'll
Ever need, we're left abandoned in the deep end

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright, we're teenage satellites
(We're teenage satellites)

We are a slow descent, forgotten astronauts
We are an avalanche, we're just an afterthought

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright, we're teenage satellites

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh, we're teenage satellites
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh, teenage satellites
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh, teenage satellites...5Embed
