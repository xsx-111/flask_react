One Summer Dream Lyrics
So I go
Though it hurts me so
I'm crying
For your love

Deep waters flow out to the sea
They never needed you or me

One summer dream
One summer dream

Blue mountains high and valley low
I don't know which way I should go

One summer dream
One summer dream

Warm summer breeze blows endlessly
Touching the hearts of those who feel
One summer dream
One summer dream

Bird on a wing goes floating by
But there's a teardrop in his eye

One summer dream
One summer dream
One summer dream
One summer dream

(One summer dream)

Deep waters flow out to the sea
Warm summer breeze blows endlessly

(One summer dream)
(One summer dream)

One summer dream
One summer dream
(One summer dream)

One summer dream
One summer dream
One summer dream (One summer dream)
One summer dream

One summer dream (One summer dream)
One summer dream
One summer dream (One summer dream)
One summer dream

One summer dream (One summer dream)
One summer dreamEmbed
