Nightrider Lyrics
I remember somewhere in the rain
The faces of the passers-by
Staring faces broken blinds
I recall the situation clear
Standing in a crowded car
I can feel the need in me

Hold on, nightrider baby
Hold on, you're a nightrider
Riding the night searching for what is gone
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on

I still see that vision of delight
While cruising on the black of night
But she keeps a step ahead
Looking out the corner of her world
Nobody ever knows a girl
Who once lived along this way

Hold on, nightrider baby
Hold on, you're a nightrider
Riding the night, searching for what is gone
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on
Desolation degradation row
Go on; don't let the feeling show
She's a ten a penny dream
Faces with no name and no address
Keep staring in on my distress
But she kills me with her smile

Hold on, nightrider baby
Hold on, you're a nightrider
Riding the night, searching for what is gone
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on1Embed
