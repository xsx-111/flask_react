Waterfall Lyrics
So now it's getting late, for those who hesitate, got no one
But they don't understand and no one hears the sound
It's like a waterfall, it's an illusion

Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair
But you know, as you hold, back the power there
Without the friends and lovers, you could never go on living

Across the waterfall, that's falling evermore, down on you
Cascading through the days, and flowing on its way
That's how it has to be, just an illusion

Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair
But you know, as you hold, back the power there
Without the friends and lovers, you could never go on living4Embed
