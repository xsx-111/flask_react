Down Home Town LyricsLlafretaw ythgim eht ecaf
Llafretaw ythgim eht ecaf
The world outside don't like us much
'Cause they ain't got our classy touch
But they ain't good enough to breathe
This town's good air, we make 'em leave
But it's no, no, no
Really can't do that
No, no, no
Down home town
No monkey business in this town
Who do you think you're pushing 'round?
This town's respectable and clean
Just look around, you'll see what I mean
But it's no, no, no
Really can't do that
No, no, no
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
But it's no, no, no
Really can't do that
No, no, no
Down home town
We got the best town band around
Just listen to their crazy sound
When they get hot, they gonna blow
You see them winnin' every show
Wish I was in the land of Dixie
Look away! Look away!
Look away! Look away!
Down home town (Gotta get down, gotta get down)
Down home town (Gotta get down, gotta get down)
Down home town
Down home town (Ooh, I think they're coming down now)
Down home town
But it's no, no, no (No)
Really can't do that (She loves you)
No, no, no (I can't do that)
Down home town
Wish I was in the land of Dixie
Look away! Look away!Embed
