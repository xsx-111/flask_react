Last To Know Lyrics
Jesus Christ be damned
I held the dagger in my hand
I killed another man
Pictures carved in stone
See your reflection in your phone
And know we're not alone

Cemetery walls
Klonopin and alcohol
Tonight I won't start a fight
You barely made a sound
We put your mother in the ground
Some words are never found

Promises were made on an alter in blood
Sacrificial children's voices echo on and on
We're the last to know, we're the last to know

They told us who we are
In spiral ladders to the stars
Collect our memories
We'll be back again
Each time a little different
It ends where it begins
Promises were made on an alter in blood
Sacrificial children's voices echo on and on
We're the last to know, we're the last to know
The last to knowEmbed
