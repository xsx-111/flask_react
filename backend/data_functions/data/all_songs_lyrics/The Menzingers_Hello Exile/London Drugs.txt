London Drugs Lyrics
What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs
Every time I’m with you I take too much
I don’t want your London drugs
Every once in a while when I’m in denial
I wind up doing something I don’t want to do
What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs

On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms
I think we overstayed our welcome
They’re giving us the look at the argyll arms
You happened to notice my anxious commotion
As my heart bled through my shirt
I’ve been a little heavy handed keepin’ it at work

What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs
Every time I’m with you I take too much
I don’t want your London drugs
Every once in a while when I’m in denial
I wind up doing something I don’t want to do
What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs
My anxiety can sleep easy
The show was everything I hoped it would be
And now we’re sitting in the back of the theater
Binging everything that’s left to drink
‘Cause in a moment it’s over
The high and the thrill
Then I’m leaving here so unfulfilled
Well if I don’t change now I never will

What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs
Every time I’m with you I take too much
I don’t want your London drugs
Every once in a while when I’m in denial
I wind up doing something I don’t want to do
What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs

What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs
'Cause every time I’m with you I take too much
I don’t want your London drugs
What’s it gonna take to fix me up?
I don’t want your London drugs1Embed
