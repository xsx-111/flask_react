Strawberry Mansion Lyrics
Hurtlin' towards the earth, set the atmosphere on fire
Then we'll put another notch in the Kuiper
Climb down from the trees to die from a disease
Brought back from the dead by the liars

I don't mind
I'll stay behind

Transmission in static, the silent monastic
Exiled to an island of plastic
Waitin' on translation, the fool's coronation
A permanent summer vacation

I don't mind
I'll stay behind

Set a course for the sun
To bittersweet oblivion
The time has come, the rain has gone
Back to hell where we belong
The games we've been playin', the real estate is changin'
The mountains and rivers to lake beds
Concrete to dust, iron to rusted
Statues reign over the ocean

I don't mind
I'll stay behind

Set a course for the sun
To bittersweet oblivion
The time has come, the rain has gone
Back to hell where we belong


Set a course for the sun
To bittersweet oblivion
The time has come, the rain has gone
Back to hell where we belongEmbed
