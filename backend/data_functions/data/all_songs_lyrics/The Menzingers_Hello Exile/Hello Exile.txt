Hello Exile Lyrics
Her language was a perfect phrase
Her playful prose followed me for days
Down the alleyways of my desire
To their final resting place

In a vacation town where I lived year round
She migrated here with the summer crowds
And we fell in love under impossible smiles
Life was perfect if just for a little while

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And a thousand years may come and go
We may never meet another soul
Here on our own island of Elba in the Poconos
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And we bathed in the sun
Cut our jeans into shorts
Outstared every star in the sky
Under the cover of nowhere the present was a present
It looked beautiful on you every night
But we knew it would end yeah we knew it all along
It was a future never reconciled
It’s as if letting your shackled heart feel loved was more difficult than total denial

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And a thousand years may come and go
I may never meet another soul
Here on my own island of Elba in the Poconos
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

Now I imagined her memory would fade in the void
She’d only reappear every now and again
I’d smile at the thought of us
Go back to my day
But that was purely wishful thinking

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile
And a thousand years may come and go
I may never meet another soul
Here on my own island of Elba in the Poconos
And just play the last set of my mind
Our passions were real from the summertime
Swimming in the Delaware wringing out your long blonde hair
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
