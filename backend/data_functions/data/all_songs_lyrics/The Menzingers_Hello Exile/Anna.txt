Anna Lyrics
I’ve memorized every single moment
Every fleeting passage of time
The way you’d laugh and dance in the kitchen
After drinking too much cheap red wine
I always rewind, the home movies in my mind
Back to the times, first moving in with you

I have so much to tell ya
Please come back to Philadelphia
This place ain’t the same without you Anna

You got a great big new promotion
But now you travel so damn much
It's like our studio apartment
Is just a place to keep your stuff
And when you’re away, I walk around in a haze
Reminiscing the days, first moving in with you

I have so much to tell ya
Please come back to Philadelphia
This place ain’t the same without you Anna
And oh, how the neighborhood's changed
And all our friends keep asking for ya
This place ain’t the same without you Anna
But I will wait, for you babe
Take as long as you need to take
I’ll be fine on my own
Counting down the days until you come home

I have so much to tell ya
Please come back to Philadelphia
This place ain’t the same without you Anna
And oh, how the neighborhood's changed
And all our friends keep asking for ya
This place ain’t the same without you Anna

But I will wait, for you babe
I have so much to tell ya
I have so much to say
Take as long as you need to take
I have so much to tell ya
I have so much to say
Oh, Anna2Embed
