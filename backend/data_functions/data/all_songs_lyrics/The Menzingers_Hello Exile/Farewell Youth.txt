Farewell Youth Lyrics
PA turnpike, northbound on a dark night
Driving into Scranton for a difficult occasion
When you first got your license we were nowhere to be found
I was just a little kid back then but you let me hang around
But we’re older now

Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

The grief starts when bumping into friends turned acquaintances
We stumble around the small talk
We break the silence with Jameson
But once we were inseparable
We were the only punks in town
We spent every weekend raisin’ hell in the basement of your parents house
But we’re older now

Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids
In someone's apartment, getting fucked up
To all our favorite records, drinking the cheap stuff
We couldn’t get enough of growing up
I saw my childhood flash before me in the death of your closed eyes
At your Irish wake we celebrate by trying not to cry

Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

Farewell youth
Farewell youth
Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
Farewell youth
Farewell youth
Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
Because I was always hanging out with the older kidsEmbed
