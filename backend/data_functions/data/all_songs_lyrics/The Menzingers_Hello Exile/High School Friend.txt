High School Friend Lyrics

Raisin' hell in Wayne County
With a copper on our tail
Hopin' that he drives on by me
But knowin' this town he’ll probably throw us in jail

We’re both so paranoid in our hometown
There's so much unclaimed baggage at the carousels
And though we’re guilty of nothing, we feel like fugitives running
Towards the Great White North or a border town in Mexico

There's former you, there's former me
We’re tellin' tales of revisionist history
I remember the days we couldn’t hardly wait to end

I was getting fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
I was gettin' fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went

We left town the minute we turned 18
We moved to different corners of the country
Now we come back for holidays and funerals
So much has changed, but Wayne County’s still the same
Drivin' down 191, there's an old memory of someone
As a little white cross just popping out from the bend

I was getting fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
I was gettin' fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went

(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don’t let the overwhelming sorrow shred all hopes of tomorrow
Don’t let em tell you how to live your life
'Cause they may never understand, but it’s okay because I do
We know all the ups and downs each other have been through

I was getting fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
I was gettin' fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went

(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)Embed
