Strangers Forever Lyrics
My inner monologue is writing
S.O.S  on deserted Islands
And  there's no one out there to read the signs
Just distant oceans and great blue skies

But my miserable memory is making me more miserable
My  mundane mind is waiting on some kind of miracle

Maybe  it's for the better we both stay strangers forever
Maybe it's for the best we pretend like we never met
Forget  everything that we've ever known
Maybe it's for the better we both stay strangers forever
Strangers forever, strangers forever, strangers forever

Well I built a raft out of total desperation
And  I got kidnapped by a pirate nation
Now somewhere out there I ramble and roar
You wouldn't recognize me anymore
But if I come into your periphery
Please just act like you don't see me
Out here looking for a glimpse of shore
A mirage of the life that we had before
Maybe it's for the better we both stay strangers forever
Maybe it's for the best we pretend like we never met
Forget everything that we've ever known
Maybe it's for the better we both stay strangers forever
Strangers forever, strangers forever
Strangers forever, strangers forever
Strangers forever, strangers forever
