Portland Lyrics
We're two strings shaking in a minor chord
We're survivors of life but we're prisoners of war
It was recklessness, what we came here for
Started on the bed ended up on the floor
We're two strings shaking in a minor chord
Oh Allison I love you, but I can't change the past

Bring the part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back

You wake up shaking in the middle of the night
A voice from the past back looking for a fight
Seize your sorrow, breathe with me
The pause between is all we need
They say it hurts til it doesn't
You said "the future is unwritten, let the past stay in the past"

Bring the part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
(Cheap champagne and roses
I know one day you'll notice)
Bring the part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love backEmbed
