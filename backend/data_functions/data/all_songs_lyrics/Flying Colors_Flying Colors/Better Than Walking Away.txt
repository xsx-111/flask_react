Better Than Walking Away Lyrics
You learned to leave from your father
But you blamed yourself when he walked off
You hold your child like the last one
But then you find yourself trying to stay gone

Rage is a game for the lonely
Love is the mercy we need

It's better than walking away
It's better than walking away
Sometimes it's harder to stay
Than walking away from it all

Holding hands at the table
A kiss goodnight with the light on
Sunrise, words and a coffee
You miss it all just to feel free

Fear is a thief to the family
Brave is the one on his knees
It's better than walking away
It's better than walking away
Love is the price that we pay
Walking away from it all

Rage is a game for the lonely
War is a front for our greed
Love makes a way but it only
Heals when we stay while we bleed

It's better than walking away
It's better than walking away
So many reasons to stay
So walk in and wait for it allEmbed
