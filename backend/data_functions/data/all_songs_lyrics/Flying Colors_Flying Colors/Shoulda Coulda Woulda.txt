Shoulda Coulda Woulda Lyrics
Hangin' on a flag pole
Lookin' like a freak show
Everyone of us has done it
Jumpin' into sinkin' sand
Tryin' to forget it
Blamin' someone else
"They made me do it"
Shedding every ounce of faith
Sucking every cell away
Caving into every impulse
Stuck inside this lonely face
Hiding every scar and stain
Busted in a Tarantino movie

Shoulda, coulda, woulda, shut up
I wished I kept my mouth shut
'Cause I can't change anything I did
Every secret that I hide
Keeps me locked up deep inside

Starin' at the future
Draggin' every footstep
Maybe there's another way out
Tell me there's another place
Tell me there's another day
Tell me there's another way out
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, shut up
I wished I kept my mouth shut
'Cause I can't change anything I did
Every secret that I hide
Keeps me locked up deep inside

Wanna reach back
Wanna reach back
Wanna reach back
Wanna reach back
Wanna reach back
Back in
Wanna reach back
Wanna-wanna reach back
Wanna reach back
Wanna reach back
Wanna reach back in
Wanna-wanna reach-reach back
Wanna reach back-back
Wanna-wanna reach back
Wanna reach
I'll start in the center
I'll work in a mirror
Want somethin' for lust
I'll run from the lust
I'll wake in the mornin'
Walk in the sunlight
Never again, no regrets
Nothin' to make me say I...
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, shut up
I wished I kept my mouth shut
'Cause I can't change anything I did
Every secret that I hide
Keeps me locked up deep insideEmbed
