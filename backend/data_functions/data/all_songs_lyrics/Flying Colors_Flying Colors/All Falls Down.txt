All Falls Down Lyrics
Red knights coming to Rome
Blood in the streets
Kingdoms die overthrown
Lay down your lives
Or be slaves to a fool
When it all falls down

Freedom stolen in sight
Do you love destruction
Or do you want life?
He who is faithful
From ashes will rise
When it all falls down

Wake up, chosen ones
Stand up, fight for love!
Where lies your treasure?
So shall you become
When it all falls down

Wake up, chosen ones
Stand up, fight for love!
Where lies your treasure?
So shall you become
When it all falls down
Wake up, chosen ones
Stand up, fight for love!
Where lies your treasure?
So shall you become
When it all falls
When it all falls
When it all falls downEmbed
