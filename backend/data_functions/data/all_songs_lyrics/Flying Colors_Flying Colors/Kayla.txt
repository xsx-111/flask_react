Kayla Lyrics
Lost in a sea of pain
Like a hole in the wall
You need a change of pace
So let's forget who we are
Look through a foggy lens
As the lines break down
And the never-end
Can begin, right now

All the dark will disappear
Kayla, Kayla
Silent dreams will fill the air
Kayla, Kayla
~
You are the beauty of
Of a place long gone
When you touch my hand
And we forget who we are

All the dark will disappear
Kayla, Kayla
Silent dreams will fill the air
Kayla, Kayla
Love ignites when we are here
Kayla, Kayla
Never wake and never fear
Kayla, Kayla
Oh, come to a place where you want to stay
(The world is blind)
Oh, darkness will leave you along the way
(Darkness will leave you for all time)
Oh, come to this place and let's not go back
(Let's stay for all time)
Oh, swirlin' a world where there is no lack
(There is no lack)

All the dark will disappear
Kayla, Kayla
Silent dreams will fill the air
Kayla, Kayla
Love ignites when we're here
Kayla, Kayla
Never waken, and never fear
Kayla, KaylaEmbed
