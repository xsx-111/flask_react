Fool in My Heart Lyrics
There's a fool in my heart
Who denies what he sees
Who thinks that one day he will stand, though he's cut to his knees
Though he's lost and alone
He always believes
That one day his love will return and he'll find what he needs

Will you be alone
In the place you call home?
Locked away
I will stay with my memories
Will you be alright
In the dark of the night?
I'll be cool
'Cause this fool keeps me company

There's a fool in my heart
That will never let go
But there is still something that I really want you to know
I always will love you
Forever, I will
And though it's been years since you left me
This fool loves you still
Will you be alone
In the place you call home?
Locked away
I will stay with my memories
Will you be alright
In the dark of the night?
I'll be cool
'Cause this fool keeps me company

So many times, I just wake it up and shine
Can you feel it coming?
Coming over and over and over, again

Will you be alone
In the place you call home?
Locked away
I will stay with my memories
Will you be alright
In the dark of the night?
I'll be cool
'Cause this fool keeps me company

There's a fool in my heart that will never let go...1Embed
