Infinite Fire Lyrics
Bitter land of sight unseen
Awaken at the altar
A simple man, a single dream
To live and never falter
Back from the seas, he had to sail
As time had slipped away now
He lands in a place of mystery
There's no way he can stay now

'Cause I will be with you
And I will be with you, again
And I will be (through the infinite fire)
And I will be with you, again

One more chance to fight the fire
That's raging through the forest
The water here's in short supply
There's no way he can store it
Reaching out across the swirl
The wind is a restless danger
Soon he'll reach the water's edge
And no more be a stranger
'Cause I will be with you
And I will be with you, again
And I will be (through the infinite fire)
And I will be with you, again
'Cause I will be with you
And I will be with you, again
And I will be (through the infinite fire)
And I will be with you, again

I'm waiting, I'm waiting

Bitter land of sight unseen
The winter sun is so extreme
We're seeking something different today
Light the lamp from in the earth
A nation from eternal birth
Hold before me absolute sway

Cover me in dust
And hide me now
As light and sound
Come trickling down
Giants turn to rust
It's all going down
Back to the ground
Still I can hear the sound
'Cause I will be with you
And I will be with you, again
And I will be (through the infinite fire)
And I will be with you, again
'Cause I will be with you
And I will be with you, again
And I will be (through the infinite fire)
And I will be with you, again

Seasons and times may take you over
Lead to you places you wouldn't go
So many seeds sown by the sower
Infinite fire come turn us to gold
Seasons and times may take you over
Lead you to places you wouldn't go
Seasons and times may take you over
Lead you to places you would never goEmbed
