Forever in a Daze Lyrics
Watch you walk into the room so smooth
And it cuts me like a diamond
A spiritual reaction ensues
And you're tryin' hard to fight it
Your eyes are echoing my name
Calling me to your castle
And we begin to magnetize
Drawing ever closer

I'm your fire
I'm your fortress
You turn me into a thousand horses
You're my heartbeat
My beautiful dream
You don't even know my name and you got me
Loving you forever in a daze

Enveloped in liquid air
You're holding hostage every stare
Sealing up every escape
For your love, I will give my life
To the venomous viper
I'll turn your soiled dress to white
And get you ready for the morning
I'm your fire
I'm your fortress
You turn me into a thousand horses
You're my heartbeat
My beautiful dream
You don't even know my name and you got me
Loving you forever in a daze

Thank you for the gift
Of giving me a lift
Like a space cartoon
You take me to the moon
Give me just one day
And I will free your mind
Take your lined up faith
And throw it outta time

I'm your fire
I'm your fortress
You turn me into a thousand horses
You're my heartbeat
My beautiful dream
You don't even know my name and you got me
You don't even know my name and you got me
Loving you forever in a dazeEmbed
