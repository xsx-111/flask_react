Blue Ocean Lyrics
In a momentary place
It was written on the wall
But it never really came to us at all
It's an elementary thing
The answer to the call
That will lead us to the great unending hall

With a wheel of emotion
That is always turning
Landing where it may
As the world moves forward
To a new beginning
Still I feel this way

Take me
Where the river meets the sea
To the city made of glass
Where our emptiness is gone at last
Take me
To a world beyond our space and time
Under the crystal water sky
Where we never have to say goodbye
When life never seems to fit
And everything you do seems wrong
And the good don't ever last for very long
Call it miracle or fate
Either one has long since gone
But there's just enough to keep you hangin' on

With your world in commotion
And your senses telling
There is so much more
And with every emotion
Your timeline's screaming
Running through the door

Take me
Where the river meets the sea
To the city made of glass
Where our emptiness is gone at last
Take me
To a world beyond our space and time
Under the crystal water sky
Where we never have to say goodbye
Blue ocean
Take away my memory
Blue ocean
Make it the way it's gonna be

With your world in commotion
And your senses telling
There is so much more
And with every emotion
And your timeline's screaming
Running through the door

Take me
Where the river meets the sea
To the city made of glass
Where our emptiness is gone at last
Take me
To a world beyond our space and time
Under the crystal water sky
Where we never have to say goodbye

Blue ocean
Take away my memory
Blue ocean
Make it the way it's gonna be
Blue ocean
Take away my memory
Blue ocean
Make it the way it's gonna beEmbed
