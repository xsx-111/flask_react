Everything Changes Lyrics
So you found a place you can crawl
I know it's never easy
To live inside a broken heart
Live inside a broken heart
Food just doesn't taste quite the same
Living in a basement
You're fast asleep and never found
Like you never were around

Weighed down traveler
Now you've got nothing to lose
Wade out in the water
Don't leave 'til everything changes you

Somewhere on the journey
You lost the will to keep on going
Well everybody falls apart
Everybody falls apart
Sometimes we must risk all we have
To get to our Eden
Sometimes we're drowning in the blue
Takes everything to make it through
Weighed down traveler
Now you've got nothing to lose
Wade out in the water
Don't leave 'til everything changes

The wind blows the rain through the grass
As the time slows like an old friend
Listless you let go your grasp
And there's rainbows as the road ends
Yet again

Weighed down traveler
Now you've got nothing to lose
Wait awhile, stay awhile
Majesty's found in this place
Now you've got nothing to lose
Wade out in the water
Don't leave 'til everything changes youEmbed
