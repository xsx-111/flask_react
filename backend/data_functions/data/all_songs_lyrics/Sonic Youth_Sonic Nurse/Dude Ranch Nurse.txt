Dude Ranch Nurse LyricsKeep on running in the dark
Dude ranch dream is falling apart
Stolen kisses let's pretend my friend
You play sick and I will mend
Let the action begin again, my friend
You be patient and I'll attend
Let's rehearse let's, do it again
Dude ranch nurse, your brand new friend
Let nurse give you a shot
It's something to do
Took my pulse
Let nurse give you a shot
It's something to do
I could love you
I could love you
Deep sleep coming along
Like a newborn colt you found
You're wrapping around the gauze
Dizzy reminder
Ouch, she found
Let nurse give you a shot
Don't slip too far
I could love you
I could have you
You be cowboy and I'll allow
Let me ride you until you fall
Let's pretend there's nothing at all
Nobody knows the shape I'm in
Kiss me now it's just a sin
Nobody knows the shape I'm inEmbed
