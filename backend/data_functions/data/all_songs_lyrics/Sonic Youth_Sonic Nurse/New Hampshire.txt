New Hampshire LyricsTrace paper flying word
Trace paper flying word break
City scoot high
City scoot high alert
Kill us your scum fight blooze
Kill us your scum fight blooze blues
Johnny Winter
Johnny Winter no show
B.B. King just turns on
The New Hampshire boys
Steve and Joe
Have gone beyond
Doing it for life
Unlike Buddy Guy who has
Decimated the riff bat with one
Hypertonic
Note lead on
Lead onEmbed
