Pattern Recognition Lyrics
I'm a cool hunter making you my way
Like a brand name you'll replay

I will know you
I won't show you, yeah yeah
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

Heat-seeking missile freak
Black magick
Scared to speak
I will know you
I won't show you, yeah yeah
Will you buy me a shaky heart
Let's forget has torn me apart

I will know you
I won't show you, yeah yeah
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
Can you sell me
Yesterday's girl
Because everyday I feel more like her
Oh baby baby
Please don't go
Pattern recognition
Is kind of slow

Like a cool hunter watch the disarray
Keep your secret foolish head away
I will know you
I won't show you, yeah yeah
Close your eyes and feel the fun
Pattern recognition's on the run

I will know you
I won't show you, yeah yeah
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the oneEmbed
