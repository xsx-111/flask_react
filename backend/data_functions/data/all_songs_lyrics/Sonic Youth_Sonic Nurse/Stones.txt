Stones Lyrics
Lights on the stones on backed-up drain
What lovers list on languid stain
We've come together to gather star
Shooting up stones a pallored heart

The dead or alive
There's danger
The dead are alright
With me

We're not gonna run away
We're not gonna leave you stranger
We turn the light on your lonely home

Camera on the haunted stones
Blood-shadow gentle painted scorn
Now it's dancing ink across your skin
Hieroglyphic-lover nature-friend

The dead or alive
There's danger
The dead are alright
With me
We're not gonna run away
We're not gonna leave you stranger
We turn the light on your lonely home2Embed
