I Love You Golden Blue Lyrics
Dead boy stares
Strange to meet you
Dead boy cares
So great to see you

Is it time to go
It's a place I know
I can't read your mind
I can't find the time
I can't feel the thrill
I don't have the will

Dead boy dares
Believe in you
Dead boy stares
Afraid that you will see him

Is it time to go
It's a place I know
I can't read your mind
I can't find the time
I can't feel the thrill
I don't have the will
I love you
A metallic blue
I love you
Golden blue
I miss you
Shine all alone
I miss you

Don't know what to do
I don't glitter like the stars above
I don't glow like neon alone
Don't blush it's just the wind outside
Don't rush to be by my side4Embed
