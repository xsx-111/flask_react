Paper Cup Exit Lyrics
Skimming the tops of tall trees
Through the clear light of free speech
A sudden memory disease
Claims the air all around me
I'm getting lost in the slipstream
Maybe relive the same dream
Of coming in from the cold
And losing half of my soul

Memory disease
Across United States
That I had told the truth
Feel so high
Architectural
I look to the skies
To see our bodies

They were rising up
Out of the paper cup
A sea change is due
Idols in fescue
Touchdown on the new Mason-Dixon Line
The map is ripped and torn
Tilted frame with all hope gone
And I don't mind if you sing a different song
Sing a different song
Just as long as you sing
As you sing, sing along
It's later than it seems
It's later than it seems
It's later than it seems
Time everyone came clean
It's what you didn't say
It's what you didn't say
Don't wanna be a slave
It's what you didn't

Skimming the tops of tall trees
Through the clear light of free speech
I'm coming in for a landing
I've got a soul understanding
It all comes down to a word
It's just like nothing, I heard
Over the rainbow in time
Will be one hell of a climb

High lights, bright
Life
Sweep pie clear sky
Sky
Reminiscent
Of honey in your eye
Unwind
Saturnalia
I don't mind if you sing a different song
Sing a different song
Just as long as you sing
As you sing, sing along

It's later than it seems
It's later than it seems
It's later than it seems
New ears are listening
It's what you didn't say
It's what you didn't say
Don't wanna be a slave
It's what you didn't say
Nothing to give awayEmbed
