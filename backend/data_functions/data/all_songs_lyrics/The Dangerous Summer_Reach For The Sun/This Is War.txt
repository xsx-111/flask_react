This Is War Lyrics
My heart woke up my head like a thunderstorm, a place where I can barely stand
I spent a winter without my air, but now I feel it in my chest
I'm just so sick of the scenery, and all those hours without sex
I get so tired of being me, but now I'm feeling this again

And God knows that you can't see after dark
But I won't give this up 'cause I wrote it on my chest

So tell me what you think of the atmosphere and all those months inside my head
Well do you really believe in me?
I will hold this like a gun because I've got some things to do
(Stay what you are, stay what you are)
Because I've got some things to do

I filled up all my future with written words
I told the whole world I was spent
I came around when they needed me
And that's just how I learned to give
With all the feelings and losing sleep
In the scene where I found hope
Buried deep
And now I never want to go
God knows that you can't see after dark
But I won't give this up 'cause I wrote it on my chest

So tell me what you think of the atmosphere and all those months inside my head
Well do you really believe in me?
I will hold this like a gun because I've got some things to do
(Stay what you are, stay what you are)
Because I've got some things to do

Yeah, I do
I've got all those plans laid out again
Like this is war, and I want to touch the coast again
I'll forget to take my voices going
Forget to hold my breath as spoken
And say, "Don't you remember where you've been?"

So tell me what you think of the atmosphere and all those months inside my head
Well do you really believe in me?
I will hold this like a gun because I've got some things to do
(Stay what you are, stay what you are)
Because I've got some things to doEmbed
