Reach for the Sun Lyrics
I wrote a song about war, the kind that lives in your head
I found a place I can sit, a place where everyday light hits
Like the palm of your hand when you're reaching for something that's
Balled up in the sky
That's the way I like to see myself, reaching for just one star at a time

I heard what was a song inside the earth
I put my ear to the ground and I sang with every word

See, I got lost in the sound
It was the moment I felt sick
Just when I needed it most
There is not much to explain
Except I found myself blinded by every bit of light
I felt so safe inside the sight of the sun
I really think I'm home now, I really think that

I heard what was a song inside the earth
I put my ear to the ground and I sang with every word
I felt a wave so strong, I fell right in it
It hit so hard, and it took my spirit
Know that I belong to you until I die
I remember giving this a try

I screamed so loud 'cause that's exactly how I felt
It broke me out, and I gave up all my plans
I set them down, 'cause I really need to see the sun again
Don't worry, 'cause I'll be fine

I heard what was a song inside the earth
I put my ear to the ground and I sang with every word
I felt a wave so strong, I fell right in it
It hit so hard, and it took my spirit
Know that I belong to you until I die
I heard what was a song inside the earth
I put my ear to the ground and I sang with every word
I felt a wave so strong, I fell right in it
It hit so hard, and it took my spirit
Know that I belong to you until I dieEmbed
