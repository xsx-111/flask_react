Never Feel Alone Lyrics
I drank the weekend to the ground, and you're in my arms
I kept my feelings to myself, and you weren't wearing much at all
It wasn't like me to move closer to you
A feeling's just a feeling 'til you let it get the best of who you are
Then sleep gets harder, and I need more of you
So lay down on the couch and let me show you why I need you more
Than all the boys on your street

Am I wrong, or is this really what you want to happen?
When all I want to do is have this, I'm not strong enough to breathe
Am I wrong, or is this really what you want to happen?
When all I want to do is have this, I'm not strong enough to breathe

So here's the thing with my head: I'm unstable
I'm feeling honesty come out, when really I'm just gone
So now's the part where I get closer to you
Do you feel me when I touch you?
Do I really lack the skills to turn you off?
It's what you do to me

Am I wrong, or is this really what you want to happen?
When all I want to do is have this, I'm not strong enough to breathe
Am I wrong, or is this really what you want to happen?
When all I want to do is have this, I'm not strong enough to breathe
'Cause I'm caught in every single word, and I know that you are something else
Yeah, I reached my point
Well I plan to do my very best to let you know that you're in my head
When I drive out to the coast
I'll bring a piece of you with me so you know
That I'll be coming home

Am I wrong, or is this really what you want to happen?
When all I want to do is have this, I'm not strong enough to stand
'Cause I've been pushed around before, and I've felt the burn
From every inch of my heart, but it's worth it
To never feel alone
Am I wrong, or is this really what you want to happen?
When all I want to do is have this, I'm not strong enough to stand
'Cause I've been pushed around before, and I've felt the burn
From every inch of my heart, but it's worth it
To never feel aloneEmbed
