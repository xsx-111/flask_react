A Space to Grow Lyrics
Six long hours in my head, I watched people in cars
It made me feel like I'm living, I guess it's never that hard
Let's live outside of the city and blame the ones that I loved
For all the shit that I carried when I was never enough

I found a cut somewhere where we could all lay
The world was waking up, and I'm learning now
That my heart isn't breaking down
It's my world, so just pray with me, pray with me, pray with me
'Cause I'm spent

Yeah, I spent them all, those long confusing hours
With my mind turned on, the world was getting louder
I found myself on edge, my feet were over water
Just a song in my head that reminded me I'll never be alone

I found a cut somewhere where we could all lay
It's frank and it's fucked, but I'm learning now
That my heart isn't breaking down
It's my world, so I'll
Take another look at my life and give everything I own
To all the people in my heart
I am free, I am freezing
I am wrong
I am so obscure, it's terrible
And I'm loved
But in between the cars, they bother me
I helped make the art that hangs on your walls
And plays in your heart, it stays in your arms
You're not a machine, I'm sure of that
You're every bit like me, you gave up on your dreams
And now you're stuck with that, you settled for the pencil days
I'm a paintbrush in a way
I'm simple, yeah, I'm plain
I'm colored all the same
I have meaning if you find it in yourself
I'll sell myself or not
Like I
Really give a fuck, I'm just an artist on a shelf

And I'm learning now
That my heart isn't breaking down
It's my world, so I'll
Take another look at my life and give everything I own
To all the people in my heart
I am free, I am freeEmbed
