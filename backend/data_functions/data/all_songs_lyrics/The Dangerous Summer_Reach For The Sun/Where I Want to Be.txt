Where I Want to Be Lyrics
In the back of my mind, well I fought, my God
'Cause all of the hell that's in my time
But I can still see the birds and where they went this year
Our winter made things hazy, and I know
That I was losing sight of my hometown
And in my blacking out, I think I let you down
Don't let them try to save me, 'cause I'm already crazy

And there is something in your face
That pulls me far enough away
I guess that I always knew
That I'd find you when I thought

That I'd be letting out
My darkest now
And in my climbing out, I let you live
I wish you'd try to save me, your silence makes me crazy, it
Takes a lot to say that something is fate, I kind of know where you're headed
Am I too up front, or am I just on time?
Well where is your head at?

And there is something in your face
That pulls me far enough away
I guess that I always knew
That I'd find you when I thought
I reached my point, I let them down
I slept in the worst part of this town
You are my song, and you are where I want to be

I want to take those steps I never have
I need to stand up straight so I can feel your breath
I really think for once that I can change
It's really not that bad
I'm learning now that I was wrong in everything
And that's the reason why I think that I can grow
It's really not that bad
It's in the way you had, it's in the way you had me
All wrapped up, like I'm a part of something, finally
And I'm never looking back

And there is something in your face
That pulls me far enough away
I guess that I always knew
That I'd find you when I thought

I reached my point, I let them down
I slept in the worst part of this town
You are my song, and you are where I want to be
I reached my point, I let them down
I slept in the worst part of this town
You are my song, and you are where I want to beEmbed
