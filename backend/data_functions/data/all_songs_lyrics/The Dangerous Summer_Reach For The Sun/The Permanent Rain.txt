The Permanent Rain Lyrics
So why the sudden change, and what's this all about?
I know they speak your name, but where's the sound right now?
I can't stop praying you'll hear me play
I know that I'll be with you there someday

So where the hell's my hope, and why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot, but I won't let this die
You know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
Another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight

Can I pull out all the stops and get out of this town?
I want to make you proud, but I really don't know how
I know it's not helping to hear me say, "I wish it was me in the car that day."
Though something made me stop and think of what you said
You know it meant a lot, but I was just a kid
One with all these dreams of growing up and playing
Music on the road, I've been screaming all these years and thinking of you both

So where the hell's my hope, and why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot, but I won't let this die
You know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
Another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight
See, I wrote this note 'cause I never even told you
You know I've got some things to sing about like we were young
And holding true to all these songs
That always made us pull through
And now I've got some words that I'll write down
And I'm sending this shit out

So where the hell's my hope, and why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot, but I won't let this die
You know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
Another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight
No, not tonight
So where's my hope, and why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot, but I won't let this die
You know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
Another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight
So where the hell's my hope, and why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot, but I won't let this die
You know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
Another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight
No, not tonightEmbed
