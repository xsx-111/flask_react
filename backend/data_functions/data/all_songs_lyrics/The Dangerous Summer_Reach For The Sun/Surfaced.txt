Surfaced LyricsI set my words on the ground and I was grinding my teeth
I planted pieces of light to see if planets could speak
It took my mind by surprise when I was finally free
Through all my darkest days
I felt my heartbeat again, and dropped to my knees
There was a sun in my eyes that made a star out of me
It's like my life was a list and my head was first
To get crossed off
And it's the pleasure that I keep to sit down with my friends
And talk about my day
Can you hear me?
Well I don't even care
I'll stop my screaming
If you look the other way
It's been a bad year
So let me sleep in one more day
I really found the simple things live closest to your home
I'm not alone because I live inside a world that is my own
I haven't found what I've been looking for yet
But you can count on me to stay forever
And that's the truth, we'll stay just fine
I'm coming back, and just on time
To be myself again, the way that made me real
So tell me, have you surfaced yet?
This is how it felt when I was growing up
And being part of no one, but you found yourself
That says a lot to me these days
I'm sorry for the way I used to be
I was just a kid
Just a kid
Can you hear me?
Well I don't even care
I'll stop my screaming
If you look the other way
It's been a bad year
So let me sleep in one more day
I really found the simple things live closest to your home
I'm not alone because I live inside a world that is my own
I haven't found what I've been looking for yet
But you can count on me to stay forever
Yeah, let me sleep it off
"Try not to be hard on yourself"
Was all I ever heard from her
I finally think I understand what she was saying to me
Because nothing's worth the pain in your back, believe in that
The world can take control but don't ever lose your heart
Because I know you better than that
Because I know you better than that
Can you hear me?
Well I don't even care
I'll stop my screaming
If you look the other way
It's been a bad year
So let me sleep in one more day
I really found the simple things live closest to your home
I'm not alone because I live inside a world that is my own
I haven't found what I've been looking for yet
But you can count on me to stay foreverEmbed
