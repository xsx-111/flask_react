Weathered Lyrics
I felt unable, I was lying on my side
In the same clothes from the very last night
I wanna pray that I'm doing everything right
I saw my mom die for the very first time
She was an angel, God took her from the sky
And there's a million other people that I found
Who cared more than I ever will

I held that note out
I grabbed my bag, and I left through the door
I let my hair grow
Put these words on my skin, I cannot relate

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice
To call you back and say that everything is bad without you
And I'm lost again, oh god believe I'm lost again

I stayed in bed, and
We took so much that I couldn't even sleep
I waited so long
Though that wasn't even that bad
I never had to be a part of
The world, and I've been making that a goal for reasons that I cannot explain
Well I'm an optimist, but only in a perfect world
I think I'm too stained with all the negativity
From all the people in my way
Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice
To call you back and say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again
Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice
To call you back and say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again

I took a trip down south and felt the sun on my face, and it
Made things okay for a second
I drew a picture of my problems when I was going insane
And I focused on the currents
It's the funny thing about it, I
Never seem to worry that every single current's not the same
It's all about position, and where I choose to lay
And God, I am going away

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice
To call you back and say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God, believe I'm lost again
Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice
To call you back and say that everything is bad without youEmbed
