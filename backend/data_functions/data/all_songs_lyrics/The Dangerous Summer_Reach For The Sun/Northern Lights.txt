Northern Lights Lyrics
It's 2:00 and I was sleeping, but I'm not feeling great
I took some pills to help my thinking
But now I'm thinking worse
Well I was hoping that I could see you if that's not too absurd
Am I in love or am I dreaming?
'Cause I'm not sensibly
Just taken by your words
For once I found the cure
I'm sick of staying up late
'Cause you're not here
And I'm not there
No, I'm not afraid to watch you change me
I'm not afraid to watch you change me
You need to know what you're into
I'll tell you I'm a goddamn piece of work
So I'll just sit here until you enter my arms
'Cause that's the simpleness
Of where I lay my head, I'm a wreck when I'm alone
I'm the boy who lost his home and I'm sensibly just
Taken by your words
For once I've found the cure
I'm sick of staying up late
'Cause you're not here
And I'm not there
No, I'm not afraid to watch you change me
I'm not afraid to watch you change me

I took the Key Bridge north to your parents' house again
I saw my share of lights from the sky outside the city
I brought you things I loved just to show you that I care
I found a place to lay inside of the warmth
And that's the way that I've spent
These last few days of writing all these songs
I swear to God that I love you
'Cause I can't explain this

I'm sensibly just
Taken by your words
For once I've found the cure
I'm sick of staying up late
'Cause you're not here
And I'm not there
No, I'm not afraid to watch you change me
I'm not afraid to watch you change me
Anymore
I'm taken by your words
For once I've found the cure
I'm sick of staying up late
'Cause you're not here
And I'm not there
No, I'm not afraid to watch you change me
I'm not afraid to watch you change me
AnymoreEmbed
