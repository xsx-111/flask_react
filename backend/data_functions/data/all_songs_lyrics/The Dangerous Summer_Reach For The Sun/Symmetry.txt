Symmetry Lyrics
I stayed awake just long enough to see you
Remember Winnipeg?
And feeling simpler back then?
I took a week off from my band and flew out
It was a Saturday
I saw you waiting by the plane

I was always in a way just a long shot
I was never in the clear of that
I am lucky just to be a potential
But I will always make a mess of that
Of that
Of that

I traded symmetry for everything I loved
I took my feelings out, and I had told you I was done
I know your mistakes, does it bother you that I found where they stay?
Can I reach you yet?
I stood up so fast, and I let you down
It was the first time that I heard, I heard that sound
It filled my head with the darkest shade of black
And I met you there
I realized then that I was just a little sad
And I left you there
I was always in a way just a long shot
I was never in the clear of that
I am lucky just to be a potential
But I will always make a mess of that
(I know your mistakes)
I was always in a way just a long shot
(Does it bother you that)
I was never in the clear of that
(I found where they stay)
I am lucky just to be a potential
(Can I reach you yet?)
But I will always make a mess of that
(I stood up so fast)
I was always in a way just a long shot
(And I let you down)
I was never in the clear of that
(It was the first time that I heard)
I am lucky just to be a potential
(I heard that sound)
But I will always make a mess of thatEmbed
