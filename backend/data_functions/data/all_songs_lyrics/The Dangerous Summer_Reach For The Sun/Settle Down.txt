Settle Down Lyrics
I gave my things away
I called the people that I only see on holidays
This next year's gonna burn a hole in me
I spent my weekdays in my car
And the weekends drinking hard enough for two
I think I'll settle down one of these days
'Til I catch my breath
I feel the weight of the world on my back
But I'm not feeling sick to death

'Cause I laid awake in bed and thought of better times
I never want to sleep 'cause I found apathy
In laying down and never waking up
Never waking up

I learned a lot today
'Cause there's a reason why
I'll never live the easy way
I'm trying to be real
I wrote down words inside my arm
That say "I'll never walk alone," 'cause I get tired
I know I'll have my friends in every way
So I caught my breath
And for the first time I found what I'm looking for
I laid awake in bed and thought of better times
I never want to sleep 'cause I found apathy
In laying down and never waking up
Never waking up
I laid awake in bed and thought of better times
I never want to sleep 'cause I found apathy
In laying down and never waking up
Never waking up

Yeah, I went down
Yeah, I found a way
In the city where my father was born, I had a dream I moved out west
I finally found out what I wanted to be, so I picked up where I left
And I waited two more years and covered up my ears
I think I'm ready to sing this time
(I think I'm ready to sing)
I think I'm ready to sing this time
I really think I'm gone

I laid awake in bed and thought of better times
I never want to sleep 'cause I found apathy
In laying down and never waking up
Never waking up
I laid awake in bed and thought of better times
I never want to sleep 'cause I found apathy
In laying down and never waking up
Never waking upEmbed
