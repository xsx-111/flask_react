Mississippi Mud Lyrics
When the sun goes down, the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Hey, hey, uncle Dud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
What a dance do they do
Lordy, how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet on the Mississippi mud

Lordy, how they play it
Goodness, how they sway it
Uncle Joe, uncle Jim
How they pound that mire with vigor and vim
Joy, that music thrills me
Boy, it nearly kills me
What a show when they go
How they beat it up either fast or slow

When the sun goes down, the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Hey, hey, uncle Dud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
What a dance do they do
Lordy, how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet on the Mississippi mud
Oh, Uncle Joe, uncle Jim
How they pound that mire with vigor and vim
What a show when they go
How they beat it up either fast or slow

When the sun goes down, the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Hey, hey, uncle Dud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
What a dance do they do
Lordy, how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet on the Mississippi mudEmbed
