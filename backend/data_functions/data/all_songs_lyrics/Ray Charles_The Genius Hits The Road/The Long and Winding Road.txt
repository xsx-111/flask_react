The Long and Winding Road LyricsThe long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Leads me to your door
The wild and windy night
The rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why keep me standing here
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
But Still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to you doorEmbed
