Sentimental Journey Lyrics
Going to take a sentimental journey
Going to set my heart at ease
Going to make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories
Got my bag, I got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that, "All aboard"
Seven, that's the time we leave at seven
I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track
That takes me back
Never thought my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Got to take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey homeEmbed
