Rainy Night In Georgia Lyrics
Hovering by my suitcase
Trying to find a warm place
To spend the night
Heavy rain falling
Seems I hear your voice calling
"It's all right"

A rainy night in Georgia 
It seems like it's raining all over the world
I feel like it's raining all over the world

Neon signs a-flashing
Taxi cabs and buses
Passing through the night
A distant moaning of a train
Seems to play
A sad refrain to the night


How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life and you just got to play the game
I find me a place in a box car
So I take my guitar
To pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I feel fine


Oh, have you ever been lonely, people?
And you feel that it was raining all over this man's world
You're talking about
