Alabamy Bound Lyrics
I'm Alabamy bound
They'll want no heebie-jeebies hanging around
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth
All I'm worth to plant my tootsies in an upper berth

Just hear the choo-choo sound
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground
So I will shout it so the world can know
Here I go, I'm Alabamy bound


Just hear the choo-choo sound
I know that soon we're going to cover the ground
And then I'll holler so the world can know, here I go
I'm Alabamy, I'm Alabamy bound, I'm goneEmbed
