Deep In the Heart Of Texas Lyrics
The stars at night are big and bright
(Where's that happen, Ray?)
Deep in the heart of Texas
The Prairie Sky, is wide and high
(What's that place now?)
Deep in the heart of Texas
The sage in bloom is like perfume
(What's that place again please?)
Deep in the heart of Texas
Reminds me of the one I love
(What place are you talking about?)
Deep in the heart of Texas, yeah

The Coyotes wail along the trail
(Did this happen in New York, Ray?)
Mmm-mmm, deep in the heart of Texas
The rabbits rush around the brush
(This has to be California)
No no, deep in the heart of Texas
The cowboys cry, "Ki-yip-pee Yi"
(Can this be Brooklyn?)
I'm afraid not, it's deep in the heart of Texas
The Dogies bawl, and bawl and bawl
(Now name it for me)
Deep in the heart (What'd you say now?)
I said deep in the heart (I can't hear you)
Deep in the heart (Where's that?) of TexasEmbed
