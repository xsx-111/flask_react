Chattanooga Choo Choo Lyrics
Hey there, pal, what you say?
Step aside partner, it's my day
Bend an ear and listen to my version
Of a really solid, Tennessee excursion
Pardon me boys, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Yes Yes, Track 29!
Boy you can give me a shine
Can you afford to board, the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
I've got my fare
And just a trifle to spare
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina
When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shuffle all the coal in
Got to keep it rolling
Whoo Whoo Chattanooga there you are
There's going to be, a certain party at the station
Satin and Lace
I used to call funny face
She's going to cry
Until I tell her that I'll never roam
So Chattanooga Choo Choo
Won't you choo choo me home
Get aboard
All aboard
Chattanooga choo choo
Won't you choo choo me homeEmbed
