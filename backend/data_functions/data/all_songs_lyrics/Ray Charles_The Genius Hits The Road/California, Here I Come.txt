California, Here I Come Lyrics
California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers and flowers bloom in the sun
Each morning at dawn, birdies sing and everything
A sunkissed miss said, "Don't be late"
That's why I can hardly wait
So open up your Golden Gates
California, here I come


A sunkissed miss said, "Don't be late"
That's why I can hardly wait
So open up your Golden Gate
California
California
California, here I comeEmbed
