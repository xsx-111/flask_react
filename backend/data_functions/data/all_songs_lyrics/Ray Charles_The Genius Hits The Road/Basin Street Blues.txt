Basin Street Blues Lyrics
Why don't you come along with me
To the Mississippi?
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
And steam down the river, down to New Orleans
You know the band's there to meet us
Old friends to greet us
Where all the light and the dark folk meet
A-way down yonder down on Basin Street

Let me tell you about that Basin Street
Is the street where the elite always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems
Or just how much it really means
Glad to be, yes, siree
The welcome's free and dear to me
That's why I can't lose
These Basin Street blues


Oh, Basin Street
Is the street where the elite always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems
Or just how much it really means
I'm glad to be, yes, siree
The welcome's free and dear to me
That's why I can't lose
These Basin Street blues
Ah, that's why I can't lose
These Basin Street bluesEmbed
