Feel the Benefit Lyrics

You went out on the street without your shoes on
You didn't listen what your momma said
She said you won't feel the benefit (Won't feel the benefit)
And if we all went out without our shoes on
Tell me where would we be? (Where would we be?)

If all the people in the world lost their reason
What would we see? Where would we be?
If all the entertainers in the world lost their music
What would they play? What could they say
To pacify the crowd, to justify themselves?
Won't feel the benefit

You're like a cloud behind the sun
Like the face behind the clown
You're moving like the wrinkles in a frown
And you can never look back
A leaf that's borne upon the wind
A cardboard suitcase in your hand
The wanderer soon returns
And finds the colour of the grass is just the same
On the other side of the tracks (Oh)

Ooh when you smile it's like a holiday
Ooh pack your bags and we can get away
We'll float on a Queen down to Rio
There's no need to shave
We'll be stinking like rum in a punch

You can walk on the water
You can dabble in the mumbo jumbo
You can smoke a little ganja
Float like a bird over Rio, Rio
You can ride with the Gauchos
Swinging your bolas in a red bandana
You can run with the devil
Takin' your chances with Se√±orita
You can drink a lot of coffee in Brazil
But the bill is gonna make you ill


So you can go out on the street and take your chances
But if you do, you better do it right
Or you won't feel the benefit (Won't feel the benefit)
Spin the wheel and take your chances
And your number might come up
Though the odds may be in favor of the house
If all the people in the world would say together
We're all black and white, we're all day and night
If all the people in the world could sing together
How would it sound? What would we feel?
We'd all feel the benefitEmbed
