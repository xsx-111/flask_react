Marriage Bureau Rendezvous Lyrics
Well I've been lookin' after number one for too long
And it seemed that love was passing me by
So I thought I better do something about it
And that's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you
That's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you

Well a lonely man needs a marriage bureau
Where they sit you right down and you fill in a form
Would you like a blonde or a black or a blue rinse?
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim, long and tall?
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim, long and tall?
Oh no, too many questions

I'm looking for a girl like Momma used to be
She's cooking up a dream, she's baking ecstasy
Won't it be fine when
I find her

Would I like to take her to a movie or the theatre?
Would I pick her up at home or would I like to meet her?
Somewhere we could take a good look at each other
Smile and say hello or walk away
Smile and say hello or walk away
So I'm squeaky clean in and out of the bath
I never shaved so close before
I'm gonna put on a tie
I'm gonna shine up my shoes
I'm gonna slick back my hair
I've got nothin' to lose
Oh, oh, I'll be stinkin' so good
Like I'm drowning in a sea of cologne

Hey, do you know you remind me of someone?
But I'm here making eyes at you
And I think we're gonna say goodbye to the bureau
Close the files, turn the page, start anew
Close the files, turn the page, start anewEmbed
