Modern Man Blues Lyrics
I'm tired Lord and I'm drawn
And I'm chilled right to the bone
I crawled home from my work
And this note said she was gone
Said your dinner's in the cat
And your love is out the door
I'm goin' back to my momma
And I don't want you no more, no more
She said she don't want me no more
She's gone back to her momma
Said she's never never comin' back no more

Now a man can take so much
And only heaven knows his limit
But a naggin' bitchin' woman
Digs a hole and puts him in it
A sophisticated man
Needs a little something on the side
So what you don't get at home
You've gotta get outside, hey

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money (Whoo)
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad that woman's gone
Now time goes marching on
And it won't wait for you
You've gotta take it when it's offered
Go out and get it when it's due
Now a man can move much faster
Without a millstone around his neck
So if you get the chance to lose it
You've gotta drop it and run like heck, hey

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money (Whoo)
She's gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone, gone
I'm so glad that woman's gone
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad that woman's gone
She's gone, gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
Gone
I'm so glad that woman's gone
(Na na na na na na na na na na na na)
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey (Whoo)
She's gone, gone
I'm so glad that woman's gone
Ooh, she's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
Yeah, she's gone, gone, gone
I'm so glad that woman's gone (Whoo)
She's gone, gone
I'm spending all of my money
Yeah, she's gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone, gone, gone
I'm so glad that woman's gone
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
Well she's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone, goneEmbed
