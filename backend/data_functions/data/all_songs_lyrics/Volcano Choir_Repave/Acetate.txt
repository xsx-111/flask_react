Acetate LyricsI will hobble you around
I may drive you down
There are promises I make
There are promises that I'll take away
But I won't beg for you on acetate
I won't crawl on you to validate
Tear those numbers down, I won't be having them around
For now
"Cause I'll be on the leash
I was jostling there for weeks
I will never cauterize / I will never tow the lines
I will never fortify and I wonder if I recovered now
You found me on the beach
I was resting there for weeks
I will never cauterize
I will never fortify and I wonder if I recovered now
But I won't beg for you on acetate
I won't crawl on you to validate
Tear those numbers down, I won't be having them around
For now
(It's one way or the other)
It's shudders up under the covers
I've tumbled up under fronters row
Wonder if I've recovered now
But I won't beg for you on acetate
I won't crawl on you to validate
Tear those numbers down, I won't be having them around
For now
Shout it, shout it golden loud
The apple's on the archer's ground
No longer feeling tepid now
SHOUT IT say it louder now
I wanna carry on ...
Tear those numbers down1Embed
