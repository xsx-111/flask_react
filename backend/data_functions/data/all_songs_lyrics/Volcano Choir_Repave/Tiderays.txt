Tiderays LyricsWake up
Soft denims on the floor
Spent nights last sleeping like two fours
We're tall neither
And the full fever
And the dawn quakes
Haste back the seething den
Baby
This is not sin
It's nineteen inkings
Or one fresh inkling
On the hard nights
You're the ace right
And you would break down so gentle in my livery
Now you're levying
Past the sediments
Now you're leveling
You built up that benevolence
Tiderays
Yeah, whatcha didn't film matters
Yeah, whatcha didn't feel flatters
Whatcha didn't find tonight
Won't honor them
(Watch you) Cross the fast black platter
(Watch you) Walk the plain, what's this matter?
Don't calm the evidence
Build up this benevolence
Sway for the tiderays
Brace for the tiderays3Embed
