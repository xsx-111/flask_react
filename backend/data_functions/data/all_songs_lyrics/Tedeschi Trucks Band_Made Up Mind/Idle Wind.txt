Idle Wind LyricsCan't run away and I don't wanna fade
And I don't wanna walk in alone
Can't help the news but I don't fault you
And I brought it all on my own
How I wish I could fly
Like a bird in the summer sky
Just a ship with a sail
In the idle wind, idle wind
Now I've got things to do and I'm telling you
And I don't wanna stay anymore
And I wasn't shy like dream on high
Now I'm old and I don't really care
I'm just trying to be somebody happy
I'm just trying to be somebody smart
How I wish I could fly
Like a bird in the summer sky
Just a ship with a sail
In the idle wind, idle wind
Why don't you sail away with me?
Love tell did I buy you baby
You got me...
Cause in the dim of night
And I sense some hope in the air
Now this warm little world
That must be hear
Must be spook and unprepared
How I wish I could fly
Like a bird in the summer sky
Just a ship with a sail
In the idle wind, idle wind
Idle wind, idle windEmbed
