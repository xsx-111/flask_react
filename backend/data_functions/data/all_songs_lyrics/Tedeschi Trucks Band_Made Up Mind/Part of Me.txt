Part of Me LyricsI wasn't sure
If you coming back to me
All of your loving
The pleasure of our sweet melody
These are the days
The days of reflecting
On the times that we had
I'm gonna wait
All alone
Until the day when you come home
Don't you know I never left you darling
Now I found that you were
Alway a part of me
Search the world and I'll finally followed
The one and only kind of love
That sets me free
I was on the wrong path
When I realized I looked back
And I knew what I saw
I saw you play a song for me
You brought me to tears
You brought me deeper
Dropped me to my knees
It was a love
Love so real
It was something that I'd never feel
Don't you know I never left you darling
Now I found that you always
Were a part of me
Search the world and I'll finally followed
The one and only kind of love
That sets me free
Together we've grown
And we left the storm behind
You gave me shelter
And it held the test of time
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna let you
Pass me by
I'm done running
Don't you know I never left you darling
Now I found that you always
Were a part of me
Search the world and I'll finally followed
The one and only kind of love
That sets me free
