Whiskey Legs LyricsMuddy feet and whiskey legs
Comin' at me like a subway train
Riddled language fill my ears with pain
I'm laughing out loud 'cause I feel insane
Too tired to yawn
But I'm willing to run
All this crazy
They keep me hangin' on
Looking for smoke and that ain't no joke
Hillbillies comin' at me
Won't leave me alone
Summer's past and I'm losin' steam
A slummer's call in a winter's dream
Too tired to yawn
But I'm willing to love
Over the withered hills I roam
Tryin' to keep me from going home
Black is the day and white is the night
Just enough blue to make it alright
How many dreams will you let flow by
Before you choose one to ride?
Muddy feet and whiskey legs
Coming at me like a subway train
Overthrow the spirit as the clocks strikes three
Daddy calls are following me
Black is the day, white is the night
Just enough blue to make it alright
How many dreams will you let flow by
Before you choose one to ride?Embed
