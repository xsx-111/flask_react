Calling Out To You LyricsThere was a lady on the mountain
Eyes like pools of water in the sun
Hair flow down my shoulders like the river
I could see her chest, move up and down
Started calling out
She was calling out to you
Hear her calling out
She's been calling out to you
You gotta do right by your woman
As she'll do right by you
Walking with a mason jar of fireflies
She can't find the light she need within
You can hear her ego on the mountain side
Awful singing feeling you can't swing
She was calling out
She was calling out to you
You hear her calling now
Calling out to you
You gotta do right by your woman
As she'll do right by you
She was calling out
She was calling out to you
You hear her calling now
Calling out to you
You gotta do right by your woman
As she'll do right by you
Calling out to you
Calling out to you
Calling out to you
Calling out
Calling out toEmbed
