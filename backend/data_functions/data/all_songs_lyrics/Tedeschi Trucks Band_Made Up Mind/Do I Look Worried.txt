Do I Look Worried LyricsBack in the day when I lie
We'd always fight
Now here you are foolin' 'round
Out every night
I don't have to take it anymore
And I'm tired of always keepin' score
All I'm sayin'
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?
Smacked in the face, such a disgrace you were wrong
I try it again, stay 'till the end, but how long?
We've been here so many times
And I know you've fed me so many lies
All I'm sayin'
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?
Ohh, worried to you
Ohh, 'cause I ain't worried

Fool me once or twice, you know the sayin' - Shame on you!
Now that I'm done with the man, here's what I'll do
I'll find my way to an open door
'cause it's not the same as it was before
All I'm sayin'
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?
Ohh, worried
Ohh, 'cause I ain't worried
Lord, 'cause I ain't worried
You better, you better be worried
Ohh, I'm worried, worried, worried, worried
Yeah I ain't gonna take it
Anymore
Ohhh!Embed
