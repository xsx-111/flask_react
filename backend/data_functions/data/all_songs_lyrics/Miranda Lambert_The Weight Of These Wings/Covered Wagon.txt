Covered Wagon Lyrics
Get the lead out, Mama
Pack up everything we own
The smog's about to get me
And I've got a mind to roam

In my covered wagon
Honey, down the road we go
On down the road we go
On down the road we go

Got an itch to ramble
And I got no place to be
The people in the city
They ain't got no use for me

In my covered wagon
Mama, down the road we go
On down the road we go
On down the road we go
Alright

Baby, down the road we go
On down the road we go
On down the road we go
I'm headed for the country
Can't nothing keep me here
I feel so free and easy
Like a funky pioneer

In my covered wagon
Mama, down the road we go
On down the road we go
In my covered wagon
Baby, down the road we go
On down the road we go
Down the road we go
On down the road we go
Baby, down the road we go
On down the road we go
Baby, down the road we go
On down the road we go
Honey, down the road we go

Down the road I know
Down the road I go
Down the road I go (On down the road we go)
Down the road I go (On down the road we go)
That's alright (On down the road we go)
That's alright (On down the road we go)
Down the road I go
(On down the road we go)
Down the road I go
(On down the road we go)
(On down the road we go)
Down the road I go
(On down the road we go)
Down the road I go
(On down the road we go)
Down the road I go
(On down the road we go)
On the road I know
(On down the road we go)
Down the road I go
(On down the road we go)
That's alright
(On down the road we go)
(On down the road we go)
(On down the road we go)
(On down the road we go)Embed
