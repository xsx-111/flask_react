Dear Old Sun Lyrics
Dear old sun
How you holding up?
Through the winter cold
Up there all alone
February's been hard on a heart
But we're near the end
And it's almost March
Though the sky's been grey
And in our way I still see your light

Well, you melt the snow
And you grow the roses
And you dry the tears
And you freckle noses
Our little world
Revolves around you
Coming up and going down

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Dear old sun
Let's call it a day
And I watch you set
I'll let you rest
But I'll wait for you
Like morningâ€™s dew
'Til I see your light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oohh ooh-ooh-ooh

I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight
I still see your light
I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight
I still see your lightEmbed
