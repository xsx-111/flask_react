Intro-Lude Lyrics
(Yo, I'm checkin' for Left Eye man)
Oh God 'G', hm
I don't know God, I don't know God
I don't God, I don't really really know, check my flow...

My man Al B. Sure! "He's In Effect Mode"
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get wit me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Um, speakin' of which, you know how I troop
Late Thursday night playing ball at run and shoot
I see my girl Chilli in her Lexus Coupe
Sittin' pretty, oohh, in that hot pink suit
And BAM!! In through the door she struts
It's the lovely T-Boz with the ill haircut
(But Left Eye's the dime piece)
Yeah, you know it's all good
But I heard...was a hood...
It's like that y'all
My name's Malik the Five Foot Freak
It's like that y'all
My name's Malik the Five Foot Freak
It's on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E I rule
TLC up in the house, CrazySexyCool
You know what I'm sayin?
