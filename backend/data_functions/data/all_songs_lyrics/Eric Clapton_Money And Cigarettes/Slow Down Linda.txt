Slow Down Linda Lyrics
Well, if you're looking for a winner
Then you know you've got to go with me
I've got more ashes than Wednesday
And you know I can brew my tea
I'm fixing to teach you everything I know
I'll take you with me, baby, everywhere I go
If I can catch you for a minute
I know you'll take a chance with me

So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you think that you could save a little time with me?
So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company?

I've seen you speeding down the highway
When you ought to dig the scenery
And you can wolf down your dinner
In the time it takes to drink my tea
You're always rushing around everywhere you go
You leave me eating dirt on the side of the road
I can't keep running much longer
You always go too fast for me

I think that you're getting too old to be running around
I think that it's time you thought about settling down
So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company?

You're always rushing around everywhere you go
You leave me eating dirt on the side of the road
I can't keep running much longer, you always go too fast for me
