Pretty Girl Lyrics
Pretty girl, you are the light of my life
I mean my everything
You're the one I chose to make my wife
That's why you wear my ring

And when I'm feeling down and out
You're the one who will bail me out
My love will always guide me home
Pretty girl, my pretty girl, pretty girl, my pretty girl

Pretty girl, don't ever say goodbye
Don't ever let me be
If you do, you know that I will die
You mean that much to me


Pretty girl, hear what I have to say
It's something you should know
You brought me sunshine on my darkest day
That's why I love you so
