Everybody Oughta Make a Change Lyrics
Change in the weather
Change in the sea
Come back baby
You'll find a change in me

Everybody, they ought to change sometime
Because sooner or later
We have to go down in that lonesome ground

I changed suits
I changed shirts
I changed, baby
Just to get shed of the dirt


I changed honey
I changed money
I changed, people
Just to keep from being funny

Change in the ocean
Change in the sea
Come back baby
You'll find a change in me
