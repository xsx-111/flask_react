Crosscut Saw Lyrics
I'm a crosscut saw
Baby, drag me across your log
I'm a crosscut saw
Baby, drag me across your log
I cut your wood so easy for you
You can't help but say, "Hot Dog!"

Some call me Woodcutting Sam
Some call me Woodcutting Jim
The last girl I cut wood for
She wants me back again


I got a double-bladed axe
That really cuts good
Well, I'm a crosscut saw
Going to bury me in your wood
