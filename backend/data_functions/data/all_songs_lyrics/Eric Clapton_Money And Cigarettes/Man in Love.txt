Man in Love Lyrics
You're always in my hair, you keep me feeling fine
I celebrate every time I realize you're really mine

Because I'm a man in love
Yes, I'm a man in love
I tell it everywhere I go
I want the whole world to know
That I'm a man in love

I used to be so sad, like a dog without a bone
And then you gave me something baby I had never known


I love to see you walk up and down the street
You look so pretty baby from your head down to your feet


Well, the minutes seem like hours, and the hours seem like days
And the days they seem like years every time you go away
