Crazy Country Hop Lyrics
Way down in a country town one day
A little, old country band began to play
They had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone
When the leader said go them cats began to blow

Ooh wee oh oh
Ooh la la, let's rock and roll

Now all the people gathered around
Just to dig that rocking-rolling sound
Suddenly the drummer rang a bell
And all them country cats began to yell


Old McDonald did a crazy bop
Said it's time to milk my cow, I got to stop
But just before I cool it and cut out
Here's something all you cats can think about

Snaggle-toothed Malinda was a drag
She latched onto a dude who showed up stag
He tried to run and then he tripped and fell
She kissed him and we all could hear him yell


Well, a hound dog ran a polecat into town
Brought him to the dance and laid him down
Someone hollered skunk and you can bet
All them country cats is running yet
