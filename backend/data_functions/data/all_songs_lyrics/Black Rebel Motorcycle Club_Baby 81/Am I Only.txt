Am I Only LyricsNothing seems to show
The feelings come and go
And everything's so strange
The people never change
Am I only
Only one of you
Emotions never known
They talk though what you show
So easy you let go
What's left is torn and thrown
Am I only
Only one of you
You turn into a song
And everything feels wrong
There's so much more to see
But lost is meant to be
Am I only
Only one of you
Am I the only lonely one of you
Am I the only lonely one of you
Am I the only lonely one of you
Am I the only lonely one of you
Am I the only lonely one of youEmbed
