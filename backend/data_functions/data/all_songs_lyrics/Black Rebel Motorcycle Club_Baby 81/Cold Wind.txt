Cold Wind LyricsCan't change all the things I've done, I know
I'm chasing the reasons and my soul
I feel it gone
I feel it gone
I've been waiting for the right time just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
Waiting for the right time just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
I've been here a thousand times, I know
I thought that the point was to take it slow
Now I know what you said was true
I feel it gone
I feel it gone
I've been waiting for the right time just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
Waiting for the right time just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
And I feel it all
There's nothing left of this
They steal your innocence
There's nothing left of this
What use is innocence
There's nothing left of this
I'm drowning in my own disease
Now I know it, now I see
I feel it all
I feel it all
I've been waiting for the right time just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
Waiting for the right time just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
And I feel it all
There's nothing left of this
They steal your innocence
There's nothing left of this
What use is innocence
And I feel it all
Yeah, you're awake and you know it 'cause you hit the ground
Yeah, I'm awake and I know it 'cause I hit the ground
Yeah, you're awake and you know it 'cause you hit the ground
Yeah, we're awake and we know it 'cause we hit the ground
Yeah, we're awake and we know it 'cause we hit the ground
Yeah, we're awake and we know it 'cause we hit the groundEmbed
