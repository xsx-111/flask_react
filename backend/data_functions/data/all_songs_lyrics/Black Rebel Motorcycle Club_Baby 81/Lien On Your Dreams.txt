Lien On Your Dreams LyricsThere's a lien on your dreams
That keeps you going under
And a hole in the floor
Drops us all together
You can fight all you like
There's no way to hide
All the lines on your face
Show you've got no place in here
As long as the setting sun will shine
As long as the setting sun will shine
As long as you fight
But it's the same every day
It drives the world insane
And the lies of mankind
Burn you up inside
But it hurts and what's worse
There's no way to reverse
When your mind wants to start
Pulling you apart, baby
'Cause I needed more
And I need it more
Will you satisfy
I needed more
I needed more
But this is more than I ever wanted
It's a joke and we hope
You're pleading from a rope
There's a sound coming down
That burns you to the ground
But they feast while you sleep
It marks you like a beast
But they lie through their eyes
How long can you take it, girl
'Cause I needed more
And I need it more
Will you satisfy
I needed more
I needed more
But this is more than I ever wanted to believe in
It's a shame how we play
But love is not a game
And it works when it hurts
But nothing kills the pain
It's a gas while it lasts
It knocks you on your ass
Without passion you're a fashion
How long can you fake it, girl
'Cause I needed more
And I need it more
Will you satisfy
I needed more
And I needed more
But this is more than I ever wanted to believe in
You're all I came here for
You are my lonely soulEmbed
