Took Out A Loan LyricsI took out a loan on my empty heart, babe
I took out a loan for my patient soul
And I feel alive as long as I don't need you
And I feel alive as long as I keep hold
I took out a loan on my empty heart, babe
I took out a loan for my patient soul
And I feel alive as long as I don't need you
And I feel alive as long as I keep hold
Of what I think, I thought I heard you loved me
I think you thought you heard I loved
Have I been mistaken
Have I been mistaken
I feel confused about the way it's done
I won't be denied, I'm coming in this time, babe
I've fallen in love with your creature's soul
And I've been a witness to your sickest obsession
And I feel alive as long as I keep hold
Of what I think, I thought I heard you loved me
I think you thought you heard I loved
Have I been mistaken
Have I been mistaken
I feel confused about the way it's doneEmbed
