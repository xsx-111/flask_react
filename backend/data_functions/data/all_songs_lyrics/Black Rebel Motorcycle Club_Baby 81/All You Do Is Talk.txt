All You Do Is Talk LyricsHelp yourself, don't say a thing
Your love won't show in anything at all
If all you do is talk
Sadly I remain in need
Of all the things you say but leave in speak
All you do is talk
Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
You're lucky, words don't bleed
You time the end of all we see
You say we're on our way and all will be
Alone in everything
You say it's all we'll ever need
You've found an easy way but still you weep
Alone in everything
Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
You're lucky, words don't bleed
Help yourself, don't say a thing
What love you show won't mean a thing at all
If all you do is talk
Sadly we remain to see
What brings an end is also what we need
All you do is talk
Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
You're lucky, words don't bleedEmbed
