Killing The Light LyricsShe said, you're killing the light
You'll never see it again
We come to suffer, I said
I won't be fooled by the light
I won't be fooled by the lie
The easy road lies in wait
Takes it's toll and all it desires
Leads you blind, leaves you there
Takes your heart and leaves you in silence
Ooh, ooh
Look what you've started
Ooh, ooh
Look what you've started
Ooh, ooh
Look what you've started
Ooh, ooh
We're all broken hearted
She said, don't leave us behind
We'll never be here again
Our lives are closer this way
I won't be fooled by the light
I won't be fooled by the lie
The easy road lies in wait
Takes it's toll and leaves you in silence
Leads you blind, leaves you there
Takes your heart, now that you're wasted
Ooh, ooh
Look what you've started
Ooh, ooh
Look what you've started
Ooh, ooh
Look what you've started
Ooh, ooh
We're all broken heartedEmbed
