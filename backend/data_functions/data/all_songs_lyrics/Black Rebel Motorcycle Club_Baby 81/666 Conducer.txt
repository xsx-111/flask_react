666 Conducer LyricsNo one knows her name but they see her youth and use her
She's feeling free and everything she sees is truth
She's seventeen, she's got everything she needs to lose
Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh no
She's got everyone to help her on her way
She's got everyone to help her on her way
She's got everyone to help her on her way down
He seems to know right where it hurts, your pain in vain
He gives himself to you, he's in your way
And everything he does just seems a phase, insane
Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh no
He's got everyone to help him on his way
He's got everyone to help him on his way
He's got everyone to help him on his way down
Everything you touch tears at your heart apart
Of everything you see down in your soul, never let you go
You've got everyone to help you on your way
You've got everyone to help you on your way
You've got everyone to help you on your way down
