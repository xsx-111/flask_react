Berlin LyricsHey there, little lovers, why we fighting with each other?
Ain't no use in crying like the others

We're all fools in need, too foolish to believe
Im gonna, uh, somebody, uh, somebody, uh, somebody, uh, somebody

And there ain't no use in trying to deceive
I've been fooled by the lover, fooled by the sinner
Fooled myself into thinking I was living

And say, help me, somebody, help me, somebody
I'm fighting just to breathe as I get back on my knees
I'm gonna, uh, somebody, uh, somebody, uh, somebody, uh, somebody
Uhh, somebody's gonna hurt somebody
Uhh, somebody's gonna hurt somebody
Uhh, somebody's gonna hurt somebody
Uhh, somebody's gonna hurt somebody
She said, suicide's easy, what happened to the revolution?
