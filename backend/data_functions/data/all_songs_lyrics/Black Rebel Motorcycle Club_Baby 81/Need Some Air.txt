Need Some Air LyricsYou wanna pick something up, you gotta lay it down
You wanna turn something on, you gotta set it off
You wanna let something in, you gotta tear it out
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air
The only word that you know is please, please, please
The only life that you see is from your knees
I wanna feel the light, I just can't receive
Don't wanna leave the ground, I just need some air
I need some air
It's just a love that you can't get back
It's just a tale of a heart attack
You feel alive, but you're sinking fast
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last
You wanna lift something up, you gotta pin it down
You wanna pull something in, you gotta let it out
You wanna light something up, you gotta burn it down
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air
The only word that you know is please, please, please
The only life that you see is from your knees
I wanna feel the light, I just can't receive
Don't wanna leave the ground, I just need some air
I need some air
It's just a love that you can't get back
It's just a tale of a heart attack
You feel alive, but you're sinking fast
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last
You wanna pick something up, you gotta lay it down
You wanna turn something on, you gotta set it off
You wanna light something up, you gotta burn it down
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air
I need some air
I need some air
I need some air
It's just a love that you can't get back
It's just a tale of a heart attack
You feel alive, but you're sinking fast
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last
It's not the prayer you repeat at night
It's not the saint that has seen the light
It's just the breath that you hold inside
Just keep it cool, it will be alrightEmbed
