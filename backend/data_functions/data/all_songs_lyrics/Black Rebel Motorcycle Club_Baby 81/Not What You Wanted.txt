Not What You Wanted LyricsYou know you've got a lot to learn
You feel it but your heart won't burn
The fear is running every nerve
Your turning to the ones you've hurt
Nothing ever satisfies
You're screaming but your tongue's still tied
Starving but your love won't feed
Nothing ever sets you free
You know you've got a long way down
You'll feel it when you hit the ground
It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters
Pinned inside the walls of sound
Reaching but your hands are bound
Crying but your love's so sweet
Your singing but your heart still weeps
And no one ever seems to care
Feels like she walks on air
It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters
I can't wait for time to save us
And I can't break your fall forever
'Cause you always take
You always take too much
You always take
You always take too much
It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters
It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold, where nothing mattersEmbed
