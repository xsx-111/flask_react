The Likes Of You LyricsI ain't ever seen the likes of you before
I ain't ever seen the likes of you before
I'll be you ever-loving cure
I'll be you ever-loving cure
I ain't ever gonna let you go, baby
I ain't ever gonna let you go, darling
You're my ever-loving cure
You're my ever-loving cure
I ain't ever seen the likes of you before
I ain't ever seen the likes of you beforeEmbed
