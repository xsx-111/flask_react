Weapon of Choice Lyrics
I gotta speak and you want to listen up
There is no time to feast your eyes
You want it all but the world won't give it up
Up to the edge your star will rise

What is your weapon of choice
What's your weapon of choice
There is no weapon to free us all
What is your weapon of choice
What's your weapon of choice
There is no weapon to free us all

I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation
I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation

Everyone's got their own split factions
Every pawn will pay it's price
I've been digging out in all directions
I'll see you through to the after life
What is your weapon of choice
What's your weapon of choice
There is no weapon to free us all
What is your weapon of choice
What's your weapon of choice
There is no weapon to free us all

I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation
I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation

It's too hard to stand aside
It's enough to stop your heart

I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation
I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation
I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation
I won't waste it, I won't waste it
I won't waste my love on a nation3Embed
