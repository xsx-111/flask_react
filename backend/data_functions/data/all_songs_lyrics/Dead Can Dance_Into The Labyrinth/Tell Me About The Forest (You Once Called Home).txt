Tell Me About The Forest (You Once Called Home) LyricsFarewell now, my sister
Up ahead there lies your road
And your conscience walks beside you
It's the best friend you'll ever know
And the past is now your future
It bears witness to your soul
Make sure that the love you offer up
Does not fall on barren soil
For the wind cries of late
In the whispering grass
Our way of life is held
In the spinning wheels of chance
I believe
In the way of long ago
And the sands I believe
Rose long ago
And we're changing our ways
Yes, we're taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home
For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we built above
Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl
We must sing her creation song
Jeune du monde
Invoke the spirits that feed us
This dreaming takes too long
But I'm not bitter
No, I'm surviving
To face the world
To raise the future
So why don't you tell me
Come on and tell me
About the world you left behind
Can you tell me?Embed
