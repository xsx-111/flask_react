How Fortunate The Man With None LyricsYou saw sagacious Solomon
You know what came of him
To him complexities seemed plain
He cursed the hour that gave birth to him
And saw that everything was vain
How great and wise was Solomon
The world however did not wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's wisdom that had brought him to this state
How fortunate the man with none
You saw courageous Caesar next
You know what he became
They deified him in his life
Then had him murdered just the same
And as they raised the fatal knife
How loud he cried: you too my son!
The world however did not wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's courage that had brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none
You heard of honest Socrates
The man who never lied:
They weren't so grateful as you'd think
Instead the rulers fixed to have him tried
And handed him the poisoned drink
How honest was the people's noble son
The world however didn't wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's honesty that brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none
Here you can see respectable folk
Keeping to God's own laws
So far he hasn't taken heed
You who sit safe and warm indoors
Help to relieve our bitter need
How virtuously we had begun
The world however did not wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's fear of god that brought us to that state
How fortunate the man with noneEmbed
