The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove LyricsI thought that you knew it all
Well you've seen it ten times before
I thought that you had it down
With both your feet on the ground
I love slow ... slow but deep
Feigned affections wash over me
Dream on my dear
And renounce temporal obligations
Dream on my dear
It's a sleep from which you may not awaken
You build me up then you knock me down
You play the fool while I play the clown
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in disillusionment
I don't believe you anymore ... I don't believe you
I thought that I knew it all
I'd seen all the signs before
I thought that you were the one
In darkness my heart was won
You build me up then you knock me down
You play the fool while I play the clown
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in a domestic graveyard
I don't believe you anymore ... I don't believe you
Never let it be said I was untrue
I never found a home inside of you
Never let it be said I was untrue
I gave you all my time2Embed
