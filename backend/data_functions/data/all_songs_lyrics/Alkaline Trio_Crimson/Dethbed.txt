Dethbed Lyrics
C-c-c-calling all cars, all coroners
We've got a dead one here
And anybody else receiving this
The west coast is far from clear
Like a time bomb or sudden death
It's gonna find you when you least expect
It's gonna leave you with the emptiest feeling inside
(Over analyzed)

They found me face down in the street
On the night you left to find another place to sleep
In rain and regret
They said they tried everything, but it was no use
Yeah, they tried everything and everyone but you

Falling like stars into the ocean black
We're gonna disappear
And anything left recognizable
Is rubbed away with fear
We've got our hearts dipped in time release
We've got the know-how and the elbow grease
We've got our victim all cut up down here on the floor
(Over and out the door)
They found me face down in the street
On the night you left to find another place to sleep
In rain and regret
They said they tried everything, but it was no use
Yeah, they tried everything and everyone but you

One but you
One but you

They found me face down in the street
On the night you left to find another place to sleep
In rain and regret
They said they tried everything, but it was no use
Yeah, they tried everything and everyone but you1Embed
