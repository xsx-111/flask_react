Fall Victim Lyrics
Not sure how this is supposed to feel
Cutting like a red hot knife of surgical steel
Brought fresh from the autoclave
She came, she came with sterile warnings
Screaming from her blade
Singing, "I wanna make you bleed."

I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting our time
Wasting our time

Down on my knees, but not to pray
Hit so hard across the skull, it buckled my legs
They told me I had hell to pay
I came, I came too close to heaven
Had nothing to say for myself
I had to walk away

I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting our time
Wasting our time
I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting ours2Embed
