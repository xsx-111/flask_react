Settle for Satin Lyrics
It's not so much a storm
But just a cloud that lives inside of me
He doesn't stir so easily these days
But when he wakes, he goes the distance
In a marathon of days too long
Open containers that sing songs
You'll never dream again, but you can pray

I guess we only settle in to what we know
I guess we always settle in, and we know...

That there is comfort in a world
Where darkness is the only thing we see
And cold is all we have to breathe
Where affectations keep us company
Where the lies we tell to the eyes that roll in doubt
Are somehow out of our control

It's not about the scars
But more the crowds that walk all over me
They don't give up too easily these days
But when they break, they go to pieces
Fall apart right here in Northside bars
Under a sky that knows no stars
You'll never shine again, but you will stay
I guess we only settle in to what we know
I guess we always settle in, and we know...

That there is comfort in a world
Where darkness is the only thing we see
And cold is all we have to breathe
Where affectations keep us company
Where the lies we said to the eyes that roll in doubt
Are somehow out of our control
That there is comfort in a world
Where darkness is the only thing we see
And cold is all we have to breathe
Where affectations keep us company
Where the lies we said to the eyes that roll in doubt
Are somehow out of our control
We lost controlEmbed
