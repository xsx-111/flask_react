Smoke Lyrics
Over and out of it
For one more plane ride out
I'm not sure, I never was
If this would all head south, or what

Wait here, a month or two will pass
I'm sure I won't
Faith, dear, enough to get you by
Until we're home

And I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
And I wish that I wrote you one original note

Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again

Over and out of it
For one more plane ride out
I'm not sure, I never was
If this would all head south
And I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
And I wish that I wrote you one original note

Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it againEmbed
