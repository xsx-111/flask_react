Sadie LyricsYou're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here
It's far too bright for you
If they attack you, just lay there
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through
And seconds, they seem like a lifetime, a dream
Recurring, a dream that can't come true
And they'll pin it all on you
After all you've been put through
Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say, and now, miss
Susan A, you're losing every
Opportunity
To put us all away
Now run along my little nightmare, your job is done here
You've scared them all to death
If they revive them, just sit there
Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath
This sentence may seem like a lifetime, a scream
That's curdling the blood they found on you
And your knives and clothing too
Charlie's broken .22
Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say, and now, miss
Susan A, you're losing every
Opportunity
Well they found you and they shipped you up the river the same way
That you've bound and gagged, you've shot and stabbed
You tried to set them free
But they've thrown away the keys
"He represented a God to me that was so beautiful that I'd do anything for him
I'd do anything for God
Even murder, if I believed it was right
How could it not be right if it is done with love?
I have no remorse for doing what was right to me
I have no guilt in me."
Whoa...Embed
