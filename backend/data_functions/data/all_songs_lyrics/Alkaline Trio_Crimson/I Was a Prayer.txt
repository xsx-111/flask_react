I Was a Prayer LyricsI am waiting 'til there's nothing left
I'm a prayer, all you see is breath
I am empty, I am skin and bones
I'm a rib cage
Well, I'm out the door with apathy
And I'm coming home with sympathy
I am realized, I am shamed
I choose to stay here
You got a sign, so I paid a ransom
You felt sorry, so I felt a wrath come
Had a nice grip on my life 'til you twisted my arm
There's a song I love so much I stole
Every precious note I took, I sold
Now I spit out words
Do you see my lungs on the dance floor?
To a hopeless cause I sold my soul
A romantic plastic piece of shit you can mold
Until I break into chokable pieces
You got a sign, so I paid a ransom
You felt sorry, so I felt a wrath come
Had a nice grip on my life 'til you twisted my arm
And I open up like the back of a book
I ruin everything with just a quick look
I settle down like a rocket explodes
Hit the ground but how far out, who knows?
You got a sign, so I paid a ransom
You felt sorry, so I felt a wrath come
Had a nice grip on my life til you twisted my armEmbed
