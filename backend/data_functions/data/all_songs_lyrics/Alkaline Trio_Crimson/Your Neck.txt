Your Neck Lyrics
We're the things that go bump in the night that you can't see
Yeah, we're the mishaps that always happen in threes
This ain't no rocket science, no big mystery
Why the light of day that's shown to us
Is absolutely meaningless to me

Well, first things first, we've gotta find a way
To make the beauty of the nighttime last all day
We'll do our very best to keep our appetites in check
You better watch your back
We may want your neck

Nothing but rotten apples lay here, light years from the tree
Got thrown out of the house at the ripe age of three
I'll do my very best to keep my feelings off my chest
And out of your neck
Out of your neck

We're the things that go bump in the night that you can't see
Yeah, we're the mishaps that always happen in threes
This ain't no rocket science, no big mystery
Why the light of day that's shown to us
Is absolutely meaningless to me
We're the things that go bump in the night that you can't see
Yeah, we're the mishaps that always happen in threes
This ain't no rocket science, no big mystery
Why the light of day that's shown to us
Is absolutely meaningless to me

We're the dreams that crumble into nightmares while you sleep
(We're the things that go bump in the night)
Yeah, we're that feeling someone's watching from the street
(We're the things that go bump in the night)
This ain't no rocket science, no big mystery
(We're the things that go bump in the night)
Why the light of day that's shown to us
Is absolutely meaningless to meEmbed
