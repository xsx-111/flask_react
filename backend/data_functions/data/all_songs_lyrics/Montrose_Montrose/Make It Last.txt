Make It Last LyricsWell, I remember when I was seventeen
My father told me pick your dreams
He said life ain't easy as it seems
When you get older you'll see what I mean, yes
All right, yeah
At the time, I wanted to be twenty-one
It seemed the right age for havin' fun
But when I got there, I was still too young
And twenty-five seemed to be the one
But now I live my life from day to day
'Cause I wouldn't have it any other way
Whether I'm twelve or whether I'm sixty-four
Spend my time like there ain't gonna be no more
Yeah
You know that sweet girl you been chasin' round
She's got you hooked 'long as she keeps you down
Well, I know what happens once she comes around
It won't be long and you'll be back on the town
But now I live my life from day to day
I wouldn't have it any other way
Whether I'm twelve or whether I'm sixty-four
Spend my time like there ain't gonna be no more, uh
Lord, yes, alright
Things between, they suit you right
But once you get them it seems like they're all alike
So make it last as long as you can
It's so much easier when you understand
And you live your life from day to day
Well, I wouldn't have it any other way, no no
Whether I'm twelve or whether I'm sixty-four
Spend my time like there ain't gonna be no more, no
Yeah
Alright
Keep on rollin', c'mon
Make it last
Keep on rollin', right on down, yeah
Make it last as long as you can
Keep on rollin', yeah
Come on, keep on rollin'
Come on, make it last
As long as you can (keep on rollin') Yeah
You got to make it last
Last and last, last and last
Right on down1Embed
