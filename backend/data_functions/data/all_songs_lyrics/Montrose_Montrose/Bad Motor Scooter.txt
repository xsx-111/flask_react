Bad Motor Scooter LyricsIf you get lonely on your daddy's farm
Just remember I don't live too far
There's a red bridge across the bay-yea
You can be at my place in less than a day!
So get on your bad motor scooter and ride!
Come over to my place and stay all night
First thing in the morning we'll be feeling all right!
All right! All right! All right!
So get on your bad motor scooter and ride!
Ooh, the last time I seen your face
Swore that no one'd take your place!
Now, since you been gone, I been feelin' a-bad, yeah!
I come out to your place  I'm afraid of your dad
So you get on your bad motor scooter and ride!
Come over to my place and stay all night. Yeah!
First thing in the morning we'll be feeling all right!
All right! All right! All right! All right!
Get on your bad motor scooter and ride!
Ride! Ride! Ride!
C'mon Baby!
Yeah
Crank it on up!
Get on your bad motor scooter and ride!
Come over to my place and stay all night, babe
First thing in the morning we'll be feeling all right!
All right! All right! All right! All right!
Get on your bad motor scooter
Get on your bad motor scooter
A-get on your bad motor scooter
And ri-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-idEmbed
