Rock the Nation LyricsAll right!
Come on, now!
Ooh, yeah!
Got it in me, I've got it in me
Ain't gonna quit until it all comes out
Gonna do it, ain't nothin' to it
Just shake my hips, throw my head back and shout...
Been a long education
But my homework is done
I'm gonna rock the nation
Just-a wanna have fun, yeah!
Gonna shake it and I ain't gonna break it
I'm gonna show you what it's all about
Got it in me, got it in me now
Ain't gonna quit 'till it all comes out
Been a long education
But my homework is done
I'm about to rock the nation
Just a-wanna have fun
Fun
Oh, yeah!
Have some fun!
All across the nation
Gonna run all across the nation
Come on!
Rock the nation
Got it in me, oww..
Don't wanna quit until it all comes out
Gonna shake it, ain't gonna break it
I'm gonna show you what it's all about
Been a long education
But my homework is done
I'm about to rock the nation
Rock the nation
