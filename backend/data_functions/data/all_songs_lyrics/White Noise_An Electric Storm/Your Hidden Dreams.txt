Your Hidden Dreams LyricsTry holding mist there in your hand
And you'll begin to understand
How life can leave you like a rainbow
See a foot upon the stair
An eye, a hand, a smile beware
Your heart says yes, but something in your brain, no
Why do you let it hold you?
Life must be lived in full view
In every sin there must be pride
Your hidden dreams can't be denied
People who begin to see
The way of life all welcome me
Into their flowery beds of daydreams
You are one that's on your way
So just relax, there's no delay
Let go your thoughts and be engrossed in strange scenes
Why do you let it hold you?
Life must be lived in full view
In every sin there must be pride
Your hidden dreams can't be denied
So quickly take me by the hand
A stranger in a stranger land
I know the secrets of your yearnings
So don't pretend that I can't see
Come, Orpheus, and sing to me
We'll go together and there'll be no turning
Why do you let it hold you?
Life must be lived in full view
In every sin there must be pride
Your hidden dreams can't be denied
Take me, and you'll begin to understandEmbed
