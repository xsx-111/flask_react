My Game of Loving LyricsWhen I smile at you or touch your hand
Do not think I love you, I'm just playing
My game of loving
Getting hungry for my game of loving
When we kiss and touch, don't call it loving
It's only a game I play of loving making pleasure
My game of loving
Getting hungry for my game of loving
My way of loving
Don't think it's true, remember it with laughter
When you're gone and someone else will play my game of loving
My game of loving
Getting hungry for my game of loving
My way of lovingEmbed
