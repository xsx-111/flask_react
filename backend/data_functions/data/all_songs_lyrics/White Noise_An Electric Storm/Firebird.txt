Firebird LyricsBy the storm blown down
She'd a broken wing
When I took her in hoping she'd stay
Milk and honey fed
In a feathered bed
She got well and my love flew away
Firebird
Fly high fly free
I can't hold you down
You're too wild for me
I will search for you
In the nest we knew
But the feathers and straw have gone cold
And at night I dream
You'd come back to me
And your warm body's with me to hold
Firebird
Fly high fly free
I can't hold you down
You're too wild for me
With the break of dawn
All the dream is gone
And I sink once again to the ground
But I'm just as high
In a rut looking up
As I was on a cloud looking down
Firebird
Fly high fly free
I can't hold you down
You're too wild for me1Embed
