The Visitation LyricsYoung girl with roses in her eyes
Sits on a bed of white sheets
The lights are off, the gloom begins
To thicken as she waits
She's waiting alone in the dark
(waiting...)
Where is the sun and flowered park?
(we're always waiting...)
Why do they always meet in shadow?
Young girl with roses in her eyes
(I'm as close as your breathing...)
Waits for the phosphorescent mouth
(but you can't hear me...)
It's blue and comes upon her neck
In whispers like dry grass
She's waiting for her lover's voice
(I tried to talk to you...)
The sun is gone, the music plays
(but you wouldn't listen...)
From the street corner and she cries
Young girl with roses in her eyes
Hugs close the dark and cries
The words she hears are weak
Her lover is not asleep, he's dead
She feels his breathing by her side
He reaches across the border
Stretching his boneless hand towards her
(...Death is silent, painless
I didn't know what happened
I was suddenly standing above my body
While you looked on
Too much in shock for tears
I tried to speak
But couldn't
I tried to talk to you
But you wouldn't listen
And now we meet
Like guilty lovers in the dark
For such a hopeless moment
And even as we meet, I feel you slipping from me
And I go back
To my darkness...)
The girl with roses in her eyes
(my spirit lingers after you like a faint stream of clouds...)
Speaks with her lover who is here
(my mouth hovers about you forever...)
Like vines their voices intertwine
It is all they have
(I see you waiting for me... summoning up the power as the light dies...)
She struggles to hold him back
(that light we loved...)
He clutches but the power is gone
And the pillow turns to chalk
(Don't go, don't go, don't go...)
(Please don't go...)
(I'm slipping...)
(I tried to speak but couldn't
And now we meet like guilty lovers in the dark
For such a hopeless moment
And even as we meet, I feel you slipping from me
And I go back to my darkness...)Embed
