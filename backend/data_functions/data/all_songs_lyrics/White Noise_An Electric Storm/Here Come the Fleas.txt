Here Come the Fleas LyricsHere come the fleas, they're at your knees
So move over please, I don't want you around me
Dirt on the floor from six weeks or more
You say it's a bore to keep this darn hole tidy
Why'd you do (shut up) the things that most people frown at?
You haven't washed yourself for weeks (Go back to sleep)
Can't begin to clear that mess in the kitchen
The windows cracked, the basement leaks
("What's going on in there? What do you think you're doing?"
 "Here ... would you mind being quiet in there?
A man can't even hear what his own steel band is doing")
Go lie on the stair, you just don't care
You better beware, or I might take a tumble
Here come the fleas, they're on your knees
So move over please, I don't want you around me
Go get a job, stop being a slob
Go earn a few bob...
...and I'll give you a kiss...Embed
