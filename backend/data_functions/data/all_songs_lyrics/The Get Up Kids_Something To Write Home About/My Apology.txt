My Apology Lyrics
You'll be accepting my apology
For taking things too seriously
Sometimes, I'm old enough to keep routines
Sometimes, I'm child enough to scream
For everything I broke in two
You're barely missing me
I'm missing you
And everything you do
I really do
I really do
Sure, I do

My once photographic memory
For recollections' sake is failing me
I can't remember for the life of me

Sometimes, I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
Sometimes, I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
We move on
Get a job where I tell
All of my accounts of someone else
I'm quick enough to judge that they were wrong
And that we knew it all along
Sing a long long-winded song
I would be content to hum along
Hum

If I state that my fingers know where to show
What everyone should have known
I'll let it go
Hopefully, you'll forget
Any words that I put in print
My luck, you'll change
Have strength enough to walk away

Sometimes, I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
Sometimes, I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
We move on
Sometimes, I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
Sometimes, I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
Read and rewrite it wrongEmbed
