Valentine Lyrics
It's words you forget to Anniversary songs
The bottles bite back
Your tolerance wrong
Your good intentions count for little anymore
If you're sorry, why wage war?
I'm not fully convinced
There's something wrong with this
Could another point of view
Biased and untrue
Tear me away from you?

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away?
Apologies are breaking me
Constants aren't so constant anymore

Two days, I wait for calls to come through
Tonight for me translates to yesterday to you
Bend and you wave
You're barely away
I wish I could say tonight
When you bend and wave goodbye
You'd take me with you
Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away?
Apologies are breaking me
Constants aren't so constant anymore
The constants aren't so constant anymore

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away?
(Constants aren't so constant anymore
Constants aren't so constant anymore)
