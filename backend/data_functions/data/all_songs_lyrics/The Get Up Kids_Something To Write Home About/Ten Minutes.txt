Ten Minutes Lyrics
Ten minutes to downtown
Is ten minutes too far
When my friends all say I'm crazy
Maybe I'm being selfish
(Maybe I'm being selfish)
Maybe I'm just scared
(Maybe I'm just scared)
Don't be gone when I get home
I need you there

If I had to explain it
I wouldn't know where to start
It's like you're falling in love while I just fall apart

Ten minutes to downtown
Is ten minutes too far
When my heart is saying, "You're crazy."
Maybe things are getting better
(Maybe things are getting better)
Maybe things aren't so bad
(Maybe things aren't so bad)
Don't be gone when I get home
You're all I have
If I had to explain it
I wouldn't know where to start
It's like you're falling in love while I just fall apart

Pockets empty
How can you tell me that everything will work out?
A pointless fight when you're always right
And everything will work out
It works out

Sometimes, I miss you more
Whenever I'm at home
I've been home all summer
Now, I'm leaving you alone

Pockets empty
How can you tell me that everything will work out?
A pointless fight when you're always right
And everything will work out
Everything will work out
Everything will work outEmbed
