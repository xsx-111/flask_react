Holiday Lyrics
What became of everyone I used to know?
Where did our respectable convictions go?
Your words don't match the story that your actions show
What do I know?

I'm sure you can't help but remembering
I thought that you'd be the one not to forget
Remembering's not helping you yet

Say goodnight, mean goodbye
I know you think my life would stop when you're away
Maybe I can see you on holidays
You're worlds away
I've never forgotten all our yesterdays
I'm lucky if we're speaking on the holidays

The evidence presents itself accusingly
Your absence speaking everything you think of me
Now that I am faced with opportunity
You're not remembering

I'm not asking you anyway
And even if you ever could cave in
I wouldn't know where to begin
Say goodnight, mean goodbye
I know you think my life would stop when you're away
Maybe I can see you on holidays
You're worlds away
I've never forgotten all our yesterdays
I'm lucky if we're speaking on holidays
Holidays
Say goodnight, mean goodbye
I know you think my life would stop when you're away
I'm lucky if we're speaking on holidays
