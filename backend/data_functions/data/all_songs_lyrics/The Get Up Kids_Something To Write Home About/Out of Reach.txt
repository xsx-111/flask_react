Out of Reach Lyrics
Long way from home
Lost by an echo
I'd never have known
I've got pictures to prove I was there
But you don't care

Here's me overseas
Across the pond by the Dover peaks
I've smuggled myself into new nationalities
You think you'd be proud of me

There's room to believe
Out of sight
Out of mind
Out of reach
Start over
Is no way to begin

Long way from home
Lost by an echo
I'd never have known
I've got pictures to prove I was there
But you don't care
There's room to believe
Out of sight
Out of mind
Out of reach
Start over
(Start over)
Is no way to begin
There's room to believe
Out of sight
Out of mind
Out of reach
Start over
(Start over)
Is no way to begin
No way to begin
Way to beginEmbed
