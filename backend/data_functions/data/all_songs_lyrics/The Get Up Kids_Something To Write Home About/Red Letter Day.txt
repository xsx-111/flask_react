Red Letter Day LyricsYou've got some nerve, I never knew
What with the world we gave away in front of you
I see it all much clearer now
You're just a phase I've gotten over anyhow
It's over
I'm not giving in again
We're loyal like brothers
Just us versus all the others
You're the one for...
You're the one for me
I trusted misleading promises worth repeating
How could you do this to me?
Red letter day that I learned
I'm sure you'll get what you deserve
I see it all much clearer since
Far past the point of this
It's over
We're loyal like brothers
Just us versus all the others
You're the one for...
You're the one for me
I trusted misleading promises worth repeating
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me?
And if it's a lie
I don't want to be the one who signed
I'm not the one who falls down
It's over now
If you want to try
Try to forget it
I'll say it's over
I'm gone
We're loyal like brothers
Just us versus all the others
You're the one for...
You're the one for me
I trusted misleading promises worth repeating
How could you do this?
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me?1Embed
