Action & Action Lyrics
You really think that you're bigger than this
To the tune of ten thousand lisps
Who'd have thought we'd represent
When I can't take a compliment?
Overexposure is the key
And any focus on me
Is appreciated
And it should be

No wonder now
I finally found
The right formula for...

You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
You take it all too seriously

What better way to make an honest mistake
Than a televised hand of fate?
When the world closes in on you
A decision would be overdue
Now, nothing left is out of hand
A stronger, jaded man stands
If the world is ending
Then we toast to it
I'm stronger now
But not without
The right formula for...

You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
Here's all you get from me
Here's all you get from me

I'm down for whatever
What's there left to wait for?
I'm down for whatever
What's there left to wait for?
Wait for?
I wait!

You taught me how
I play the fool
Every mistake that I make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
And plain to see
Here's all you get from meEmbed
