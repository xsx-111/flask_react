The Company Dime Lyrics
I watched it all come crashing down
On the verge of a world profound
Standing on unstable ground
Adding insult to irony
I think it's really gonna happen this time
Calls are on the company dime
Reluctance ties up the line with irresponsibility

No matter, save for a friend
No argument can amend
Irreplaceable but in the end
One star player doesn't save a team
Now, you're open to attack
Our burden rests on your back
Replace, re-track
Responsibility

I'm still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this
Anonymous until the ending
Spent a long, long time pretending
And a longer day spent accepting
What the world ahead would store
You only learn by not believing
That the industry is unforgiving
Everything that you've been giving
Isn't what it was before

I'm still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this

Replace, re-track
Replace, re-track
Replace, re-track
I'm still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over thisEmbed
