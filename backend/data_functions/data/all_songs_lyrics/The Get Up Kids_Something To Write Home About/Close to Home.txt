Close to Home LyricsSummer swallowed us whole
Waited for you to come 'round
Every word you wrote down
We read it over to know
Would they believe in us now?
There's no shame like no sound from sources
Hits close to home
Everything that we've found says, "Make your own destiny."
But you're unaware that you should be scared
Maybe you'll learn from mistakes that we make
We're not waiting forever
We know you'll never be there
We're not waiting forever
If you get out, see you there
Summer swallowed us whole
Waited for you to come 'round
There's no shame like no sound from sources
Hits close to home
Everything that we've found says, "Make your own destiny."
But you're unaware that you should be scared
Maybe you'll learn from mistakes that we make
We're not waiting forever
We know you'll never be there
We're not waiting forever
If you get out, see you there
You're not awake, as I'm aware
Maybe we had all you figured absolutely wrong
There's been a misunderstanding
We've had all along
Maybe we had all you figured absolutely wrong
(Maybe we had all you figured absolutely wrong.)
You can read about
(You can read)
About it when we're gone1Embed
