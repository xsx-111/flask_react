Long Goodnight Lyrics
Every attempt to
Is filled with holes
Reads like a polygraph, I'm told
I'm not bitter, anyway
Let it go

I never sleep still
Lest I forget
Tied down by handicaps instead
I'm not bitter, anyway
But I didn't want it to turn out this way

Sing a long goodnight
Forfeit any fight
Refuse to rest assured
It comes with no reply
Hold on too tight
Hang on every word

If it all ended tonight
You know that I wouldn't mind
Back to the good old times
Before it won
If it all ended tonight
You know that I wouldn't mind
Back to the good old times
Before it won

Sing a long goodnight
Forfeit any fight
Refuse to rest assured
It comes with no reply
Hold on too tight
Hang on every word
Sing a long goodnight
Forfeit any fight
Refuse to rest assured
It comes with no reply
Hold on too tight
Hang on every wordEmbed
