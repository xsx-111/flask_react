Super Freak Lyrics
She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow, girl
She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room, it's the right time
She's never hard to please, oh no

That girl is pretty wild now
The girl's a super freak
The kind of girl you read about
In new-wave magazine
That girl is pretty kinky
The girl's a super freak
I really love to taste her
Every time we meet
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky, yow
Everybody sing
Super freak, super freak
She's a very special girl
The kind of girl you want to know
From her head down to her toenails
Down to her feet, yeah
And she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine
Going back in Chinatown
Three's not a crowd to her, she says (Menage a trois)
"Room 714, I'll be waiting"
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

That girl is pretty kinky
The girl's a super freak
The kind of girl you read about
In new-wave magazine
That girl is pretty wild now
The girl's a super freak
I really like to taste her
Every time we meet
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, HEY!
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky, yow

Temptations, sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhhhh
Super freak, super freak
That girl's a super freak
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhhhh

She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street

Blow, Danny! 
Oh girl
Oh girl11Embed
