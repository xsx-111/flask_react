Fire It Up (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
Long Beach, say "Hell yeah"
Say "Hell yeah"
"Hell yeah"
Say "We want Rick to funk us up"
We want Rick to funk us up
We want Rick to funk us up
We want Rick to funk us up
We want Rick to funk us up
We want Rick to funk us up
We want Rick to funk us up, hey
We want Rick to funk us up
Horns, blow!

Hey everyone, tonight we're gonna have fun
What you want me to do with the funk, y'all?
Fire it up
Hey everyone, tonight we're gonna have fun
What do you want us to do with the funk, y'all?
Fire it up

If funky music makes you move
And you just can't wait to groove
And getting off is what you've come here for
No need to hesitate
'Cause you know I hate to wait
I'll funk you 'til you roll on out the door
So wave your funk sign in the air
And show me that you care
You've been sitting on your booty much too long
We'll funk you, but don't go nowhere
If you say it's fun
Then fire up 'cause the show has just begun
Hey everyone, tonight we're gonna have fun
What you want us to do with the funk, San Diego?
Fire it up
Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun
What you want us to do with the funk, Long Beach?
Fire it up

Yo...HO!
What you want us to do with the funk, Long Beach?
Fire it up
What you want us to do with the funk, Long Beach?
Fire it up
What you want me to do with the funk, L.A.?
Fire it up
What the fuck you want me to do with the funk?
Fire it up
Say "Fire it up"
Fire it up
Say "Fire it up"
Fire it up
Say "Fire it up"
Fire it up
Say "Fire it up"
Fire it upEmbed
