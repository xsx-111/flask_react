Give It to Me Baby Lyrics
When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast asleep
You wouldn't even talk to me
You say I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love ya
(I just wanna love you, baby)
Guess that's why I'm so elated
C'mon, girl

Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
Just give it to me, baby
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff, that sweet, funky stuff
Yo...HO! OW!
Give it to me, baby

When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home
(C'mon, Rick, I'm tired, let's go home)
That's the time I start romancin'
You say "How can I love ya?
(How can I love you, baby?)
When your body keeps on moving?"
I say "Wait 'til I squeeze you" (Oh)
Maybe then you'll start to groovin'
C'mon, girl

Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
Just give it to me, baby
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff, that sweet, funky stuff
Yo...HO! OW!
Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
(Give it to me) what you say
(Give it to me) what you say
Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
(Give it to me, give it to me)
Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me right away
Give it to me, give it to me
Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, give it to me4Embed
