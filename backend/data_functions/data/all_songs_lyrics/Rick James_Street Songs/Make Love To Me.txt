Make Love To Me Lyrics
Taste so good to the very last drop
You on bottom and me on top
Rolling around to the saxophone sound
Feel so good, don't wanna come down

Make love to me, baby, baby
Do it nice and slow
Make love to me, sugar, sugar
Let your feelings show--hey baby, oh baby
Do me, do me, do me
Just do me, do me, do me, do me good, baby

Feel so good soaking wet like the rain
So soft and gentle and we show no shame
Kissing you, baby, only you and I know
Feel so good, just let your love flow

Make love to me, baby, baby
Do it nice and slow
Make love to me, woman, woman
Let your feelings show
Feeling hot, feeling cold
(Feeling so hot and cold)
Feelin' young and feelin' old
That's what I feel when I'm holding you tighter
Squeezin' you baby, loving you with all my might
All I'm asking is just to make love to you
(Making love to you, making love to you)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Hey baby, hey baby
Listen to me, baby
(Don't you dare be nervous, don't you dare be shy)
Just let me make sweet love to you, baby
(Don't you dare be nervous, don't you dare be shy)
There's no need to wonder why
(Don't you dare be nervous when I call your name)
What will you do when I call your name?
Will you come like the fallin' rain?
Come like the fallin' rain
Come like the fallin' rain

Feels so good
Woman, do me
Do me good
Woman, do me, do me, do me, do me, do meEmbed
