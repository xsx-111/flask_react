Give It To Me Baby (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast asleep
You wouldn't even talk to me
You say I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love ya
(I just wanna love you, baby)
Guess that's why I'm so elated
C'mon, girl

Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
I'll make you hot like you've had enough
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
I'll make you hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, L.A
Give me that stuff, that sweet, funky stuff
Yo...HO! OW!
When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home
(C'mon, Rick, I'm tired, let's go home)
That's the time I start romancin'
You say "How can I love ya
When your body keeps on moving?"
I say "Wait 'til I squeeze you"
Maybe then you'll start to groove
C'mon

Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
Give it to me, baby (Give to me, baby)
I'll make you hot like you had enough
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
Give it to me, baby (Give it to me, baby)
I'll make you hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
(Say what?)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff, that sweet, funky stuff
Yo...HO! OW!
Sing it, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
(Give it to me) what you say
(Give it to me) what you say
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
(Give it to me, give it to me)
L.A
(Give it to me, give it to me)
L.A
(Give it to me, give it to me)
(Give it to me, give it to me)
(Give it to me, give it to me)
Somebody scream
Turn this son of a bitch out
Oohuh-oohuh...Oohuh-oohuh
Oohuh-oohuh...Oohuh-oohuh
Come on, L.A
I can't hear shit
Say Oohuh-oohuh...Oohuh-oohuh

Give it up, Los Angeles
Give it up for Rick James and the Stone City Band
Teena Marie, Mary Jane, give it up
Rick James, truly a legend in his own timeEmbed
