Super Freak (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don’t take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street
She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room, it's the right time
She’s never hard to please

That girl is pretty wild now
(The girl's a super freak)
The kind of girl you read about
(In new-wave magazines)
That girl is pretty kinky
(The girl's a super freak)
I really like to taste her
(Every time we meet)
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me
Hey, hey, hey-heeeey

She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky
Super freak, super freak
She’s a very kinky girl
(The kind of girl you want to know)
From her head down to her toenails
(Down to her feet, yeah)
And she’ll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine
(Going back in Chinatown)
Three's not a crowd to her, she says
(Ménage à trois)
Room 714, I’ll be waiting
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

That girl is pretty wild now
(The girl's a super freak)
The kind of girl you read about
(In new-wave magazines)
That girl is pretty kinky
(The girl’s a super freak)
I really like to taste her
(Every time we meet)
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me
L.A., hey, hey
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky
Temptations, sing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oooooh
Super freak, super freak
Temptations, sing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oooooh

She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street
Blow, Danny


Super freak, super freak, super freak
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all rightEmbed
