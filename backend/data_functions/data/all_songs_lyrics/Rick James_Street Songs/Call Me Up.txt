Call Me Up Lyrics
*phone rings*
Hello, may I speak to Rick James, please?
Listen, baby

Love me, love me tender, baby
I don't like no pain, I don't like no pain
Make me surrender, sugar
When you call my name (The name is Slick Rick)
Rock me, roll on me, baby
Baby, don't you stop, don't you never stop
Wake me, woman, shake me, baby
I want your love a lot
I can feel your body burning next to my flesh
Like fire, hot fire

Girl, you can call me up (Call me up)
Hey baby, girl, you can call me up (Call me up)
When you need some love and affection, HO!
(Call me up)
Hey baby, hey baby (Call me up)

Squeeze me, and delight me, baby
Like you've never done, you can do it, baby
Kiss me in those places, darlin'
Make me holler for more, give me more and more
Give me so much pleasure, baby
Give me every bit you got, give me every drop
Make me feel much better, baby
By telling me you'll never stop, say you won't stop
I can feel your body burnin' to my flesh
Feel the fire, hot fire

Baby, when you want a hand to hold
When you're feeling all alone, just gotta call me up
Baby, when you wanna do it all night
When you wanna make love right
Just gotta call me up
Baby, when you want a hand to hold
When you don't wanna be alone, just gotta call me up
Baby, when you wanna do it all night
When you wanna get love right
Just gotta call me up, hey
Girl, you can call me up (Call me up)
Hey baby, hey baby, girl, you can call me up (Call me up)

Hello? May I please speak to Slick Rick?
(Call me up)
I'm right here with you, baby, waiting for the serious funk
I'm not gonna play with your emotions, baby
(Call me up)
We gon' get to the serious funk
Lay in my bed, talk straight from the head
Nothing else need be said, so funk
Serious funk
Serious, funk, hoEmbed
