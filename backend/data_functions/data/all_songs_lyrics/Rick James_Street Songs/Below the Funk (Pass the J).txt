Below the Funk (Pass the J) Lyrics
I wanna talk, pass the joint

I was born in a city they call Buffalo
Zero degrees below is too damn cold and funky
Mama raised me on the numbers racket
With eight kids and no father
She said she couldn't hack it
On the eastside where I started sangin'
On the corners hangin'
Out with all the hoodlums
Pass the joint
Now the love that I find in the city
Is such a cryin' pity
Ain't no love for brothers
Pass the joint

Pass the joint
I think I want to talk
'Bout the place I was born, I was torn
Said pass the joint
Give me one more hit
I ain't finished with it
I got some more to say
Now the players hangin' 'round the main strip
Actin' like they're on a trip
If they had my cash they could be hip
But it's strange the gossip is so tragic
They call me a faggot
And me and all my women laugh at it, ha
Love, I got my good friends there
They really keep me dancin'
They keep me really laughin'
In the country, me, my dog and horses
Hangin' out with my family
Talkin' 'bout Stone City
Say, pass the joint

I think I wanna talk 'bout the place, where I was torn
Say, pass the joint
I need me one more hit
I ain't finished with it
I got some more to say

Need to talk, 'bout the city I was born
I got to talk
I wish they wouldn't be so torn
I wanna talk 'bout the city I was bred
I need to talk 'bout the city that has led me to my fame
I was born in a city they call Buffalo
Zero degrees below is too damn cold and funky
I think I wanna talk about it, pass the joint
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
I think I wanna talk about it, pass the joint
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
Come on, one more hit, that's it
Pass the joint
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
I think I wanna sing about it, pass the joint
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
Thank youEmbed
