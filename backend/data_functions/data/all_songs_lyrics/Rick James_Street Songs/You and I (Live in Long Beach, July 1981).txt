You and I (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Ahhhh, YOW!

You and I
We fit together like a glove on hand
That's right
Don't you know
That I would gladly take you anywhere
You wanted to go
You and me
We are as close as three-part harmony
Wouldn't you agree?
And if by chance
Our romance ended it would surely be
The end of me

Some people might say I'm infatuated (On no, baby)
But I don't care, 'cause they really don't know
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
They'll never see of hear the things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned they all can go to hell
Yeah, well, well well well
You and I (Do-do)
You and me (Do-do-do)
Should be together (Do-do)
Eternally (Do-do-do)
You and I (Do-do)
You and me (Do-do-do)
Should be together (Do-do)
YEAH, WOO!
Dance, girls...woo!
L.A., everybody on the funk
(Everybody dance on the funk, everybody dance on the funk)
Oh, dancin' on
(Everybody dance on the funk, everybody dance on the funk)
Now shake your booty now
(Everybody shake your booty now)
Shake it down, down, down
(Everybody shake your booty now)
Shake it down
(Everybody shake your booty)
Oh, down, down
(Everybody shake your booty)
Now dance on 'em
(Everybody dance on the funk, everybody dance on the funk)
(Everybody dance on the funk, everybody dance on the funk)
Y'all ready to go home yet? You still wanna party?
Listen up
Before we party, I just wanna thank some people, bring it down
If y'all don't wanna go home yet, you gotta do me a favor
You gotta work them hands
If I see people ain't partyin' we gon' go home early tonight
Now, I think this crowd particularly is very pumped higher tonight on the groove
Hell yeah?
I think y'all really came out to party tonight, hell yeah
Listen up, here's what I want you to do
Last night, there were some people in here and started this thing happening
It was very spontaneous and everybody had a good time
But, I wanna see if this crowd here tonight can do what they did last night
And that is, everything that I sing y'all bring back to me
I don't think you can do it; you think you can do it? We'll see
Now, work them hands, first of all
People in the back, hey, work your body
Look at ya, party
Now, I'ma sing a note, and then I want y'all to sing it back
And I bet you can't catch all my stuff; y'all got that?
Doo-doo-bah, doo-doo-bah (Doo-doo-bah, doo-doo-bah)
Bau-mau-bau-mau (Bau-mau-bau-mau)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Budu-skiddu-buh-skiddu-doo-doo-skit (Budu-skiddu-buh-skiddu-doo-doo-skit)
Wait a minute, y'all wouldn't be related to them people who was here last night, would you?
Oh, y'all got some new stuff, huh? Oh, y'all think y'all real tough, don't you?
Y'all think y'all real bad, huh? Okay, I'ma wear you out right now
Work them hands, I wanna hear nothin' but hands
