Do You Want Some Funk? (Interlude) (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
Did I hear you say you wanna funk?
Did hear you say you wanted to funk?
Well then, if you want some funk
Then you got to give it up
If you want some funk, got to give it up
(If you wanna funk)
If you want some funk
I don't think you heard me, baby
You've got to give it up
I can't see shit
If you want some funk, you've got to give it up
People, if you want some funk, let me hear you sing
Then you've got to give it up, I can't hear ya
If you want some funk
You got to give it up
Then you got to give it up
People, if you want some funk
Then you got to give it up
Let me hear ya
If you want some funk, then you got to give it up
If you want some funk, then you got to give it up
The name is Slick Rick, call me up
You know my number, baby
If you want some funk, then you got to give it up
Let me see you, if you're with me, baby
If you want some funk, then you got to give it up
Say what?
If you want some funk, then you got to give it up
Woo!
If you want some funk, then you got to give it up
If you want some funk, then you got to give it upEmbed
