Love Gun (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang

Girl, if you like what you see
And you want to be with me
Baby, shoot me, with your love gun
Any day, any time
You want me in your mind
Baby, shoot me, with your love gun

Put your finger on the trigger
When you pull it back I'll figure
Now that you're ready for the fire, yeah
Hold it straight and hold it steady
When you shoot me I'll be ready
I'm gonna shoot you with desire, yeah

Give me a shot, of your love gun
Fire me up, girl, we'll have big fun
Give me a shot, of your love gun
Fire me up, baby, we'll have big fun
L.A
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Long Beach, you know we love you, sing
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Shoot the shot off, shoot the shot off, shoot the shot off
Shoot the shot off, baby
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang

Girl, when you need a little love
And it's Rick you're thinkin' of
Shoot me, with your love gun
Any day, anytime
You want me in your mind
Baby, shoot me, with your love gun
Sing it, sugar

Put your finger on the trigger
When you pull it back I'll figure
Now that you're ready for the fire, yeah
Hold it straight and hold it steady
When you shoot me I'll be ready
I'm gonna shoot you with desire
Give me a shot of your love gun
Fire me up, baby, we'll have big fun
Give me a shot of your love gun
Fire me up, baby, we'll have big fun

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah!
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang
Ah, bang bang...Ah, bang bang

Love, gun, bang bang bang
I got my thang â€” sing it, motherfucker!
Love, gun, bang bang bang
Love, gun, bang bang bang
Love, I got my bang bang, gun, I got my bang bang
