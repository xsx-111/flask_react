Square Biz (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
Everybody get up
Put your hands together for me, all of you here

Flash back, who's that dancin' to the latest?
Suave de bone, the greatest, ooh, he sure is moving me
That's what I said though you didn't know yet
Our love is was kismet, soon to be made history

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love, that is
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love
That is, that is, that is
So shy, whoa, my, had to change that real quick
Had to use a few tricks, you know like my femme fatale
Phase two, me, you dancin' on a cloud
I'm gonna sing it loud 'cause my love is on the wow

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love, that is
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love
That is, that is Square Biz

Square Biz, Square Biz
Square Biz, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love
Square Biz, Square Biz
Square Biz, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love
Phase three, ooh-wee, on a love oasis
Joy upon our faces sent from up above
Bombs burst, fireworks, big production thing
I'm talkin' horns and string, orchestration is my love

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love, that is
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love
That is, that is, that is Square Biz

Uh, baby
Uh, break it down, Stone City, break it down
Ooh (What's your name, baby?)
Nevermind that, what's your name, baby?
They call me Slick Lee, baby
Slick Levi? (Slick Levi, baby. What's your name?)
The fellas call me Lady Tee (Lady Tee, baby?)
Can I rap to you?
I'm talking Square Biz (Talk to me)
C'mon y'all, I'm talking Square Biz (Talk to me)
I'm talking Square Biz
I'm talking Square Biz to you
I'm talking Square Biz
I'm talking Square Biz to you

Long Beach, what's happening? Entre vous Lady Tee
I've heard a boatload of others ladies' rap
But they ain't got nothin' on me
I'm less than five foot one, a hundred pounds of fun
I like sophisticated funk
I live on Dom Perignon, caviar, filet mignon
And you can best believe that's bunk
Here's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, Square Biz
I've been called Casper, Shorty, Lil' Bit
And some they call me Vanilla Child
But you know that don't mean my world to me
'Cause baby, names can't cramp my style
(I love chick-icken) And Buff's collard greens
A little hot water cornbread
I love you too Cat daddy
But don't you let that go to your head
Square Biz, Square Biz
You know I like spirituals and rock
Sarah Vaughn, Johann Sebastian Bach
Shakespeare, Maya Angelou
And Nikki Giovanni just to name a few
Well, I'm wild and peaceful Lady Tee
I got to keep my irons in the fire, you see
I got the point, the scam, the low, the deal
What you feel, say what?

Flash back, who's that? (Flash back)
Flash back, who's that? (Flash back)
Flash back, who's that? (Flash back)
Flash back, who's that? (Flash back)

I'm gonna talk about it
I'm gonna talk my love
I'm gonna talk about it
I'm gonna talk my love
I'm gonna hip you to the Tee
