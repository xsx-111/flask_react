Mr. Policeman Lyrics
Hey Mr. Policeman
I've seen you in my neighborhood
You look to me up you'll do no good
I've seen you with your gun in your hand
Hey Mr. Policeman
I saw you shoot my good friend down
He was just havin' fun
Checkin' out a one and one

It's a shame, it's a disgrace
Why every time you show your face
Somebody dies, man; somebody dies, man

La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Hey Mr. Policeman
Why don't you leave the boys alone
Why don't you just roll your own, yeah
And call me on the telephone
Hey Mr. Policeman
I see you walkin' on your beat
Searchin' strangers on the street
Especially the hoes you meet, yeah
It's a shame, it's a disgrace
Why every time you show your face
Somebody dies, man; somebody dies, man
Check it out

Shot my friend down, down, down, yeah, sing

La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Hey Mr. Policeman
I saw you shoot my good friend down
He was just havin' fun, yeah
Checkin' out a one and one
Hey Mr. Policeman
I see you never havin' fun
Strapped to your side a gun
.357 Smith Magnum

It's a shame, it's a disgrace
Why every time you show your face
Somebody dies, man; somebody dies, yeah, sing
La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, sing
La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

I'd rather be a farmer than to be
The police (The police)
Police (police)
I'd rather be a singer than to be
The police (The police)
Police (The police)
I'd rather be a farmer than to be
The police (The police)
Police (The police)
I'd rather be a funk n' roll singer than the police
The police (The police)
Sing it, children

La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, take me home
La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah
La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la1Embed
