Come Into My Life (Live in Long Beach, July 1981) Lyrics
C-O-M-E, come, come into my life
C - O - M - E
C - O - M - E

Girl, when push comes to shove and it's me you want to love
Mama, come (C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
Don’t be afraid and hesitate, I won't hurt you or make you wait
If you come (C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
Do you wanna get off on this good time feelin'
That I got, and I got a lot
(C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
Something deep inside tells me you’re reelin'
Burnin' hot, you're burnin' hot
(C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
Listen

Don't you know that I'm the one
Knockin' on your door, beggin’ you for more
Come on, baby
Must I ask you one more time?
Come into my life
Open up your heart and let me come
Come on, baby
Must I ask you one more time?
Yeah, L.A
Open up your heart and let me come
Let’s turn this mutha out
Somebody scream
Somebody scream

Girl, when you're lonely in the night, and you need a love that’s right
Mama, come (C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
I will be there quick in a flash, even bring my private stash
If you come (C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
Do you ever wonder why it's better comin' than to go?
Then tell me so
(C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
Baby, you know I hate to see you runnin'
’Cause then you blow, and that's a no no
(C-O-M-E, come, come into my life)
Listen

Don't you know that I'm the one
Knockin' on your door, beggin' — sing
Come on, baby
Must I ask you one more time?
Come into, come into my life
Open up your heart and let me come
Come on, baby
Must I ask you one more time?
Yeah
Open up your heart and let me come
L.A., give it up for funk
Somebody scream
Say "Hell yeah"
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Yeah!
Daniel LeMelle on the horn, y'all
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head
Don't stop, L.A
Everybody's dancin' on the funk — come on, L.A
Everybody's swingin' on the funk — sing!
Everybody's dancin' on the funk
Everybody's dancin' on the funk

Don't you know that I'm the one
Knockin' on your door, beggin' you for more
Come on, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Y'all wanna hear some more?
Say "Hell yeah"
Say "Hell yeah"Embed
