Juliette LyricsDon't sing sad songs Juliette
'Cause I heard you've been out to get it
I seen you dancin' all night long
What they said about you I hope it
Don't turn out wrong
Red, red roses, lyin' on the ground
Heartache and pain
They call you by name
They follow you around
Juliette talk sweet Juliette
Juliette
The sky is all cast over
And the stars refuse to shine
And your lonely, your life is lonely
Ah in time
Over here don't concur
He said you were out of control
But I don't mind if you were with her one time
So called prince of rock and roll
Red, red roses, lyin' on the ground
Heartache and pain
They call you by name
They follow you around
Juliette
I'm so sorry JulietteEmbed
