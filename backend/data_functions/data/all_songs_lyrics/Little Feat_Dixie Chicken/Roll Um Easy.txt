Roll Um Easy LyricsOh I am just a vagabond
A drifter on the run
And eloquent profanity
It rolls right off my tongue
And I have dined in palaces
Drunk wine with Kings and Queens
But darlin', oh darlin'
You're the best thing I've ever seen
Won't you roll me easy
Oh slow and easy
Take my independence
With no apprehension, no tension
You walki' talkin' dream paradise
Sweet pair a' dice
Well I been across this country
From Denver to the ocean
And I never met girls who could sing so sweet
Like the angels that live in Houston
Singin' "Roll me easy, so slow and easy...
Play that Concertina, I'll be your temptress..."
And baby I'm defenseless
Singin' harmony
In unison
Sweet harmony
Gotta hoist your flag and I'll beat your drumEmbed
