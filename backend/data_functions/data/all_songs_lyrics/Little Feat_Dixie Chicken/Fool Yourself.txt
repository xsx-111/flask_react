Fool Yourself LyricsLook out child you're bound to change
You can't ever stay the same
Cause if you keep on singin' the same old lines
You're going to look around babe and find your friend's out of town
Watch out girl the words you're sayin' don't really fit the play
Somebody else you might talk to now
Knows what you sayin' what you mean
They don't help your style
You might say you ain't got a hold on yourself
You might say you always try your best
You might say you only need a rest
You might say you can only fool yourself
I said fool yourself
I said fool yourself
Don't believe the words you read
They're written on the street
And every time you know you play their game
They'll knock you down and take your pride away
See how bad you need to cry
But no matter how you try
It's the same old story once again
You always have number one who calls you friend
I call you friend
You might say you ain't got a hold on yourself
You might say you always try your best
You might say you only need a rest
You might say you can only fool yourself
I said fool yourself
I said fool yourself
I said fool yourselfEmbed
