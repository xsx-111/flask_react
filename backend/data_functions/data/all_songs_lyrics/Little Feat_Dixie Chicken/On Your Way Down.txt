On Your Way Down LyricsSunrise
And sunset
Since the beginning, it hasn't changed yet
People fly high, begin to lose sight
'cause you can't see very clearly when you're in flight
It's high time that you found
The same people you misuse on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
Vintage wines from the year '62
It's your thing, it's your thing
What pleases you
Not to be found when you're across town
You think it's an honor girl just to have you around
It's high time that you found
The same dudes you misuse on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
You think the sun rises and sets for you
But the same sun rise and set and shine
On other folks too
I don't mind you turning round
I myself would even like a little higher ground
It's high time that you found
The same people you walk on on your way up
You might meet up
On your way downEmbed
