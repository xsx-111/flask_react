Two Trains LyricsIn 1966 I found my love
In 1967 I had all there was
And as my time went by I was satisfied
Until that situation took me by surprise
Now there's two trains runnin' – on that line
One train's me, and the other's a friend of mine
You know it would be all right, be just fine
If the woman took one train, and left the other behind
Illusion; it is just the same. Conclusion:
I don't know how to play the game
Of what it is or how it's going to be
When one train is my friend and the other train is me
Easy, I say easy, I can't push or shove her
So I guess I really care
Now I'm not one to hide my love behind a lock and key
But if things keep on the way they are, be no place left for me, yeah
There's two trains runnin' – on that line
One train's me, and the other's a friend of mine
You know it would be all right, be just fine
If the woman took one train, and left the other behind
Two trains, two trains, two trains, two trainsEmbed
