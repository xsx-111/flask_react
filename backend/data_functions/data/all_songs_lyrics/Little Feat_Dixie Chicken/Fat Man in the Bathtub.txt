Fat Man in the Bathtub LyricsSpotcheck Billy got down on his hands and knees
He said, "Hey mama, hey, let me check your oil all right?"
She said "No, no honey, not tonight
Come back Monday, yeah, you come back Tuesday
And then I might"
I said Juanita, my sweet Juanita, what are you up to?
My Juanita
I said Jaunita, my sweet chiquita, what are you up to?
My Juanita
Don't want nobody who won't dive for dimes
Don't want no speedballs 'cause I might die trying
Throw me a line, throw me a dime
'Cause there's a fat man in the bathtub with the blues
I hear you moan, I hear you moan, I hear you moan
Billy got so sad, dejected, put on his hat and start to run
Runnin' down the street yelling at the top of his lungs
"All I want in this life of mine is some good clean fun"
"All I want in this life and time is some hit and run"
I said Juanita, my sweet Juanita, what are you up to?
My Juanita
I said Jaunita, my sweet chiquita, what are you up to?
My Juanita
Put my money in your meter baby so it won't run down
But you caught me in the squeeze play on the cheesy side of town
Throw me a dime, throw me a line
'Cause there's a fat man in the bathtub with the blues
I hear you moan, I hear you moan, I hear you moan1Embed
