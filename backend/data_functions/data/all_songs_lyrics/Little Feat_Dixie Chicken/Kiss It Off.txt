Kiss It Off LyricsOne so sad, feeling's painful
You can't deny, there is no peace
Is no love, milk-toasted love
Ain't no velvet glove
You were the child of some electric nightmare
And you could move mountains, the swords of fire
They keep you around to watch their house of gold
Keep the hungry away from the sacred grove
You were holy and you made me wonder how
But you looked like a devil who would sieze and shake you down
On the hopes of a tyrant
No one makes it over
There is no peace
Is no love, a milk-toasted love
Ain't no velvet gloveEmbed
