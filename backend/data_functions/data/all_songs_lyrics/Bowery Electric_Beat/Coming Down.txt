Coming Down LyricsClose your eyes, we're coming down
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Close yourself, you'll fall away fast
Hold on tight, we're coming down
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Lose yourself, you'll fall away fast
Hold on tight, we're coming downEmbed
