Youth of Today Lyrics
Maybe if you were some spearheaded guy
I would listen to what you have to say
But you're just some incapable figure
Thinking you're bigger than me
But you're not yet
You don't know a thing about the youth of today
Stating your opinion
Making it ring in my head all day

And you say, "My children weren't the same"
"My children's children they're the ones to blame"
And you say, "In my day we were better behaved"
But it's not your day no more

And we are the youth of today
Change our hair in every way
And we are the youth of today
We'll say what we wanna say
And we are the youth of today
Don't care what you have to say at all

And maybe if you had a true point of view
I would listen to you
But it's just your one sided feelings
They keep getting in my way
And you don't know a single thing about
The youth of today
Stating your opinion
Making it ring in my head all day

And you say, "My children weren't the same"
"My children's children they're the ones to blame"
And you say, "In my day we were better behaved"
But it's not your day no more

And we are the youth of today
Change our hair in every way
And we are the youth of today
We'll say what we wanna say
And we are the youth of today
Don't care what you have to say at all

And you say, "My children weren't the same"
"My children's children they're the ones to blame"
And you say, "In my day we were better behaved"
But it's not your day no more
And we are the youth of today
Change our hair in every way
And we are the youth of today
We'll say what we wanna say
And we are the youth of today
Don't care what you have to say at allEmbed
