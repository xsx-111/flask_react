Barrowland Ballroom Lyrics
Oh, the lights outside they're as bright as the sun
They're much brighter than anyone
Oh, the girls in the queue, yes, they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung

And when the night turns to day
And all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright
On the cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh, won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare
But baby I just don't care if it's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to, maybe I should tell you
That people, they may stop and stare
But baby I just don't care, tonight, if it's only me and you
Oh, nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band start to play
Won't you buy me a drink, and I'll tell her what I think
If she gets in my way

And when the night turns to day
And all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright
On the cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh, won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare
But baby I just don't care if it's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to, maybe I should tell you
That people, they may stop and stare
But baby I just don't care, tonight, if it's only me and you
And when the night turns to day
And the lights they fade away
(I wish that love and life would pass me by)
And when the band stops a song
Because there's something going on
(Well there is magic in the air, I swear)
And I wish that I saw Bowie, playing on that stage
I wish that I saw something, to make me come of age

Oh, won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare
But baby I just don't care if it's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to, maybe I should tell you
That people, they may stop and stare
But baby I just don't care, tonight, if it's only me and youEmbed
