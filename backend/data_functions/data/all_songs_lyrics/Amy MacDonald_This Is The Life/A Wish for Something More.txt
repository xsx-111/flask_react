A Wish for Something More Lyrics
Oh, the sun is shining
Far too bright
For it to still be night
Oh, the air feels so cold
So cold and old
How can it be light?

Oh, let's take a walk outside
See the world through each other's eyes
I wish I was your only one
I think you're beautiful
But your hair is a mess and your shoes are untied
But that's what I love best

And I, I wish I was the one, you lonely, lonely son
And you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances, fairytale romances
Every single day
And you look at me and say, "I'm your best friend every day"
But I wish for something, wish for something more
Oh, I love you like a friend, but let's not pretend
How I wish for something, wish for something more
Now the grass is so green
But I can't see anything
Past your eyes
I'm fixated on your smile
Your cherry lips make life worthwhile
I'm thinking these things what I'm trying to say

Cause life gets in my way
Every single day

And I, I wish I was the one, you lonely, lonely son
And you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances, fairytale romances
Every single day
And you look at me and say, "I'm your best friend every day"
But I wish for something, wish for something more
Oh, I love you like a friend, but let's not pretend
How I wish for something, wish for something more

Now the sun is fading, now the rain is coming down
And I'm looking at your face when you're looking at the ground
I see diamonds in your dreams, I see pearls around your neck
I see everything that's beautiful, oh, everything that's beautiful
I, I wish I was the one, you lonely, lonely son
And you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances, fairytale romances
Every single day
And you look at me and say, "I'm your best friend every day"
But I wish for something, wish for something more
Oh, I love you like a friend, but let's not pretend
How I wish for something, wish for something moreEmbed
