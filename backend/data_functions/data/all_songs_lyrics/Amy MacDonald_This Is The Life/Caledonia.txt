Caledonia Lyrics
I don't know if you can see
The changes that have come over me
In these last few days I've been afraid
That I might drift away

So I've been telling old stories and singing songs
That make me think about where I came from
And that's the reason why I feel
So far away today

And let me tell you that I love you
That I think about you all the time
Caledonia's been calling me
Now I'm going home
And if I should become a stranger
You know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
Caledonia's been everything I've ever hadEmbed
