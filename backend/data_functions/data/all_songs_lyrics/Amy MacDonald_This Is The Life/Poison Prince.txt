Poison Prince Lyrics
A poetic genius
It's something I don't see
Why would a genius
Be tripping on me?
And he's looking at me now
But what he can't see
Is that I'm looking through his eyes
So many lies behind his eyes
And tell me stories
From your past
And sing me songs
You wrote before
I tell you this
My poison prince
You'll soon be knocking
On heaven's door

Some kinda poison prince
With your eyes in a daze
Some kinda poison prince
Your life is like a maze
And what we all want
And what we all crave
Is an upbeat song
So we can dance the night away
Oh, who said life was easy?
Who said life was fair?
Who said nobody gived a damn
And nobody even cared?
The way you're acting now
Like you left that all behind
You've given up, you've given in
Another sucker of that slime

Some kinda poison prince
With your eyes in a daze
Some kinda poison prince
Your life is like a maze
And what we all want
And what we all crave
Is an upbeat song
So we can dance the night away
Some kinda poison prince
With your eyes in a daze
Some kinda poison prince
Your life is like a maze
And what we all want
And what we all crave
Is an upbeat song
So we can dance the night awayEmbed
