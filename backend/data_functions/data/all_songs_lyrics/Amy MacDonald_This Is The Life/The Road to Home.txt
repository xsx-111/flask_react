The Road to Home Lyrics
Oh, the leaves are falling from the trees
And the snow is coming, don't you know?
But I still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home

Oh, the sound is fading in my ears
And I can't believe I've lasted all these years
But I still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home

Oh the light is fading all the time
And this life I'm in, it seemed to pass me by
But I still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home

Now I must say goodbye
Keep telling myself now don't you cry
But I'm here where I belong
I'll see you soon, it won't be long

I'll see you soon, it won't be long
I'll see you soon, it won't be longEmbed
