Rock Bottom LyricsA rock and roll dream-
Hard as it seems
And he's singing the song he wrote for you
But you left him aside, kicked him out and swallowed your pride
Now it's all gone wrong
And you saw a photograph
And remembered the good days
And you signed an autograph
And remembered the front page
Singing, "please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down!"
A rock and roll scene
And you drank from the bottle last night
I tried to tell you but all you started was a fight
And you carried on writing your songs
And I sat there humming along
But now it's all gone wrong
And you saw a photograph
And remembered the good days
And you signed an autograph
And remembered the front page
Singing, "please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down!"
Now your days are gone
There's not a memory
Not a tune, not a song
And it's all gone (wrong)
Oh it's long gone (wrong)
No it's all gone (wrong)
Oh it's long gone (wrong)
Now your days are gone
There's not a memory
Not a tune, not a song
And it's all gone (wrong)
Oh it's long gone (wrong)
No it's all gone (wrong)
And it's long gone (wrong)
But, "please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down!"
"Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down!"Embed
