Mr Rock & Roll - Live From King Tuts LyricsSo called Mr. Rock'n'roll is dancing on his own again
Talking on his phone again to someone who tells him that his balance is low
He's got nowhere to go
He's on his own again
Rock chick of the century is acting like she used to be
Dancing like there's no-one there before she never seemed to care
Now she wouldn't dare
It's so rock and roll to be alone
And they'll meet one day far away
And say: "I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away
And say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"
Mrs. Black and White, she's never seen a shade of grey
Always something on her mind, every single day
But now she's lost her way
And where does she go from here?
Mr Multicultural sees all that one can see
He's living proof of someone very different to me
But now he wants to be free
Free so he can see
And they'll meet one day far away
And say: "I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away
And say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"
He says: "I wish I knew you, I wish I met you
When time was still on my side"
She'll say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I loved you
Before I was his bride"
And so they must depart, too many more are broken hearts
But I've seen that all before in TV, books and film and more
And there's a happy ending
Every single day
And they'll meet one day far away
And say: "I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away
And say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"Embed
