Mr Rock & Roll Lyrics
So-called Mr. Rock and Roll he's dancing on his own again
Talking on his phone again
To someone who tells him that his balance is low
He's got nowhere to go, he's on his own again
Rock chick of the century is acting like she used to be
Dancing like there's no one there
Before she ever seemed to care, now she wouldn't dare
It's so rock and roll to be alone

And they'll meet one day far away, and say
"I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away and say
"I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"

Mrs. Black and White, she's never seen a shade of grey
Always something on her mind, every single day
But now she's lost her way
And where does she go from here?
Mr. Multicultural sees all that one could see
He's living proof of someone very different to me
But now he wants to be free
Free so he can see
And they'll meet one day far away, and say
"I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away and say
"I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"

He'll say, "I wish I knew you
I wish I met you when time was still on my side"
She'll say, "I wish I knew you
I wish I loved you before I was his bride"

And so they must depart, too many more broken hearts
But I've seen that all before
In TV, books, and film and more
And there's a happy ending, every single day

And they'll meet one day far away, and say
"I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away and say
"I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"Embed
