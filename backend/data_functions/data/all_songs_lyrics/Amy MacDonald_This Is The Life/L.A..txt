L.A. Lyrics
Oh, here's a story bout a boy named J
Nothing he did would ever get in my way
But there's still a long, long way to go

I've only ever seen his face on film
I've only ever heard the lines he'd say
But still they won't, get in my way

I'm always told to be the dreamer kind
Wake up one morning and your dreams are life
Never let them bring me down, never let them tear me down
I always thought that I would follow you
Every place and everything you do
But I'm happy to be by myself, I don't need no one else

He's never ever seen my face before
I'm trying hard cause this I can't ignore
But there's still a long, long way to go

I'm always told to be the dreamer kind
Wake up one morning and your dreams are life
Never let them bring me down, never let them tear me down
I always thought that I would follow you
Every place and everything you do
But I'm happy to be by myself, I don't need no one else

All my dreams are built around your face and this place
All the times I'm staring at the sun, you're the one
All my dreams are built around your face and this place
All the times I'm staring at the sun, you're the one

I'm always told to be the dreamer kind
Wake up one morning and your dreams are life
Never let them bring me down, never let them tear me down
I always thought that I would follow you
Every place and everything you do
But I'm happy to be by myself, I don't need no one else
I'm always told to be the dreamer kind
Wake up one morning and your dreams are life
Never let them bring me down, never let them tear me down
I always thought that I would follow you
Every place and everything you do
But I'm happy to be by myself, I don't need no one elseEmbed
