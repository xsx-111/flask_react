Scotty LyricsNow you move so smooth
It's all new inside you
Spins that rhythm
You let push through
Rows to rows, mile to mile
Gaze is fixed, eyes on fire
Something secret sleeps deep
Inside
It's your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way, yeah
And you laugh in their faces
You say, "Scotty's got to stay", yeah
They blink once, they blink twice
Seen it all, hearts like ice
Something secret sleeps deep
Within you
It's your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way, yeah
And you laugh in their faces
You say, "Scotty's got to stay", yeah
It's your natural place
And you laugh in their faces
It's your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way, yeah
You laugh in their faces
You say...
(If I could fly, I'd pick you up)
It's your natural place
(I'd take you into the night)
You stay
(And show you love)
Scotty's got his way, yeah
(If I could fly, I'd pick you up)
You laugh in their faces
(I'd take you into the night)
You say...
(And show you love)
Scotty's got to stay, yeahEmbed
