Pendulum LyricsYou're the cat's eyes
You're the pendulum
When the orator says
It's your time, you're the one
All the natives say
You know it's your time, you're the one
Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
But now you're gonna swing like a pendulum
In your mind's eye
You see pentacles
Fortune tellers say
It's your time, you're the one
And your wife, she says
It's your time, you're the one
Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
And now you're gonna swing like a pendulum
Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
And now you're gonna swing like a pendulum
It's your face in the mirror
Hasn't changed through the years
And all you do is swing like a pendulum
You're hollow, oh oh
So hollow, hollow2Embed
