Twins LyricsBody electric
Disconnected
Slow my love goes
Into shadows through the hollows
Lonely echos your name
They cry and cry
If I could go back and find you
I would I'd safely hide you
Twins, our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearms
Bodies electric
So disconnected
Slow my love grows
Into shadows through the hollows
Lonely echos my mind
They cry and cry
If I could go back and find you
I would I'd safely hide you far from
Those things that haunt you, and my heart
Would be inside you
Twins, our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearms
Twins, our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearmEmbed
