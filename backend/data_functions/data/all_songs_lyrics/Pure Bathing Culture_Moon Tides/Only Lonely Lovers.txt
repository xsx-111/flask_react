Only Lonely Lovers LyricsEmeraldâ€™s green between us
Envied ivyed overgrown
(Holy olded brizes ???) crystalizes
Lonely lovers left below
Two peaks deeply distant
We came crimson crying overgrown
(Holy olded brizes ?) as we go
Leading lonely lovers home
I remember feathered lashes hiding eyes wise fateful no more
Homesick, my heart beats black
Hopeless hollow no for the one i adore
The green ghosted vision
Scales in the isle storms that blow
(Holy olded brizes?) crystalizes
Lonely lovers left below
I remember feathered lashes hiding eyes wise fateful no more
Homesick, my heart beats black
Hopeless hollow no for the one i adore
Love me tender I remember fading lights last lit from the door
Homesick, my heart beats black
Only lonely lovers know what the hopeless adore
Only lonely lovers knowEmbed
