Trip Like I Do Lyrics
Another world, another time
In the age of wonder
Another world, another time
This land was green and good
Until the crystal cracked
Once more, they will replenish themselves
Cheat death again
The power of their source
The crystal
The crystal
The crystal
The power of their source
The crystal
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
I want you to trip like me
I want you to have fun
Me and you
Oh my God this is the best
I want you to trip like I do
Oh my God
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
I want you to trip like I do
Oh my God
I want you to trip like I do
I want you to trip like I do
I want you to trip like I doEmbed
