I Feel So Bad Lyrics
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes, I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away

Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I won't
Then again I think I will

Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave here
Sometimes I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
Yes, I got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away

Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I won't
Then again I think I willEmbed
