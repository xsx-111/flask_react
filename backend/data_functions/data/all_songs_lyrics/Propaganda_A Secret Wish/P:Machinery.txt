Propaganda
On joyless lanes we walk in lines
A calm but steady flow
Accompanied by loud commands
Our strength is running low
Another hope feeds another dream
Another truth installed by the machine
A secret wish, the marrying of lies
Today comes true what common sense denies
Rotating wheels of destiny inflame the city lights
Machines call out for followers far out into the night
The calls of the machines drowning in the steam
Another hope feeds another dream
Another truth installed by the machine
A secret wish, the marrying of lies
Today you find is true what common sense denies
The calls of the machines drowning in the steam
On joyless lanes we walk in lines
A calm but steady flow
Our strength is running low
Another hope
Another dream
Another truth
Installed by the machine
