The Chase LyricsChasing after passing visions
Chasing after passing visions
And traces buried by the tide
Chasing after passing visions
And traces buried by the tide
Hunting for the bygone picture
Reviving phantoms of the past
Hunting for a bygone picture
Chasing after passing visions
Of this magic of your touch
And traces buried by the tide
Your secret smile, I can't forget
Chasing after passing visions
We could turn back the pointers of the clock
And traces buried by the tide
Oh if I could and if you wouldEmbed
