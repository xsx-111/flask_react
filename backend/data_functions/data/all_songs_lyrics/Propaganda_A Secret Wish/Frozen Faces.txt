Frozen Faces LyricsOne box for optimism
Forget the world, take this break
And dance
The drums are stained with blood
Don't look at this disaster
If you want my advice, take this break
And dance
Sweet secret sense of sin
Sweet secret sense of rhythm
Sweet secret sense of sin
Sweet secret sense of rhythm
If your pure emotions
Ich fuerchte keine Einsamkeit 
Provoke these frozen faces
Es gibt keine Warmherzigkeit 
Take this break and dance
You can't stay away from this
You listen to this hellish crash
You can't stay away from this
The war has just begun
Frozen faces can always melt
Sweet secret sense of sin
Frozen faces can always melt
Push this echo in the outside world
Sweet secret sense of sin
One box for optimism
Forget the world
Sweet secret sense of sin
Sweet secret sense of sin
Push this echo in the outside world
Sweet secret sense of sin
Frozen faces can always melt againEmbed
