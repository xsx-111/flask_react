Prelude/Nightmare Lyrics

Dynamic explosions in my brain
Shattered me to drops of rain
Falling from a yellow sky
Orange faces through an opened eye
Stop me
Hold me back as I jerk
Stop me
Voices from all those at work
Lips don't want to criticize, you know
Eyes can never tell you lies
It's the words
Take that fire, bring me my brain
Let me love it higher
Why is it so cold out here? (so cold!)
Let me in
The price of your entry is sin
Go away, then return
Know which face you have to turn
Eyes are glaring, voices flaring
Why?
Caught up deep inside, beneath my brain
Take my love and turn it to pain
Take my heart and tear it apart
Gonna burn in our desire
Why?
Why?3Embed
