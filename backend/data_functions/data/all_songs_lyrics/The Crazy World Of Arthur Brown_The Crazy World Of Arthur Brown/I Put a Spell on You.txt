I Put a Spell on You LyricsI put a spell on you
Uh huh, because you're mine
You gotta stop the things you do
I ain't lyin'
No, I ain't lyin'
I can't stand it
I can't!
I can't stand the way, the way you're runnin' 'round
And I don't care
I don't care if you don't want me
'Cause I'm yours anyhow
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Lord knows I love you anyhow
And I don't care
I don't care if you don't want me
Because I'm yours anyhow
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Whoa, I put a spell on you, spell on you, spell on you!
Lord, because you're mine
You're all mine!
Yeah, you're all mine!
I wanna tell you
You gotta stop the thing you do
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Please! Please!
Please!
I ain't lyin'
I'd never!
I'd never lie to you and you know why?
I can't stand it
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't stand the way, the way you're runnin' 'round
And I don't care
I don't care if you don't want me
'Cause I'm yours anyhow
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine1Embed
