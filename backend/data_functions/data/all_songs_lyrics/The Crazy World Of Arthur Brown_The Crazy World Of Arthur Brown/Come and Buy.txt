Come and Buy Lyrics"God-brother, you lie"
When you see a fire burning inside your mind's eye
Breathe the meaning of the flames before you let them die
Let them burn you through until you know that you can fly
Twisting, turning, falling, burning
Roaring balls of fire
Eyes that see them have no need
Of guides to span the wire
Let the flames burn you right through
To lower burns through higher
Come and see
Come and buy
Come and see
Come and buy
I can sell you the love
I can buy you the morning sun
You can buy sun from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty, the mountain, the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free
Come and see, come and buy
Come and buy
Buy my love
Sleeping sunsets sweat their beauty, melting at your feet
Take your mind through sacred fire leaving you complete
Let the flames burn you so hard, there can be no retreat
Floating, drooping, looping, turning
Roaring balls of fire
Light the pathway you must take
To drag you from the mire
Soothe the darkness from your feet
Burn down your funeral pyre
Come and see
Come and buy
Come and see
Come and buy
I can sell you love
I can sell you the morning sun
You can buy sun from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty, the mountain, the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free
Come and see, come and buy
Come and buy
Buy my fire
Buy my fire
Eyes are glaring on your face
Watching you below
Take the sun that sweats at midnight
Burning you below
See the sun as it sweats with beauty
Burning through the fire
Feeding on your soul so deep
Fire
Come and buy my fire
Come and buy my fire
Come and buy
Buy my fire
Why is it so cold down here? (so cold!)
Let me in!
The price of your entry is sin
Go away, then return
Know which face you have to turn
Eyes are glaring, voices flaring
Why?
Caught up deep inside, beneath my brain
Take my love and turn it to pain
Take my heart and set it afire
Gonna burn in our desire
Oh! Fiend! Let me free!
Why?
