Time/Confusion Lyrics
Time
Bending faces
Time
Mending places
Time into time
One white hand
Holding silence
Collapses
Ecstacies of violence
Time into time
Time
Let your fist open wide
You'll find the hand and the pattern
Behind which we all hide
Change into time
A bubble of blood
Shed from laughter
Circles death
Before and after
Time beside time

Smiles yawning wisdom
Joy or a liar's kingdom?
Sea leaves scattered in the bracken
Lemons in a spider's web
And travel down an ancient footpath
Where the sudden sand catches you
And you try to stay its favour
And find, at its source, a green leaf
Already reddened
All things have a pattern
Why is it so cold out here? (so cold!)
Let me in!
The price of your entry is sin
Go away, then return
Know which face you have to turn
Eyes are glaring, voices flaring
Why?
You're gonna burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Oh, you're gonna burn all night!
Yes, you're gonna burn in a fire that's so hot
A ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
A ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
A ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Embed
