Rimshot (Outro) LyricsThank you (*clapping*)
The rim shot, hey, c'mon
My rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, c'mon
I want my rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, c'mon
My rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, c'mon
Give it to me, give it to me....
Boom-klat-boom-klat....
Get your stick up against that drum
I don't wanna hear no snare
C'mon, rim shot, I wanna hear it
Rimshot, oh, puts me on the clouds
I got to hear it loud, loud, loud, loud
I really dig the way you hear that stick
On the drum, pum, pum, pum, pum
I want my rim shot, hey, digi
The rim shot, hey, digi...
I, I, I, I wanna rim shot....(repeat til end)Embed
