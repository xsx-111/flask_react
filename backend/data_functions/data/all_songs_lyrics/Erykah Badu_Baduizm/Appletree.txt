Appletree Lyrics
I'd like to dedicate this to all of the Creator's righteous children
I have some food in my bag for you
Not that edible food, the food you eat?
No. I have some food for thought
Since knowledge is infinite
It has infinitely fell on me, so um...

It was a stormy night, you know the kind where the lightning strikes
And I was hanging out with some of my artsy friends
Ooh wee ooh wee ooh
The night was long, the night went on
People cooling out until the break of dawn
Incense was burning so I'm feeling right, aight

See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me
Cause I can't please you and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down, you just don't want to be down

I have a hoe
And I take it everywhere I go
Cause I'm plantin' seeds so I reaps what I sow, ya know, ya know
Oh, on and on, and on and on, my cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
I can't control the soul flowing in me
Ooh wee ooh wee

See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what ya got
I work at pleasing me
Cause I can't please you and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be down
Oh my my my, oh my my my
Oh my my my, ah
Oh my my my my my my my

Oh, I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me
Cause I can't please you, and thats why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee doo wee

And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, dum dum diddy
And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be down
You just don't want to be down
Oh, you just don't want to be down
Down, down, down
You just don't want to be down...
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
