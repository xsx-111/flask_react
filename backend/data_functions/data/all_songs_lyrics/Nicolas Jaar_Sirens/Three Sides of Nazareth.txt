Three Sides of Nazareth LyricsNico: Te gusta ese?
Alfredo: Sí, sigue.
Nico: Y ahí, estaba caminando en un pastel muy chiquitito, y estaba cantando. Y ahí vino un león! Caminando y (roars)
If every now and then you feel like you’ve seen it all,
Then be sure to remember there’s always two sides to a wall.
And if you ever forget that truth was fought with a code,
Then be sure to remember a tale often told on the road.
I was on the blue line when a wired man came through,
He wore his pain like a list of all that you already knew.
He said careful you might trip on the side of the road.
And one eye doesn’t blink on the side of the road.
And you hear that bell ringing on the side of the road?
Yea it doesn’t stop ringing on that side of the road.
And no one knows your name on this side.
They just point at you on that side.
And people get high on this side.
While sunflowers turning on their side.
But the sun don’t shine of this side.
Illuminated minds on that side, doing nothing at all.
They’re doing nothing at all.
I found my broken bones by the side of the road.
I found my broken home by the side of the road.
I found my broken lens by the side of the road.
I found my broken friends by the side of the road.
He said morality is dead on that side.
It’s been thrown on the ground on this side.
Like the casualties in bed on that side.
Find them over on their side.
I found my broken bones by the side of the road.
I found my broken home by the side of the road.
I found my broken lens by the side of the road.
I found my broken friends by the side of the road.
Lessons from a man that wore his pain like a list of all that he knew
Of all that he knew.
Lessons from a man that wore his pain like a list of all that he knew
Of all that he knew.
Lessons from a man that wore his pain like a list of all that he knew
Of all that he knew.
Now he’s talking to you
Now he’s talking to you.
Now he’s talking to you.3Embed
