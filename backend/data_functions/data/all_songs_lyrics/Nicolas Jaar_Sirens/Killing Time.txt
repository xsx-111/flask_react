Killing Time LyricsI think we’re just out of time
Said the officer to the kid
Ahmed was almost fifteen and handcuffed.
He was just building his own sense of time
He was just building time (one of many)
But comfort says we’re fine
And Angela said to open the door
Money, it seems, needs its working class
Money, it seems, needs its working class.
We are just waiting for the old folks to die
We are just waiting
For the old thoughts to die
Just killing time
Just killing time
Just killing time
Just killing time
Just killing time
Just killing time
