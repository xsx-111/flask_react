History Lesson LyricsDarlin’
You’re late
For your history lesson.
Don’t you worry, I’ll give you my notes.
Chapter one: We fucked up.
Chapter two: We did it again, and again, and again, and again.
Chapter three: We didn’t say sorry.
Chapter four: We didn’t acknowledge.
Chapter five: We lied.
Chapter six: We’re done.
Oh..but..baby…Don’t you decide it?3Embed
