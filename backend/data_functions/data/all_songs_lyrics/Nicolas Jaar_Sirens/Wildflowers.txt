Wildflowers Lyrics
I wouldn't take it from me
But maybe
We gotta do it this way
And find out
We gotta do it this way
Looks like you
Talks like you
Just a mirror, correction, idea
Reflection

Looks like you
Talks like you
Just a mirror, correction, idea
Reflection

Just getting closer, sin, faith.

Why did we do it this way?

Try to see, try to see - an eye!Embed
