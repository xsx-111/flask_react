The Governor LyricsMachine: Deicide
It’s simple and numb,
Stuck on automatic,
It’s a blind dealer - a wide-eyed addict.
We’ve allowed for a wheel of loss and desire,
Now there’s no way to put out the fire.
Yea we’re all just rollin’ - high on some junk,
Automatic lava, deicide monk,
A hall full of kids trying to deal with their guilt,
But the echo of the hall is automatically built - and it’s alright.
Find yourself and look back,
No one else will-
We’ve created a monster and it’s ready to build.
The young one’s a trigger, with a bad habit,
She’s a blind nun, cruelest in static.
Yea the past’s just running, high on a stick,
Meaning is useless when given to the sick,
A hall full of kids automatically built so the edge of the hall is ready to kill you alright -
And it’s alright (with you)
Alarm is going off,
Oh can’t you hear -
Your eye’s in the wrong place reflecting a tear,
Go ahead and forget, just give us a smile,
Your whole ride is set, on automatic dial
On automatic dial
On automatic dial
On automatic dial
On automatic dial
On automatic dial
On automatic dial
On automatic dial
On automatic dial
Alarm is going off,
Oh can’t you hear -
Your eye’s in the wrong place reflecting a tear,
Go ahead and forget, just give us a smile,
Your whole ride is set, on automatic dial
Yea we’re all just rolling,
The mothers have sunk,
All the blood’s hidden in the Governor’s trunk,
They keep you in a hall with all of your ilk,
To echo the title of the trunk that they built : “it’s alright”
And it’s alright (with you)1Embed
