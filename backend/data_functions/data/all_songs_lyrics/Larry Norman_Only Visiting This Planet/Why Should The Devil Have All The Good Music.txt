Why Should The Devil Have All The Good Music LyricsI want the people to know that he saved my soul
But I still like to listen to the radio
They say rock 'n' roll is wrong, we'll give you one more chance
I say I feel so good I gotta get up and dance
I know what's right, I know what's wrong, I don't confuse it
All I'm really trying to say
Is why should the devil have all the good music?
I feel good every day
'Cause Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues away
They say to cut my hair, they're driving me insane
I grew it out long to make room for my brain
But sometimes people don't understand
What's a good boy doing in a rock 'n' roll band?
There's nothing wrong with playing blues licks
But if you got a reason tell me to my face
Why should the devil have all the good music
There's nothing wrong with what I play
'Cause Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues away
I ain't knocking the hymns
Just give me a song that has a beat
I ain't knocking the hymns
Just give me a song that moves my feet
I don't like none of those funeral marches
I ain't dead yet!
Jesus told the truth, Jesus showed the way
There's one more thing I'd like to say
They nailed him to the cross, they laid him in the ground
But they shoulda known you can't keep a good man down
I feel good every day, I don't wanna lose it
All I wanna, all I wanna know
Is why should the devil have all the good music
I've been filled, I feel okay
Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues
Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues
Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues awayEmbed
