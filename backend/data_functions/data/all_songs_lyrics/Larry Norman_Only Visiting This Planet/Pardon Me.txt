Pardon Me LyricsPardon me, kissing you like I'm afraid
But I know when I'm being played with
And you'll leave me when you get the chance
Off you'll go, in the darkness of the night
Like a bird in freedom's flight
You're thinking only of deliverance
Close your eyes, and pretend that you are me
See how empty it can be
Making love if love's not really there
Watch me go, watch me walk away alone
As your clothing comes undone
And you pull the ribbon from your hairEmbed
