The Outlaw Lyrics
Some say he was an outlaw, that he roamed across the land
With a band of unschooled ruffians and few old fishermen
No one knew just where he came from or exactly what he'd done
But they said it must be something bad that kept him on the run

Some say he was a poet, that he'd stand upon the hill
That his voice could calm an angry crowd and make the waves stand still
That he spoke in many parables that few could understand
But the people sat for hours just to listen to this man

Some say he was a sorcerer, a man of mystery
He could walk upon the water, he could make a blind man see
That he conjured wine at weddings and did tricks with fish and bread
That he talked of being born again and raised people from the dead


Some say a politician who spoke of being free
He was followed by the masses on the shores of Galilee
He spoke out against corruption, and he bowed to no decree
And they feared his strength and power, so they nailed him to a tree
Some say he was the Son of God, a man above all men
That he came to be a servant and to set us free from sin
And that's who I believe he is, 'cause that's what I believe
And I think we should get ready, 'cause it's time for us to leaveEmbed
