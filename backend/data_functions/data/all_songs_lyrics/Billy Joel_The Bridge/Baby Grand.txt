Baby Grand Lyrics
Late at night when it's dark and cold
I reach out for someone to hold
When I'm blue, when I'm lonely
She comes through, she's the only one who can
My baby grand is all I need

In my time, I've wandered everywhere
Around this world, she would always be there
Any day, any hour
All it takes is the power in my hands
This baby grand's been good to me

I've had friends, but they slipped away
And I've had fame, but it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes, I spent them fast enough
But as for women, they don't lust with just one man
But my baby grand is gonna stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
Why, I don't believe that
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on
I've come far from the life I strayed in
And I've got the scars from those dives I played in
Now I'm home, and I'm weary
And in my bones, every dreary one night stand
My baby grand is coming home with me
With me

But ever since this gig began
My baby grand's been good to meEmbed
