No Lullaby LyricsKeep your eyes open and prick up your ears
Rehearse your loudest cry
There's folk out there who would do you harm
So I'll sing you no lullaby
There's a lock on the window, there's a chain on the door
And a big dog in the hall
But there's dragons and beasties out there in the night
To snatch you if you fall
So come out fighting with your rattle in hand, thrust and parry; light
A match to catch the devil's eye, bring a cross of fire to the fight
And let no sleep bring false relief from the tension of the fray
Come wake the dead with the scream of life, do battle with ghosts at play
And gather your toys at the call-to-arms and swing your big bear down
Upon our necks when we come to set you sleeping safe and sound
It's as well we tell no lie to chase the face that cries
And little birds can't fly so keep an open eye
It's as well we tell no lie, so I'll sing you no lullaby
It's as well we tell no lie to chase the face that cries
And little birds can't fly so keep an open eye
It's as well we tell no lie, so I'll sing you no lullaby
Keep your eyes open and prick up your ears
Rehearse your loudest cry
There's folk out there who would do you harm
So I'll sing you no lullaby
There's a lock on the window, there's a chain on the door
And a big dog in the hall
But there's dragons and beasties out there in the night
To snatch you if you fall
So come out fighting with your rattle in hand, thrust and parry; light
A match to catch the devil's eye, bring a cross of fire to the fight
And let no sleep bring false relief from the tension of the fray
Come wake the dead with the scream of life, do battle with ghosts at play
And gather your toys at the call-to-arms and swing your big bear down
Upon our necks when we come to set you sleeping safe and sound
It's as well we tell no lie to chase the face that cries
And little birds can't fly so keep an open eye
It's as well we tell no lie, so I'll sing you no lullaby1Embed
