Minstrel in the Gallery (Live) LyricsThe minstrel in the gallery
Looked down upon the smiling faces
He met the gazes observed the spaces
Between the old men's cackle
He brewed a song of love and hatred
Oblique suggestions and he waited
He polarized the pumpkin-eaters
Static-humming panel-beaters
Freshly day-glow'd factory cheaters
(Salaried and collar-scrubbing)
He titillated men-of-action
Belly warming, hands still rubbing
On the parts they never mention
He pacified the nappy-suffering, infant-bleating
One-line jokers, TV documentary makers
(Overfed and undertakers)
Sunday paper backgammon players
Family-scarred and women-haters
Then he called the band down to the stage
And he looked at all the friends he'd made
The minstrel in the gallery
Looked down upon the smiling faces
He met the gazes observed the spaces
In between the old men's cackle
He brewed a song of love and hatred
Oblique suggestions and he waited
He polarized the pumpkin-eaters
Static-humming panel-beaters
The minstrel in the gallery
Looked down on the rabbit-run
And threw away his looking-glass -
Saw his face in everyone
He titillated men-of-action
Belly warming, hands still rubbing
On the parts they never mention
(Salaried and collar-scrubbing)
He pacified the nappy-suffering, infant-bleating
One-line jokers, TV documentary makers
(Overfed and undertakers)
Sunday paper backgammon players
Family-scarred and women-haters
Then he called the band down to the stage
And he looked at all the friends he'd made
The minstrel in the gallery
Looked down on the rabbit-run
And threw away his looking-glass
And saw his face in everyone
The minstrel in the gallery
Looked down upon the smiling faces
He met the gazes...
