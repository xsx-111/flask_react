Jack-in-the-Green Lyrics
Have you seen Jack-In-The-Green?
With his long tail hanging down
He quietly sits under every tree
In the folds of his velvet gown
He drinks from the empty acorn cup
The dew that dawn sweetly bestows
And taps his cane upon the ground
Signals the snowdrops it's time to grow

It's no fun being Jack-In-The-Green
No place to dance, no time for song
He wears the colours of the summer soldier
Carries the green flag all the winter long

Jack, do you never sleep
Does the green still run deep in your heart?
Or will these changing times
Motorways, powerlines
Keep us apart?
Well, I don't think so
I saw some grass growing through the pavements today
The rowan, the oak and the holly tree
Are the charges left for you to groom
Each blade of grass whispers Jack-In-The-Green
Oh Jack, please help me through my winter's night
And we are the berries on the holly tree
Oh, the mistlethrush is coming
Jack, put out the lightEmbed
