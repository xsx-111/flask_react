Cross-Eyed Mary Lyrics
Who would be a poor man, a beggarman, a thief
If he had a rich man in his hand
And who would steal the candy
From a laughing baby's mouth
If he could take it from the money man

Cross-eyed Mary
Goes jumping in again
She signs no contract
But she always plays the game
She dines in Hampstead village
On expense accounted gruel
And the jack-knife barber
Drops her off at school
Hey

Laughing in the playground
Gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a letching grey
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play
Hey
Cross-eyed Mary
Finds it hard to get along
She's a poor man's rich girl
And she'll do it for a song
She's a rich man stealer
But her favour's good and strong
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate
Helps the poor man get along
Hey



Laughing in the playground
Gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a letching grey
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play
Hey

Cross-eyed Mary
Goes jumping in again
She signs no contract
But she always plays the game
She dines in Hampstead village
On expense accounted gruel
And the jack-knife barber
Drops her off at school
Hey
Cross-eyed Mary
Oh Mary
Oh Cross-eyed Mary5Embed
