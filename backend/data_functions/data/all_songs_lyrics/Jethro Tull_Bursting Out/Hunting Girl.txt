Hunting Girl Lyrics
One day I walked the road and crossed a field
To go by where the hounds ran hard
And on the master raced: behind the hunters chased
To where the path was barred
One fine young lady's horse refused the fence to clear
I unlocked the gate but she did wait until the pack had disappeared

Crop handle carved in bone;
Sat high upon a throne of finest English leather
The queen of all the pack
This joker raised his hat and talked about the weather
All should be warned about this high born Hunting Girl
She took this simple man's downfall in hand;
I raised the flag that she unfurled
Boot leather flashing and spurnecks the size of my thumb
This highborn hunter had tastes as strange as they come
Unbridled passion: I took the bit in my teeth
Her standing over --- me on my knees underneath
My lady, be discrete
I must get to my feet and go back to the farm
Whilst I appreciate you are no deviate
I might come to some harm
I'm not inclined to acts refined, if that's how it goes
Oh, high born Hunting Girl
I'm just a normal low born so and soEmbed
