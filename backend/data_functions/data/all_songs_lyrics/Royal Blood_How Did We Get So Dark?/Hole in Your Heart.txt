Hole in Your Heart Lyrics
Everytime I think about it
I shiver like I've never shook
And all the while we talk about it
It never feels exactly like it should
Even if we turned it around
It would only do no good

So baby don't fake it
When you already know
You can't shake it
And it's starting to show
I can't fill that hole in your heart
Like I could at the start

I felt a fire burning long before
I even saw the smoke
The tragedy just looming over the horizon
Still there's a part of me that hopes
That we could just turn it around
But it would only do no good
Just remember there's nobody else
That could love you like I could
So baby don't fake it
When you already know
You can't shake it
And it's starting to show
I can't fill that hole in your heart
Like I could at the start
Yeah baby don't fake it
When you already know
You can't shake it
And it's starting to show
I can't fill that hole in your heart
Like I could at the start
Ooohhhhh
Ooohhhhh
Ooohhhhh
Ooohhhhh

So baby don't fake it
When you already know
You can't shake it
And it's starting to show
I can't fill that hole in your heart
Like I could at the start
I can't fill that hole in your heart
Like I could at the start
Ooohhhhh
Ooohhhhh
Ooohhhhh
Ooohhhhh4Embed
