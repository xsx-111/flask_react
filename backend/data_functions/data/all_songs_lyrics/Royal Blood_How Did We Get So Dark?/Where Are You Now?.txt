Where Are You Now? Lyrics
I was an honest boy, yeah
I was brought up right
Fell for an honest girl, yeah
We were so tight
If only luck was always on our side

You gave in all your secrets
Didn't give in mine
Nowhere left to run, no
We live to shine
If only love was on your side
And I was just a stranger passing by

You saw me driving my car
Like a dog running wild
Oh my hands were shaking
Singing, "where are you now?"
I wish I could go back somehow
Just tell me baby, where are you now?
Where are you now?

I've tasted every potion, they don't taste like you
You're a teardrop in an ocean
Still we're drinking through
And I still wonder where you are and who you're talking to
When I think about it I get blue
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Yeah!2Embed
