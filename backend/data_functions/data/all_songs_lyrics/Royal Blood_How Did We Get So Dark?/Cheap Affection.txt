Cheap Affection Lyrics
I wanna be
All by myself
So take what you need
I don't want your help
'Cause it'll rain on me
Like it did last night
Now you're out of your mind
Least you're out of sight

Two years, two months, wishing too late
Shouldn't have let me go to waste
So long, I know it's been awhile
Just ask and I won't fake a smile

'Cause cheap affection passed me by
And God knows I paid the price
So convinced of paradise

Ten thousand ways
To tell the truth
Spoilt for choice
Yeah, I just can't choose
But I'm an honest man
That's honesty
You should give it a try
Honestly

Two years, two months, wishing too late
Shouldn't have let me go to waste
So long, I know it's been awhile
Just ask and I won't fake a smile

'Cause cheap affection passed me by
And God knows I paid the price
So convinced of paradise

Two years, two months, wishing too late
Shouldn't have let me go to waste
Two years, two months, wishing too late
Shouldn't have let me go to waste1Embed
