Look Like You Know Lyrics
Say my prayers every night
But no one's there to make it right
Holding on
Nothing's changed
Same old love just rearranged

No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
No
No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
So

Just look like you know
Look like you know something I should
I think I should go
I really feel like you want me to
Don't say that you want me
Don't pray the wish you can't make come true
Can I be replaced?
Cause that look on your face
Says "Baby I never knew"
Happiness on a drip
To total bliss running down the drain
Losing count of the days
Now every kiss just feels the same

No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
No
No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
So

Just look like you know
Look like you know something I should
I think I should go
I really feel like you want me to
Don't say that you want me
Don't pray the wish you can't make come true
Can I be replaced?
Cause that look on your face
Says "Baby I never knew"
Just look like you know
Look like you know something I should
I think I should go
I really feel like you want me to
Don't say that you want me
Don't pray the wish you can't make come true
Can I be replaced?
Cause that look on your face
Says "baby I never knew"2Embed
