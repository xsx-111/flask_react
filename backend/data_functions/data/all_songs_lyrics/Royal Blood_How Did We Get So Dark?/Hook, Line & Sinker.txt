Hook, Line & Sinker Lyrics
She's got the devil on one shoulder
And the other's getting colder
She looks so good but it's not nearly
Feeling like it's supposed to
Going sold, going sold
Going, gone

Then she drags me by one finger
To her lips, hook, line and sinker
Honey I'm a sucker, when you linger
Give me everything I want
Cause you know, I won't go
Till I'm gone

Say my name again
Tell me you're caught in the middle
You're caught in the middle
And you're begging for me to stay
Cause every now and then
My love calls like a whistle
It calls like a whistle
And it's blowing your mind again
Got you crawling in the shadows
To the smoke of the tobacco
Burning slowly out the window
And whichever way it blows
There you go, there you go
There you go

I'm a slave to your addiction
Your affection and your friction
I've got all the money to buy exactly what I want
But you're not for sale
Honey no second chances, oh no

Say my name again
Tell me you're caught in the middle
You're caught in the middle
And you're begging for me to stay
Cause every now and then
My love calls like a whistle
It calls like a whistle
And it's blowing your mind again

She's got the devil on one shoulder
And the other's getting colder
She looks so good but it's not nearly
Feeling like it's supposed to
Going sold, going sold
Going
Say my name again
Tell me you're caught in the middle
You're caught in the middle
And you're begging for me to stay
Cause every now and then
My love calls like a whistle
It calls like a whistle
And it's blowing your mind again5Embed
