Half the Chance Lyrics
At the top of the hill
By the luminous sign
Deep in the hollow
Inside a wooden house
Under the setting sun
You turned shallow
I can still remember when
You'd hold me close and let no one in
At the top of the hill
By the luminous sign
Deep in the hollow

Given half the chance
I would go back now
Try to shake you up
Get through to you somehow
'Cause not a day goes by
I don't wish that I
Tried to change your mind
Instead you chose your fate and mine

Down by that sunset strip
Lost in the thick of it
Deep in the shadows
That night I laid beside
But you could not hide
That guilty swallow
Yeah, I can still remember when
You'd hold me close and let no one in
Yeah, given half the chance
I would go back now
Try to shake you up
Get through to you somehow
'Cause not a day goes by
I don't wish that I
Tried to change your mind
Instead you chose your fate and mine
Given half the chance
I would go back now
Try to shake you up
Get through to you somehow
'Cause not a day goes by
I don't wish that I
Tried to change your mind
Instead you chose your fateEmbed
