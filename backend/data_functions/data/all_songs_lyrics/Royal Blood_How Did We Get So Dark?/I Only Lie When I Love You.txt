I Only Lie When I Love You Lyrics
I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound

Go ahead, muck about
I got my conscience twisted
Pull your hair, make me shout
It's just that you insisted I was good for nothing
Like you were onto something

I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound
I only lie when I
I only lie when I
I only lie when I
I only lie when I
I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound
Go ahead, pull the plug
Broken finger, sticky trigger
Now I can't get it off my chest
And now I'm wishing you were someone else
You know I'm up to something
Diagnosed, no disease
Got a suspicion but you just can't find it up your sleeve
And now I beg the truth be told from someone else
All of that fuss for nothing

I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound
I only lie when I
I only lie when I
I only lie when I
I only lie when I
I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound4Embed
