Public Displays of Affection LyricsTherefore all to see
Self-contained lovers
Welded orally
No run for cover
I'd join in the fun
If i had someone
But it seems I'm undone
These public displays of affection
Surely your love must be new
I can wait for my next rejection
I'm always the first in the queue
Tried to hold your soul
But I crushed your spirit
Why do I feel so close
When I can't get near it
I'm flooded with fear
And it don't disappear
But I'm still standing here
These public displays of affection
Surely your love must be new
So conscious of my imperfections
I've never lost interest in me
These public displays of affection
Surely your love must be new
Your natural over-protection
Leaves me with nothing to do
These public displays of affection
Surely your love must be new
I've got no time for reflection
My savior is long overdueEmbed
