Aqualung LyricsBattle cries
We make a swift retreat
Paradise, it don't come cheap
Square up to fight
Like dynamite
The flight is young
We're getting deep
Without an aqualung
Our will is strong
We've got to work out where we're
Going wrong
Buttercup
I think we missed our turn
Back it up
You think I'd learn
Your gelignite
Sets truth alight
The flight is young
We're getting deep
Without an aqualung
Our time is long
We've got to find out
Where we're coming from
Square up to the fight
Like dynamite
The flight is young
We're getting deep
Without an aqualung
Our will is strong
We've got to work out where we're
Going wrong
Light years from here
We're going to burn up
In the atmosphere
It's crystal clear
We're coming swinging
On a chandelierEmbed
