What New York Couples Fight About LyricsOnce a label is on something
It becomes an it
Like it's no longer alive
It's like a loss of vision
Or some dark impression
Or a black spot on your eye
If it's up to you
My little sweet baboo
Through the shouting and the fever
Think of life as queer
Think of it my dear
As some knobs or a fancy tone
From here there is no reason
Baby's got it made
But it's not what the life's about
What is imagination?
May become a fact
If we think of it that way
If you want to know
I can tell you now
Or if you make it through somehow
Or is it best to keep or fall to sleep
It isn't looking very good to me from here
Hey
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
What do New York couples fight about
Brother's gonna work it out
(Baby's got the bed sheet)
How do
(That was under you)
New York
(When your time and and the life expires)
Couples Fight it out
What these couples fight about
(Keeps it in the closet)
What do
(Keeps it to herself)
New york
(She should throw the damn thing out)
Couples fight about
But their gonna work it out
(Why should you continue)
How do
(To shake it off)
New York
(Would you write things on the wall)
Couples fight it out
What these couples fight about
You could make it hard, to be
In the shouting you will see
Or is it best to change the world you're keeping
Down again
Hey
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know...
Such is the sound of sorry
Without the shy report
Or the grips that could hold you down
(Just when things were looking up
You act just like a horses butt)
Everything was simple
But the body's worn
Got the life spread on the ground
(Powder pink and general
The kitchen sink, a funeral)
Every loving other
Don't you fade on me
Like a bomb that's about to blow
(Often we will overlook
The things that make it undercooked)
We can make it hard
Or we can take the world apart
Or you'd never be that sure?
Of the simple thing that makes you want to cry again
Hey
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know 'cause I forget
He's distressed
And I forget
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna knowEmbed
