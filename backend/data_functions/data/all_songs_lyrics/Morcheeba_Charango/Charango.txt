Charango LyricsAll this fuss a lil more (more Morcheeba)
Props from here to singapore (Morcheeba)
All this fuss a lil more (Morcheeba)
Props from here to singapore (Morcheeba)
Yo'
Pull up in a all black 528 (errrr)
Fly new paint
Drive threw states
While you a'int
Can't get props cuz your styles to fake
Try new thing
Rap like me
Dance like D
One more chance like Biggy
Easy Coast Rock
Beats don't stop
Niggas fall off mad teams go pop
Swing like spiderman and wall creaper
Pace Won rocks them all the tall creature
You don't like me
I ain't feelin ya'll neither
Ya'll need to roll your blunts with Morcheeba
This is how the east coast rocks
This is how Pace Won rocks
This is how the east coast rocks
This is how MJ rocks
This is how Pace Won rocksEmbed
