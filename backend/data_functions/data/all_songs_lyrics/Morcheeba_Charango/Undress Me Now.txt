Undress Me Now LyricsUsing your mind
Imagine our skin
Joined at the hip
Joined from within
By using your eyes
You're freezing my frame
Watching our clothes burst into flames
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your mind
Using your mind
So give me a light
Oh give me a drink
Just give me a reason
To feel what I think
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your mind
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your mind
Using my mind
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how)
You know how, you know how
You know how, you know how1Embed
