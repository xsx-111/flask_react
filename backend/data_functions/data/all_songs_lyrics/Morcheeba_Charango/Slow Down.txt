Slow Down LyricsTake your time now
Feel like standing still
Get your barings
Until
When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown
When the day is here
All you got to do is slowdown
Full of tension
'Cause you love the chase
You just need your
Own space
When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown
When the day is here
All you got to do is slowdown
When you had enough
Of the fastest stuff to slowdown
When you see from space
Must be a mess slowdown
When the day is here
All you got to do is slowdown
When the day is here
All you got to do is slowdown
When it's hard out there
And you gonna bail, slowdown
You just seem sometimes
To forget your mind slowdown
