Dangerous Lyrics
Can you feel it? Watching you in the darkness
Touching you like a sickness
Fear is taking control
The beach head is the street
In the gutter lies defeat
Fear is the key to your soul
That makes you dangerous
So dangerous to yourself

Can you feel it in the shadows?
Watching you, touching you
Can you feel it in the shadows?
Watching you, touching you
Changing you into a mad dog
Howling at the moon
And you are so far out of tune
Better learn how to sing
Fences, we put up defenses
Then we come to our senses
It may keep them out
But it keeps us in
And that makes us dangerous
We're all dangerous to ourselves
This is a jungle, not illusion
Jungle city, in confusion
We are the next step in evolution
The new stone age, revolution
Back to the stone age, constitution
No solution

Can you feel it in the shadows?
Watching you, touching you
Can you feel it as the shadows
Follow you, swallow you?
Can you feel it?
Fear is the key
Can you feel it?
Fear is the key
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Fear is the key to your soulEmbed
