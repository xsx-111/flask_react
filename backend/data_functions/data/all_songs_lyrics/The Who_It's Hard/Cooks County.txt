Cooks County LyricsPeople are suffering
I'll say it again
People are suffering
I'll say it again
People are suffering
I'll say it again
So remember when you're looking for trouble
That trouble is already busy with weaker men
People are hungry
I'll say it again
People are hungry
I'll say it again
People are hungry
I'll say it again
So don't you abuse that body
It'll snap without assistance my friends
The song goes on
I'll sing again until the music enervates
The song goes on
The sting of pain will dull and finally fade away
The song goes on
Through centuries of history it reverberates
The song goes on
On curving comets track the music makes its way
This song is so long
It ends up where it begins
People are lonely
I'll say it again
People are lonely
I'll say it again
People are lonely
I'll say it again
So don't let them run too far from home
You'll be alone for sure on that you can depend
People are bleeding
I'll say it again
People are bleeding
I'll say it again
People are bleeding
I'll say it again
So put away that switchblade knife
Tighten up the knot that'll help this bloodshed end
The song goes on - the song goes on
This song
Is so long
It ends up where it begins
People are suffering
I'll say it again and again
People are hungry
I'll say it again and again
People are lonely
I'll say it again and againEmbed
