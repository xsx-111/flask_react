Why Did I Fall for That Lyrics
The streets of the future littered with remains
Of both the fools and the so called brains
The whole prediction is enough to kill
But only God knows if it will not or it will

Nobody knows why we fell so flat
Some silly creature said we would never crack
Most would just survive and then bounce back
But the rest are crying "Why'd I fall for that crap"
Why did I fall for that?

So many rash promises sincerely made
By people who believed that we were being saved
They made us all believe that we were acting white
But the truth is we have forgotten how we used to fight

Nobody knows why we fell so flat
We are impotent and neutered like whining cats
We have found the piper but we've lost the rats
But the kids are crying "Why'd you fall for that dad?"
Why did you fall?
It never rains under my umbrella

Four minutes to midnight on a sunny day
Maybe if we smile the clock will fade away
Maybe we can force the hands to just reverse
Maybe as a word, maybe maybe is a curse

Nobody knows why we fell so flat
We have never been taught to fight or to face up to facts
We simply believe that we'd remain intact
But history is asking why'd you fall for that?

Why did you fall?
Why did I fall for that 1Embed
