One at a Time Lyrics
One at a time
Always ready to fight over the little things
One at a time, she is
Always ready to fight over the little things
She is going crazy and the table starts shaking
She is been abusing her body again
Her vision gets hazy and the bottles start breaking
She has been seeing that man again

If you want her, you can keep her
'Cos I can only handle one at a time
You can take her
I have got someone waiting in line
And I would like to
But I can only handle one at a time
One at a time

I found out she's continually cheating
She insists, she so innocent
So I stayed out at another late meeting
And she waited up for another argument

I am moving on to something better
There must be something better than this
She's got me so confused
As to who's being used
Call her up right away
You have got her number
And I promise not to answer the phone
You can pick her up in your clapped out Humber
I just hope it can get you home
