The War Is Over LyricsA light shines above
A trace of the sky
Reflecting in my lover's eye
The sun going down
On a war, lost or won
All is silent in this newborn world of peace
We're the only ones awake to see
It's not a case of right and wrong
It's all about to be
You and me
So come and bless my soul
It's all about to be
A blue whippoorwill sings
On the other side of the rain
We're through with the games
We survived the hate and the pain
The storm's gone away
So come my kingdom come - come todayEmbed
