Ricochet LyricsHear me breathe
From the other room
So which of all the lies you told
Should I keep as my own?
The metaphors are lost on me
What I see is what I see
The earth is moving - time to say goodbye?
Only sky ahead
Love's so hard to find
I saw it coming
Saw it go wailing down the line
Will I see you again?
A window closed, an opened door
Some seven steps away
My actions caught up finally
Beyond the watchword wait and see
Beyond the undecisive ways of mine
Only sky ahead
Love's so hard to find
I saw it come and saw it go
Somewhere down the line
Down the line
The dream machine's on speed
My head's up in the clouds
We met up on the ledge
And I could read your mind
And though things fall asleep
Nothing ever dies
I caught it on the bounce
And now we float
- hands outstretched -
Along the riverEmbed
