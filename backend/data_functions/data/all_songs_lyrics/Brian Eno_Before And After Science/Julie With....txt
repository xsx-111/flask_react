Julie With... Lyrics

I am on an open sea
Just drifting as the hours go slowly by
Julie with her open blouse
Is gazing up into the empty sky

Now it seems to be so strange here
Now it's so blue
The still sea is darker than before


No wind disturbs our colored sail
The radio is silent, so are we
Julie's head is on her arm
Her fingers brush the surface of the sea

Now I wonder if we'll be seen, here
Or if time has left us all alone
The still sea is darker than before
