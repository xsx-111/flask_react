Here He Comes Lyrics
Here he comes
The boy who tried to vanish to the future or past
Is no longer here with his sad blue eyes
Here he comes
He floated away and as he rose above reason
He rose above the clouds, he was seven feet high
Here he comes
The night is like a glove and he's floating like a dove
That catches the wind in the deep blue sky
Here he comes
The boy who tried to vanish to another time
Is no longer here with his sad blue eyes

Here he comes
Here he comes

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh


Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Here he comes
The boy who tried to vanish to another place
Sees us following here all one at a time
Here he comes
And we're checking out each other's supplies
And looking at the eyes of all the others standing in the line
Here he comes
The night is like a glove and he's floating like a dove
With his deep blue eyes in the deep blue sky
Here he comes
The boy who tried to vanish to the future or past
Is no longer alone among the dragonflies

Here he comes
Here he comes

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Who will remember him?
Who will remember him?3Embed
