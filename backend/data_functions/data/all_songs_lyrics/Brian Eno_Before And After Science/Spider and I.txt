Spider and I LyricsSpider and I
Sit watching the sky
On a world without sound
We knit a web
To catch one tiny fly
For our world without sound
We sleep in the mornings
We dream of a ship that sails away
A thousand miles away
We sleep in the mornings
We dream of a ship that sails away
A thousand miles away1Embed
