All Along The Watchtower LyricsThere must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them know along the line
What any of this is worth, yeah
No reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who think that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And that is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
Because the hour is getting late
Hey, hey, hey
All along the watchtower
And princes kept the view
While horsemen came and went
Barefoot servants too
All I got is a red guitar
Three chords and the truth
All I got is a red guitar
The rest is up to you
There's no reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are some among us here
Say that life is just a joke
You and I, we've been through that
And that is not our fate, at least today
So let us not talk falsely now
Because the hour is getting late, late
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah-e-yeah
Yeah, yeah-e-yeahEmbed
