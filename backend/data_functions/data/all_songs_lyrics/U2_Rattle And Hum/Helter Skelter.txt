Helter Skelter Lyrics
This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. We're stealing it back. 

When you get to the bottom
You go back to the top of the slide
And you stop and you turn
And you go for a ride
Then you get to the bottom
Then you see me again
Hey, hey, hey

Do you, don't you want me to love you?
(Yeah)
Coming down fast, I'm right here above you
(Yeah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Ain't no lover, but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ooh
Do you, don't you want me to make you?
(Yeah)
I'm coming down fast, now don't let me break you
(Yeah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ooh


When you get to the bottom
You go back to the top of the slide
And you turn and you stop
And you go for a ride
Then you get to the bottom
Then you'll see me again
Hey, hey, hey

Do you, don't you want me to love you?
(Yeah)
Coming down fast, I'm right here above you
(Yeah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ooh, and again
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
