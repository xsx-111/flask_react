The Blarney Stone Lyrics
Get off my ass, ya wee bitty fuck
If I pull out the claymore, you're shit outta luck
Who is that girl, that pretty young thing
After I fuck her, she'll get up and sing

Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

Down to the pub, for a two-shillin' ale
The bread on the counter is goin' stale
If I don't get some fresh bread soon
Gonna punch you in your face, and bark at the moon

Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

Ain't got no girl, 'cuz I haven't the time
Got too many other things on me mind
Patty was nice, she was pale and cute
But I threw her away, like an old piece of fruit
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye
Got tombs in me pores, my feet are all wet
Got mold in my ears, but I ain't dead yet
Got stones in me bladder, got a crack in me head
When Patty starts cryin', this is what I said

Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye4Embed
