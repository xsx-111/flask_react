The Mollusk Lyrics
Hey little boy, what you got there?
Kind sir, it's a mollusk I've found
Did you find it in the sandy ground?
Does it emulate the ocean's sound?
Yes, I found it on the ground
Emulating the ocean's sound

Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free

Hey little boy, come walk with me
And bring your newfound mollusk along
Does it speaketh of the Trinity?
Can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye?
Yes, it speaks of the Trinity
Casting light at the sun with its wandering eye

Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free

You see, there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand (Yes)
The waking of all creatures, that live on the land (Yes)
And with just one faint glance, back into the sea (No)
The mollusk lingers... with its wandering eye (No)
