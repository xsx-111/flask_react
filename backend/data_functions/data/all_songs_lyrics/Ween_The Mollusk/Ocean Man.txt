Ocean Man Lyrics
Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land
That you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip

Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the Oberman?
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man

Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man

Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land
That you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip (Trip, trip, trip, trip, trip)
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the Oberman?
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man

Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
