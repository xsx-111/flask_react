The Golden Eel Lyrics
Sitting alone in the den
Watching the eel
Help me find my way home
Watching the eel
Burrows its head in the sand
Daylight has come
There shall be rest in a while
Daylight has come

I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel

Who can explain all these thoughts
Racking my mind
An endless barrage of shit
Racking my mind
The eel offered his help
I can't understand
Speaking its truth from the bank
Now I can see

I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel

I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel1Embed
