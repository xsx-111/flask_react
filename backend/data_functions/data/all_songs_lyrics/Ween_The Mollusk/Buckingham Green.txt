Buckingham Green Lyrics
A child without an eye
Made her mother cry, why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green

The children saw the eye
As a sign from God descending from the sky...
It was alright to dream
Of Buckingham Green

"Summon the queen!"
Spoke the child of eye, "It's time to fly."
Turning fire to steam
On Buckingham Green

A child without an eye
Made her mother cry why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green1Embed
