Just Say Goodbye LyricsSometimes when I'm fading
I fight to stay awake
Here I lie, come and take me
I'll go
I will go so far just to say goodbye
My, my in my opinion
I tried, I huff and I puff
Why am I in my skin again?
Well, I don't know how it works
So I just say goodbye
Sometimes I see sorry faces
I don't think I qualify
Be kind as the nights embrace us
Oh, oh, we tried so hard
Oh, as if I have answers
Oh, we tried so hard
Just to say goodbyeEmbed
