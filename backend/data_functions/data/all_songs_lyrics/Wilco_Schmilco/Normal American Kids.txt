Normal American Kids LyricsI remind myself of myself long ago
'Fore I could drive, 'fore I could vote
All of the time, holding a grudge
'Fore I knew people could die just because
Shot from a sling, head full of buzz
I knew what I liked was not very much
High at the time, tied to the grid
Always afraid of those normal American kids
Oh, all of my spirit leaked like a cut
I knew what I needed would never be enough
I was too high to change my bid
Always afraid to be a normal American kid
Always hating normal  American empty summer days
Lightning crazed and cracked like an egg
High behind the garden shed
Painting myself as a normal American kid
I always hated it
High as high as high can loom
Under the sheets in my bedroom
I was high as high can get
Always afraid of those normal American kids
Oh, bongs and jams, and carpeted vans
Hate everything, I don't understand
High times tightening the lid
I had to get away from those normal American kids
Always hated those normal American kids
Always hated those normal American kids2Embed
