Locator LyricsLocator sees me swaying through the catacombs
Locator hears me whispering in my home
Even when the waves are falling
Beat me into diamonds
Even when the wheels are whining
Even when the wheels are whining
Something in the sky can find me
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide
Here below, here below, here below, here below
Oh no, locator it is I
Even when I run I'm crawling
Even through the walls and blinds and
Even when the wheels are whining
Even when the wheels are whining
Something in the sky can find me
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide
Here below, here below, here below, here below
I love locator everywhere I go
I tell locator everything it wants to knowEmbed
