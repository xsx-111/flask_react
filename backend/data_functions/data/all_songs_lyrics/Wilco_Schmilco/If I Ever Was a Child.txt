If I Ever Was a Child LyricsI've never been alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child
I was tied up like a boat
Unbuttoned like a coat
Set free for a while
Well I jumped to jolt my clumsy blood
While my white, green eyes
Cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Even out of spite?
I slump behind my brain
A haunted stain never fades
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take
And I cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Over night?
So I won't ever want to touch
Your heart too much
Or hold you too tight
I slump behind my brain
A haunted stain will never fade
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take
I never was alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child3Embed
