Cry All Day LyricsI know that I'm unknowing
I'm never totally right
I'm gonna walk away slowly
Instead I bid you good night
Another goodbye
I'm gonna cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Whatever you're withholding
I never said it was good
If I could sell it by the dozen
I'd never dare but you would
I know that you would
I'm aware that you could
Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
I had a hole in my heart
I had a "company" me
It kept me whole-y from rolling
Someone into something like me
Something like me
You don't wanna be
I cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
I cry all night
I cry all day
And I cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
At the open mic
I sing and I stall
I fall on the knife
However, there's another
Another future to fight
I never took it so seriously
Oh, it was serious alright
Watch 'em all fight
But you can't fight it
And I cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
Cry all day
Cry all night
All day
And now the hounds are calling
I see the world I find
I'm sick of your affliction
But you're just a smartass and blind
Out of the light
Now be kind
Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
All night
Into the light
Into the light
Into the lightEmbed
