Good Times LyricsNight, the city
Its dark and lonely streets
Rain falls on my face
Mixed with salty tears
Confirm your happiness
Everything is looking good
Look down, feel the pain
Falling teardrops to the ground
Think back through the phrases
Restore sanity to the mind
You know she's gone now
Are these not the good times?
Good times, good times
We're leavin' them pretty soon
When I'm over the pain of missing you
Good times, good times
Arrivin' just as soon as
All the flames extinguish the memories that I knew
Thinking as though things
Had worked out fine
When I knew it'd hurt you
If you knew you were hurting me
Day breaks, clouds move
And the sun comes through the rain
But for now I'm livin' back
In the stormy night
I gotta think back through the phrases
Restore sanity to the mind
You know she's gone now
Are these not the good times?
Think back through the phrases
Restore sanity to the mind
You know she's gone now
Are these not the good times?
Good times? Good times?
Good times, good times
We're leavin' them pretty soon
When I'm over the pain of missing you
Good times, good times
Arrivin' just as soon as
All flames extinguish the memories that I knewEmbed
