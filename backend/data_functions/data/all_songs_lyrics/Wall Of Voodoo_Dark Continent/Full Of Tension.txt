Full Of Tension LyricsThere's something pulling on my sleeve
Full of tension
There's something breathing down my neck
Full of tension
Now if you wanna take it to the hilt
You can take it 'til you tilt
Something pulling on my sleeve
Full of tension
Watchin' out my window at the people in the street
I try to keep it quietâ€“this feeling's got me beat
I can't contain myself no matter what I try
There's something breathing down my neck
Full of tension
A tiny hole burnt with a cigarette
Full of tension
And now I start to see the little spots
Stickin' to the wall and on the floor
Something pulling on my sleeve
Full of tension, hup!
There's something tightening 'round my neck
Full of tension
There's something pulling on my sleeve
Full of tension
And I hear a knock-knock-knockin' at my door
I just can't take it anymore
Something pulling on my sleeve
Full of tension
Full of tension
Full of tension, tension
Stand at full attention!Embed
