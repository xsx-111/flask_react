Red Light LyricsIf it's the rough stuff ya want
You can point your finger at me
'Cause I can dish it out good
But I don't give it away for free
There's a price for my vice
And I want it in cash
In a plain brown bag
You can put it out by the trash
There'll be a red light by the window
And a blue light by the car
He'll be running, but he won't get far
A red light by the window
And a blue light by the car
He'll be running, but he won't get far
This modern world deserves a
Modern attitude
You've gotta stick it to them
Before they stick it to you
I want the money
And I want it in cash
You can put it out, put it out, put it out by the trash
There'll be a red light by the window
And a blue light by the car
He'll be running, but he won't get far
There'll be a red light by the window
And a blue light by the car
He'll be running, but he won't get far
Red light
Blue light
Red light
Blue light
This modern world deserves a modern attitude!Embed
