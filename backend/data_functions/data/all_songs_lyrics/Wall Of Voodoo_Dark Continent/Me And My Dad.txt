Me And My Dad LyricsMe and my dad
We've got a good thing going
Fishing trips, the hard way's the best
Man-to-man talks, when the going gets tough
The tough get going
Follow me, son
I'll guide you the right way
Fix my car when the engine falls apart
Show me where the piston goes
Can you get this thing to start?
Father talks big business with authority
He's the big boss, he knows the levels of consistency
Father knows how to read his morning paper
Tellin' me how he died to live, workin' hard labor
Me and my dad
Me and my dad
Me and my dad
We've got a good thing going
Father talks big business with authority
He's the big boss, he knows the levels of consistency
Father knows how to read his morning paper
He's tellin' me how he died to live, workin' hard labor
Me and my dad
Me and my dad
Me and my dad
We've got a good thing going
Me and my dad
Me and my dad
Me and my dad
We've got a good thing goingEmbed
