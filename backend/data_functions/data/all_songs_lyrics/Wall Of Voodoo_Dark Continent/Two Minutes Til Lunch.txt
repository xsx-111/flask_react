Two Minutes Til Lunch LyricsI was standing in line, I was biding my time
I was watchin' a clock on the wall
And it was two minutes til lunch, so I got good and ready
Just then I heard the telephone call
It was she, she told me not to worry
She told me, take life a little more in stride
Remember the books I bought-cha, but yaâ€”never really read 'em
You just don't remember much inside anymore
I was standing in line, I was biding my time
I was watchin' a clock on the wall
And it was two minutes til lunch, so I got good and ready
Just then I heard my foreman call
"Don't-touch-that-you'll-blow-this-place-up!"Embed
