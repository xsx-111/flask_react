Animal Day LyricsGrandma is a rhino
My brother is a dog
I can tell it's animal day
'Cause my best friend just turned into a frog
Bobby is a monkey
My girlfriend is a horse
But I'm not turning into anything
I never caused animal wars
Uh-oh
Growin' hair on my hands
I'd better run for the mirror
I'm an animal
It's animal day
It's animal day
It's animal day
It's animal day
Now the animals have cars
They're starting to run us over
Notches on the steering wheel
My pet is calling me Rover
Deers are hunting for humans
Seals keep crushing our heads
Animals bettin' on us at the track
My animal's in my bed
It's animal day
It's animal day
It's animal day
It's animal dayEmbed
