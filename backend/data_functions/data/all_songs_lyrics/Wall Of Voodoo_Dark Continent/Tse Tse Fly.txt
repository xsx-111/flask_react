Tse Tse Fly LyricsI was walking through the jungle, and I
Was looking for good business
Something to take away the risk
Break or bust or call it quits
See an object in the air
See an object touch my hair
I was walking through the jungle, and I
Was looking for good business
My energy is draining
Touching down on my arm
I'm feeling kinda sleepy now
I was bitten by a tse-tse fly
I was bitten by a tse-tse fly
I was walking through the jungle, and I
Was looking for good business
Gotta invest in insect bombs
No-pest strips and firearms
On the ticker tape came the note
'Tse-tse fly: no antidote'
I was walking through the jungle, and I
Was looking for good business
My energy is draining
Touching down on my arm
I'm feeling kinda sleepy now
I was bitten by a tse-tse fly
I was bitten by a tse-tse fly
I was bitten by a tse-tse fly
I was bitten by a tse-tse fly
Swat that fly!Embed
