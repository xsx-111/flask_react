Crack The Bell LyricsThanks a lot, thanks a whole lot
Lulu sends her friends
They cover their mouths with one hand
Well, I keep waiting here
Drifting around in a dark land
Envelope unturned
I push the stamp and stick it
And I know there's a bell to crack
And I know there's a bell to crack
I hear crosstalk now
Coming through the wire
One voice tells me yes
The other is a liar
And I know there's a bell to crack
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
Click-clack, joint, this thing is on my sleeve
All this mess around and I gotta clean it up
Okay, Mister Questions, you tell me, when are we gonna leave?
And can you design a heart–a heart that doesn't bleed?
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
See the bell, so I crack it
You just can't find good bells anymore!
Yeah, yeah, sure!
Tom Shane's a friend of mine!
I really like him—he's in the industry!
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crackEmbed
