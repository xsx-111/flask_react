Back In Flesh LyricsSomeone smashed my alarm
It's got me on the edge
You know it's so sharp
(Uhhhh...)
And you know I won't go, you know I won't go
I don't wanna go
(He won't go)
The corporation's boiling over
Everybody's taking over
And I'm back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
You better sign your time card now
They don't care about you anyhow
Sign in, your minimum cut
You're late again, your salary's cut!
Someone smashed my alarm
It's got me on the edge
You know it's so sharp
(Uhhhh...)
And you know I won't go, you know I won't go
I don't wanna go
(He won't go)
The corporation's boiling over
Everybody's taking over
And I'm back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
I won't go
(He won't go)
I don't wanna go
(You must go!)
Is it time to go?
(The orders are in!)
Well, I'd rather go bowling!
(The lanes are closed!)
Maybe a little tennis?
(Your racket's got a hole)
How about some baseball?
(Field's rained out)
Maybe a little fishing?
(The fish are on vacation)
Well, what about some golfing?
(The greens are overgrown)
Well, what about some swimming?
(I don't think so!)
Well, what about this, and that?
(No, no, no, no, no!)
Well, you can't tell me what to do!
You can't tell me what to do!
(Hey, fuck you!)Embed
