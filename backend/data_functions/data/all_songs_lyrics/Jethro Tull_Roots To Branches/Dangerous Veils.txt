Dangerous Veils LyricsDesert candle in a tented space
Throwing softer shadows on a covered face
Sister, silent to the likes of me --
Pay my respects to her propriety
Is this some crazy woman here
Dancing behind her thin black veil?
Am I misreading those mysterious eyes?
Duet impossible to harmonize
I'm not inviting any stiff reaction
I'm not one for naming holy names
And I won't peek behind those dangerous veils
Though you might hate me just the same
Name of the Father ringing in her head --
Thinking over what the prophet said
Words and tradition bind her in their spell
Don't drink the water from this holy well
I'm not inviting any fierce reaction
And I'm not one for naming holy names
I won't peek behind those dangerous veils
Though you might hate me just the same
Desert candle in a tented space
Softer shadows on a covered face
Sister, silent to the likes of me --
I tip my hat to her propriety
I'm not inviting any fierce reaction
And I'm not one for naming holy names
I won't peek behind those dangerous veils
Though you might hate me just the sameEmbed
