This Free Will LyricsShe peeled from a stretch black snake
Which slipped up to the hotel door
Darting looks from piercing eyes --
The stir of memory and then no more
Well, you know how I have to believe --
She can almost remember my name
It's been a long time coming, babe --
Long time loose amongst foreign hills --
Shaking my faith in this free will
Years ago in a coastal town
Mosquitoes buzzed in her hair
Schooldress torn and bare feet brown --
Then the rains came and she wasn't there
You're closing your doors on me
When you had almost remembered my name
It's been a long time coming, babe --
Long time loose amongst foreign hills --
Shaking my faith in this free will
Sharp points in an ink black sky --
Faint words collide, then are lost
I'll follow you beneath this dome --
Win you back at any cost
I know we were children then
But you can almost remember my name
It's been a long time coming, babe --
Long time loose amongst foreign hills --
Well, let's be children still --
Don't shake my faith in this free will
Don't shake my faith in this free willEmbed
