Valley LyricsWake hard in the morning
See the young girl milking
Stream rushing by on a bed of stone
Old goats and sandstone cracking --
All containing --
Squeezing that river like it squeeze your bones
In the long red, red valley people live here too long
In the long red, red valley they only sing the valley song
Some bad people living further down the valley
Not easy for us to do good trade
We got snowmelt, snowmelt sweet water
They got that valley road that they made
In the long red, red valley people dying here too long
In the long red, red valley they only sing the valley song
Holding hands on the hillside
Showing love to your brother --
Your sister and your mother --
But we hate those people down the valley
Has anybody seen Moses?
Get him off that mountain
Bring back the tablets of stone
It's a wise, wise prophet who keeps his own council
Yeah, leave the other man's wife alone
In the long red, red valley people live here too long
In the long red, red valley they only sing the valley song
Wake hard in the morning
See the young girl milking
Stream rushing by on a bed of stone
Old goats and sandstone cracking --
All containing --
Squeezing that river like it squeeze your bones
In the long red, red valley people living here too long
In the long red, red valley they only live the valley song
In the long red, red valley people dying here too long
In the long red, red valley they only know the valley songEmbed
