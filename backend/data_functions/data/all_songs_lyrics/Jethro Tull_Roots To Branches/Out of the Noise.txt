Out of the Noise LyricsGlued to the kerbstone, staring
Frozen at the stop-sign too
See that crazy suicide mongrel
He's going to try to cross that avenue
Old dog of experience
Ripping through the black and yellow cabs
Dodging rickshaws and the bicycle boys
He's got his mind on someone else's dinner --
Over the road, round the corner, out of the noise
Lives down in some cool, cool basement --
Sharing with a family of bouncy, ratty little guys
Works to a discipline of ritual undertakings --
Sleep, eat, and gentle exercise
Old dog of experience
Ripping through the black and yellow cabs
Dodging rickshaws and the bicycle boys
He's got his mind on someone else's dinner --
Over the road, round the corner, out of the noise
Some towns I know, he could end up in a restaurant --
Wrong side of a table for two
It's enough to send him running, running for cover
Back into traffic, what's a poor dog to do?
Old mutt of experience
Ripping through the black and yellow cabs
Dodging rickshaws and the bicycle boys
He's got his mind on someone else's dinner --
Over the road, round the corner, out of the noiseEmbed
