Wounded, Old and Treacherous LyricsA walk on the quiet side, late in the day --
Don't mean to get in anybody's way
The Gods seem willing: sun's in the sky
Old crows cawing as the straight crows fly
There was a time when love was the law
There was a time for the tooth and the claw
Last rites given, no holds barred
Heaven Express on my credit card
Now let me draw the jungle line --
I won't cross yours if you don't cross mine
Won't make trouble, I don't need no fuss
But I'm wounded, old and I'm treacherous
Allow me to draw the jungle line --
You cross it once, you cross some friends of mine
They won't make trouble, they don't need no fuss
But they're wounded, old and they're treacherous
In the crisp of evening, on sacred ground --
Ghosts of fathers pushing moonbeams round
Big cats prowling inside your head --
They left for China; better left for dead
Let me draw the jungle line --
I won't cross yours if you don't cross mine
Won't make trouble, I don't need no fuss
But I'm wounded, old and I'm treacherous
A walk on the quiet side, late in the day --
Don't mean to get in anybody's way
The Gods seem willing: sun's in the sky
Old crows cawing as the straight crows fly
There was a time when love was the law
There was a time for the tooth and the claw
Last rites given, no holds barred
Heaven Express on my credit card
Living mountains going to shake that town --
Big mother calling you from underground
She don't want trouble, she don't need no fuss
But she's wounded, old and treacherousEmbed
