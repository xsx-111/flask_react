Stuck in the August Rain LyricsBrings jasmine tea on a painted tray
And bends to kiss my frown away
But I'm still still stuck in the August rain;
Stuck out in the cloudburst once again
The cover's on, the coast is clear
We're all battened down, only us here
But I'm still still stuck in the August rain;
Stuck out in the cloudburst once again
She walks between the lines
And she can read my signs
Stuck out in the August rain:
Out in the cloudburst once again
Single-minded in my gloom
I appear to revel in this darkened room
But I'm still still stuck in the August rain;
Stuck out in the cloudburst once again
She walks between the lines
And she can read my signs
Stuck out in the August rain:
Out in the cloudburst once againEmbed
