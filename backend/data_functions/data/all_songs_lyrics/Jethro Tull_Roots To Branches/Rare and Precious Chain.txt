Rare and Precious Chain LyricsRare and precious chain
Do I have to tell you, tell you once again?
Under red lights, on soft nights, it all comes back to you
Rare and precious chain
Binds me to your soul round gently pulsing veins
Shackled tight, feel love's bite coming back to you
No gold of fools
No hostage taking
No engagement rules
To leave you forsaken
Tiny beads of sweat
Thin diamond glistening, glistening around your neck
Forgotten rooms, dark catacombs
They all come back to you
No crock of glittering prizes
No sharply worded telegram
No excuses for the word-weary
No excuses for who I am
It's a rare and precious chain
Around your neck I place it, place it once again
Drawn finger tight, feel love's bite coming back to you
Under red lights, on soft nights, it all comes back to you
