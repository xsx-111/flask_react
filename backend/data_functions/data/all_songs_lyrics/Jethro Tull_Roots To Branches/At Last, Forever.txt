At Last, Forever LyricsAt Last, Forever
So why are you holding my hand tonight?
I'm not intending to go far away
I'm just slipping through to the back room --
I'll leave you messages almost every day
And who was I to last forever?
I didn't promise to stay the pace
Not in this lifetime, babe
But we'll cling together:
Some kind of heaven written in your face
So why are you holding my hand tonight?
Well, am I feeling so cold to the touch?
Do my eyes seem to focus
On some distant point?
Why do I find it hard to talk too much?
And who was I to last forever?
I didn't promise to stay the pace
Not in this lifetime, babe
But we'll cling together:
Some kind of heaven written in your face
So why are you holding my hand tonight?
I'm not intending to go far away
I'm just slipping through to the back room --
I'll leave you messages almost every day
And who was I to last forever?
I didn't promise to stay the pace
Not in this lifetime, babe
But we'll cling together:
Some kind of heaven written in your faceEmbed
