To Have and to Hold (Spanish Taster) Lyrics
I need to be cleansed, it's time to make amends
For all of the fun, the damage is done
And I feel diseased, I'm down on my knees
And I need forgiveness, someone to bear witness
To the goodness within, beneath the sin
Although I may flirt with all kinds of dirtEmbed
