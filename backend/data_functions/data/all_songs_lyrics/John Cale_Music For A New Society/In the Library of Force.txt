In the Library of Force LyricsWe kill in the world
We live in it
We live in it
Then you smiled crawling as your houses were burning for God
Books crawl down from the shelves Read themselves to you Read themselves at you In the Library of Force
In the Library of Force
William the Conqueror flipping from the pages of History
Drink from the pages
Come the precious stones of guilt
The tracking of detention
Was lurking in the Souls of Man
From the Last Day of Language
Beaten
Bludgeoned
Ransacked
Stoned
The Written Word
The Written Word
Written Word
Commands to the Sky to Starve the Sky
And the crawling skin of GodEmbed
