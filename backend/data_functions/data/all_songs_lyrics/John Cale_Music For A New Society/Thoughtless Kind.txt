Thoughtless Kind LyricsWhen we grow tired of the friends we make
In case we mean to say something else
Say they were the best of times we ever had
The best of times were the thoughtless kind
We dress conservatively at the best of times
Prefer the shadows to the bright lights in the eyes
Of the ones we love
The bright lights in the eyes of the ones we love
What we see, what we imagine, the eyes tell us nothing
The bright lights in the eyes of the ones you love will tell us nothing
Like the scars of imagination
The scars of imagination
The bright lights in the eyes of the one you love will tell you nothing
Except that you're the thoughtless kind
So if you grow tired of the friends you make
Never, never turn your back on them
Say they were the best of times you ever had
The best of times were the thoughtless kind
The very best of times were the thoughtless kindEmbed
