Chinese Envoy LyricsShe was a princess, much lower than people thought
A master of nothing a mistress of something she thought
She could talk about things that never mattered ever
From one person's miserable life after another
She could talk to the French and Germans at will
They'd never listen ..they never will
The chinese envoy was here, the chinese envoy was here but left
The chinese envoy was here but left in his broken hearted pagoda
Calling out her name you'd be surprised at what came
Galloping out of the darkness just like furniture
We'd have lost it all if it hadn't been for Cardinal Richelieu
And all his courtiers
The chinese envoy was here, the chinese envoy was here but left
The chinese envoy was here but left in his broken hearted pagodaEmbed
