Loyalty Lyrics
They were both young
He believed in himself only
His oversize dickeys cinched up way high
She lived in her books and fantasies
They both searched for some sort of loyalty
When they made love, begged each other, just don't betray me

Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty
Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty

Her mothers heart had been shattered
Told her daughter to beware
Both secrets and dreams you should never share
Trust only in change 'cause hearts change
But betrayal always feels the same
But with him she found loyalty

Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty
Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty
'Cause like a child you will never want for love
'Cause all that I have, I give to you
(I give to you)
Come and take my hand
And share your life with me
'Cause you are my soul and I will always love you
(I'll always love you)

Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty
Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty

That's all I have worth going
(Come be with me)
With someone to know me
(Someone broke my heart)
Give my heart and my soul
(Show me loyalty)
Just love me
Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty
I'll be there for you
Right there for you
Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyalty
Come be with me
Soothe my achin', achin' heart
Show me loyalty
Come be with me
Soothe my broken heart
Show me loyaltyEmbed
