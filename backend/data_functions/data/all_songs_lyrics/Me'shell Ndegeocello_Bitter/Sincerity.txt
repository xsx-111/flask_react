Sincerity Lyrics
He loves
With sweetness and sincerity
While she can only pretend

He caresses her hair
(Thinks to himself) such a lovely face
Gives his entire self
(Shares his secrets)
But it's all in vain
His love for her drowns him
In a sea of denial
Her fear of being alone
Will it keep her there

He loves with sweetness and sincerity
While she may only pretend
He loves with sweetness and sincerity
While she may only pretend

The morning comes
(He reaches out) to feel her warmth
She pulls away
(He closes his eyes)
He's so ashamed
He's poor in all but truth
But what a fool is he
To wish for wine in her empty kiss
He loves with sweetness and sincerity
While she may only pretendEmbed
