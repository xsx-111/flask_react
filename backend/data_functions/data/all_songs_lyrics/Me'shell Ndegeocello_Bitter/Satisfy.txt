Satisfy LyricsOnly you satisfy me only you satisfy me
Only you
Only you satisfy me only you satisfy me
The rays of the sun greet my body
I am naked in your world
Come walk me through the garden
And fill me with your love
I've searched my whole life this life
For the reason that we cry
Just one kiss then I close my eyes
Only you satisfy me only you satisfy me
Only you
Only you satisfy me only you satisfy me
Alone I am never
I am but one of many
And you have so that I may see
Freedom amidst this mockery
I hold out my hand and touch heaven
Tear out my grieving heart
But you come and fill it with love
Only you satisfy me only you satisfy me
Only you
Only you satisfy me only you satisfy meEmbed
