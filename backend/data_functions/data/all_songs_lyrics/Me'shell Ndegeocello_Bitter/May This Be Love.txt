May This Be Love LyricsWaterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall
I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall
Some people say
Day-dreamings for all the, huh
Lazy minded fools
With nothin' else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
Just as long as I have you
Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfallEmbed
