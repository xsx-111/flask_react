Faithful Lyrics
My daddy made no excuse
I believe my lies are truth
Why won't you eat what you're fed
'Cause when I touch myself I think of only you
And when I touch someone else

No one is faithful
I am weak, I'll go astray
Forgive me for my ways
No one is faithful
No one is faithful
I am weak

I hear voices and I can't stand to be alone
'Cause emptiness is all I've ever known
Soiled by my lust I feel no shame
No longer forsaken when they call my name
Beautiful angels come to my bed
I am satisfied on their flesh I've fed

No one is faithful
I am weak, I'll go astray
Forgive me for my ways
No one is faithful
No one is faithful
I am weak
Forgive me for my ways
No one is faithful
No one is faithful
