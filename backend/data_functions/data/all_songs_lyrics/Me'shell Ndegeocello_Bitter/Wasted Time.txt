Wasted Time Lyrics
You rarely notice but I hang on your every word
Everything you say
You are much too busy to notice me
You turn and walk away
Into another's arms hopeless ashamed
I wish I could hold you that way
Brokenhearted I dream for you to notice me

Wasted time on loving you wasted time
Wasted time on someone
Who won't love you as much as I
As much as I as much as I as much as I

In my fantasy you are asleep beside me
I feel you breathe
If only I could be there for you
The one that you make love to

Wasted time on loving you wasted time
Wasted time on someone
Who won't love you as much as I
As much as I as much as I as much as I
In my fantasy you are asleep beside me
I feel you breathe
If only I could be there for you
The one that you make love to

Wasted time on loving you wasted time
Wasted time on someone
Who won't love you as much as I
As much as I as much as I as much as I

You rarely notice but I hang on your every word
Everything you say
You are much too busy to notice me
You turn and walk away
Into another's arms hopeless ashamed
I wish I could hold you that way
Brokenhearted I dream for you to notice meEmbed
