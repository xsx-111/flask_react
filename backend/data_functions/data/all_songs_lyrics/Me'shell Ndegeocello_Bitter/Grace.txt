Grace LyricsCan't say I have ever been faithful
Except to God
Never felt I could call anywhere home
Till I fell asleep here in your arms
I never thought I'd fall in love
Your love is my only saving grace
You caress my heart
Kiss my face
Your love is my only saving grace
Sometimes God calls out to me to come home
'Cause I feel so alone
Then I taste your kiss
Your touch your sweet love
I never thought I'd fall in love
Your love is my only saving grace
You caress my heart
Kiss my face
Your love is my only saving grace
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Your love is my only saving grace
You caress my heart
Kiss my face
Your love is my only saving grace your loveEmbed
