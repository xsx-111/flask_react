Songs of Farewell and Departure Lyrics
Before we steam and send, steady to the sun
A simple tale of woe, your hearts will be undone
A love song to everyone I know
Arms wide open, here we go

She weaves a trail of petals through the embryonic ice
Her hair is warm to the touch, her flowers twice as nice
And if he stands on the moon, he can barely catch her eyes
Always open to the sky

And so we land, only to find we never left the ground
Please leave the walls and the floors exactly as you found
A love song to everyone I know
Arms wide open, here we go

Here we go
Here we go
Here we goEmbed
