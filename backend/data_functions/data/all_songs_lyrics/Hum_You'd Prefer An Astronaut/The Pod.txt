The Pod LyricsMorning scatters in and I am steady like a drug
Feeling out this one
She wakes up smashed as hell and steadies her ass against the rail
And bends before the pounding rain
She had the widest bright ideas all along about my love
And I need this fucking fix and I beg her to pick from
One of a million ways to feel no pain
The morning after bends reflected in and I can hardly stand
The way this whole thing makes me seem
She climbs out from a dream with lungs hardening
She screams a stereo scream
And bends before astounding rain
She's got a system made of metal with magnet bits inside her brain
She opens her box of tricks and begs me to pick from
One of a billion ways to feel no pain
She had the widest bright ideas
That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends
Everyone is on
Wait
Wait on the end
Hold me uptight, let me breathe now
She had the widest bright ideas
That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends
Everyone is on
Wait
Wait on the end
Hold me upright, let me breathe now2Embed
