Stars Lyrics
She thinks she missed the train to Mars
She's out back counting stars
She thinks she missed the train to Mars
She's out back counting stars

She's not at work, she's not at school, she's not in bed
I think I finally broke her
I bring her home everything I want, and nothing that she needs

I thought she'd be there holding daisies
She always waits for me
She thinks she missed the train to Mars
She's out back counting stars

I found her out back, sitting naked
Looking up and looking dead
A crumpled yellow piece of paper, with seven nines and tens

I thought she'd be there holding daisies
She always waits for me
She thinks she missed the train to Mars
She's out back counting stars

I thought you'd be there holding daisies
You always wait for me
She thinks she missed the train to Mars
She's out back counting stars2Embed
