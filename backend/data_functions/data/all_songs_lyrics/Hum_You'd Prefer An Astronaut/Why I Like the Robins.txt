Why I Like the Robins LyricsThe distance outside of you comes into focus
Collapses away lovingly
And hands to the glass and eyes to sky
Glued to the south, she waits to see
She's looking for birds she met last fall
Who said they would come back different than all
She's waiting for six who know about sound
Who'd promised to come back upside-down
And I like your raindrop collector
Splash in my eyes and makes everything else look like you
So hand me the glasses and teach me to use them
Show me the window
I want to look too
I'll take the glasses and cover for you
You get some sleep and I'll stay 'til two
I'm looking for six who know about sound
Who promise to come back upside-down
She's got colors to spare and I don't care what they choose
I've got nothing to do and nothing like you left to lose
She's got colors to spare and I don't care what they choose
I've got nothing to do and nothing like you left to lose
She's got colors to spare and I don't care what they choose
I've got nothing to do and nothing like you left to lose
She's got colors to spare and I don't care what they chooseEmbed
