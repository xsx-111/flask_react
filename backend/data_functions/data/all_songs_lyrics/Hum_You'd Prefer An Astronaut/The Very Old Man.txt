The Very Old Man LyricsIt's eerie and it's awesome
How connected two pods scattered on the surface can become
Lazy into one
He knows lightning kills the other
She can't stand to watch his petals fall
It's better when cascades become like us all
After noon, a golden disengagement leaves a woman with a household left to fill
Sit and be still
Send the voltage 'cross his ticker
Watch the stars, they start to flicker
And one by one, the levels fall
Another drink, my love, and make it tall enough
So I can stand on it and see
All you've done for me
A world of curves and lines electric
Remember how you strung the colored lights
From Christmas tree to meEmbed
