Suicide Machine Lyrics
Sleep comes to everyone
While we wait for the Sunday afternoons
Sleep comes to everyone
Everyone, baby, yeah
But you

Sleep comes to everyone
While we wait, wide awake and blue
Sleep comes to everyone
Everyone, baby, yeah
But me and you

And so I give myself away
To everybody every day
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do

And so I give myself away
To everybody every day
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do
Sleep comes to everyone
While we wait for the Sunday afternoons
And sleep comes to everyone
Everyone, baby, yeah
But you

And I had this one figured out
That's why the suicide machine is built for two
A simple, sick device devised to overload on love
To bring us colored dreams and soundtracked waves of fun

And so I give myself away
To everybody every day
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do

And so I give myself away
To everybody every day
And so I give myself to you
And you need it more than I do

Sleep comes to no one else
Like we have, falling through the ground
Fulfilling promises of endless summer nights
I'm losing ground, you're losing sound
Somewhere through a thousand blues
A dragonfly descends with just a whisper
I'm lonelier than God
And all my wishes spin the fishes in the air
And everyone a different shade of you

And to the left where up is down
Now stands a zebra made of shapes of me and silver and the sun
So bring no guilt with you up above the flatline
Let's just hit the sky, exploding into one2Embed
