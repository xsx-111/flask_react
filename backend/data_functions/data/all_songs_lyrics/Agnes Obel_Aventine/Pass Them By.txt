Pass Them By LyricsWe come together, here we go
Around the fire, here we go
Flaming higher, here we go
To my surprise a fever grows
Lamps will glimmer on the gloom
On the light in the room
As we fill it to the brim
We say the words we take them in
Oh how the hills were laughing
Oh how the creeks they cried
Oh how the grass would cheer on
As we passed them by
Room for many, room for few
Here in the dark I made for you
Oh why do I hear you and believe
That we come together to make it sweet
Oh how the hills were laughing
Oh how the creeks they cried
Oh how the grass would cheer on
As we passed them byEmbed
