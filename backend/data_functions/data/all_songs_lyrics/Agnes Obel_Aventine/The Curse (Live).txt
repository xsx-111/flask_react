The Curse (Live) LyricsAnd the people went into their hide, they oh
From the start they didn't know exactly why, why
Winter came and made it so, all look alike, look alike
Underneath the grass would grow, aiming at the sky
It was swift, it was just another wave of a miracle
But no one, nothing at all would go for the kill
If they called on every soul in the land, on the moon
Only then would they know a blessing in disguise
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
Tell me now of the very souls that look alike, look alike
Do you know the stranglehold covering their eyes?
If I call on every soul in the land, on the moon
Tell me if I'll ever know a blessing in disguise
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like before
The curse ruled from the underground down by the shore
And their hope grew with a hunger to live like beforeEmbed
