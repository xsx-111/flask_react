Words Are Dead (Live) LyricsWanna buy you roses
'Cause words are dead
Following the blindness
On the arrowhead
Those words are dead
You know it
For those words are dead
Lower them down
Didn't know if you could
Deny the dead
Leave you in silence
On a moldy bed
Oh, I am numb
And over
Their kingdom come
Lower me down
They are dead
They are dead
Oh, don't cry for me
Oh, don't cry for me
Oh, don't cry for me
Oh, don't you cry for me
Lower them down
In the ground
Lower them down
In the ground
Lower them down
In the ground
Lower them down
In the groundEmbed
