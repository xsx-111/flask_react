My Ideal LyricsLong ago my heart and mind
Got together and designed
The wonderful girl for me
Oh what a fantasy
Though the ideal of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy
Will I ever find the girl in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe she's a dream and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me
Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she was my ideal?
(Instrumental solos)
Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my ideal?Embed
