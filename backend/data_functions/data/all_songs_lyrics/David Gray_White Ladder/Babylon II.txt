Babylon II LyricsFriday night, I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool, to open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule
If you want it, come and get it
For crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was never in doubt
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Babylon, Babylon
Saturday, I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowds I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream
I only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid, to show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made
If you want it, come and get it
For crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was never in doubt
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
Babylon, BabylonEmbed
