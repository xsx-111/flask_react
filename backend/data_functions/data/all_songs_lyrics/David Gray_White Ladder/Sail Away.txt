Sail Away Lyrics
Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be, will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now

Crazy skies all wild above me now
Winter howling at my face
And everything I held so dear
Disappeared without a trace
Oh all the times I've tasted love
Never knew quite what I had
Little Darling, if you hear me now
Never needed you so bad
Spinning round inside my head

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now
I've been talking drunken gibberish
Falling in and out of the bars
Trying to find some explanation here
For the way some people are
How did it ever come so far?

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now
Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now
