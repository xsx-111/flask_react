White Ladder LyricsWhite ladder
Water and wine
Forever crying all the time
Don't wanna feel tonight
There's no rhyme or reason to life
This sweet life
White river
Thunder and war
How many time oh no
Don't wanna feel no more
There's no rhyme or reason to love
This sweet, sweet love
To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another valentine
A burning flame
To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another valentine
A burning flame
Tall order, tremble and sigh
Forever crying
Oh my
Don’t wanna feel tonight
There’s no rhyme or reason to love
This sweet, sweet love
To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another valentine
A burning flame
To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another valentine
A burning flame
To the night another body
To the night another name
To the another valentine
A burning flame
White ladder
Water and wine
Don't wanna feel tonightEmbed
