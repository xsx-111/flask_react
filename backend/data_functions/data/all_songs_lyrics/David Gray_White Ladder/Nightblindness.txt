Nightblindness LyricsA million to one outsiders
Night blindness
Can't see your bright eyes - or what the time is
Twenty five past eternity
Here listening to the sirens
Coming closer, now further away
What we gonna do when the money runs out?
I wish that there was something left to say
Where we gonna find the eyes to see a brighter day?
I'm sick of all the same old answers
Last chances, cold stones
Propping mountains up on matchsticks
Dragging baskets full of bones
And honey please don't stop your talking
'Cause there's a feeling won't leave me alone
What we gonna do when the money runs out?
I wish that there was something I could say
How we gonna find the eyes to see a brighter day?
What we gonna do when the money runs out?
I wish that there was something left to say
How we gonna find the eyes to see a brighter day
A brighter day
A brighter dayEmbed
