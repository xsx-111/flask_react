Say Hello Wave Goodbye LyricsStandin' at the door of the pink Flamingo cryin' in the rain
It was a kind of so-so love and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again
You and I had to be the standing joke of the year
You were a run-around, a lost and found and not for me I feel
Take your hands off me, hey
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face, for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
We tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt and me in a suit but it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less, and now your life's a mess, so insecure you see
I put up with all the scenes, this is one scene that's goin' to be played my way
Take your hands off me, hey
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face, for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Under the deep red light I can see the make-up slidin' down
Well hey little girl you will always make up so take off that unbecoming frown
As for me, well I'll find someone who's not goin' cheap in the sales
A nice little housewife, who'll give me a steady life and not keep going off the rails
Take your hands off me, hey
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face, for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye
Goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
We were born before the waves
Who are we to understand
We were born before the waves
Say goodbye
Through the rain, hail, sleet and snow
Say goodbye
Get on the train, train, train
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
In the wind and the rain now, darling
Say goodbye
In the wind and the rain now, darlingEmbed
