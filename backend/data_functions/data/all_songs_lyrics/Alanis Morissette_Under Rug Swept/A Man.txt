A Man Lyrics
I am a man, as a man I've been told
Bacon is brought to the house in this mold
Born of your bellies, I yearn for the cord
Years I have groveled, repentance ignored

And I have been blamed
And I have repented
I'm working my way toward our union mended

I am man who has grown from a son
Been crucified by enraged women
I am a son who was raised by such men
I'm often reminded of the fools I'm among

And I have been shamed
And I have relented
I'm working my way toward our union mended
And I have been shamed
And I have repented
I'm working my way toward our union mended

We don't fare well with endless reprimands
And we don't do well with a life served as a sentence
And this won't work well if you're hell bent on your offense
'Cause I am a man who understands your reticence
I am a man who still does what he can
To dispel our archaic reputation
I am a man who has heard all he can
'Cause I don't fare well with endless punishment

'Cause I have been blamed
And I have repented
I'm working my way toward our union mended
And we have been blamed
And we have repented
I'm working my way toward our union mended

We don't fare well with endless reprimands
And we don't do well with a life served as a sentence
And this won't work well if you're hell bent on your offense
'cause I am a man who understands your reticence1Embed
