So Unsexy Lyrics
All these little rejections, how they add up quickly
One small sideways look and I feel so ungood
And somewhere along the way, I think I gave you the power to make
Me feel the way I thought only my father could
All these little rejections, how they seem so real to me
One forgotten birthday, I'm all but cooked
And how these little abandonments seem to sting so easily
I'm 13 again, am I 13 for good?

I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved and for someone so fine
I can feel so boring for someone so interesting
So ignorant for someone of sound mind

All these little protections, how they fail to serve me
One forgotten phone call and I'm deflated
And all these little defenses, how they fail to comfort me
Your hand pulling away and I'm devastated

I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved and for someone so fine
I can feel so boring for someone so interesting
So ignorant for someone of sound mind
When will you stop leaving, baby?
When will I stop deserting, baby?
When will I start staying with myself?

All these little projections, how they keep springing from me
I jump my ship as I take it personally
And all these little rejections, how they disappear quickly
The moment I decide not to abandon me

I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved and for someone so fine
I can feel so boring for someone so interesting
So ignorant for someone of sound mind
I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved and for someone so fine
I can feel so boring for someone so interesting
So ignorant for someone of sound mind1Embed
