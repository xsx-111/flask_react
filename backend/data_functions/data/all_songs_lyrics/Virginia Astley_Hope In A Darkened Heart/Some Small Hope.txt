Some Small Hope LyricsAll those dreams lie unfulfilled
All those lives that pass us by
Careless thoughts torment my lonely soul
But my trust is still pure
Why must all the days be dark?
Can no one escape their fears?
Could we ever feel such a sad despair
With just one small hope?
Like a corpse deep in the earth
I'm so alone
Restless thoughts torment my soul
As fears, they lay confirmed
But my life has always been this way
Breathing in these perfect hours
My regrets still try to drown me
Soon the past will be just an emptiness
Far away
Now you've gone
Time will pass
Friends will leave
Close my eyes
Far away
Some small hope
Far away
Now you've gone
Time will pass
Friends will leave
I'll close my eyes
Far awayEmbed
