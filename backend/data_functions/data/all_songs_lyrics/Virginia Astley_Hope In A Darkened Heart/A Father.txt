A Father LyricsYou've run away
And never, no, never
Shall I see you again
But will haunt you forever
In your sleep
In your dreams
We'll always be there
You'll be far away
But we'll always care
Should you return
Which you won't, so there's no use
In saying these words
Should you think of it, please know this
That a father isn't blood
That a father is love
And if you've no love in you
There's no place here for you
To run to when you're lonely
And scared and alone
There's no place herе for someone
Who has no heart in him
Rеlationships
Are not born, they are formed
Through days that are bad
In all of the storms
The smiles and the laughter
The love through the years
Rows and the fights
Then all of the tears
But an unknown man, a lying trickster
Has no place in my heart
No place in hers too
For a father isn't blood
For a father is love
And if you've no love in you
There's no place here for you
You've run away
And never, no, never
Shall I see you again
But will haunt you forever
In your sleep, in your dreams
We'll always be there
You'll be far away
But we'll always care
Far, far away
No guilt will you feel
I love you still
I set this sealEmbed
