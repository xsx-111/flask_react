So Like Dorian LyricsI've seen through your mask
Your mask of deceit
I've seen behind your eyes
So blue but so cold
I've seen into your soul
And I know it's been sold
I've heard all your lies
Your boring tall tales
I've tasted your tongue
Like a worm from the grave
Had you inside me
Then like a rock beside me
Like Dorian Gray
Like a mask at a ball
Like a lying government
You're no good at all
Poor Paul, your friends say
As you twist and use them
Poor Paul, they say
As you still abuse them
Everyone loves you
Thinks you're so sweet
Your sorrowful facе
And turned-out feet
Poor Paul, your friends say
As you twist and use thеm
Poor Paul, they say
As you still abuse them
I've seen through your mask
Your mask of deceit
I've seen behind your eyes
So blue but so cold
I've seen into your soul
And I know it's been sold
I've seen through your mask
Your mask of deceit
I've seen behind your eyes
So blue but so cold
I've seen into your soul
And I know it's been soldEmbed
