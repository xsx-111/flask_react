Darkness Has Reached Its End LyricsThe gentle, quietly, they go
The tender, kind and the bold
The child, the child, he has grown
What was warm now lies cold
And hope hides in the heart
No man can learn their song
As clear as this evening light
With eternal hope, you long
But faith and truth and love and strength
Once dwelt within your soul
And rivers run as crystal falls
And who is able to stand?
Standing alone
Your heart's as cold as ice
Your hand is shielding the light
As you search for the meaning of life
And light shall shine from the stars
And rain will fall on this Earth
And sorrow shall pour in my heart
As the flowers appear on Earth
The darkness has reached its end, I'm told
And love is stronger than hate
Iron, it rusts as stone decays
And force shall always
Wipe away the tears from your eyes
For love is stronger than
I have hurt my friends, I know
And who shall catch their fall?
Faithful and true
Hope, pure as crystal
And sorrow shall pour from my heart
As the flowers appear on Earth
And light shall shine from the stars
And rain will fall on this Earth
To you wherever you are
Our love is stronger through pain
And light shall shine from the stars
And rain will fall on this Earth
And sorrow shall pour in my heart
As the flowers appear on Earth
And light shall shine from the stars
And rain will fall on this Earth
To you wherever you are
Our love is stronger through pain
So hope, faithful and true
So pure, clear as crystal
And sorrow shall pour from my heart
As the flowers appear on EarthEmbed
