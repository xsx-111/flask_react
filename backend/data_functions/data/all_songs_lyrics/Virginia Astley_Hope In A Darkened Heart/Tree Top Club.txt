Tree Top Club LyricsThe tree is bent
And the trunk now twisted
The tiny saplings
That we once planted
Oh, do you remember the tree top club
When you won the Bunty competition?
And there was a cold stone seat
And a blue, cold sky
My bike was green
And yours was brown
Nana bought us sweets and comics
From the motorway shop
And you know I lie
This pure indulgent fantasy
With a baby's mind
I crave for love
But this adult sensibility
Lets me stray
And I compromise
My life is always compromise
Oh, tell me why
It's all a senseless lie
The church is ruined
And the graves are deserted
Those hiding places
That we once haunted
Do you remember the old Scout Hut
When we hid in Dermoor's shed?
And you know I lie
This pure indulgent fantasy
With a baby's mind
I crave for love
But this adult sensibility
Lets me stray
And I compromise
My life is always compromise
Oh, tell me why
It's all a senseless lie
And you know I lie
This pure indulgent fantasy
Knowing now it's a dangerous thing
But this adult sensibility
Leads us astray
And you realised
Your thoughts are a long way away
And they prophesy
That man lives a hopeless lieEmbed
