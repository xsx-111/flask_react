Charm LyricsJust when you thought it was all worked out
When all the lessons were learnt
Mistakes were all paid for
Just when you thought that the time was right
For your great love
Someone arrived who stole all of your breath away
And charm diffused his charm upon your body
Magic had put lightness into your heart once again
Just when you thought it was all worked out
When all the lessons were learnt
Mistakes were all paid for
Just when you thought that the time was right
For your great love
Someone arrived who stole all of your breath away
And charm diffused his charm upon your body
Magic had put lightness into your heart once again
A false love bred which was always deceitful
It's not the first time that lies were sworn as truth
Time will heal all things, pain will fade away
Someone arrived who stole all of your breath away
And charm diffused his charm upon your body
Magic had put lightness into your heart once again
Someone arrived who stole all of your breath away
And charm diffused his charm upon your body
Magic had put lightness into your heart once again
Someone arrived who stole all of your breath away
And charm diffused his charm upon your body
Magic had put lightness into your heart once againEmbed
