Le Song (A Day, A Night) LyricsSilently, the rain is falling on the window
The thunder cracks in a crescendo
The winter evening light is gently failing
The day has come to end
Now it's nightfall
The stars in the sky
Finally, the morning comes to us, still sleeping
A crack of light shines in, and peeping
Through the old dusty blinds, you see a street
Which at this early hour still smells so street
And children leave their homes together
With coats and hats for rainy weather
Can life like this go on forever?
A simple life, a simple pleasure
Now it is daybreak
The sun rises slowly
Silently, the rain is falling on the window
The thunder cracks in a crescendo
The winter evening light is gently failing
The day has come to end
Now it's nightfall
The stars in the sky
Now it is daybreak
The sun rises slowlyEmbed
