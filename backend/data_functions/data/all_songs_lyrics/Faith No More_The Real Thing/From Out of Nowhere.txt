From Out of Nowhere Lyrics
Tossed into my mind
Stirring the calm
You splash me with beauty
And pull me down

'Cause you come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare

Obsession rules me
I'm yours from the start
I know you see me
Our eyes interlock

'Cause you come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare

One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave good-bye...
Sifting to the bottom
Every day for two
All energy funnels
All becomes you

'Cause you come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare

One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And it hurts inside
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave good-bye...
