Candy Lyrics
Candy, it's been really nice
But I've got to go
'Cause I can't be
The part of your life you don't want to know

And I can't keep lying all the time
And I know you'll find a better man
They're all too easy to find
And I'll just go away somewhere
And slowly lose my mind

Candy, they called you a baby
They called you a whore
And I can't see the light at the end
For you anymore

And I can't keep lying all the time
And I know you'll find a better man
They're all too easy to find
And I'll just go away somewhere
And slowly lose my mind
Candy, I can't be the man
They want me to be
Maybe it was only with you
That I could be me

And I can't keep lying all the time
And I know you'll find a better man
They're all too easy to find
And I'll just go away somewhere
And slowly lose my mind
I'll just go away somewhere
And slowly lose my mindEmbed
