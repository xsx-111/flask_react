Summer Lies Lyrics
We used to dance
Like it was going out of style
When you loved me for a while
And I remember every word you ever said, every kiss
We used to sing
All the oldest songs we knew
But the words were never true
For you, or was it all a game of solitaire played in the dark?

All the sweetest things you said
And I believed were summer lies
Hanging in the willow trees
Like the dead, were summer lies
I'll never fall in love again

I whispered, too
But the things I said were true
And I gave up my whole world
For you, I gave you all the best years of my life
And half the worst
And now you're gone
I pine and wane, pale and wan
Never knowing when it's dawn
Curtains drawn, hiding in my room wasting away, cutting myself
All the sweetest things you said
And I believed were summer lies
Hanging in the willow trees
Like the dead, were summer lies
I'll never fall in love againEmbed
