The Glory of Love LyricsYou've got to laugh a little, cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love
You've got to live a little and cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love
You've got to give a little, take a little
Sometimes let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love
Now as long as there's just the two of us
Don't need nobody to moan
As long as there's just two of us
And we're lying right down here on our own
You've got to laugh a little and cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that is the glory of love
You've got to live a little and give a little
Sometimes let yourself live a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love
Now as long as there's just two of us
We don't need the world and it's charms
Now as long as there's just two of us
And we've got each other's arms
You've got to laugh a little and cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love
You've got to give a little and take a little
Sometimes let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, and that's the real glory of loveEmbed
