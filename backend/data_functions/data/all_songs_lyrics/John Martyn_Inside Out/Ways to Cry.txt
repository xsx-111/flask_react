Ways to Cry LyricsIf I ever took another woman
I was in my need for you
If I ever took another woman
I was bleeding for you
Every day is another day to fly
And every day is another way to cry
I get so low in this life I'm leading
I can't tell right from wrong
I get so deep in this book I'm reading
I don't know the facts from a song
But every day is another day to cry
And every day is another way to fly
If I ever took another woman
I was screaming for you
If I ever took another woman
I was dreaming of you
And I won't beg, but I will have to try
To stop you if you tried to say goodbye
If I ever took another woman
I was trying for you
If I ever took another woman
I was crying for you
Cause every day is another day to cry
And every day is another way to fly
No little boy left, no little boy left
No little boy...Embed
