So Much in Love with You LyricsThe second time that I saw you
I knew you had to be the one for me
Now that you have got so deep inside me
That even a fool like me can see
That I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't sleep without you near
I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't seem to see it clear without you
Well you move like I always knew you
When we let our bodies groove
When I hold you down gently baby
I've got nothing in the world to prove
'Cause I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't seem to get it clear
I'm just so much in love with you baby
Getting very tired of crying
Though I'm laughing from the inside out
Need your easiness around me
Need you to tell me what it's all about
'Cause I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't seem to see it clear
I'm just so much in love with you baby
I can't seem to make it here without youEmbed
