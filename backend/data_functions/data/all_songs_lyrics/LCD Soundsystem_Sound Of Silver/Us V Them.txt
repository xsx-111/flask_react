Us V Them Lyrics
The time has come, the time has come
The time has come today
The time has come, the time has come
The time has come today (Bells!)


The time has come, the time has come
The time has come today
The time has come, the time has come
The time has come today

And so all the good people want rescue
(The time has come, the time has come)
All the smart people wanna talk to you and
(The time has come today)
All the clever people wanna tell you that
(The time has come, the time has come)
All the little people wanna dance, it's true
(The time has come today)

The time has come, the time has come
The time has come, the time has come
The time has come, the time has come
The time has come, the time has come
To shâ€”
Oh!

The time has come, the time has come
The time has come today
The time has come, the time has come
The time has come today

And so all the good people want rescue
(The time has come, the time has come)
From all the smart people who wanna talk to you
(The time has come today)
And all the clever people wanna tell you
(The time has come, the time has come)
That all the little people wanna dance, it's true
(The time has come today)

Cloud, block out the sun
Over me, over me
And spoil, spoil all the fun
Won't you, please?

Cloud, block out the sun
Over me, over me
And spoil, spoil all the fun
Won't you, please?

If you please, please anyone
Talk to me, talk to me
All you boys, lonely and drunk
On your knees

Us and them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over and over again

Because all the good people want rescue
(Us and them, over and over again)
All the smart people wanna talk to you
And all the clever people wanna tell you
(Us and them, over and over again)
That all the little people wanna dance, it's true
So it's us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over and over and over
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over and over and over

All the good people want to rescue
(Us and them)
All the smart people wanna talk to you
(Over and over again)
All the clever people wanna tell you
(Us and them)
That all the little people wanna dance, it's true
(Over and over again)

It's just us and them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us v. them
Over and over again
Us and them
Over and over again1Embed
