Left Hand Path LyricsI am my own God
Master slave and I will be beyond the grave
No one will take my soul away
I carry my own will and make my day
I am my own God
See the truth beyond
Through endless lies thy kingdom come
Glorified wisdom illumination tool
Self deceit it's the golden rule
Live your life you're gonna die your own death
There's no one above that's gonna take your breath
May the evil drown in its source
I dip my forefinger in the watery blood
Of your impotent redeemer
And write over his thorn torn brow
The true Prince of Evil
What man's created
Man can destroy
Bring to light
That day of joy2Embed
