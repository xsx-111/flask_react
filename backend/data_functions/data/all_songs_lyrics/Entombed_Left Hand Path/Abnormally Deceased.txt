Abnormally Deceased LyricsA tumor of mold
Inherits you inside
Spreads in you
Soon to putrefy
Convulsion sets in
Relentless aggrieve
Stench of decay
Starts possessing visibility
Putrid stench
?
Infected body
Slowly putrefies
Heading for death
Flesh turns out to be mold
About these symptoms
You were never told
Decomposed to shreds
Bodily debris
Coagulated blood, molded flesh
Surrounded by disease
Recently died
But limbs are moving anyway
Thoughts have ceased
But you scream in hysterical rageEmbed
