The Truth Beyond LyricsPeople put to death in the name of God
And blood run red in an eternal flood
The word has been spread - Throughout the centuries
Millions of corpses lying in the cemeteries
Reek of Christianity
Down of obscuration
The birth of insanity
And death to liberation
Lord of evolution
Enslavement emperor
Root of all evil
It is the holy terror
God the almighty - The creator of Earth
Devote your life to this holy writ - The key to your rebirth
And if you've been a believer of justice and brave
So what! It shall be written on your grave
The bell summon its slaves to mass
In the darkest hour
To devour the body of Christ
The blood feast shall increase their power
Chalices filled to the edge with blood
Drawn from holy veins
Tearing his stomach open
And revel in the shredded remains
Smell the putrid stench
Of the godblessed crucifixion
And discover the lies
There is no resurrection
Get your eyes open wide
And discover the lies
See the truth beyond
The shadows of a false paradise!Embed
