But Life Goes On LyricsA rotten stench
Surrounds another ended life
Maggots infesting the rotten flesh
Is that the way you want to die?
Decomposed
Don't want to live in a decaying shell
But why should I go to heaven
And who's to say I'll enter hell
Dead - Deceased, but life goes on
I will be the one who won
My charred body will decay
But my soul will be floating anyway
Visually a corpse
But what's inside my head
Don't consider I once was deceased
So I guess I'll come back from the dead
Dying my death
In relentless aggrieve
Dead and put down in a wooden box
Just can't be my destiny
Dead - Deceased, but life goes on
I will be the one who won
Continue to seek and you will see
That life is your worst enemyEmbed
