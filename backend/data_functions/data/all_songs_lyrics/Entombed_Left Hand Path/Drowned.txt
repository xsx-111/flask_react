Drowned LyricsAs the claws of dark spellbind me
And the light of the moon fills my eyes
I feel the presence even stronger
My invocation closer to rise
Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Living in decay
Between the gates and then into the maze
Who was I to know
That I would be on my way to an early grave
They have taken my body
And control of the mental where there is no memories
They darkened the thoughts of the mind
I remember the times I wanted to travel beyond
I am the reason why it has been its good and its bad
They left me now
To shiver and cry like a child
They left me in humiliation
Unknowing, unknown where or when is to die
By the dark and mighty waters
I'm standing here alone
To hear and suffer my sentence
To pay the price I owe
I'm drowned
Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Living in decay
Burning their teeth into my skin and my flesh
Into the maze of the ultimate judgment
I wish for only deathEmbed
