Carnal Leftovers LyricsYou remember when he stuck
That hair curler up
Her wet and juicy hair pie
He was laughing like hell
While she was screaming in pain
It was the way he wanted her to die
Carnal leftovers on the floor
If you had come a little earlier
You would have seen some gore
He's staring down
He took her breath
Leaving a carnal stench behind
He'll be curious to search for clues
Carnal leftovers. The only thing to find
Carnal leftovers on the floor
If you had come a little earlier
You would have seen some gore
He's staring down
He took her breath
Leaving a carnal stench behind
He'll be curious to search for clues
Carnal leftovers. The only thing to findEmbed
