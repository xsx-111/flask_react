Revel in Flesh LyricsAs your eyes are filled with horror
I lift up the corpse on the bench
You can't avoid the dismal sight
Its arms and legs I retrench
Excavating its interior
To get ahold of what's inside
And as I drivel and belch
You feel so damn reviled
I continue with laugther
I drink the bowel's rheum
Squeezing my hand through its mouth and further
Through its stomach to its womb
Of its once called body
There seems nothing to be left
And you better prepare yourself
For an equaling death
Revel in flesh
Pools of coagulated blood
And rotten flesh by my side
Now I really need something more
To kill another day in my lifeEmbed
