Short Movie LyricsI am paying for my mistake
That's okay
I don't mind a little pain
It's a short fucking movie, man
I know
I won't try and take it slow
Bottled water, called a drought
Come on, what's that about
Keep me sick to make me well
Come on, what the hell
I got up in the world today
Wondered who it was I could save
Who do you think you are?
Just a girl
That can play guitar
I think I could get away with
Saying only half what I say
No, I can't give you up
Oh no, I'm not gonna stop
But they know
But they'll never know why
They know
But they'll never know why
I don't know what we're afraid of
No, I don't mind
Oh no, I don't mind
If I fall in love to the sound of birds
On the wing
Then kids, I'm laughing
They know
But they'll never know why
They know
But they'll never know why
They know that I loved you
But they don't know why
They know that I loved you
But they'll never know why
Kicking off, it's kicking off
Now it's short fucking movie, man
It's a short fucking movie, man
It's a short fucking movie, man
It's a short fucking movie, man
I know
I will try and take it slow
I know
I'm gonna try and take it slow1Embed
