Easy LyricsYou fell asleep listening to me linger on
About how it used to be
In the backseat
When we were young
When we were young 
My oldest friend
You know me then
You know me now
How did I get lost
Looking for God in Santa Cruz?
Where you go to lose your mind
Well I went too far this time
When we were young
When we were young we belonged to someone
And that was easy
I’ve got us lost so I’ve turned us off in Joshua Tree
You’re my oldest friend so I know you then and you know me
It was a bit too high for me
I spent a month thinking I was a high desert tree
When we were young
When we were young we belonged to someone and that was easy
Well you can't be lost if you’re not on your own
Well you can’t be found if you’re not all alone
Well you can't get lost if you’re not on your own
Well you can’t be found if you’re not all alone
When we were young
When we were young we belonged to someone and that was easyEmbed
