Howl LyricsWe expect dawn around morning
I trust the rise of the sun
I’ve been up late with the night birds
Begging the dawn not to come
Begging the dawn not to come
Oh, how I don’t want to leave you
So much I can’t hardly bear
I have things I must tend to
Will you stay as you are, lying there?
Would you stay as you are, lying there?
Kissing the rain off my shoulders
Answering questions with stares
Holding my chest like I’m a wild horse
About to run away scared
About to run away scared
Sun kicks the moon off the mountain
That is my cue to leave
The long tears of women are silent, so they don’t wake those who sleep
So they don’t wake those who sleep
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon, I’ll come find you
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon, I’ll come find you
I’ll come get you
Hope that you haven’t changed your mind
I’ll come get you
Hope that you haven’t changed your mind, baby
Be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mineEmbed
