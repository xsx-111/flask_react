Strange LyricsI know you love your children
I know you love your wife
I know you set yourself up to live the simple life
You get it all and you realize you haven’t opened up your eyes since you were
Young and it’s so bright
When you try to take it all in and realize you can’t begin again you wonder
How you keep moving
I can offer you so little help but just accept the hands that you’ve been dealt
Do your best to be a good man
Do you know how hard that is?
Do you know how strange life can be?
Well you love me and I know that, we can’t let a precious thing go
I don’t love you like you love me, I’m pretty sure that you know
Just try and bring meaning to all things and when you try to take it in
No one wants to be alone
But should you fall in love with me, your love becomes my responsibility and I
Can never do you wrong
Do you know how hard that is?
Do you know how strange I love you?
No I do not believe we were born equally
Wanna know what I see?
Those who do good will be treated accordingly
I know you love your children
I know you love your wife
I know you set your self up to live the simple life
You’ve got it all and you realize you haven’t opened up those eyes since you
Were young and it’s so bright
When if you try to take it all in and realize you can't begin again you must
Keep moving
I can offer you so little help but just accept the hands that you’ve been dealt
And your best to be a good man
Do you know how hard that is?
Yes I know how strange life can be1Embed
