David Lyrics
I look west and I believe
He looks east and he thinks of me

No, he won't see me anymore
I open gates that close his doors
Just to know that he lives and breathes
Has to be enough for me

There's an angel walking Earth
One of a kind amongst all this dirt
Sat down one day and I swallowed my pride
And I begged him not to leave my life

With a tear in my eye
And a lump in my throat
I read you David's final note
"Goodbye, little girl, don't you forget
Wasted love is a long regret"
"Goodbye, little girl, don't forget
Wasted love is a long regret"

Wasted love is a long regret1Embed
