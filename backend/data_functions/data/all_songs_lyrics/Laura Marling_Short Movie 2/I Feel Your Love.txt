I Feel Your Love LyricsKeep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can never know what's going on
What's going on
Keep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can't be alone
An electric fence, a silent defense to you all
You let me in, I loved you then
The first taste is free, then you had me
I feel your love
I feel your love
Keep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can get along
An electric fence, a silent defense to you all
Let the river answer
Let the river answer so I can get along
What's going on? What's going on?
You must let me go before I get old
I need to find someone who really wants to be mine
I feel your love
I feel your love
Keep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can never know what's going on
What's going on
Let the river answer
Let the river answer so I can be alone
An electric fence, a silent defense to you all
You must let me go before I get old
I need to find someone who really wants to be mine
I feel your love
I feel your love
Please let me go
Please let me goEmbed
