Daisy Lyrics
Daisy lives by the docks
Down at the white rock
Running an open home
Daisy lives by the sea
I only see Daisy
When she wants to see me

Daisy's alright
She's up all night
Down at the docks
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
A woman alone is not a woman undone

Daisy met a man from Sicily
He sailed in one day and told her
Who she was gonna be
Oh, did he look at her strange
For no one and nobody
Is Daisy gonna change
Daisy's alright
She's up all night
Down at the docks
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
A woman alone is not a woman undone

Daisy's got a baby now
She called her Angelina
So she'd stand out of the crowd
Daisy doesn't care from where she seeds
As far as she's concerned
She's immaculately conceived

Daisy's alright
She's up all night
Down at the docks
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
A woman alone is not a woman undone1Embed
