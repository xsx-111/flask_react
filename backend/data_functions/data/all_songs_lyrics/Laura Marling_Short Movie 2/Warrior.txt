Warrior LyricsHe means to ride me on
He sees a battle he don't want to face alone
I bolt upwards and shake him off my back
He falls to his knees, on to a bloody track
Well I can't be your horse any more
You're not the warrior I've been looking for
I see what you mean to do with me
I cannot protect you from who you want to be
Go face the Lord on your own
You have my love but it will not make you grow
I can't be your horse anymore
You're not the warrior I would die for
He fearing solitude, began to beg
When he saw I was sure, stuck a knife into my leg
Good luck walking on in your own bloody trail
This noble path you're on will send us both to hell
I'm just a horse on the moor
Where is my warrior I've been looking for?
I stumble some way on, licking my sores
Tasting the memory of pain I have endured
Wondering where am I to go?
Well looking back on a bloody trail, you think that I should know
But I'm just a horse with no name
Somewhere there is other beasts who think the same
I'm just a horse with no name
Some place there's some other beasts who think the same
One morning I awoke to someone calling me
A priestess I'd seen once in some arcana dream
And she pulled an orange from the ground
Is this my warrior?
I am
I am
Am found
I'm just a horse with no name
Where are my other beasts who think the same?
I'm just a horse on the moor
Where is the warrior I've been looking for?1Embed
