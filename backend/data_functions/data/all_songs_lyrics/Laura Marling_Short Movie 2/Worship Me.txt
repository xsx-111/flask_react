Worship Me Lyrics
Little boy, I know you want something from me
Yes I might be blind but I am free
Don't you try and take that away from me

Little girl, I know you think that I'm a mystery
Yes, you might be blind but you are free
Don't you cry and wish that away from me

It's God you need
It's God you need

We're young
We're young and lost
And need something to put our hopes up
Need something to protect us

It's God you need
It's God you need

Sit down and worship me
Sit down and worship me
Sit down and worship me
Me
Forgive me
Forgive me
Forgive me
Forgive me

Sit down and worship me
Devote your life to peace
Sit down and worship me
Devote your life to peace, and breathe
And breatheEmbed
