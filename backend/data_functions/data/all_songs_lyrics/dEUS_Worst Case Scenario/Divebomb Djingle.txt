Divebomb Djingle LyricsIt is a waterproof
Windproof
I love youth
I'm on-the-roof-kind-of-day
Yay
We're in the grillroom
With the groundwork
You stain your skirt, skirt
I like your hairdo, I hate your way
Yes, that's the price you pay
Yes, that's the price you pay
Yes, that's the price you pay
Yes, that's the price you pay
I'm just a shipboy
Pay my shiptoll
And every shipday
I take a shipstroll out on the deck
It's complicated
I underrated
But now I made it
Might it be a bit ok?
No, that's the price you pay
No, that's the price you pay
No, that's the price you pay
No, that's the price you pay
I'm feeling weary
He said to Larry
I'm gonna o.d
I can a roadie, I'm in a popband
He said: "Remember, James Dean
Was looking pristine
In comes the benzine
Out goes the rebel without a grant
But with a fanzine
Yes, that's the price you pay
Yes, that's the price you pay
Yes, that's the price you pay
Yes, that's the price you pay
Just like a dive-bomb
You're gonna dive, son
Ain't nothing won hon'
Until it's done, done, look out for the quake
Check out the ceiling
There's nothing healing
Your life is peeling
I know the feeling, I just wanna break
You just wanna break
No, that's the price you pay
No, that's the price you pay
No, that's the price you pay
No, that's the price you payEmbed
