Mute LyricsI, I knew a girl and she was a joker
Her hair was nicotine-brown, eyes of a joker
Her grass has a pale ginger green
Whatever that means
Together, we saw they were building a building
Alone I see the building is there
Her grass has a pale ginger green
Whatever that means
Your mind goes, your mind goes, your mind goes
This has nothing to do with you, it's just the way that I turn you
Your mind goes, your mind goes, your mind goes
'Cause this has nothing to do with you, it's just the way that I turn you
You see, I, I knew this girl and she was a joker
And if she was so big, I guess I would smoke her
Her grass has a pale ginger green
She knows what it means
Your mind goes, your mind goes, your mind goes
Well, this has nothing to do with you, it's just the way that I turn you
Your mind goes, your mind goes, your mind goes
And this has nothing to do with you
I'm calling it off, I'm taking it low
I'm staying ahead of our soul
I'm calling it off, I'm taking it low
I'm staying ahead of our soul
I'm calling it off, I'm taking it low
I'm staying ahead of our soul
I'm calling it off, I'm taking it low
I'm staying ahead of our soul
Your mind goes, your mind goes, your mind goes
Crawl so damn low
I'm calling it off, I'm taking it low (your mind goes, your mind goes, your mind goes)
I'm staying ahead of our soulEmbed
