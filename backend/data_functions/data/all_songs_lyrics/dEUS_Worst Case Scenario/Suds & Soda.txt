Suds & Soda LyricsFriday, friday 
Your head, come on, is dead and gone
It might as well be said so long
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
And can I wait for my decoder
Get off, get up, you son of pop
The light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda, a smile decoder
And can I get, yeah, what I ordered?
And there's always something in the air
Sometimes suds and soda mix okay with beer
Can I, can I break your sentiment?
Oh, you're just reminding me
Can't see no person there
Just wanna shout "What the fuck?"
Jimmy ean is halloween
Like kerosene for dee dee scene
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
And can I skip this thing I ordered?
Get off, get up, you son of pop
The light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda, a vibe decoder
And can I get, yeah, what I ordered?
There's always something in the air
Sometimes suds and soda mix okay with beer
Can I, can I break your sentiment?
Oh, you're just reminding me
Can't see no person there
Just wanna shout "What the fuck?"
There's always something in the air
Your face, come on, is dead and gone
You might as well be said so long
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
And can I wait for my devoter?
Get off, get up, you son of pop
The light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda, a smile, decoder
And can I skip, yeah, what I ordered?
And can I break your sentiment?
So can I break your sentiment?
So can I break your sentiment?Embed
