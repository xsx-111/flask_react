Great American Nude LyricsShe had this thing about Aleister Crowley
It was like a fascination
She had this thing about Aleister Crowley
It was like a fascination
I don't mean to be rude
Burton in a salad bar, sweet like a candy bar
No more sugar for a clean genius in quarantine
I mean where's the love, where's the hate?
What's a smiling face and a sunburned prostate for a man that great?
Richard there, Richard here, Richard quoting Shakespeare
Back and forth and back again, to be or not to be the man
Lizzy's getting dizzy, she should've known it from the start
Being rich is just a lifestyle, being alive is just a part
That's what makes a kilo heavier than a gram, mam
That's what makes a kilo heavier than a gram, mam
I don't mean to be rude
Great american nude
Got a gift from my mother, she got it for a dime
She got it from someone and I also don't mind
But it's just a phase, when I get graced, can't tell the picture from a sound
I thought we would just call her 'Great American Brown'
Great American Brown
Fool smart, move fashion and the crowning on a brown man
Black is butter, count the shaky hands
You see, I got it from my mother, she got it for a pop
Get the gallery connected, get the clientele to form
Suck a demon for a duck
I didn't mean to be rude, great american nude
Hey, I didn't mean to be rude, great american nude
Burton in a salad bar, sweet like a candy bar
No more sugar for a clean genius in quarantine
Where's the love, where's the hate?
Always seen a smiling face, a sunburned prostate for a man that great
Great american nude
Take American Express?
That's what makes a kilo heavier than a gram, mam
That's what makes a kilo heavier than a gram, mam
That's what makes a kilo heavier than a gram, mam
That's what does it
Motif, motif, motif, motif, motif, motif
Motif, motif, motif
Great american nude, great american nude
Great american nude, great american nude
I know I wanna testifyEmbed
