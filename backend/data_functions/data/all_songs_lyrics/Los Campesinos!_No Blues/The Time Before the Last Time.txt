The Time Before the Last Time Lyrics
One last meal as one last gesture
Cheapest wine, second-best restaurant
Clapperboard made of two pork chops
Credits roll before the scene stops

And in the shower
Heard your housemate on the phone
Lathered up my padded bones
Lathered up my padded bones
From her soap I foam
The shower-head moaned
And I looked down to the tray
Sons and daughters washed away
Sons and daughters washed away
"Good night, God bless," she'd say
The length of your legs
Half the length of your body
Above you, thinking of she
Above you, thinking of she
I knew I should leave
I said this before
And I thought that we agreed
The time before the last
The time before the last
Before the last timeEmbed
