A Portrait of the Trequartista as a Young Man Lyrics
Now is time to take recourse
To drag my bones from 'neath his corpse
Retract the blade within his heart
Inscribe our initials in the bark
Of every tree in every woods
In ink red blood, can you imagine?
While wearing his head as a hood
I'd take life for a crime of passion

Lies told, lies told, lies told, lies told

Darling, if I had the choice
I'd excavate his throat of voice
And corrugate his vocal chords
To play a tune to please the Lord
Make him recite this murder ballad
A sombre tune told by a bore
Pump blood around the limp and pallid
Harmonising as you snored

Lies told, lies told, lies told, lies told
Lies told, lies told, lies told, lies told
One day when I'm older, I'll write it all down
A portrait of the trequartista as a young man

We all know we're gonna die
We're a speck of dust in a bad god's eye
He rubs us clean, but love is blind
A balloon artist kisses porcupine
We all know we're gonna die
We're a speck of dust in a bad god's eye
He rubs us clean, but love is blind
A balloon artist kisses porcupine
We all know we're gonna die
We're a speck of dust in a bad god's eye
He rubs us clean, but love is blind
A balloon artist kisses porcupineEmbed
