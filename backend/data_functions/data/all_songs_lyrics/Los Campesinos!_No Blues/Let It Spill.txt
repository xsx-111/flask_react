Let It Spill Lyrics
I was born atop a winter's hill
I took form as a ball in the virgin snow
That started on its slow descent
Barely more than twenty-seven years ago
And every ounce my love has grown
I absorbed another flake
When this avalanche has hit
Imagine the mess I will make

A tidal wave from the tears
Will you toil in the garden to dig a well
Deep to the core of the earth?
They'll sob enough to douse all the fires of hell
I see you with shovel in hand
Your skirt billows above your knees
Envy the soil that fills their pores
And this perverted breeze

And I'm full to the brim
Pull me up to your mouth
Let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim
Flood the North to the South
Let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim
Pull me up to your mouth
Let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim
Let it spill, let it spill
Let it spill all over us two
I take no solace in coastal breezes
'Cause the quay is sea minor without you
BÃ©la Guttmann of love
Curse all my exes to a life of celibacy
And then while you freed the doves
I shot them from the sky for taxidermy
An every day disaster
A bread and butter tragedy
I sunk an oil tanker
Off the shores of Galillee

And I'm full to the brim
Pull me up to your mouth
Let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim
Flood the North to the South
Let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim
Pull me up to your mouth
Let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim
Let it spill, let it spill
Let it spill all over us two
You'll find me upside down in the belfry
'Cause baby, I'm bats, it is true1Embed
