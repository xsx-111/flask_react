Selling Rope (Swan Dive to Estuary) Lyrics
As I swan dive into the estuary
The birds do not flinch at my fall
They perch in the rafters, before, during, after
They do not notice me at all
As I float down into the estuary
Wind cases my body in cool
I smell petrol fumes, see the smoke rise in plumes
The earth is one big fireball
The earth is one big fireball

Anecdote, lie, my own alibi
I've been telling jokes
Piled notes high, my own alibi
I've been selling rope

As I break the film of the estuary
The seaweed submerges my form
No passing cars stop, not a single jaw drops
As my wallet and keys sink before
A splash all I left in the world

Anecdote, lie, my own alibi
I've been telling jokes
Piled notes high, my own alibi
I've been selling rope
Once held a magpie in the palm of my hand
And the blood in our veins flowed faster, as I'd planned
Got a heart full of love and a head full of more
But a fist full of threads from the seams
And I saw a smile in that beak

Anecdote, lie, my own alibi
I've been telling jokes
Piled notes high, my own alibi
I've been selling rope

Oh, I was a bird right then, one day I will be again
I've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
Oh, I was a bird right then, one day I will be again
I've been telling jokes while selling rope to you


Oh, I was a bird right then, one day I will be again
I've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
Oh, I was a bird right then, one day I will be again
I've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
There's no ticker-tape, no pearly gates
No carnival and no parade
Just one, one for sorrow
There's no ticker-tape, no pearly gates
No carnival and no parade
Just one, one for sorrowEmbed
