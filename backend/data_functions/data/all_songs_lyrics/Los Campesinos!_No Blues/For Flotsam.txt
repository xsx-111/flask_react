For Flotsam Lyrics
Knees knocking and blood flowing, so
I want you to know

You say you are an old cassette that has gone and spilt its spool
You're far more like a wet cardboard tube
On this nightclub toilet floor
As I describe my lonely, you listen very clear
The last set of goalposts taken down
Summer of odd-numbered year

She says, "If you're unhappy, then you gotta find the cure"
Well, I prescribe me one more beer, beyond that I am unsure
May not be be all and end all, in my defence, she is the hole
I've thrown my goalkeeper forward, she's catenaccio

Flotsam, Jetsam and Spindrift, all the girls I have loved
Dumped to earth by a spendthrift, gilt angels from above
And I saw God in the bathroom, I baptised him in sick
Embraced him around his cistern, "C'est la mort, enough of this"

Knees knocking and blood flowing, so
I want you to know that I want to
And later, she said something that stuck hard in my mind
"We are their Capel Celyn, they gotta keep their slippers dry
To empathise with Tories, to invite upon disease
A safer bet's to pack your bags, go holiday in Eyam"

I will take you where the sun shines, cast shadows on your face
Crawl into their deepest recess, 'til I freeze or dehydrate
We'll live and breathe it in real time, montage is for the dead
And my heart's still doing Fosburys, nowhere near finished yet

Knees knocking and blood flowing, so
I want you to know that I want to
Knees knocking and blood flowing, so
I want you to know that I want to
Knees knocking and blood flowing, so
I want you to know that I want to
I want you to know that I want to
I want you to know that I want toEmbed
