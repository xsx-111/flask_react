Peace of Mind LyricsAll we need but it's so hard to find
Is some peace, peace of mind
All we need but it's so hard to find
Is some peace, peace of mind
When the fathers and the mothers fight all the time
Leave the sisters and the brothers no time to rhyme
To the left, to the right
So far apart
With so much to consider, no time for the heart
Time for the heart
All we need but it's so hard to find
All we need is peace of mind
All we need but it's so hard to find
All we need is peace of mindEmbed
