Do What You Gotta Do Lyrics
Do what you gotta do
Come on back, see me when you can

Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start
It's my own fault what happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

So you just do what you gotta do, my wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind, find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feel no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And man you never lied to me
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me
So you just do what you gotta do, my wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind, find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can2Embed
