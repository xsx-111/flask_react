Sunday In Savannah LyricsOne more
Sunday in Savannah
Hear the whole creation shoutin'
Praise the Lord
See them flinging out the banner
While the congregation says amen
Young folks
Tendin' Sunday School
They sing merrilly 'bout the golden rule
Horse sense preaching all the day
They hollar in the righteous way
It's time for me to call on Mother Hannah
While she sits there wishing for her last reward
One more Sunday in Savannah
One more Sunday in Atlanta
It's the same thing
Same mistake
Same feeling
Don't ya dare
Go fishin' son
AmenEmbed
