In the Morning LyricsIn the morning when the moon is at it's rest
You will find me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight;
Pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning
'Tis the morning of my life
In the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life
In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day
In the ev'ning I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
Where w'll stay until the sun shines
Another day to swing on clothe's lines
May I be yawning
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
In the morning
In the morning
In the morningEmbed
