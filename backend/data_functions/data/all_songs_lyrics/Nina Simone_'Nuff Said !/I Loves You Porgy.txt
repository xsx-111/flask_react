I Loves You Porgy Lyrics
I loves you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here
With you forever
And I'll be glad

Yes I loves you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands
If you can keep me
I wants to stay here
With you forever
I've got my man


I loves you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here
With you forever
I've got my man
Someday I know he's coming to call me
He's going to handle me and hold me
So, it's going to be like dying, Porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes I know, I'll have to go

I loves you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Honey, don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here
With you forever
I've got my man1Embed
