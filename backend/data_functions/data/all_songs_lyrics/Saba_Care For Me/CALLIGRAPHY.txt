CALLIGRAPHY Lyrics
I don't tell the truth so y'all will feel sorry for me
I don't write this shit so y'all will feel God coming
I don't get down like that
Wrote the amount of raps just on a mission to find something
Calligraphy
Needed to feel, move to the beat of my drum
I don't mean kick and the snare
We cannot bury all of the fucked-up shit that we been through
While God keeping us here
We be aware, but only timing will tell
When you will find all your letters
Calligraphy

Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of running away, running away
Everyone leaving, I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of running away, running away
Everyone leaving, I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

I'm not mad at God, I just can't get out of bed
My best friend obituary really hang on my wall, by the dresser
I'm tryna see it a life lesson
No time for mourning on my schedule, I seem to write less
Calligraphy, yeah
Reading the signs like I'm a highway driver, I just hit blas√©-blase
Hieroglyphic, I see the wall that they writing
I build a wall up in my head
Autopilot, what it felt like I was on, I sent the word out, flying
Calligraphy
Ugh, write it away, write it away
I just got tired of running away, running away
Everyone leaving, I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy
Write it away, write it away
I just got tired of running away, running away
Everyone leaving, I write 'em away, write 'em away
Calligraphy

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run (Yeah)
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running (Run!)
Running, running, running, running (Run!)
Running, running, running, running (Run!)

I can't get out of bed
I'm not mad at God
But I can't get out of bed
Calligraphy
Write it away, running away
I just got tired of running away, running away19Embed
