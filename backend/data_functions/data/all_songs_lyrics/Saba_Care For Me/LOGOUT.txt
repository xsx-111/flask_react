LOGOUT Lyrics
Right away, ayy

If you press "Log Out," you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm having
Ain't no beauty in the absence of broadcasting to your fol-ol-lo-wers
I seen a celeb get naked
I seen obsessive behavior, I see famous people all-all o-ver
I don't want no autograph
I just want a follow back, maybe tag to your fol-ol-lowers

Playback, say that
That just the way that the game go; after the rain, it's a rainbow
I see a product you paid for, shit get forgotten a day old
If I cannot log in, they started a rumor that I had got shot like a day ago (Bow! Bow!)
I don’t walk without my headphones, I don't got cable in my crib
I don't even know how we got here, being dependent is my fear
Government look like the mafia, censoring out what you watching
Internet turned me inanimate object
Look, Solitaire more than a game with your card
Can't change the channel, it'll stay in our heart
Stay in the public, and pray to your God
Need validation, I'm too insecure
Characters defined one hundred and forty
Two hundred and eighty, your post to your story
I'm from the 290, two sides to each story
Yeah, I'll be your friend, but you cannot follow me
If you press "Log Out," you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm having
Ain't no beauty in the absence of broadcasting to your fol-ol-lo-wers
I seen a celeb get naked
I seen obsessive behavior, I see famous people all-all o-ver
I don't want no autograph
I just want a follow back, maybe tag to your fol-ol-lowers

Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think they got ev—, ooh
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think I got every—, look
Everything's on camera, everything's on camera
Everybody want handouts, everybody got pamphlets
Everybody want Santa, everything is on camera
Everybody want pics now, everybody got antlers
Everybody my kid now, everybody got Pampers
Everything is on me now, everybody got cameras
Ain't nobody got Chancelor, ain't nobody got answers
All 'em scratching they head now, ain't nobody got dandruff
Don't nobody like selfies on they own page
I know people with they friend requests as they homepage
Ain't put a picture on they wall since the Stone Age
Feel locked up in they own cage when they on stage
If you press "Log Out," you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?15Embed
