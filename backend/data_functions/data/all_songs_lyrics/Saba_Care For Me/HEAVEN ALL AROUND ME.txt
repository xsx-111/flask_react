HEAVEN ALL AROUND ME Lyrics
Yelling at my mother, like, "I know you hear me"
Get a little closer, repeat
Bus driver pass me up, don't see me
Paramedic talk about what he need (*Huh-uhh, huh-uhh*)
"He need his oxygen"
They seem incompetent, I see the consequence
I walk where I can't hear them, they're inaudible
I got up, like, "I gotta go," forensics search for follicle
I promise y'all, I'm not a ghost, I promise y'all, oh, look
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around me
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around—

No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars (Stars)
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around me
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around—
No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God (With God)
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around me
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven

Yelling at my brothers, like, "I know that I'm here"
Regardless of how loud, they don't hear
Walkin' through the crowd, they shed tears
I know I did not disappear
Uphill, I'm battling, I see the cameraman
I see the news station's truck parked outside
It's every channel here
Yeah, interview, interview, interview—cut
Someone just bled out because they got (Cut!)
Chalk outline look like the shape of my shadow
Hand go right through the wall if I try touch
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around me
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God (With God)
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around me
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around—
No, I can't feel your pain, but I can see the stars
No, I ain't leave in vain, but I know we with God
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven all around me
There's Heaven all around me, there's Heaven
