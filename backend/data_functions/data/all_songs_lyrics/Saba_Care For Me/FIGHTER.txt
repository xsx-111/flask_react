FIGHTER Lyrics
Me and E-Guy just fought 'cause his family wouldn't stop talking
We neighbors who argued often, I run, I jog to him
Toss a jab, and I caught him, he threw a left—ain't connect
'Cause I ducked when I came back up, I seen his sister talking trash
Like, "Touch my brother, I'm beating yo' ass"
("Touch my brother, I'm beating yo' ass, nigga!")
So I fucked her brother up to see what she about, yeah
Walked away, and then we noticed that his teeth was out, yeah
She ain't do shit, she just mad, we got to see her pout
So me and Cell, we just fought, I was walking, and then he jawed me
I dropped to the floor while calling for help in front of my grandmother's house
The next hit, he punched me my mouth
I can't believe I'm on the ground 'cause I tried to hit him, I gambled
I'm ugly cryin' in public—I'm like, "When I get you back, you gon' wish that you never touched me"
Somehow I never could touch him, our brothers broke the shit up
And I walked the rest of the day with my head down
Funny how getting your ass beat'll spread 'round
Ha, yeah

But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more
So me and E-Guy, we scrap again
Jacob jumped in, I'm handicapped
Manny watched from across the street
Then he ran up and hopped on me
Three on one, they teaming up, but me, I never think to run
They circling around
Got me surrounded like police or something (Woop-woop!)
So it's bad enough they already jumpin' me
Then I see Cell coming—I'm praying, "Please don't fuck with me"
("Please leave me the fuck alone")
It's not fair, and I think he agree
So instead of fighting with them, he came and teamed up with me
Me and Grandpa ain't talked since I stopped attending the college
He called me, said I'm a scholar, I should be getting my doctorate
"Or, shit, at least in the army, instead you chose to hip-hopper
I know how this is gon' end 'cause I went through this with your father"
Me and my girl just fought 'cause I talked before she could talk
She was telling a story, I cut her off with some shit not 'bout the same topic
So she just stopped in the middle before the plot hit
The rest of the car ride silent, like "You always do this"
Like, "You don't value my thoughts—either that, or you too damn stupid to realize
That if you don't hear me out, then I'ma feel muted
You say that you care; well, show it—I'm not asking a lot
I know you think you listening, but you just waiting to talk," ha
My fault
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more
But I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter, I won't no more

It's harder to love myself when all these people compliment me
Somehow it just remind me what I don't got
But these folks don't care to know, they think you rolling in the dough
Not realizing your next meal is a 4-for-$4
Still feeling the guilt that Walt never thought to call
Fighting myself to get out of bed
I'm fighting myself to get out of bed
Fighting myself (Myself, myself, myself)

I don't wanna fight no more
'Cause I'm not a fighter

Yeah, me and all my niggas dropped out
Then we drove to Texas, slept at Waffle House
Kicked out of the hotel, we all broke
We don't got no mattress, sleep on your floor
Me and Grandpa ain't spoke since I dropped out
Made sure on my first tour, stop at his house
I sleep on the hotel, not your floor
He tell me that he proud of his boy
I'm not a janitor no more at Homan Square
Saved up for a roundtrip, LAX
I just learned it's no risk, no reward
I slept on the floor at Port Author' (I slept on the floor)
Me and all my niggas dropped tears
Heart been on the floor for a whole year (Oh, oh)
We all broke
We all broke12Embed
