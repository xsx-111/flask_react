GREY Lyrics
The best song is probably on the B-side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
Disagree
Grey
The best song was probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine
Grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest
In the game
Grey, grey

Sometimes, I think about the pressures of a artist
And what it takes to get called a success even with no college
We barely even considered
Don't label me with them niggas
Infatuation with plastic, I wanted it to be realer
First, they wanted it hip-hop
And then they wanted guerilla, and then they wanted drug dealer
And then, they wanted a dancer; now, they want a drug addict
Infatuation with plastic, white girl wanna be sister
Driver wanna be walker, and walker wanna be sitter
The best song is probably on the B-side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
Disagree
Grey
The best song was probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine
Grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest
In the game
Grey, grey

Sometimes, I think about the pressures of the label
And what it take to get paid for discovering art they ain't know existed
I know it ain't your intention to try and change me
Multimillion, your children
Private school, they attending, and album-selling what did it
I shuck and jive, a good nigga; split the pot, and I'm silent
I'ma give you your single, and you just give me the finest
"Saba, if it's so bad, then, hey, why the hell are they signing?"
'Cause sitter wanna be walker, and walker wanna be drivin'

The best song is probably on the B-side
Won't be surprised when the label deny
Disagree
Grey
The best song was probably on the demo
But that's not the one that got you your limo
Limousine
Grey
The single the one that wasn't as honest
But this is what they say make you the hottest
In the game
Grey
Mm
Care for me, carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive
I told you motherfuckers, like Oedipus
Heather B, "Sway in the Morning"
Painting that paint like a portrait
Action, I ain't for the talking
Ain't for the fame, but the fortune cool
Altering the altitude
Offering the thought for food
Authoring that art that move, mm
Carefully editing every word
Everything got to be charity
Give it my all—these melodies therapy
I keep it thoroughly, PIVOT, the legacy
How could you not be moved?
I don't give them an option to, mm
Don't nobody want to be great
Everybody want to be seen
And nobody want to be quiet
Everything is (Grey!), everything is (Grey!)
Everything is (Grey!), everything is (Grey!), mm
Care for me, carefully, back with more clarity
Back like consecutive, I told you m—
Look, everything is grey (Grey!), everything is grey (Grey!)
Everything is grey (Grey!), everything—12Embed
