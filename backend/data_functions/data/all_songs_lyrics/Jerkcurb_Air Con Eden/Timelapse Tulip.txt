Timelapse Tulip Lyrics
I still believe and
We had a slow dance
Between the shades of
Your dad's apartment

My life in timelapse
I forgot it all
A slow motion romance
I remember

Nothing but your sweater
Mahogany floor
We do our 
And outside the tulips blossom then die

My life in timelapse
A slow motion romance

I still believe and... (I still believe and)
I still believe and... (I still believe and)
I'll wait forever (I'll wait forever)
I'll wait forever (I'll wait forever)Embed
