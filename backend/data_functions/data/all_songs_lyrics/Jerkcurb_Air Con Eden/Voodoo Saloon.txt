Voodoo Saloon LyricsI know a man
He is I
The seasons will come
When you die
Our days are
Over and out
But your eyes still
Speak with doubt
You're the voodoo saloon
Wearing the skin you were born in
You won't be leaving here soon
You still miss the
Idea of someone to lean on
Should've had a thing
Could've had a thing
Would've had a thing
To start
My un-bar mitzvah heart
My marzipan heart
I have to say
"It's nice to meet you"
But I want to say
Whose eyes are whose ?
