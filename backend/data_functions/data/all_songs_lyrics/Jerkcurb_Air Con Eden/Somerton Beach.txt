Somerton Beach Lyrics
I'm ceasin' to believe
That a body on a beach has no history

But you don't know me and I don't know you
The syncopating lullaby
(Straight to beyond)
Of a no man's hell
And why should I trust you
If you can't trust me?
I'm dreaming up an alibi
Want you to know
Of Somerton Beach

The seas take this feelin'
It follows me in my steps
Beneath me

But you don't know me and I don't know you
A stranger in a suit n' tie
Straight from beyond, and into my soul
And how did you get here?
And how'd you find me?
The relaxing way to die
Want you to know
Of Somerton beach
I'm watching on a windless night
Washed up on the shore
And in my head
I am thinking
I wish I could go back in time
And I have spent the night
On Somerton beachEmbed
