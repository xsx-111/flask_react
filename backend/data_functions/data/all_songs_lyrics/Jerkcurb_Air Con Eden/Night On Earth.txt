Night On Earth LyricsIt's our last night on earth
Won't you spend it with me?
It's perfect now
Just hold me and say
"I want to spend it with you"
I know I...
I see a dimmer light than
Before
But furthermore
Your eyes feel more alive
Now that our time is near
It's our last night on earth
You're the girl of my dreams
It's over now
This day, it would come
I knew it all along
I know I...
I may not be the first pick of the bunch
In your skin and your eyes
I can see fright
But you're not afraid to hold me tight
This desperate moment
Would last forever
And I would be
So happy
To spend eternity
Now I'm with you
Cause you picked me
To end eternity, and I chose you
Ooh
La la la la la, and I chose you
Ooh
La la la la la, and I chose you
Ooh
End eternity, I chose you
Ooh
La la la la la, and I chose you5Embed
