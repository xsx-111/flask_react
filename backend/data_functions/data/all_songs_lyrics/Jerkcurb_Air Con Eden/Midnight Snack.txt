Midnight Snack Lyrics
I snuck a snack
Under my duvet
Peanut butter and jelly
Makes my bed feel much less empty
When I'm alone
Seems like the stars
Out my window
Match the sugar on my cake
Driving through space
Drifting me far away
Like a flying saucer
My midnight snack
I can't feel the crumbs
Stick to my back
Just tasting my dream jar
Eat what you want
