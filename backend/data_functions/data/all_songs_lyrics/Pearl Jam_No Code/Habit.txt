Habit Lyrics
See it happen to a couple of friends
Seen it happen and the message it sends
Taking off for what's an obvious fall
Just to see what all the fuss is about

It's not your way
Not your way
It's not your way

Another habit says it's in love with you
Another habit says it's love's overdue
Another habit like an unwanted friend
I'm so happy with my righteous self

It's not your way
Not your way
It's not your way

Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never thought you
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never never thought you
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Speaking as a child of the 90's

Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never thought you
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
Never thought you'd habit
I never thought you, never, never thought you
Never...

Never me
Never you
Never meEmbed
