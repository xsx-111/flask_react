Mankind Lyrics
You'll be going out with radio, going out with disco, going out like bacchanal
I'll be going out with telephone, going out alone, to the radar zone

It's all just inadvertent imitation, and I don't mean mine
It's all across this nation
If it's just inadvertent simulation, a pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world faking it?

I'll be playing with my magazine, using up my Listerine, like Ovaltine
And you'll be dipping in your battleship, for the latest tip, for the latest dream

It's all just inadvertent imitation, and I don't mean mine
It's all across this nation
If it's just inadvertent simulation, a pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world faking it?

If it's just inadvertent imitation, a pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world faking it?
What's got the whole world faking
What's got the whole world faking it? Yeah1Embed
