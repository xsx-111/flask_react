Who You Are Lyrics
Come to send. Not condescend
Transcendent to consequences
To transcend where we are
Who are we? Who we are

Trampled moss on your souls
Changes, all you're a part
Seen it all. Not at all
Can't defend fucked up men

Take me for a ride before we leave

Circumstance. Clapping hands
A driving winds. Happenstance
Off the track, in the mud
That's the moss in the aforementioned verse

And a little... Wow... And a little...
Just a little time before we leave

Stop light plays its part
So I would say you've got a part
What's your part? Who you are
You are who who you are1Embed
