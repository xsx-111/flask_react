Red Mosquito Lyrics
(Line one, mighty fine)

Watched from the window with a red mosquito
I was not allowed to leave the room
I saw the sun go down and now it's coming up
Somewhere in the time between

I was bitten
Must have been the devil
He was just paying me a little visit
Reminding me of his presence
Letting me know he's a-waiting, oh

Red man's your neighbor, Call it behavior
While you're climbing up slippery hills
Two steps ahead of him, Punctures in your neck
Hovering just above your bed
Hovering just above your bed

I was bitten
Must have been the devil
He was just paying me a little visit
Reminding me of his presence
And letting me know he's a-waiting
He's a-waiting oh, there
Yeah
If I had known then, what I know now
If I had known then, what I know now
If I had known then, what I know now
If I had known then, what I know now1Embed
