Around the Bend Lyrics
I'm wishing you all well
Mind a peace within your cell
Covers up I cast you off
I'll be watching as you breathe
I lie still, you move, I send you off around the bend

I hold your head deep in my arms
My fingertips they close your eyes
Off you dream my little child
There's a sun around the bend 

All evenings close like this
All these moments that I've missed
Please forgive me, won't you dear?
Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend

You're an angel when you sleep
How I want your soul to keep on, and on, around the bendEmbed
