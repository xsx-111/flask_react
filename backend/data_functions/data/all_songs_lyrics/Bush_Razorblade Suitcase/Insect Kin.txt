Insect Kin LyricsIron lung I know you well
Deal with you like a bad spell
See the trail moon burns
Red strip and vicadin
You were the only one
You're the censor
You'll never people me
I'm not defenseless
In the afternoon as the light dims
Build a life out of all this semtex
You're the brightest one
You were the centre
The perfect opposite of what you asked for
It's not just one way
A negative factor
With all of these wasps out
I'd better take cover
Better take cover
Copper tongue beam me up
Lonely without my impediments
Start to save what we used to steal
Walking on gelatin
I never noticed you
You were the brightest one
You were wide of me
Just like the English sun
You caught the light again
In a perfect way
The biggest threat of all
Is in the alleyway
You're the demon seed
You're the factor
Feel better with a little bit of plaster
It's not just one way
A negative factor
With all of these wasps out
I better take cover
Better take cover
(I better take cover!)
There's all the pain
In the way she talks
All the pain in the way she walks
All the pain in her wave goodbye
All the pain in the way she smiles
All the pain in her fatal charm
All the pain in her arms
Arms...
In her arms...
In her arms...Embed
