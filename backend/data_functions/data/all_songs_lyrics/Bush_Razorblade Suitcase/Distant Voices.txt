Distant Voices LyricsI never thought I'd get away
Cause all there is is fading fast today
Maybe you sleep well in your head
Bring on the night let the cold moon burn instead
'Cause I'm gonna find my way to the sun
If I destroy myself
Swallowing habits die real hard
And the coat she wore could not conceal the scars
Beneath the magic of her lace
Are a thousand lonely faces she can't place
'Cause I'm gonna find my way to the sun
If I destroy myself, I can shine on
I'm gonna find my way to the sun
When I destroy myself, I can shine on
Shine
Shine
Shine
Sooner or later maturbate or lose
Stationary west way running from the view
In true the self destructive veins
We have found a way to keep the gifts that maims
'Cause I'm gonna find my way to the sun
If I destroy myself I can move on
I'm gonna find my way to the sun
If I destroy myself I can shine on
Shine
I'm gonna find my way to the sun
If I destroy myself I can shine on
Shine
Shine
Shine
ShineEmbed
