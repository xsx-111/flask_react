Mouth Lyrics
You gave me this
Made me give

Your silver grin
Still sticking it in
You have soul machine
Soul machine

The longest kiss
Peeling furniture days
Drift madly to you
Pollute my heart drain
You have broken at me
Broken me

All your mental armour drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth, mouth

Your loaded smiles
Pretty just desserts
Wish it all for you
So much it never hurts
You have soul machine
Stolen me
All your mental armour drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armour drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your mouth, mouth, mouth

We've been missing long before
Never found our way home
We've been missing long before
Where we'll find our way

You gave me this
Made me give
You have soul machine
Broken free

All your mental armour drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armour drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your mouth, mouth, mouth
All your mental armour
All your mental armour
And your mouth, mouth, mouth
Mouth, mouth, mouth, mouth
Mouth, mouth, mouth, mouth
Mouth, mouth, mouth, mouthEmbed
