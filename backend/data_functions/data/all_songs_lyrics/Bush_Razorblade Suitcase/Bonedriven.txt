Bonedriven LyricsWe're just a wish away
27th letter
Much maligned
Beat me clever
Say you will
Nevermind
Open up
Open wide
Bonedriven
Bonedriven
See we're taking all the life
To all pollutants
Shave your face
We're all confusion
We're all the rage
Isolate
Crowd it out
All that's left
Inside out
Heaven knows who walks away
Heaven knows who walks
Bonedriven
Bonedriven
See we're taking all the light
Bonedriven
Bonedriven
See we're taking all the light
I was wrong and I will wait
I was wrong and I will wait
I was wrong and I will, I will, I will wait
A thousand lamps
Won't lift the dark
Rest of our lives
Might have already passed
Bonedriven
Bonedriven
See we're taking all the light
Bonedriven
Bonedriven
See we're taking all the light
We're taking all the lightEmbed
