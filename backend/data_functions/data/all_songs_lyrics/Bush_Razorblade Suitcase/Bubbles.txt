Bubbles LyricsGot all these days to alleviate
Got all these ways to bend it straight
It's a shitty life just to bring you down
You'll still be young
Where did this life go
Don't twist the face of authority
He sucked the life outside of me
She's forever blowing bubbles all the way
There is nothing left to lose
There is nothing left to gain
Forever blowing bubbles all the way
There is nothing left to lose
There is nothing left to gain
Bubbles
Deconstruct your modern fable
Homogenize your stake laid angel
Stop feeding me interpretation
We're a sick sick sick
We've watched it created
Have the means to hang out minority
Outside and inside-out of me
Forever blowing bubbles all the way
There is nothing left to lose
There is nothing left to gain
Forever blowing bubbles all the way
There is nothing left to lose
There is nothing left
She's forever blowing bubbles all the way
There is nothing left to lose
There is nothing left to gain
Forever blowing bubbles all the way
There is nothing left to lose
There is nothing leftEmbed
