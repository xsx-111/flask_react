Communicator Lyrics
Somewhere
Sometime
All things
Will be fine

And it never
Seems to stop

Wonder if
I've met my wife

Somewhere
Sometime
All things
Will be fine

And it never
Seems enough

Wonder if
I've met my wife
Splinter left
Focus right
Focus right
This mortal soil around me
Mortal feeling I have found
Surrounded by your glory
Hold me now so that I never drown

And it never
Seems to stop
(Somewhere, sometime)

Wonder if
I've met my wife
Splinter left
Focus right
Focus rightEmbed
