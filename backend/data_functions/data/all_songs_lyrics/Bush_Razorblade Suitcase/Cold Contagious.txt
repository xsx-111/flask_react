Cold Contagious Lyrics
Wherever you are
You will carry always
Truth of the scars
Darkness of your faith
Slowly move on
How did we get to here?
It all went wrong
Gravity claiming all your tears
Everything looks so much better now
Looks so much better now
Skinful

You will get yours
You will get yours
You will get yours

You have no right to ask me now
You were never that around
And I have this

Reality day trips
And your "suit me, suit me" ways
Turn out the light switch
We’ve been awake for days
And no one’s coming ’round here no more
No one’s coming ’round here
You will get yours
You will get yours
You will get yours

You have no right to cut me down
You were never that around
And I have this
I have this


Paint your perfect day
I don’t mind this
I’m better off by the way
I’m deeply grounded

You will get yours
You will get yours
You will get yours
And you will get yours
You will get yours
You will get yours

Cold contagious
