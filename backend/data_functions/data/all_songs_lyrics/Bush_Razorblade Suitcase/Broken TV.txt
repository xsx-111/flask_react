Broken TV LyricsNo longer same, no longer human
You're everything that I need
And you pray for rain just to make it sunny
It's bad enough you can see
We miss you
We miss you
Who's power crazy
Who's hungry for honey
Who put a hole and taken less
I
I don't know why I must love money
I love you better when there's nobody else
Nothin' to hold me to hold me back
She turns around and give it right back
Am I always gonna be this blind
Am I always gonna be this...
These are the days, of broken tv
She comes the mirror thinks is look real nice, well...
Load up on sex, we're moving on inside
We see the light now we got real tight yeah
I feel funny
And I suck (f**k) fineEmbed
