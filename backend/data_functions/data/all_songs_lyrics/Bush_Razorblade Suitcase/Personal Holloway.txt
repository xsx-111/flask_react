Personal Holloway LyricsTune my weaker eye
Spit white
Hold the world up all day
She's blue in the face again
Paracetamol
Sleep the darkness all away
Drinking kitchen paint to dye the
Winter
I hope we'll never see again
Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Married by signs
Married by signs
Personal holloway
Six month linen
It's safe to say we are alone
Suburban suicide
Watching night come amber
It's all so temporary
Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Married by signs
Married by signs
Move a little way
Move a little way now
Move a little way
Move a little way now
Bleed life
Breath life
Could be a better plan
Could be a better plan
Could be a better planEmbed
