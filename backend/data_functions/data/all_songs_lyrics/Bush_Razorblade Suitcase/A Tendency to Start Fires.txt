A Tendency to Start Fires LyricsStrange zoo
Strange blaze
Douse my head in flames
Coming through got to get some
Happiness is a bad son
Forceps
Kitchen tools
Deconstruct your every move
Feels better when you're here
Guillotine just got here
Back bend
Back break
Please yourself to make it rate
Live it all at your own cost
So many just got lost
Leaning for fire
Leaning to fire
Leaning to fire
Here's tomorrow man
Best of my ability
Chasing what I can
Here's tomorrow man
Instinct
Bare boned
Light it up
Take it home
You will be all things
You'll get what you bring
Leaning to fire
Leaning to fire
Leaning to fire
Here's tomorrow man
Best of my ability
Chasing what I can
Here's tomorrow man
Best of my ability
Chasing what I can
Here's tomorrow man
With our own tongue
With our own tongue
Here's tomorrow man
Best of my ability
Chasing what I can
Here's tomorrow man
End of the century
Chasing what I can
Here's tomorrow man...Embed
