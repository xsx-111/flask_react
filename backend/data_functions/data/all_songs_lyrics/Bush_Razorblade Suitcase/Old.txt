Old LyricsHell bent useless void
Feed your fame paranoid
Wash these hands for a change
One step close by the way
Spin around all way
Nothing left
Give it all away
Give it all away
Sell me up jacket-straight
Eat the ones left on my plate
So much sharp
So I am smoto  days
Doctor ain't it good to live?
Spin around wrong way
Nothing left
Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away
Every day give yourself away
Coming on dark
And that gives you away
Gives you away
Spin around all way
Nothing left
Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away
