Greedy Fly Lyrics
Do you feel the way you hate?
Do you hate the way you feel?
Always closest to the flame
Ever closer to the blade
Yeah

I am poison crazy lush
Built these hands to lift me up
We are servants of our formulaic ways

I'm screaming daisies
From 14 miles away
I've got my own time
Got it all today

Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind, mind, mind

Limbo this and limbo that
You were this and you were that
Ever know that what you fear is what you find
This indian summer
I signed my life away
There's a greedy fly in here
And I fly away

Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind, mind, mind
Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind, mind, mind
Mind, mind, mind, mind
Mind, mind, mindEmbed
