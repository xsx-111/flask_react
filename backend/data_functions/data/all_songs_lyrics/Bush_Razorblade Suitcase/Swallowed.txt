Swallowed LyricsWarm sun feed me up
I'm leery loaded up
Loathing for a change
And I slip some
Boil away
(Chorus)
Swallowed, followed
Heavy about everything
But my love
Swallowed, sorrowed
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet
Just wanna be myself
Hey you said you would love to try some
Hey you said you would love to die some
In the middle of a world on a fish hook
You're the wave
You're the wave
You're the wave
(Chorus)
Swallowed, borrowed
Heavy about everything
But my love
Swallowed, hollowed
Sharp about everyone
But yourself
Swallowed, oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet
Piss on self-esteem
Forward busted knee
Sick head
Blackened lungs
And I'm a simple selfish son
(Chorus)
Swallowed, followed
Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed, oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here
I miss the one that I love a lot
I miss the one that I love a lot
I miss the one that I love a lotEmbed
