Straight no Chaser LyricsAlways be there
Face I live with
Always be there
Face I live with
Abscess memory
With broken fingers
All the fallen down angels
Raw pain, distress
It's all
In the way we know
That we could have it all
Some
Satellites of pain
Can't always be ignored
War on all sides
War on all sides
Drink life as it comes
Straight, no chaser
Life as it comes
Straight, no chaser
Climb inside you
Away from strangers
Building a system
Of alleys and motorways
It's all
In the way we know
That we could have it all
Some
Satellites of pain
Can't always be ignored
It's all
In the face of what
We thought we knew before
War on all sides
War on all sides
War on all sides
Keep on driving
Hair left morning wet
There's nothing like losing you
There's nothing like losing you
There's nothing like losing you
There's nothing like losing youEmbed
