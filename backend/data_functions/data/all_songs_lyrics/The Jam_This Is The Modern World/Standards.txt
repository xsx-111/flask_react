Standards LyricsOh we make the standards and we make the rules
And if you don't abide by them, you must be a fool
We have the power to control the whole land
You never must question our motives or plans
We'll outlaw your voices, do anything we want
We've nothing to fear from the nation
We'll kick you out your houses if you get too much
If we have to, we'll destroy your generation
We've built up a frontage and we've gained respect
There's no one to endanger our position
Standards rule OK
Standards rule OK
Standards rule OK
Standards rule OK
And we don't like people who stand in our way
Awareness is gonna be redundant
And ignorance is strength, we have God on our side
Look, you know what happened to Winston
Oh we make the standards and we make the rules
And if you don't abide by them, you must be a fool
We have the power to control the whole land
You never must question our motives or plans
Standards rule OK
Standards rule OK
Standards rule OK
Standards rule OK
Standards rule
Standards rule
Standards rule
