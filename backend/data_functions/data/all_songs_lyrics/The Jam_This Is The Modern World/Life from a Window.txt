Life from a Window LyricsLooking from a hilltop
Watching from a lighthouse, just dreaming
Up here I can see the world
Sometimes it don't look nice
But that's OK
Life from a window
I'm just taking in the view
Life from a window
Observing everything around you
Staring at a grey sky
Trying to paint it blue
Teenage blue
Life from a window
I'm just taking in the view
Life from a window
Watching everyone around you
Some people that you see around you
Tell you how devoted they are
They tell you something new on Sunday, but come Monday
They've changed their minds
I'm looking from a skyscraper
I'm standing on the post office tower
So I can see
All there is to see
Life from a window
I'm taking in the view
Life from a window
Watching everything around you
I'm looking from a skyscraper
I'm standing on the post pffice tower
So I can see
All there is to seeEmbed
