The Weaver Lyrics
Observing the shades
Interpreting signs
Reporting the patterns
Row by line

Liturgical tales I live and tell
Infused and entwined like threads in the tapestry

I am, therefore I do
Explore, I am the Weaver
I do, therefore become
A seer and believer

Observing the shades
Interpreting signs
Reporting the patterns
Row by line

I am, therefore I do
Explore, I am The Weaver
I do, therefore become
A seer and believer
I am, therefore I do
Explore, I am the Weaver
I do, therefore become
A seer and believer

Observing the shades
Interpreting signs
Reporting the patterns
Row by line

Elegiacal songs I live and tell
Spun and woven like threads in a tapestry
