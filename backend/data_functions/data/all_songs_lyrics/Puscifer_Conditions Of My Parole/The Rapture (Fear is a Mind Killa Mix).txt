The Rapture (Fear is a Mind Killa Mix) Lyrics
I see you lingerin' 'round
Like a bad idea
Peddlin' salvation
Threatenin' damnation

About to drop you like Cain
Like Cain dropped Abel
About to drop you like Cain
Like Cain dropped Abel

You're no medium
Just the scum on the shallow end of assumption
Time to come correct, son
Rapture my ass
You better hope he takes you
Before I do

About to drop you like Cain
Like Cain dropped Abel
About to drop you like Cain
You better hope he takes you
About to drop you like Cain
I've had enough of your voodoo
About to drop you like Cain
You better hope he takes you
Up the Sodom
You're Gomorrah deliverin' redemption
Feel my resurrection

Before I doEmbed
