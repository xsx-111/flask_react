Telling Ghosts Lyrics
The more you take the more you need
The more you suck the more you bleed
The dead know better, so listen to the letter
The more you suck the more you bleed

Echoes and specters and ghosts of none the wiser
Apparitions each of bad decisions brush on by
Envious in the ever after
Electric fuzzy haze of regrets and dreams denied

Paramount to pompous, disregard the cipher
Ignorant, the Gluttons and the Needy rush on by these
Messages from the ever after
Dead letter office, deliverance denied

The more you take the more you need
The more you suck the more you bleed
The dead know better, so listen to the letter
The more you suck the more you bleed

Echoes and specters and ghosts of none the wiser
Apparitions each of bad decisions brush on by
Envious in the ever after
Electric fuzzy haze of regrets and dreams denied
The more you take the more you need
The more you suck the more you bleed
The dead know better, so listen to the letter
The more you suck the more you bleed
The more you take the more you need
The more you suck the more you bleed
The dead know better, so listen to the letter
The more you suck the more you bleed3Embed
