Toma Lyrics

Toma g端ey

Stole my patience, stole my pride
Snatched the rhythm from my stride
Kicked my certainty up the middle
Knocked the wind out of my romantic side
Hopes and wishes set aflame
What's your purpose here, whatcha hope to gain?
Took my dignity, you took my dignity
Burned a lover so earned an enemy

Time to make it right, how it's gonna be
Watch you pay the toll right in front of me
Time to pay your due, it's time to set you straight
Take what you dish out, toma g端ey

Hopes and wishes set aflame
What's your purpose here, whatcha hope to gain?
You took my dignity, you took my dignity
Lost a lover and earned an enemy
Time to make it right, how it's gonna be
Watch you pay the toll right in front of me
Time to pay your due, it's time to set you straight
Take what you dish out, toma g端ey
Time to make it right, how it's gonna be
Watch you pay the toll right in front of me
Time to pay your due, it's time to set you straight
Take what you dish out, toma g端eyEmbed
