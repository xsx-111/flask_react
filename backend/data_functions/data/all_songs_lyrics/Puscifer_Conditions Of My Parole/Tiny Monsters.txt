Tiny Monsters LyricsDay gives way to night
On the storefront mannequins
The audience with Mona Lisa grins
Moonlight builds emotion
As the players scuttle in
Pull the curtain back and let the show begin
Moon of mischief under low light discipline
Here the tiny monsters hunt for harlequins
Silent patrons view the drama
Under low light discipline
Here the tiny monsters hunt for harlequins
Moon of mischief
We kill, be killed or run
To be or not to be beyond the dawnEmbed
