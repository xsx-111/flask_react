Man Overboard LyricsBlood sky every mornin'
Shoulda seen the warnin'
Captain to the Seaman
Man your battle stations
Poseidon's on a mission
'Bout to turn it up to eleven
Captain to the Seaman
Assume crash positions
Toss the extras over
About to take on water
Blood sky every mornin' (all hands on deck, all hands on deck)
Shoulda seen the warnin' (coulda, shoulda)
Poseidon's on a mission (brace yourself, brace yourself)
'Bout to turn it up to eleven
Mind the sails, mind the sails (mind the sails, mind the sails)
All hands on, all hands on deck (all hands on deck)
Women and children first (women and children first)
Bail sailor, bail, bail, bail (bail, bail, bail)
Brace yourself, brace yourself (brace yourself, brace yourself)
Brace yourself, brace yourself a twelve (brace yourself a twelve)
All hands on, all hands on deck (all hands on deck)
All hands on, all hands on (all hands on, all hands on)
Blood sky every mornin' (all hands on, all hands on deck)
Shoulda seen the warnin' (woulda, coulda, shoulda, shoulda)
Poseidon's on a mission (brace yourself, brace yourself)
'Bout to turn it up to eleven (brace yourself, brace yourself)
Captain to the Seaman (here come the gales, mind the sails, mind the sails)
Assume crash positions (all hands on, all hands on deck)
Toss the extras over (women and children, women and children first)
About to take on water (bail sailor, bail, bail, bail)
Poseidon's on a mission (brace yourself, brace yourself, brace yourself)
'Bout to turn it up to eleven (brace yourself, brace yourself, brace yourself)
Poseidon's on a mission (brace yourself, brace yourself, brace yourself)
'Bout to turn it up to eleven (brace yourself, brace yourself a twelve, brace yourself a twelve, brace yourself a twelve)2Embed
