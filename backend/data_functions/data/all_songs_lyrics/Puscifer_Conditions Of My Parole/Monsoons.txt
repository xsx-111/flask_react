Monsoons LyricsValley Heat is rising
Relieve us
Long exhale to heaven
Believe us
Valley Heat is rising
Relieve us
Long exhale to heaven
Relieve us
Dry, the desert touches sky
A prayer for deliverance from on high
And pray, the sky will understand
And cry and pour emotion down
Only you can bring the color in
You alone breathe the hope into our world
The patient pleading ground
Without you, brittle, grey and brown
Only you can bring the color in
So I and mine can carry on too
You can bring the color in
So I and mine can carry on
We pray, the sky will understand
(Heaven relieve us)
And cry, emotion pouring down
(Heaven relieve us)
Only you can bring the color in
So I and mine can carry on
Till' you can bring the color in
So I and mine can carry on
Till' you can bring the color in
So I and mine can carry on another day1Embed
