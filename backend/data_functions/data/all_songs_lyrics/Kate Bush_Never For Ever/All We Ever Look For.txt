All We Ever Look For Lyrics
Just look at your father and you'll see how you took after him
Me, I'm just another like my brothers of my mother's genes

All they really want for you
Are the things they didn't do
All they ever wanted, a little clue
All they ever wanted, the truth
All they ever wanted, a little bit of you
All they ever wanted
But they never did get


The whims that we're weeping for our parents would be beaten for
Leave the breast and then the nest and then regret you ever left

All we're really looking for, is another open door
All we ever look for, another womb
All we ever look for is our own tomb
All we ever look for, ooh, la lune
All we ever look for, just a little bit of you, too
All we ever look for
But we never do score

All we ever look for, a god
All we ever look for, ooh, a drug
All we ever look for, a great big hug
All we ever look for, just a little bit of you
All we ever look for, just a little bit of you, too
All we ever look for
But we never do score2Embed
