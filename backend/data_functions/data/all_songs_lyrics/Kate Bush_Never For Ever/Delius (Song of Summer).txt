Delius
Ooh, he's a moody old man
Delius
Song of summer in his hand
Delius
Ooh, he's a moody old man
Delius
In his hand
Delius
In his hand

Delius
To be sung of a summer
Delius
Night on the water
Delius
Ooh, on the water
Delius
"Ta, ta-ta!
In B, Fenby!
Ta, ta-ta!"

Syphilis

Genius, ooh

To be sung of a summer
Night on the water
Ooh, on the water
