Violin Lyrics
Four strings across the bridge
Ready to carry me over
Over the quavers, drunk in the bars
Out of the realm of the orchestra
Out of the realm of the orchestra

Filling me up with the shivers
Filling me up with the shivers and quivers
Filling me up with the shivers

Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin
Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin

Paganini up on the chimney
Lord of the dance with Nero and old Nicky
Whack that devil into my fiddlestick
Give me the Banshees for B.V.s
Give me the Banshees for B.V.s
Jigging along with the fiddle, oh, Johnny
Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-dee
Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-diddle-dee-dee!

Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin
Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin


Jigging along with the fiddle, oh, Johnny
Jigging along with the fiddle, oh, Johnny
Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-diddle-dee-dee!

Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin
Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin
Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin
Get the bow going
Let it scream to me
Violin, violin, violin1Embed
