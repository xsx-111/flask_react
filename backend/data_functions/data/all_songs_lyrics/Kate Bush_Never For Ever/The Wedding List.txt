The Wedding List Lyrics
No, I'll never give the hunt up
And I won't muck it up
Somehow this was it, I knew
Maybe fate wants you dead too
We've come together in the very same room
And I'm coming for you

Do you think I'd ever let you
Get away with it, huh?
He swooned in warm maroon
There's gas in your barrel, and I'm flooded with doom
You've made a wake of our honeymoon
And I'm coming for you!

All of the headlines said "Passion Crime:
Newly Weds, Groom Shot Dead
Mystery Man, God Help the Bride
She's a widow, all in red
With his red still wet"

She said
I'll put him on the wedding list
I'll put him on the wedding list
I'll get him and I will not miss
And now, as I'm coming for you
All I see is Rudi
I die with him, again and again
And I feel good in my revenge
I'm gonna fill your head with lead
I'm coming for you

And when it's all over you'll roll over
The butt of my gun
One in your belly, and one for Rudi
You got what you gave by the heel of my bootie
Bang bang, out like an old cherootie
I'm coming for you

All of the headlines said "Passion Crime:
Newly Weds, Groom Shot Dead
Mystery Man, God Help the Bride
She's a widow, all in red
With his red still wet"

But she sure got him on the wedding list
I got him on the wedding list!
I got him and I did not miss
I pinned him on the wedding list!
And after she shot the guy
She committed suicide
I'm coming, Rudi!
And later, when they analysed
They found a little one inside
It must have been Rudi's child
I shot, shot, shot him honey!
Never mind, she got the guy
He hit the ground, Rudi!
An eye for an eye
Ashes to ashes to ashes
An eye for an eye
I hit him, hit him
An eye for an eye
Rudi! Rudi!
I'm coming, coming, coming, honey
An eye for an eye
Rudi!Embed
