Blow Away (For Bill) Lyrics
One of the band told me last night
That music is all that he's got in his life
And where will it go?
Surely not with his soul
Will all of his licks and his R'n'B blow away?

Blow away
Blow away
Blow away
Blow away
Blow away
Blow away

Our engineer had a different idea
From people who nearly died but survived
Feeling no fear of leaving their bodies here
And went to a room that was soon full of visitors

Hello Minnie, Moony, Vicious
Vicious, Buddy Holly, Sandy Denny

Please don't thump me
Don't bump me
Don't dump me back there
Please don't thump me
Don't bump me
Don't dump me back there
Please don't thump me
Don't bump me
I want to stay here
Put out the light, then, put out the light
Vibes in the sky invite you to dine
Dust to dust
Blow to blow
Bolan and Moony are heading the show tonight

Hello Minnie, Moony, Vicious
Vicious, Buddy Holly, Sandy Denny

Please don't thump me
Don't bump me
Don't dump me back there
Please don't thump me
Don't bump me
Don't dump me back there
Please don't thump me
Don't bump me
I want to stay here3Embed
