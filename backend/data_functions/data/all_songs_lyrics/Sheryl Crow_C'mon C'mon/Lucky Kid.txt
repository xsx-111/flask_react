Lucky Kid Lyrics
I wanna take you down to the river
I wanna wash the blood from your hands
I wanna make you see you belong to me
And you won't ever win
I wanna walk out over the water
I wanna tear my heart from my chest
I wanna change my face
Wanna leave this place
Start all over again
Well, don't you know

You're wasted
You got more than you asked for
Wasted
You went in through the out door
Oh oh oh oh oh, you're a lucky kid
Wasted

I wanna turn you into a Corvette
I wanna drive you out of your mind
I wanna watch your face
When you reach that place
That you could never find
I wanna make you scream for mercy
I wanna break the silence within
And take you to your knees
Just like you did me
And crawl around in your skin
Oh, don't you know
Wasted
You get more than you asked for
Wasted
You get out through the in door
Oh oh oh oh oh, you're a lucky kid
Wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh, you're a lucky kid
Wasted

Wasted
You got more than you asked for
Wasted
You went in through the out door
You tasted
What you never had before
You wasted
Everything and now you're such a bore
Oh oh oh oh oh, but you're a lucky kid
Wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh, 'cause I know what you did
Wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh, yeah you're a lucky kid
I got your number
Oh oh oh oh oh, you get away with itEmbed
