Hole in My Pocket Lyrics
You can tell me the world is round
And I'll prove to you it's square
You can keep your feet on the ground
But I'll be walking on air
You're pretty good at waiting
While I go running around
Well that's just the way it is

You know I, I got a hole in my pocket
You give me love and I drop it
I guess I'll throw it away

We stick together
With every day that passes by
But I'm just like the weather
I keep on changing my mind
Well you can hardly believe it
Every time I turn and say, well
Good morning, I'm leaving
And I'll be back in a few days
But that's just the way it is

You know I, I got a hole in my pocket
You give me love and I drop it
I guess I'll throw it away
Oh I, I got a four leaf clover
I'll throw it over my shoulder
I'm gonna need it someday
When things don't go right, you lead me
Torn up and tied, you free me
When life is strange, you take me
Through every change, you never break me
You got a feeling there's a wall that you can never climb
I try to be there where you are, I try to be on time
But I lose my way

I, I got a hole in my pocket
I take your love and I drop it
I guess I'll throw it away
Oh I, I got a four leaf clover
I'll throw it over my shoulder
I'm gonna need it someday
Oh I, I got a hole in my pocket
You gave me love and I lost it
I guess I'll throw it away
Oh I, I got a four leaf clover
I wanna do it all over
Before it gets too late
I, I got a hole in my pocket
I took your love and I dropped it
I guess I threw it awayEmbed
