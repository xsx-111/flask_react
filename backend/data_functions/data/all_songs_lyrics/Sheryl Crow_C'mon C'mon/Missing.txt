Missing Lyrics
Feeling weak today
Run the risk of tears
Falling down your cheeks
From all the lonely years
Holding back your love
While she races up the hill
Chase what you dream of
But always standing still

All in all you see
Everything is history
Think of all that you've been missing
And every now and then
Shadows bring you back again
To think of all the things you're missing

Lay the pictures out
Pull the curtains down
Don't let us see you break
Your happiness you fake
Sending up a flare
If anybody really cares
To talk a little while
The past to reconcile
All in all you see
Everything is history
Think of all the things you're missing
Every now and then
I can almost picture him
Think of all the things
Of all the things
Of all the things

Well I do
I do
Hear the morning creeping in
And the spirit sings again
Well you will
You will
See the beauty in this moment
Every time you're standing still
Time you're standing still

These times are temporary
Someday the wind will carry you home
And you'll be free
And you'll be free
No one will pull you down
You'll wake up and look around
And never again
Think of all, all that you've been missing
Oh oh oh
All that you've been missing
Oh
All in all you see
Everything is history
Think of all that you've been missingEmbed
