I Want You Lyrics
You walk in to my dreams
With a halo and a bottle of cheap wine
You wrote your name on my jeans
And now I can't erase you from my mind
Not this time

I want you, I want you
And could it be you really want me too
I want you, you know it's true
And I'm so happy that you want me too

You say yes to this world
But your green eyes are always best in show
So don't forget I'm your girl
Whenever you see someone else you know
Well don't let it go

'Cause I want you, yeah I want you
And could it be you really want me too
I want you, you know it's true
And I'm so happy that you want me too
I don't want to sell you nothing
Tie you up and keep you running
I just want a friend to call my own
I've been chewed up and spit out
Passed over, forgot about
Until you picked me up and took me home

I want you, I want you
And can it be you really want me too
I want you, yeah you know it's true
And I'm so happy that you want me too
I don't want to sell you nothing
Tie you up and keep you running
I just want a friend to call my own
I want you, yeah you know it's true, baby
And I'm so happy that you want me tooEmbed
