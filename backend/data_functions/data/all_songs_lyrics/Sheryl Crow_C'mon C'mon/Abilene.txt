Abilene Lyrics
Can't you see I'm holdin' your flag?
The one that you left on the ground
Well is the world too heavy for you?
And if it makes you feel better I'll carry it too
'Cause no one's going to stand in your light
Impressions are easy to fight
But until you turn to me and say
You don't need anyone to carry the weight, I will stay

Abilene
Bring it on home to me
Abilene
Isn't it good to be free?

Can't you see I'm wearin' your shirt?
The one with the heart on the sleeve
Now everyone can see you've been hurt
Oh, but honey don't give up on me
When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna get out of bed?
Well everyday you're gonna find
Broken promises are no worse than words never said
Abilene
Bring it on home to me
Abilene
You're always givin' it all away

Then you want someone to come along and save the day
But you make it much too hard

Abilene
You can bring it home to me
Abilene
Oh
Abilene
Bring it on home to me
Abilene
Isn't it good to be free?

Ooh, oh
Ooh, ohEmbed
