Weather Channel Lyrics
Sunny morning
You can hear it
Siren's warning
There is weather on both sides
And I know it's coming
Just like before
There's a black dog
That scratches my door
He's been growling my name saying
You better get to running

Can you make it better for me?
Can you make me see the light of day?
Because I got no one
Who will bring me a
Big umbrella
So I'm watching the weather channel
And waiting for the storm

It's just sugar
Just a pill to make me happy
I know it may not fix the hinges
But at least the door has stopped its creaking
I got friends they're
Waiting for me to comb out my hair
Come outside and join the human race
But I don't feel so human
Can you make it better for me?
Can you make me see the light of day?
'Cause I got lab coats
Who will bring me a panacea
But I'm watching the weather channel
And waiting for the storm

You won't want me
Hanging around the birthday pony
Even though it's just a game
You know we are the same
But you're the better fakerEmbed
