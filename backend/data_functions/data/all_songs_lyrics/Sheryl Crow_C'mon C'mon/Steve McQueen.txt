Steve McQueen Lyrics
Well I went to bed in Memphis
And I woke up in Hollywood
I got a quarter in my pocket
And I'd call you if I could
But I don't know why
I gotta fly

I wanna rock and roll this party
I still wanna have some fun
I wanna leave you feeling breathless
Show you how the west was won
But I gotta fly
I gotta fly

Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine
And I'm gonna make it all right (woo, woo)
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight (woo, woo)

I ain't taking shit off no one
Baby, that was yesterday
I'm an all-American rebel
Making my big getaway
Yeah, you know it's time
I gotta fly
Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine
And I'm gonna make it all right (woo, woo)
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight (woo, woo)
Like Steve McQueen (woo, woo)
Like Steve McQueen

We got rockstars in the White House
And all our pop stars look like porn
All my heroes hit the highway
'Cause they don't hang out here no more

You can drum me on my cellphone
You can page me all night long
But you won't catch this free bird
I'll already be long gone

Like Steve McQueen
All we need's a fast machine
And we're gonna make it all right (woo, woo)
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch us tonight (woo, woo)
Like Steve McQueen
All we need's a fast machine
And we're gonna ride it all night (woo, woo)
Like Steve McQueen
Underneath your radar screen
You'll never catch me tonight (woo, woo)Embed
