Over You Lyrics
I feel like cherry wine
Like Valentine's
Like the spring is coming
And everything is alright
'Cause I've got a love that's new
I hear you're happy too
That's the way it should be
But lately I feel like crying

I wanna get over you
But you're everywhere
And I just can't get away
I gotta get over you
'Cause it's just not fair
That I, I still see your face

I heard your name today
I walked away
'Cause everyone's still talking
I don't need that in my life
Got better things to do
Than worry about you
I'm gonna keep on walking
But sometimes I, I don't know why
I wanna get over you
'Cause you're everywhere
And I just can't get away
I gotta get over you
'Cause it's just not fair
That I see your face

Well we had a good time
But time goes on
You didn't really want me 'til I was gone

I wanna get over you
Before you get over me
Over me

I wanna get over you
But you just won't let me
And I can't get away
I gotta get over you
But I can't forget the
Things that I said
Still ringing in my head
I wanna get over you
But you're always longer than I
I just can't get away (gotta get over you)
I gotta get over you
'Cause it's so unfair
That I still can see your face, oh
Ooh, ooh
I'm gonna walk into your house someday
Tell you that you never could've made me stayEmbed
