Safe and Sound Lyrics
Maybe this is forever
Forever fades away
Like a rocket ascending into space
Could you not be sad
Could you not break down
After all I won't let go

Until you're safe and sound
Until you're safe and sound
There's beauty in release
There's no one left to please
But you and me

I don't blame you for quitting
I know you really try
If only you could hang on through the night
'Cause I don't want to be lonely
I don't want to be scared
And all our friends are waiting there

Until you're safe and sound
Until you're safe and sound
There's beauty in release
There's no one left to please
But you and me
Sound
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I could've held on
Feel like I could've let go
Feel like I could've helped you
Feel like I could've changed you
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I could've held you
Feel like I could've hurt you
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I was a stranger
Feel like I was an angel
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I was a hero
Feel like I was a zero
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I should've heard you
Feel like I could have healed you
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I could have changed you
Feel like I could've heard you
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I could have healed you
Feel like I should've told you
Until you're safe and sound
I feel like I could have loved you
I feel like I could have loved you
I feel like I could have loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
Feel like I could've saved you
Feel like I could've saved you
Feel like I could've saved youEmbed
