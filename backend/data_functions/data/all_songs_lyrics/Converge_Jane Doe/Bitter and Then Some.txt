Bitter and Then Some LyricsDeath to cowards, traitors, and empty words
To those adorned with the touch of rose petals
And the blessed gift of forgetfulness
For these are your years and days to outshine
Push on and soar higher
This is your memory, your everything, and the in-between
Push on and soar higher
Death to traitors, cowards, and empty words
Death to traitors, cowards, and empty words
Death to traitors, cowards, and empty words
Death to traitors, cowards, and empty wordsEmbed
