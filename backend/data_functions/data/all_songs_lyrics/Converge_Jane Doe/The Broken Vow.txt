The Broken Vow LyricsThose nights we had, and the trust we lost
Those nights we had, and the trust we lost
Those nights we had, and the trust we lost
Those nights we had, and the trust we lost
(It all reminds me)
(It all reminds me)
(Of the sleep that fled)
(And the heart we lost)
Just how callous and heartless the true cowards are
And I write this
(For the loveless) For the loveless
(And for the risks we take) For the risks we take
(I'll take my love) To my grave
(I'll take my love) To my grave
(For the loveless) For the loveless
(And for the risks we take) For the risks we take
(I'll take my love) I'll take my love
(I'll take my love) To my grave
As tired and worn it is
I'l take my love to the grave
I'l take my love to the grave
I'l take my love to the grave
I'l take my love to the grave
I'l take my love to the grave
I'l take my love to the grave1Embed
