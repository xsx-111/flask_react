Concubine LyricsDear, I'll stay gold just to keep these pasts at bay
To keep the loneliest of nights from claiming you
And to keep these longest of days from waking you
For I felt the greatest of winters coming
And I saw you as seasons shifting from blue to grey
That's where the coldest of these days await me
And distance lays her heavy head beside me
There I'll stay gold, forever gold2Embed
