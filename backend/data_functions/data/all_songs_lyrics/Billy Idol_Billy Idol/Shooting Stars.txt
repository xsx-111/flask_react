Shooting Stars Lyrics
Here I come again

It is the end of the night
And baby snuck out tonight
Whoa, but to her strange vibe
To make her feel all right

For baby's feeling sick
Well, now she tried so hard
So hard to be hip
She's shooting stars
With her friends
She's shooting stars
'Til the end
I think it's kinda sick
She thinks she's really hip
Whoa, it can be so lame
If you wanna play that game
Why don't you listen to me?

Don't go out tonight
Don't go out with no boy
Oh, your head's always to the ground, baby
On the scrounge at the Peppermint Lounge
Baby's feeling sick
Well, now she tried so hard
So hard to be hip
She's shooting stars
With her friends
She's shooting stars
'Til the end
Well, I think it's kinda sick
She thinks she's really hip
Well, you wanna play the fool
You wanna be so cruel
You wanna shoot that hero
Oh, don't you know that, baby
Well, you better listen to me

It is the end of the night
And baby snuck out tonight
Too many sing marks on her arms
To do her any more harm

Baby's feeling sick
They tracked her down
And she's tryin' so hard
So hard to be hip
She's shooting stars
With her friends
Oh, she's shooting stars
'Til the end
She's shooting stars
With her friends
She's shooting stars
'Til the end
Come on, be her friend
You know she ain't that strong
You know she ain't that strongEmbed
