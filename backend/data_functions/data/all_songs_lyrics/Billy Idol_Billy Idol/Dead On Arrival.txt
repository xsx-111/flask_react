Dead On Arrival Lyrics
Ow!

Dead on arrival
Well, that's how they pronounced him
But I'm out for survival
I'm alive in this town
Ow! It took the vital injection
From that sweaty little girl child
Whoo! She had the blood of conviction
I'm alive and hurtin'

And they said,"Where did you go?"
And "What did you do?"
Well what's gonna happen when he gets shot with love?

Dead on arrival
They thought that nothing would save me
But I know what could break me  (ow)
Dead on arrival
You were my death reflected
I love to tiptoe
That brought me into this town
I got a vital injection
And a gun at my head, man
From a thrill hit redhead
That brought me into this town
Well where did you go?
And what did you do?
Walked on out, and he gets shot with love
With love, with love yeah
Yeah

All right!
I said 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Oooooh, oooooh, oooooh, oooooh

Dead on arrival
Well, that ain't a prediction
Fact or fiction
I'm alive in your town
Don't try to shake me (ooh)
Don't try to break me
I know what can save me
They take the blood in her town
And they said,"Where did you go?"
And "What did you do?"
Well, what's gonna happen when he gets shot with love?
With love, with love, yeah
Oooooh, oooooh, oooooh, oooooh
Oooooh, oooooh, oooooh, oooooh....Embed
