Come On, Come On Lyrics
Diamonds, rubies, pearls, fame and fortune, no less
Won't get you what you need, only double-crosses and death
It's only your fear, sister dear, never fear
No one's gonna make you fight for your love life tonight, oh

How do I know?
It's because I believe
In a love that is so strong
It's a love crush number one
If a love crush says come on

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
Yeah, I said come on
Wow, I said come on
Yes, like this
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
Yes, like this

Yeah, you know ravings, cravings, savings, addictions for sure
We don't need no panic, fascist no more
Reality for fear, sister dear, don't you fear
No one's gonna make you fight for your love life tonight, oh no
Why do I know?
It's because I believe
In a love that is so strong
In a love crush number one
It's a love that says come on

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
Yeah, I said come on
Wow, I said come on
Yes, like this
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
Yes, like this

I said no longer room at the top
Guns bead down and the pressure drop
No longer room at the top
The guns bead down and the pressure dropped

How do I know?
It's because I believe
In a love that is so strong
It's a love crush number one
And that's a love that says come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
You're gonna get it tonight
You're gonna get it tonight
You're gonna get it tonight
You're gonna get it tonightEmbed
