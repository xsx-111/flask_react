Love Calling Lyrics
Sun goes down, I rise
Red hair flames so bright
Passion breaks the night
Steal into her mind
Walk without a sound
Fire in the mountains now
Wow!

If you wanna rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you wanna rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling (love calling), love calling (love calling)
If you wanna rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you wanna rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling (love calling)

So, baby, rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Ooo, baby, rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Song man dreams for you
Moves his clapping sticks
Turns us into snakes
Hot hits
And the blue moon move, move, move
Move until we die
Move until she cries
Wow!

If you wanna rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you wanna rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling (love calling), love calling (love calling)
If you wanna rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you wanna rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling (love calling)
Oo, baby, rock on
Wow!
If you wanna rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you wanna rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling (love calling), love calling (love calling)
If you wanna rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you wanna rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling (love calling)
Wooo, baby, rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Wooo, baby, rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Wooo, baby, rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Wooo, baby, rock onEmbed
