Hole In the Wall Lyrics
Hey, baby, where did you go
When the down down got too much?
Hey baby, where will you be found
When the down down gets too much?
We were such an ugly pair
The chameleon twins, they'd stop and stare
Lovers know when love has gone
A black hole there where love was once the end

Hey, baby, where will you be
When the crack, crack gets too much (Crack)
Hey baby, where will you go
When the crack, crack gets too much
Oh, we were such an ugly pair
The chameleon twins, they'd stop and stare
Lovers know when love has gone
A black hole there where love was once the end
Yeah yeah

There's a hole in the wall
There's a hole in the wall
Ooh, a hole in the wall
There's a hole in the wall
(She has, under our expert persuasion)
(Has implicated you in high treason)
(You are under arrest)
(Do you have any final requests, requests?)
It's a move to take you through
It's a move to take you through
It's a move to take you through
To take you through
To take you through
(You have until the sand runs up)
(Do you have any final requests?)
(You look great, you look great)
(You look great)
Whoo!

Hey, babe, where will you go when that hole in
The wall is shut?
Woah, babe, you know where I'll be when that
Hole in wall is shut
We were such an ugly pair
The chameleon twins, they'd stop and stare
Lovers know when love has gone
A black hole there where love was once the end
There's a hole in the wall
Ooh, a hole in the wall
There's a hole in the wall
Catch it before you fall
The hole in the wall
There's a hole in the wall
Ooh, a hole in the wallEmbed
