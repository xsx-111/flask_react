Dancing With Myself Lyrics
On the floors of Tokyo-o
Or down in London town to go, go
A-with the record selection and the mirror's reflection
I'm a-dancing with myself
Oh, when there's no one else in sight
A-in the crowded lonely night
Well, I wait so long for my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

Oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
When there's nothing to lose, and there's nothing to prove
And I'm dancing with myself, oh, oh, uh-oh

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
When there's nothing to lose, and there's nothing to prove
And I'm dancing with myself, oh, oh, uh-oh

Oh, oh, uh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, uh-uh, oh, ow!


Well, if I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
Oohhhhhaaaawwww!!
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh

(Dancing with myself, oh, oh) Oh, it's all wet
(Dancing with myself, oh, oh) And I'll sweat
(Dancing with myself, oh, oh) And I'll sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
(Dancing with myself, oh, oh) Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
(Dancing with myself, oh, oh) Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
(Dancing with myself, oh, oh) Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Oh!
Dancing with myself, oh!
Ow!
