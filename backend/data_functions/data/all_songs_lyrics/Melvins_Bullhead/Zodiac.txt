Zodiac LyricsLocked down
And so I notice
And so of course I let it
Lost in soul
Like the poets
Like a mole low lead
Lost more
A lack of sense
To pounce on ya
Lost
I fall upon this
And I'm Adonis at home
Once more like the Duchess of Man
Like a T shown one lap
A lost man
Like I told this
For peace only
Crossed
In both solace
In the course of love and man
Lost more
THan both send
It comes with miracles and then
Cross man goes
Like a toad
For peace only
Lost
I was a live
I caught a life-like force-slam
Once more
Like a beautiful name
Like T shown low low low
Cross man
In case you notice
Cross that don't laugh
Cause I can only figure
My time away
I could tell but wish I could prevent
The way we went
You know by the way you spend this
So bored and so left
You can tell by the thought of bigger ones
You save a man
Oh yeah
I forgot to get my pills
I got to go downtown
Cause I can wear a coat
Like some manly man
You know that the house can live
Like some bandstand mind
I confess I know it's like the timid
Face of man that's hiding
Play in the sandbox
And jump and ever poured just sand
Oh yeah
I forgot to get my pills
I got to downtownEmbed
