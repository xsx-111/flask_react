Anaconda LyricsLike it soar a lore a lie
What tells a mine to mine
Ruff sewed in mullnin' sa heartbreaka
Cause she could lonely sell
Like moanin' wosta lie sin
Cause she's a keen
Like he knows a shosin wona lus
Cause he's a whole sinna
Little pigs and Little Little heartleaks . . hugh! hugh!
I just thought you'd enjoy
I sonio mine and lie so low
And like a suck a wonder the san-lo
Like sonay a wosay wonay
Little queen
And little heart attack Sarah
Popa lowEmbed
