Ligature LyricsI can see you in like a rell
Like a man doe in law
And row
Like some dance stone in less
And row stole
I might nemo men coz
And lacks
Coz I can see you in like a bread
Check my memo lee laws
And row sow
Low munned in south it now
And roast to sell
Coz my man'll be law
And row sowEmbed
