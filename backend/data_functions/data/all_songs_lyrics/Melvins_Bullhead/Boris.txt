Boris LyricsI'd like to take I like to feel wanted
Taken up and take them tall
I like to make a lot of generate the one eyed mouse
Build 'em up and let 'em fall
Just lay 'em on and leave the linen tight
Taken up and take them tall
Generate, lay them flat like monkey man
Leave 'em built, right, stand 'em tie them down
It's like sin
Boris likes a lot of little things to kick
Mix every single one that he could ever need
Boris feed
Let friend, spoon, friend, stone, lie
Let's make/take, let's feel wanted
Taken up and take 'em tall
My shake, mines monkey paddle
Boris knows and Boris likes it all
It's like sin
It's a killer she's a killer maker
It reaches in and takes, from the back of your mind
I'm not awake still alive
20 bucks has the back and see the lines
I got a small, got what they call the lack
A lack o' halfway cooked, but it's on my own
I say I can't but I really mean I won't
In the arm, or maybe up the nose
I see it all
See Boris has way of seein' through my eyes
He touches in a fashion, a master of mime
Manipulatin' me my arms and legs and spine
He's got you pawed
I'm sinkin' told you wait, like a straight on Jew
Let 'em run1Embed
