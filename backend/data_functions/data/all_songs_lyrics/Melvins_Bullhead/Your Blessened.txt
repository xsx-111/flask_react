Your Blessened LyricsYOUR BLESSENED
I like your hands
Mr Cancer see
Fell the timber
I felt you be
And if you were
Just like your will
We can end up
And we can turn up
And we can bleed
When man's only distant relative
Has descended on his own
You will know
Your blessened
I can feel you, babe
Your man-like
Your friendly
Your me
I like your hands
Mr Cancer seeEmbed
