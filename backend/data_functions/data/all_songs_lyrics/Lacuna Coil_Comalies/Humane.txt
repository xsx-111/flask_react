Humane Lyrics
(Ah-ah-ah... a-a-a-ah, ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah... a-a-a-ah, ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah... a-a-a-ah, ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah... a-a-a-ah, ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah... a-a-a-ah, ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah... a-a-a-ah, ah...)

You walk on by without feeling to your stroll
You walk alone...
Compromise is just another contradiction
You're not alone...

There's a place, you've run away
That is in your heart
It is in your heart...

In your heart
Your love again
In your heart
Your love again

There's a place to be afraid
There's another chain to hold an' you don't know
You need it by your side
Just let it know (let it know)
Your hell is when you dream and I'm awake
Look into your heart...
Deep into your heart...

In your heart...
Your love again
In your heart.......
Your love again

There is none for
Love is not afraid...

In your heart...
(Your love again)
In your heart...
(Your love again)
In your heart...
Your love again
In your heart...
Your love again...Embed
