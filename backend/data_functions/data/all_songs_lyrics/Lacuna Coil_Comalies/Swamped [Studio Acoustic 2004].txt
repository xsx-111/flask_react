Swamped  Lyrics
When you're taught through feelings...
When you're taught through feelings...
When you're taught through feelings...
When you're taught through feelings...
Uh-huh...

Destiny flying high above
All I know is that you can realise (realise...)
Destiny who cares (destiny who cares)
As it turns around
And I know that it descends
Down on me
(Ah-hi...)

It's just another day
The shame is gone
It's hard to believe, hey
That I've let it go, let it go, let it go

Destiny can't replace my life
Scary shadows of my past are alive (la la...)
Destiny who cares (destiny who cares...)
As it turns around
And I know that it descends
With a smile
(Ah-hi...)
It's just another day
The shame is gone
It's hard to believe, hey
That I've let it go away
It's just a melody
It bleeds in me
It's hard to believe, hey
That I've let it go

When you're taught through feelings...
When you're taught through feelings...
When you're taught through feelings...
When you're taught through feelings...
Uh...hi...

It's just another day
The shame is gone
It's hard to believe, hey
That I've let it go away
It's just a melody
It bleeds in me
Hard to believe, hey
That I've let it go, let it go, let it goEmbed
