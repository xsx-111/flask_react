Entwined Lyrics
(And you take me over, over again)
(And you take me over, over again)

Wonder
How can I go on and on
When you want to bury my passion?
You are the shell around
And I cannot escape
And I swallow my pride...

Entwined together now
It's time to pass it over
(And you take me over)
Entwined together now
(Over again, and you take me over)
Entwined forever
(Over again...)

Wonder
How can I live on and on
When you want to live in a hurry?
You are the wall that I
That I have to remove
And I swallow, I swallow my pride...
Entwined together now
It's time to pass it over...
Entwined together now...
Entwined forever

And you take me over, over again
And you take me over, over again
And you take me over, over again
And you take me over, over again...

(Entwined together, 'gether, 'gether now...)

Entwined together now
It's time to pass it over
(And you take me over)
Entwined together now
(And you take me over)
Entwined forever...
(Over again)

('Gether, 'gether, 'gether, 'gether)
('Gether, 'gether, 'gether, 'gether...)Embed
