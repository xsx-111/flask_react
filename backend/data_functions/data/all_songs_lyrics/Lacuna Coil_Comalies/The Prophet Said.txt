The Prophet Said Lyrics
Light—of my sun
Light—in this temple
Light—in my truth
Lies—in the darkness

Teasing pureness of your lies
Soreness of delightful mission
Burning up inside your mind
You belong to my possessions

Can't you see that I'm here inside... you?
Can't you see that I'm here inside...?

Light—massive pain
Glide—passive tension
Light—show me how to
Slide—in this pleasure

Teasing pureness of your eyes
Crawling into empty spaces
You could lie and lie again
You belong to my possessions
Can't you see that I'm here inside... you?
Can't you see that I'm here inside...?
Can't you see that I'm here inside... you?
Can't you see that I'm here inside...?

This is my harmony...
I'm in your heart again...
This is the place to live...
Where I'm alone again...
This is my harmony...
I'm here, I lay again...
This is the prayer to give...
I'm all alone again...

This is my harmony...
I'm in your heart again...
This is the place to live...
Where I'm alone again...
This is my harmony...
(A lie in your prayer)
I'm here, I lay again...
(Oh, I'm a lie in a prayer)
This is the prayer to give...
(I'm all alone again...)
I'm all alone again...
(A lie in your prayer, oh, I'm a lie in a prayer, I'm all alone again...)
(A lie in your prayer, oh, I'm a lie in a prayer, I'm all alone again...)
