Unspoken Lyrics
And it doesn't matter how you feel now
Anything at all
Seems to be your only way, so vicious
Heavenly apart
When your envy's on a piece of paper
Let me sweetly smile
You're devouring all the crumbs I'm leaving
Caught up in your lies

You're on
Clawing up my eyes
(Any other side)
I'm feeling your arms around me
On the other side
It's time to go
I'm hearing your voice without words
On the other side

But it doesn't matter how I feel now
Anything at all
Since I've left you with the wrong impression
While I'm still the same
When I turn around and look at my life
Shadows in disguise
But I'm working on an interruption of hypocrisy
You're on
Clawing up my eyes
(Any other side)
I'm feeling your arms around me
On the other side
It's time to go
I'm hearing your voice without words
On the other side

Clawing up my eyes
(Any other side)
I'm feeling your arms around me
On the other side
It's time to go
I'm hearing your voice without words
On the other side


Any other side...
(Any other side)
Any other side...
(Any other side...)
Any other side...
(Any other side, any other side...)
Any other side...
(Any other side, any other side...)Embed
