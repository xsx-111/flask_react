Tight Rope Lyrics
(Self-destruction, activated)

Delighting minds with my shadow
Rely on your way to grow
You want to decide from your cloud
You're lost in a world that I have to repair

You want it all, the greatest smile
Who wants to deny forever?
You're made of ice, I pay the price
For all your unforgiveness

Enlight'ing lies with my shame
Beneath the veil of your flow
Don't try to deny wit' your mouth
So fine it is, knowing you're under the shade

You want it all, the greatest smile
Who wants to deny forever?
You're made of ice, I pay the price
For all your unforgiveness
()
(Self-destruct sequence)

You want it all, the greatest smile
Who wants to deny forever?
You're made of ice, I pay the price
For all your unforgiveness

You want it all, the greatest smile
Who wants to deny forever?
You're made of ice, I pay the price
For all your unforgiveness...
