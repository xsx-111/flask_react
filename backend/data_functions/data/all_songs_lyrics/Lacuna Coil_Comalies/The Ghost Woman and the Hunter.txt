The Ghost Woman and the Hunter Lyrics
Staring at the sun...
No rays down on me...
I call you in my arms...
Embrace is unreal...

You're moving on
We'll never be apart
Just drain my tears
I cry aloud
You're moving on
You'll never be a part
Of all my tears
I cry... aloud

Callin' on your sins...
You're here in my dreams...
A desert place, I'm not alone...
Do you really want to be... me?

You're moving on
We'll never be apart
Just drain my tears
I cry, aloud
You're moving on
You'll never be a part
Of all my tears
I cry...
You're moving on
(And I've gotta be moving on)
We'll never be apart
(And I've gotta be moving on)
Just drain my tears
(And I've gotta be moving on)
I cry... aloud
(And I've gotta be moving on)
You're moving on
(And I've gotta be moving on)
You'll never be a part
(And I've gotta be moving on)
Of all my tears
(And I've gotta be moving on)
I cry...
(And I've gotta be moving on)
You're moving on
(And I've gotta be moving on)
We'll never be apart
(And I've gotta be moving on)
Just drain my tears
(And I've gotta be moving on)
I cry... aloud
(Oh, oh...)
You're moving on
()
You'll never be a part
()
Of all my tears
(Of all my tears)
I cry...
(I cry... I'm moving on, oh-oh...)
