Daylight Dancer Lyrics
Answer me, it can't be so hard
Cry to relieve what's in your heart
Desolation, grief and agony
Try to move down in this grave
Try to believe in every faith
As another bridge to clarity

Want to stay another way (want to stay another way)
Want to stay another way (want to stay another way)

Take another chance to find a distant sanity
And turn your pain in truth
Take another chance to fight a different enemy
And try to free it

Dance with me, it can't be so hard
Time to reveal what's in your heart
Desolation, grief and agony
Walking t'rough a life decayed
While you're repeating your mistakes
There's another chance to try to get away
Take another chance to find a distant sanity
And turn your pain in truth
Take another chance to fight a different enemy
And try to free it...


Want to stay another way...
Want to stay another way...

Take another chance to find a distant sanity
And turn your pain in truth
Take another chance to fight a different enemy
And try to free it...
Take another chance to find a distant sanity
And turn your pain in truth
Take another chance to fight a different enemy
And try to free it...Embed
