Ready For The Monkeyhouse LyricsYour face is like the moment when the sexist hero traps
The slippy villain with the weasel face, you don't have to speak
Your expression is the truth that your words don't say
And the truth won't go away
In many dark corners
I have thought myself about this
Did you do it out of malice
Did you fall or were you kissed
Could you ask your friend in the cowboy jacket
And those boots up to his knee
Would he shut his mouth for me
I've heard just enough
All I want to hear about pipes and drums
And how little time it takes the klutz to come
The golden gift of silence is I don't have to hear you speak
So would you take him out yourself before I put you both back in the street
Now the story shifts and we see a young man
Standing in the wings too old before his time
Collecting gray hairs
He's proud and he's scared and he says "I don't care"
How can he be so blind so how did you corrupt him
You must have got him where it counts
Now he's so numb he's ready to freeze
And you're ready for the monkey house
Ready for the monkey house
The monkey house but you won't take meEmbed
