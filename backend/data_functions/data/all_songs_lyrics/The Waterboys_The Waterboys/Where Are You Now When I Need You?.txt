Where Are You Now When I Need You? Lyrics
Hey Johnny, where are you now when I need you?
Now when I need you so bad?
Just one word come straight from your heart
Makes me feel so glad!
Death and disease walz together like starlets in this place
I sure would like to see your honest face

Hey Eddie, where are you now when I miss you?
Now when I miss you like hell?
If you were here I know you'd make me believe again in myself!
You don't owe me nothing I'm not calling you away
So please don't feel accused when I say

Where are you now when I need you?
When I need you so bad?
My heads almost exploding
And the tension drives me mad and maybe you wonder
Do I really believe I need you?, but I do!

Hey you, where are you now when I dream about you
In nightmares every night?
You were on a big wheel high above me
Almost out of my sight
And just as I wake you shout down something that sounds like
"Why are you not free?"
But by the time I'm dressed you're just a memory
Where are you now that I need you?
Now when I need you so bad?
When my heads almost exploding and this tension drives me mad
And maybe you wonder, Do I really believe I need you?
But I do!

Hey mama, where are you now I hurt for you?
I hurt for you so hard?
If you heard this song, I know you you'd come
You'd come somehow, no matter how far
There's a hundred things that I want to say to you
And they come rushing through my head
But when we meet like we always do we leave the best things unsaid
And my god! Isn't that lonely?, that's lonely as hell
To know the truth always but to be too scared to tell

Where are you now that I need you?
Now when I need you so bad?
When my heads almost exploding and this tension drives me mad
And maybe you wonder, Do I really believe I need you?
But I do!
But I do!Embed
