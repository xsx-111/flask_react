Another Kind Of Circus LyricsBilly and Eve are getting ready to leave
Their unfurnished room, their sad bare walls
They'll get burned but they don't care, they know
What they're doin' to get there, when they get there
And Rose and Trudi, they've been hearing voices
Telling them that it's high time, high time they made their move
They'll get burned but they don't care, they know
What they're doin' to get there, when they get there
Me and Ruthy, we're late again
But our hearts are in the right direction
We've been up together for most of the night
Convincing each other what we're doing is right
No sense in living something you don't believe
We're all ready to leave, all moving on
To another kind of circus
To another kind of circus
Another kind of circusEmbed
