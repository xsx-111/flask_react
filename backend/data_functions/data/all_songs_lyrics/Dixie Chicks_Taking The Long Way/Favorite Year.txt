Favorite Year Lyrics
We were young and so inspired
We weren't the only ones who thought
We'd change the world
No sun would set without us
No one we knew could ever doubt us
We had our future figured out
We knew a love like ours would always save the day
And that we'd always be ok

But would you know me now
Would you lay me down beside you?
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite year

You looked at me like no one else
But sometimes love just doesn't seem to conquer all
We search for someone else to blame
But sometimes things can't stay the same

But would you know me now
Would you lay me down beside you?
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite year
Holding on to the memories
Of when we were younger
I can't forget
'Cause when we were together
That's when I was at my best

But would you know me now
Would you lay me down beside you
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite yearEmbed
