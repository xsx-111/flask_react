I Hope Lyrics
Sunday mornin', I heard the preacher say
Thou shall not kill
I don't wanna hear nothing else
About killin', and that it's God's will

'Cause our children are watching us
They put their trust in us, they're gonna be like us
So let's learn from our history
And do it differently

(I hope) For more love, more joy and laughter
(I hope) We'll have more than we'll ever need
(I hope) We'll have more happy ever afters
(I hope) We can all live more fearlessly
And we can lose all the pain and misery
(I hope, I hope)

Oh, Rosie, her man, he gets too rough
And all she can say
Is he's a good man, he don't mean no harm
He was just brought up that way
But our children are watching us
They put their trust in us, they're gonna be like us
It's okay for us to disagree
We can work it out, lovingly

(I hope) For love, for joy and laughter
(I hope) You'll have more than you'll ever need
(I hope) You have more happy ever afters
(I hope) And you can live more fearlessly
And you can lose all your pain and misery
(I hope, I hope)

There must be a way to change what's goin' on
No, I don't have all the answers

(But I hope) For more love, more joy and laughter
(I hope) You'll have more than you'll ever need
(I hope) You'll have more happy ever afters
(I hope) And we can all live more fearlessly
And we can lose all the pain and misery
(I hope, I hope)
And we can lose all the pain and misery
(I hope, I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)
(I hope)1Embed
