Thin Line Lyrics
Some days rock and some days roll
And some seem to last forever
Some days it's all you want
And some days it never never
Won't you tell me why
Things couldn't be a little easier
Some days everything is cool
And some days I can't get it together

'Cause there's a thin line, yeah
Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
And there's some sunshine, baby
Shining down on me and it's all I need
To see the thin line, between me and you and you and me

How do things get so messed up
And seem so out of control
It's time to wake up, make our minds up
Time to get out of this hole
Won't you tell me why
It's as easy as you let it be
It's so hard to see the other side
When you won't let go of what you think you know
Because there's a thin line, yeah
Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
And there's some sunshine, baby
Shining down on me and it's all I need to see
The thin line between me and you and you and me

Don't look so sad
Let's see if we can find
A way to make things right between us
And while we can't change each other's minds
We'll pick each other up again every time

And there's a thin line, yeah
Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
There's some sunshine, baby
Shining down on me and it's all I need
To see the thin line between me and you and you and me
'Cause it's a thin line, yeah
Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
There's some sunshine, baby
Shining down on me and it's all I need
To see the thin line between me and you and you and me
Because it's a mighty thin lineEmbed
