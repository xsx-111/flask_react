Live Wire LyricsThey call me the real live wire
The natural born fighter
Ridin' down this long lonely highway
Drivin' straight through
Haven't played in three days and nights now
Yeah I'm long overdue
Get outta my way!
Oh ohh oh
They call me the true heart breaker
Cause I don't take home takers
There's nothing and no one to stop me
From having fun
This must be a misunderstanding
Cause I've loved only one
Get outta my way!
Oh ohh oh
They call me the real live wire
Yeah I'm a red-eye flyer
Flying down this four lane freeway
Gonna catch that last plane
In less than 24 hours
Gonna do it all again
Get outta my way!
Oh ohh oh
I'm a real live wire
Yeah I'm a real live wireEmbed
