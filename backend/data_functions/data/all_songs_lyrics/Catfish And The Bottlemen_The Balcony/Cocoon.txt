Cocoon Lyrics
I fell straight
Into your arms
Like a drunk
Who's been on it
All morning
And the sun's up
And my head's fucked
And immediately I grab you
You go all red
Like the first time
I love it when you do that
God, I love it when you do that

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You'd stay and try and out-drink me
Your friends all hated it

But fuck it if they talk
Fuck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down
I cocoon
'Round your shoulders
When you're half-cut
And you're frozen
And you've got that visible breathing
You're depending on me again

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You'd stay and try and out-drink me
Your friends all hated it

But fuck it if they talk
Fuck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down
But fuck it if they talk
Fuck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down

And if you wanna shut down and pose as positive and
Hide smoking from relatives and
Rest on me
Honey, that's alright
And if you wanna act more drunk than usual
To help you get away with more then
Rest on me
Honey, that's alright
Honey, that's alright
(I cocoon
'Round your shoulders
When you’re half-cut
And you’re half-cut)

Fuck it if they talk
Fuck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You'd stay and try and out-drink me
Your friends all hated it34Embed
