Rango Lyrics
Darling, I'm done for once
And as soon as I get outta here
I plan on coming back for nothing
But then again, there's you
And although this town does flaunt
All the stuff you need to feel at home
I plan on taking it from it nothing
But then again there's you

You see, Abby she's got to wait
Until she gets you on your own
So she can make you make mistakes
Then you can offer to take her home
And it's not like I don't miss it none
But the quicker I drink more in here
The quicker I lose track of you
But I know you wouldn't want that

And although this town does plot
Much thicker stories than I care to talk
You, you've ducked them in style
And I've always loved you for that
You see, Abby, she's got to wait
Until she gets you on your own
So she can make you make mistakes
And you can offer to take her home
And now she's wearing that top you love
And she's topping it all off
By acting like something's up
She always knew how to pull the strings

You see, Abby, she's got to wait
Until she gets you on your own
So she can make you make mistakes
And you can offer to take her home
And now she's wearing that top you love
And she's topping it all off
By acting like something's up
She always knew how to pull the strings6Embed
