26 Lyrics
I'll come, based on facts like she'll be there
Making self-control leave me
She’ll stand there selling bricks
To the rioters

I can’t believe you’re 26
With a habit of fueling my fix
You’ve got a mind that is so hell-bent on
Fixing me up before I get my coat off
You with those hands that are so hell-bent on
Making a mess I suggest we rethink something

I’ll come based on facts like we’re always screaming
But I still love you tearing me up at the seams
She’ll stand there selling bricks
To the rioters

I can’t believe you’re 26
With a habit of fueling my fix
You’ve got a mind that is so hell-bent on
Fixing me up before I get my coat off
You with those hands that are so hell-bent on
Making a mess I suggest we rethink something
You see, I'd have known what
I know now
Then I would not
Have been less tempted
To get you on top
At such a pace
I’d have been good to you, babe

You’ve got a mind that is so hell bent on
Fixing me up before I get my coat off
You with those hands that are so hell-bent on
Making a mess I suggest we rethink something
You with those hands that are so hell-bent on
(I can't believe you're 26)
Making a mess I suggest we rethink something5Embed
