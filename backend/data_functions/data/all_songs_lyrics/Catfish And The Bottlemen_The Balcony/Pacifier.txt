Pacifier Lyrics
There's always something to hide
There's always someone to lead on with you
An obligatory wine
Evidently proved that I didn't need you
She said "Oh, please, you're obsessed"
I said she looked over-dressed
She deffo didn't like that, no

She said, "I'm feeling like it's put on
When you say you don't need me
And you want nothing of me"

Oh, but, babe, you know I've tried and failed
But you just don't know how it feels
To lose something you never have and never will

There's always some kid too snide
They took my mother at thirteen
And pacifically I
Evidently proved that I didn't need you or no one
She said "It's you I detest!"
I said she looked under-slept
She deffo didn't like that, no

She said, "I'm feeling like it's put on
When you say you don't need me
And you want nothing of me"

But, babe, you know I've tried and failed
But you just don't know how it feels
To lose something you never have and never will
Oh, but, babe, you know I've tried and failed
But you just don't know how it feels
To lose something you never had and never will

I'm her pacifier
I'm her pacifier
I'm her pacifier
I'm her pacifier24Embed
