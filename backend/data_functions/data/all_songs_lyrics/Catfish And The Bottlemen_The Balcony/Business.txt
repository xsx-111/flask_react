Business Lyrics
I wanna love you
But I've no time
For your friends who can fucking do one
I've had a rough night
Let's get drunk in your bedroom
And have a smoke in your window
Until you're urging I tear up your clothes

And all I wanna know
Is just how far you wanna go

I wanna make it my business
I wanna tolerate drunk you, honey
I wanna make it my problem

Listen I know that you said you'd be sleeping
Babe, it's been enough night
Narcissistic but fuck it, I'm calling
I need to know you're alright
You see, now, I've found a lover
Who can be in peace with my mother
And I ain't ever letting her go
'Cause all I wanna know
Is just how far you wanna go

I wanna make it my business
I wanna tolerate drunk you, honey
I wanna make it my problem
I wanna make it my business
I wanna recognize drunk you, honey
I wanna make you my problem
I wanna make you my problem

If you've been having doubts at all
Then you can come and mess my bed up
And I can change your marital setup
If you've been having doubts at all
If you've been having doubts at all
If you've been having doubts at all

I wanna make it my business
I wanna tolerate drunk you, honey
I wanna make it my problem
I wanna make it my business
I wanna recognize drunk you, honey
I wanna make it my problem
I wanna make it my problem
I wanna make it my business
I wanna tolerate drunk you, honey
I wanna make it my problem
I wanna make you my business
I wanna recognize drunk you, honey
I wanna make you my problem
I wanna make you my problem10Embed
