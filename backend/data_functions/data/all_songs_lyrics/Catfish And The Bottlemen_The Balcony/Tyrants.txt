Tyrants Lyrics
Eyes rolled back, guess we were living fast
Where did you go, yeah, where did you go?
Your eyes come to show that it was so rare to see you sober
So the streetlights would carry us home

And I spent my nights trying to get a grip of you
And I did my best to get my hands under your jacket
So we could make a racket
And your divine ribs would help break mine
We hit the ground, so let's hit the ground

Nothing's alright, believe me
And I say I won't feel the same in the mornings
Nothing's alright, we're leavin'
And I won't feel the same in the mornin'

Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin' us away
Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin' us away
Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin' us away
Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin' us away
