Fallout Lyrics
I told you from the start that I was always gonna change

I pissed you off again
So that you'd leave me alone in Leeds again
And I got my stuff and left
'Cause I got this friend see who put me up again

Oh, but no, you still had to call
Oh, but no, you still had to come

But we just always seem to just fallout
When I'm most in need of it

So I spent my yesterday ducking your calls
And in fear that things had changed
So I tidied up my place
'Cause you always told me it got me thinking straight

Oh, but no, you still had to call
Oh, but no, you still had to come
But we just always seem to just fallout
When I'm most in need of it
And you just always seem to just call-out
When I'm up for leaving it

You see now, I'm sorry if I drove your matches to my clothes
But you know how I can get sometimes
You see now, I'm sorry if I drove your matches to my clothes (Woo!)

You see I, I was a test-tube baby
That's why nobody gets me
You see I, struggle to sleep at night
But it's fine, she never lets me
You see I, I was a test-tube baby
That's why nobody gets me
You see I, struggle to sleep at night
But it's fine, Mary, don't let me
(Ooh)
Nobody gets me14Embed
