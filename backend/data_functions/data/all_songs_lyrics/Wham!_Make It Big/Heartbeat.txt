Heartbeat Lyrics
Another summer, another vacation is over
It’s September now with the sun and the smell of the clover
Down by the gate, we sit and watch all our friends go by
And pretend we don’t hear the bell
That rings through the summer sky

I was happy with the kisses she gave me
It’s just that happy was all she made me
Happy that was, until I saw you

Heartbeat, heartbeat
What do you bear me now?
Oh, you hurt me, desert me, in my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat
It’ll end in tears, oh

I need a lover, when love’s such dangerous place to be
Oh, if we were meant for each other
Then why don’t you answer me?
Don’t keep me waiting, you know I long to be by your side
We could even be together, tonight
I was happy with the kisses she gave me
But now there’s nothing on Earth to save me
Why should I care? I can’t have you, oh whoa

Heartbeat, heartbeat
What do you bear me now?
Oh, you hurt me, desert me, in my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat
It’ll end in tears


Heartbeat, heartbeat
What do you bear me now?
Oh, you hurt me, desert me, in my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat
What do you fail me now?
You hurt me, desert me, in my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat1Embed
