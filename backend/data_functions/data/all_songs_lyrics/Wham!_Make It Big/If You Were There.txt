If You Were There Lyrics
You’re the one that makes my day a dream, come true
Yet and still you wonder if I think of you
You ought to see how the other girls behave
When you’re not around
And only then you would know that it’s on your finger
I’m wound, aha

If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
That I care

There’s no need for you not to have faith, in me, no
‘Cause it’s by your side girl that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends
When I don’t know have much to say
What you don’t know is with you I could never act that way
Aha

If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
That I care
I care for you baby, I-I swear that I care, I care
There’s no need for you not to have faith, in me, no
'Cause it’s by your side girl that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends
When I don’t have much to say
What you don’t know is with you I could never act that way

If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
If you were there, you’d know
That I care

I care for you, baby
I-I-I swear
I care for you, baby, I do!
Have faith in me
I care for you, baby
