Credit Card Baby Lyrics
You said that you loved me
I thought that it was true
You said that you needed me
And baby I believed that, too

I thought that you were shy
But you put me straight with a wink of your eye
I should’ve known better, I know
Put my hands in my pockets every time I see you cry

People think that you’re just so sweet
But they don’t know you quite like I do
I guess they think that I’m a lucky guy
But you’re not fooling everybody

You can have my credit card baby
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart, lady
All I know is what I see
You’re getting what you want and girl, it ain’t just me
No matter how you cry, I’m not giving any love away
Do you think I’m crazy?
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
You’re in love with me, baby?
Don’t tell me you love me
Because I know that it’s not true
Just tell me you need my money
Girl, you know I’ll give it to you

Between the ocean and the sky
There are things that you can’t buy
And if you look you’ll see, one of them is me
Take you hands out of my pockets
Digging till the day you die

People think that you’re just so sweet
But they don’t know you quite like I do
I guess they think that I’m a lucky guy
But you’re not fooling anybody

You can have my credit card baby
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart, lady
All I know is what I see
You’re getting what you want and girl, it ain’t just me
No matter how you cry, I’m not giving any love away
Do you think I’m crazy?
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
You’re in love with me, baby?
They don’t know you quite like I do
And you’re not fooling anybody

You can have my credit card baby
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart, lady
All I know is what I see
You’re getting what you want and girl, it ain’t just me
No matter how you cry, I’m not giving any love away
Do you think I’m crazy?
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
You’re in love with me?

These are the things that you’ve made for yourself
You’ve gotta take your opportunities or stay on the shelf
You wanna stay, oh yeah
Well, that’s okay
It’s just a game that we play
No matter how you cry, I’m not giving any love away
Do you think I’m crazy?
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
You’re in love with me?Embed
