Freedom Lyrics
Do-do-do-doh
Oh, whoa, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-doh

Every day I hear a different story
People sayin' that you’re no good for me
Saw your lover with another
And she’s making a fool of you, oh
If you love me baby, you'd deny it
But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me I’m a baby, and I don't understand

But you know that I’ll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever!
‘Cause baby
You could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we’re together, and you do

I don’t want your freedom
I don’t want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time-love just brings me down
I don’t need your freedom
Girl, all I want right now is you
Do do do
Whoa oh oh yeah
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool
To give you all that I do
I bet you someday, baby
Someone says the same to you

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do, oh

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
Girl, all I want right now is you
Do do do
(Can't you see you're hurting me)
Whoa oh oh yeah
Ahhhhhhh
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

You're hurting me baby
Hurting me baby
Oh
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
You're hurting me baby
Hurting me baby

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do, oh
I don't want your freedom
I don't need to play around
I don’t want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
I don't need to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down

I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
Oh...2Embed
