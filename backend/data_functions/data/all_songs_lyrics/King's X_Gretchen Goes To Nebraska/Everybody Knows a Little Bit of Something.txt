Everybody Knows a Little Bit of Something LyricsSing
Everybody knows a little bit
The time for playing innocence is over
Ignorance is a road that leads to trouble
Wisdom is a treasure born in heaven
Those who find her have a precious something
Everybody knows a little bit of something
Now everyone's entitled to his own opinion
Criticism without knowledge
Much is learned from small beginnings
Much forgotten causing folly
Everybody knows a little bit of something
Everybody knows
Everybody knows a little bit
Just a little bit, yeah
This love I found is covered in forgiving
Everyday there's hope for the future
Before I sing these words out of being
Let me take the time to say I love you
I saw the man stare in silence
(Why can't he be honest with who he wants to believe)
A cry for help was written on the cover of the magazine
(Why can't he be honest with who he wants to believe)
And I know what it means
Everybody knows a little bit of something
Everybody knows
Everybody knows a little bit
Just a little bit, yeah
Everybody knows a little bit of something
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows a little bitEmbed
