Out of the Silent Planet LyricsPerfect peace, mountains robed in glory
Coming into view
Father speaks, son becomes the story
Essence of all true
I saw what cannot be seen
She spoke to me
Take what you've learned set it free
See what you'll see
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Flowing power, waterfall of wisdom
Flawless bold commands
Masterpiece, written o'er the vision
By the perfect man
I saw what cannot be seen
She spoke to me
Take what you've learned set it free
See what you'll see
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Living martyr, truer than the seasons
No more place for lies
Cast a seed, push aside the reason
Reign of terror dies
I saw what cannot be seen
She spoke to me
Take what you've learned set it free
See what you'll seeEmbed
