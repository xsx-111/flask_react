Fall on Me LyricsA boys own story grows up to be a man
He catches the fall
He's given a second chance
Lightning flashing east to west
Love is falling on
Pain, don't fall on me
Pain, don't fall on me
Pain, don't fall on me
Love fall on me
Hand to hand
Breath to breath
The boy to man
Spirit and death
Lightning flashing east to west
Love is falling on
Pain, don't fall on me
Pain, don't fall on me
Pain, don't fall on me
Love fall on me
Hand to hand
Breath to breath
The boy to man
Spirit and death
Lightning flashing east to west
Love is falling on
Pain, don't fall on me
Pain, don't fall on me
Pain, don't fall on me
Love fall on me
Love fall on me
I said, love fall on me
