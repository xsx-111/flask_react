Summerland Lyrics
Summerland in my past
Days were full and I knew it would last
I never thought there was anything else but you

(Summerland)
The wind is getting cold
(Summerland)
You're finally getting old

Not much time, there's much to do
Look ahead and walk on through
No one's taking sides this time it's you

(Summerland)
Your sky can still be blue
(Summerland)
Always in love with you

(Summerland)
(Summerland)
Summerland in my past
Days were full and I knew it would last
I never thought there was anything else but you
Summerland

(Summerland)
The wind is getting cold
(Summerland)
You're finally getting oldEmbed
