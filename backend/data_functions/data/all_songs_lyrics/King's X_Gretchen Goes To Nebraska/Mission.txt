Mission LyricsA broken body its joints at war
Religious vipers sucking royal blood
The price is paid
The final score
The truth exists even through pious mud
Who are these people behind the stained glass windows
Have they forgotten just what they came here for
Was it salvation or "scared of hell"
Or an assembly of a social get-together
What's the mission of the preacher man
Some are true some do lie
What's the mission of the preacher man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A threat of justice the lazy judge
The governess teaches his son to scream
Adopted child
True path to trudge
No minor plot to undermine his dream
Who are these people behind the stained glass windows
Have they forgotten just what they came here for
Was it salvation or "scared of hell"
Or an assembly of a social get-together
What's the mission of the preacher man
Some are true some do lie
What's the mission of the preacher man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Preacher: Bless God! The more I think about it the more I think I was preaching the truth. I went down to the cadillac agency and one hour later I drove out a new cadillac. Hallelujah say praise the lord. Bless God I'm gonna drive that cadillac down here and get it dusty and dirty and use it for God. Hallelujah! Thank you Jesus)
Who are these people behind the stained glass windows
Have they forgotten just what they came here for
Was it salvation or "scared of hell"
Or an assembly of a social get-together
What's the mission of the preacher man
Some are true some do lie
What's the mission of the preacher man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say
What's the mission of the preacher man
Some are true some do lie
What's the mission of the preacher man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
