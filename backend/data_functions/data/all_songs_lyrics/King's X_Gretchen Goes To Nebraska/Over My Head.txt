Over My Head Lyrics
Over my head I hear music in the air
Over my head I hear music
Over my head it's loud and clear
It's going to my head

Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh lord
Music over my head

I, I, I, hear it so clear
I, I, I, hear it so dear
I know, I know, I know I'm not crazy
It's going to my head

Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh lord, yeah
Music over my head (she was singing, yeah)
Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music
Yeah

Grandma used to sing
Grandma used to sing
Everynight while she was prayin'
Over my head, over my head
I hear music oh lord

Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh lord
Music over my head (music over my head)
Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh lord
Music over my head (music over my head)

Can't you hear it
I, I, I hear it, don't you hear it
Listen, it's all around me
It is everywhere
Over my, my, my head
No, you sing it, sing it
Just like yesterday
Oh, I'm talking, talking, talking in my sleep
Oh, I can feel it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah dance to the music
Music over my headEmbed
