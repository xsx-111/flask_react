Pleiades LyricsWhen I look up at the stars at night
What could I find beyond the light
A hundred million worlds that we ignore
Who can restrain pleiades
Or know the laws of heavenly's
How many times have we been wrong before
Far off in the field I see a castle
Today the people gather at the pole
He tried to tell us all the world was spherical
They burned his body but not his soulEmbed
