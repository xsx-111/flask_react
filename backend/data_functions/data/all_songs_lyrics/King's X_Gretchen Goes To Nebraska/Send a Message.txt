Send a Message LyricsI am who I am and I don't doubt it
You are who you are is what I know
Hearing all the words of many others
Does it make a difference when they're wrong
Here we are somewhere in the circle
Dancing madly backwards round about
And who's to blame for little ones who stumble
Who can throw the stone and knock them out
There is trouble in the kingdom
Send a message to the king
(Message)
There is trouble in the kingdom
Send a message to the king
Send a (message)
I heard a voice whisper in the thunder
I believe his words but who am I
Hearing all the words of many others
Standing before pharisees and scribes
Here we are somewhere in the circle
Dancing madly backwards round about
And who's to blame for little ones who stumble
Who can throw the stone and knock them out
There is trouble in the kingdom
Send a message to the king
(Message)
There is trouble in the kingdom
Send a message to the king
(Message)
Send a (message)
Send a message, yeah (message)
Oh-oh-oh (message)
Send a message, yeah (message)
Here we are somewhere in the circle
Dancing madly backwards round about
And who's to blame for little ones who stumble
Who can throw the stone and knock them out
There is trouble in the kingdom
Send a message to the king
(Message)
There is trouble in the kingdom
Send a message to the king
(Message)
Send a (message)
Send a message (message)
Shout it from the rooftop, yeah (message)
Oh and wait again (message)
Yeah
