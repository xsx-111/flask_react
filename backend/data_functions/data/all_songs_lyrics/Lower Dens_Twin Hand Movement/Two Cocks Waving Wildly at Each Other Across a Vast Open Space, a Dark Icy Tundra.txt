Two Cocks Waving Wildly at Each Other Across a Vast Open Space, a Dark Icy Tundra LyricsTree-top tin cups
Relay a bad blood
Do I know you?
Why would I want to?
Continents set sail
I fail to reach you
Through these tea leaves
Do you miss me?
I'll go, I'll go where I'm needed
I'll go, I'll go only if I'm really neededEmbed
