Blue & Silver LyricsLater on we meet
And guests from the feast
Toast to the feats
Of our friends
The sky responded
I saw blue and silver bonded
I couldn't be happier
Or only if you were with me
And so I gave you my keys
So you could let yourself in
But I freeze at the sight of one of these
Sure things
Come with me
I need you to
Be my eyesEmbed
