Tea Lights LyricsOn the high seas
I'm the north wind
In the lighthouse
The eclipse
I hear you cry
To no one in particular
Bury us
With our ships
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sand
Tea lights in the sandEmbed
