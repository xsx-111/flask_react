Hospice Gates LyricsOn the hill adorned in dew
I miss seeing you
Though your den of verse
In the clinic stall
They've confined me to
Loose the noose I wear
And I'll run away
Away with you
All riled, night's young
I lunge, gutted on
Hospice gates
Into these rooms
Your bawdy verses boom
"If you don't know me now
You'll know me soon."
All riled, night's young
I lunge, gutted on
Hospice gatesEmbed
