Truss Me LyricsSomeday you will trust me
I guess it's inevitable
That's all I wanted to say here
But I never did, ok
You're all I wanted always
Someday you will trust me
I don't expect anything
The road's running about you
The road's running around
Someday you will trust me
Some days it is just me
Someday you will truss me1Embed
