Angels and Devils Lyrics
Call it a day
When night becomes our mad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window

Devils on my shoulder

So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
And if you'll see
The demon in you
The angel in me
The jesus in you
The devil in me

Angels on my shoulder
Call it a day
When night becomes our bad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window

Devils on my shoulder
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
And if you'll see
The demon in you
The angel in me
The jesus in you
The devil in me
The demon in you
The devil's in me
Devils on my shoulder
Angels coming closerEmbed
