My Kingdom Lyrics
I chop and I change and the mystery thickens
There's blood on my hands and you want me to listen
To brawn and to brain when the truth's in the middle
Born of the grain like all good riddles

B-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom

You kill when you talk and the enemy weakens
Your words start to walk when you're not even speaking
If my heart is a war its soldiers are bleeding
If my heart is a war its soldiers are dead

B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom

Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
I've lost and I've gained and while I was thinking
You cut off my hands when I wanted to twist
If you know how to dance to Boney Maroney
He's doing the ballet on both of his wrists

B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your k-k- k- k- k- kingdom, king-k- k- k- k-
B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
And I will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your king- kingdom, kingdom, kingdom

(You're a bitter malign person)
(And the di-di-did death is well overdue)
(King of Pain)
(King of Pain)
(You suck the blood that kills you)
(King of Pain)
(You kiss the hand that hates you)
(King of Pain)
(You're a bitter malign person)
(King of Pain)
(And your death is well overdue)
(King of Pain)
(You're a sucking, bitter pain)
(King of Pain)1Embed
