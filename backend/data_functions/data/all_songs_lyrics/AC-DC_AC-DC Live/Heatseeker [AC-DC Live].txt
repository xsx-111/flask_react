Heatseeker  Lyrics"One, two
One, two, three, four"
Ooh, we're getting ready
Ready, go!
Ha ha ha
Get ready

Ooh, we're gettin' ready to rock
We're gettin' ready to roll
I'm gonna turn up the heat
I'm gonna fire up the coal

I gotta keep that motor turning
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen

And I'm a heatseeker charging up the sky
And I'm a heatseeker
And I, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down


We're gettin' ready to break
Gettin' ready to go
Get your shoes off and shake
Get your head down and blow

You gotta keep that woman firing
You gotta keep that circuit clean
You gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream

'Cause I'm a heatseeker, burning up the town
And I'm a heatseeker, and I don't
I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Don't hose me down
Aw, here it come

Ready?
Heatseeker


I want to see you get up
And see the whites of your eyes

And I'm a heatseeker
(Heatseeker)

Yeah
I'm gonna measure you up
I'm gonna try you for size

And I'm a heatseeker

Gotta keep that motor turning
Ya gotta keep that engine clean
Ya gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen
And I'm a heatseeker
And I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Woah, I'm a heatseeker
And I'm a heatseeker
Heatseeker


Out on the street, feel the heat
Ow!Embed
