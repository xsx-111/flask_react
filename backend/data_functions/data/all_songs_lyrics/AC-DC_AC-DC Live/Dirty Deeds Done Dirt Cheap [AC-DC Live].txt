Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap  Lyrics
If you're having trouble with the high school head
He's giving you the blues
You wanna graduate, but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do:
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me anytime

Just ring: 3-6, 2-4, 3-6, hey
I lead a life of crime

Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheep)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

You got problems in your life of love?
You got a broken heart?
He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the tear drops start, fella
Pick up the phone, I'm here alone
Or make a social call


Come right in, forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball

Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheep)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap (Aww)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap


If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you made a stand

For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back-door man
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheep)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap


Concrete shoes
Cyanide
TNT (Done dirt cheap)
Neck ties
Contracts
High voltage (Done dirt cheap)

(Dirty deeds) Do anything you want me to
(Done dirt cheap)
(Dirty deeds) dirty deeds
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Yaah!Embed
