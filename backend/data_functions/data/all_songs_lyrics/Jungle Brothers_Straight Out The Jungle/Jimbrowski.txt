Jimbrowski Lyrics

(Ladies and gentlemen, live)
(The Black Prince, could)
(Could that be right?)
(Could that be Kid...)
Yeah, that's what it be
Jimbrowski, y'all
Subject matter of the 80's
So Sam
Talk to me about this

Now here we have a theory that makes me kinda weary
It's a humorous matter that makes my eyes teary
Mike G
(Jimbrowski)
Yeah, that's what they call it
The thing's so big you need a U-Haul to haul it
It's up on the tip, it's up on the top
This flamboyant thing cannot be stopped

Jimbrowski
That's what it is
Word up, up, up, up
Gotta get it into you
Jimbrowski, Jimbrowski
Jimbra-bra-bra-bra
Jimbrowski, Jimbrowski
Jimbra-bra-bra-bra
Jimbrowski, Jimbrowski
Jimbra-bra-bra-bra
Jimbrowski, Jimbrowski
Jimbra-bra-bra-bra
(Is that him?)
Here we go

This matter is for real, so let's be real about it
You always talk about it cause you can't live without it
In the evenin' when you're dreamin'
Wake up in the mornin', you must start schemin'
Cause... 'cause.... say what?
Jimbrowski's on your mind (your mind)
Takin' up most your time (your time)
Yo, Jimmy helped me write this rhyme (this rhyme)
So when you're feelin' blue
Don't front on the Jimmy (why?)
Cause Jimmy can help you (you)
If I told you Jimbrowski was seven feet tall
What would you do?
What would you say?
How would you feel?
I'm tellin' you man, Jimbrowski is located in your nearby neighborhood
If anybody come to you about Jimbrowski, you can tell them that we can do this
If not you know you can ask the Jungle Brothers, man
J-i-m-b-r-o-w-s-k-i

Jimbrowski is badder than your baddest rope chain
I guess that should explain why it was given the dope name
For some it's free, for others there's a fee
But if you come to me, I give the Jimmy for free
Spell it with a J and not with a G
What do the Jungle Brothers call it?
The Jimbrowskiiiiii

Can you please tell me about Jimbrowski?
I don't know about Jimbrowski, please tell me about it
Hey yo, speakin' of Jimbrowski
There go the dreadlock, man
Hey yo, sir
What?
Tell me somethin about Jimbrowski
What you want to know, man?
Tell me everything you know
Do you want their width, man, their heights, man?
Let me tell you right now the boy's long, man
Boy's long and mean, man
Mean?
You don't mess with the Jimmy, man
Boy, when I was a kid, man
Little boys and girls don't wanna mess with the Jimmy, man
Word?
The boy three years old, man, the boy like seven foot tall
Seven foot?
Seven foot, man
Thoo
We're not counting his hair, man
Whoo
Man, the Jimmy was no joke, man
Man, you never want to see the Jimmy, man
Man, let me get outta here, man
You don't wanna hear no more about this, man
Alright dreadlock man, peace
Ras man, ras
(*applause*)
(The Black Prince has arrived)

Once again
Jimbrowski (dynomite!)
Jimbrowski (dynomite!)
Jimbrowski (dynomite!)
Jimbrowski in the jungle
Jimbrowski in Coney Island
Jimbrowski in Staten Island
Jimbrowski in money making
Jimbrowski in Brooklyn
Jimbrowski In Boogie Down
Jimbrowski in Lefrak
Jimbrowski, come on y'all
Jimbrowski, everybody1Embed
