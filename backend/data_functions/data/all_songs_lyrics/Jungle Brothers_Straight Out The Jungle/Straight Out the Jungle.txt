Straight Out the Jungle Lyrics
Educated man, from the motherland
You see, they call me a star but that's not what I am
I'm a Jungle Brother, a true blue brother
And I've been to many places you'll never discover
Step to my side, suckers run and hide
Afrika's in the house, they get petrified
You wanna know why? I'll tell you why
Because they can't stand the sight of the jungle eye
They never fight or fuss, they never curse or cuss
They just stand on the side and stare at us
They get out of line, I put 'em on a vine
And give 'em one big push for all mankind
There ain't nothing to it, I just go 'head and do it
And lay down the jungle sound and run right through it
And when I'm on the mic, I never stutter or stumble
'Cause I'm a Jungle Brother, straight out the jungle

Cool and quiet, but quick to start up a riot
I write the rhyme, bums insist to bite it
I wear no gold around my neck, just black medallions
That show the homes of three black stallions
I don't care for fear 'cause fear fears me
Out of 10 ways of dying, the first Mike G
I'm harder than the hardest, hard as hard can get
Afrika and I while Sammy B's on the set
I kicked the rhyme to the girl and she became my pet
I lent the sucker some juice and now he's still in debt
A sucker said he wasn't scared but still in all he sweat
A poor man became rich because on me he bet
My brother's searching high and low, they're looking for me
Where will they find me? (In the J-U-N-G-L-E)
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

Struggle to live (struggle to live), struggle to survive
Struggle (struggle) just to stay alive
'Cause inside the jungle, either you do or you die
You got to be aware, you got to have the jungle eye
Take it from a brother who knows, my friend
The animals, the cannibals will do you in
Cut your throat, (cut your throat), stab you in the back
The untamed animal just don't know how to act
It's unbelievable, (unbelievable), uncivilized (ci-civilized)
And now I'm starting to realize
Danger in the jungle (jungle), the jungle means danger (danger)
Tension intense, hearts filled with anger (anger)
Men killing men just because of one's color
In this lifetime, I've seen nothing dumber
So I think before I make a move
Make sure my rhyme goes along with the groove
And backing on a brother when it's time to rumble
My name's Mike G (Mike G) and I'm straight out the jungle3Embed
