On the Run Lyrics

Jungle Brothers on the run y'all, Jungle Brothers on the run
Jungle Brothers on the run y'all, Jungle Brothers on the run
JB's on the Run, JB's on the run
JB's on the Run, JB's on the run

Come on
Oh, I run so much, you would think I'm a bandit (Why?)
You know why because I keep standing at it
Move so much, I often lose my shadow
Don't know where, but I know I got to go
Meet somebody at a quarter to eight
I'm a Scooby Do so I don't be late
If I take my vine
I'll make it on time
And if not, they'll be on my behind
I get there late, but better later than never
And when I get there, whatever is clever
I won't be stopped by a chick or a cop
You know what I'm saying?
I know what you're saying

(I can't stop)
Cause I'm
(On the Run)
(I can't stop)
Cause I'm, cause I'm, cause I'm, cause I'm
(On the run)
Some people say that I'm living inside the fast lane
Some people say that I'm going insane
Yesterday, I called my mother up on the phone. (hello?)
She said, "Son when are you coming home?
How many places do you have to go?
Tell me please 'cause I'd like to know."
I haven't seen my brothers in a year or two
They're anxious to know what I'm going through
My father wants 'em to know how I'm taking care of myself
He hasn't seen me since December 12th
My grandmother hasn't seen me since the eighth
And she wants to know if I'm keeping the faith
Nanny, Nanny, Granny, Granny
Please don't hit me on my fanny
Tell Grandpa that I said Hi
I gotta go, see ya later, good bye

(I can't stop)
Cause I'm
(On the Run)
(I can't stop)
Cause I'm, cause I'm, cause I'm, cause I'm
(On the run)
Stop! Hold it! Freeze! Now!
Uh-huh, oh yeah
I'm gonna get cha

No time to waste, no time to spare
Just enough time to comb my hair
Get myself dressed and on the run
You're anti us and into sun
Ride the vine and drink to tree
In and out of every part of New York City
Kangaroos on my tail, but that's okay
I'm doing 90 and a great oka
Working at a job that never gets done
Can't stop now cause I'm

Now I know why my girl be bugging (Why?)
Because I'm not there to give her that loving
Say I'll be there, but I'm always late
Before I wind up in another state
For Summer two weeks, I was got to move
While I'm getting paid, she's singing the blues
In a way I'm wrong and in a way I'm right
It's a part of making money for my dinner at night
I tried to tell her she's
~Hold it! Hold it! Hold up, Cops coming buddy. Come on man!
Tried to tell her it's a jungle thing
I'm a jungle brother, I must swing
~Come on, yo Sam start the car
~We out of here
On the run
Watch me now, on the run, watch me nowEmbed
