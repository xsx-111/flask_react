Going, Going, Gone LyricsThings have changed, since we met you
It's hard to see your point of view
It's not the same, we've been sold out
Don't you know, what it's all about
Going, going, gone, don't wait too long
You can't hold on, if you're too far gone
Going, going, gone, the pressure's on
Don't wait too long before you're too far gone
So we've seen, how they run your world
You're just a name, just a flag unfurled
What they say is what you do
But who are they to answer to?
Now it seems, that we did not know
What it means, when we let go
Although we try, to understand
Now's the time, to show your handEmbed
