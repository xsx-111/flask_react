Reasons LyricsSome people are dreamers, they live for the future
As if it would work out, just as they dreamed it
Would work out - somehow
Others get caught in, yesterday's papers
Too busy reading, to get on with living
But I - live for now
Sometimes it's easy to make up excuses
On the flimsiest pretext and then call them reasons
But where are they now?
Like I'm way too busy, I can't be involved now
And then there's the standby about understanding
But they're - wrong somehow
I'll climb more than a mountain
Swim more than an ocean
Build up an island
Live for a lifetime
Just give me a reason and I'll come running
When I have reasons, I know the way
I'm pointing my feet in the right direction
Give me a reason
Some people are dreamers, they live for the future
As if it would work out, just as they dreamed it
Would work out - somehowEmbed
