Love To Shine LyricsYou have no cause to doubt what you see
Close your eyes and set your feelings free
Who has the right to say that you're wrong
Open your heart and let our love grow strong
I want our love to shine down on me
Shining down from up above
You are part of me
I fix my sights and I walk without fear
The road may be dark but my direction is clear
Like a neon sign in a distant town
I watch you shine when the lights go down
I want our love to shine
Oh I want our love to shine
People too scared to say what they mean
Gonna wash their hands to keep their conscience clean
In search of a flame that some call desire
They fly into the light and right back into the fireEmbed
