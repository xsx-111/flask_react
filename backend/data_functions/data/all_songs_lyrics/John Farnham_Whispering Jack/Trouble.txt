Trouble LyricsOut in the west the sun goes down
It's just a town like any other town
People wear an innocent facade
Oh, such pretty things to heal a broken heart
Don't tell me, I know it, they all play the game
No questions, no answers, faces without names
You can drive right into a town called trouble
The fun is free but the price is double
Walk right into a town called trouble
The night is waiting for you
But in the morning you'll be gone
As nothing changes life goes on
And every day's like any other one
Never try to change the broken rule
Take, what you get, be sure to play it cool
Don't tell me, I know it, they all play the game
No questions, no answers, faces without namesEmbed
