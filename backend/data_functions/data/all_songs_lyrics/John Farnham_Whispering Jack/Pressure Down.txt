Pressure Down LyricsSet the wheels in motion, and watch them turning round
I want to sail across the ocean, I've grown weary of this town
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, It's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
In this city full of danger, we lead our separate lives
And I was frightened by a stranger, with desperation in her eyes
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Someone turned the pressure on
I called your name and you were gone
And I was trapped like a prisoner in this lonely town
I'm gonna let things slide, until the pressure comes down
Oh the winner tells his story, the loser hides in shame
The winner steals the glory, while the loser takes the pain
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure downEmbed
