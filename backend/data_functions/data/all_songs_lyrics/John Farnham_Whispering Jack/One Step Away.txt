One Step Away LyricsWhere did you come from
I knew it all along
Cause I've been waiting for someone like you
You took me by surprise
The look was in your eyes
I won't be taking chances any more
But it seems like a long time ago
I was the only one
But one look I was hooked and I knew
I'm not the lonely one again
Just one step, I'm gonna get to you
One more step, a little closer to you
One step away, from your love
Where did we belong
In a would that seems so wrong
We could be lovers, strangers, friends
Who knows
But it's only a moment away
And then it's you and me
It's the face in the crowd that you know
The opportunity exists like thisEmbed
