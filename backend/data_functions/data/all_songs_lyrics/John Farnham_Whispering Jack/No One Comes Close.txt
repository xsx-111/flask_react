No One Comes Close LyricsYou gave me your cool hand, luke warm reception
It's been such a long time, still there on the platform
What can an old flame do
But talk about just what's new
Things that have happened since you went away
No one, no one comes close
Someone maybe will come my way, until that day
No one comes close to you
I see you in all those up market movies
You talk on the talk shows, I stare at the TV
What can an old friend say
I know you don't feel this way
I'm taking this chance today, to let you know
Of all the lovers I've ever known, you stand alone
No one comes close to you
Oh I'm going back to my friend
One on whom I can depend
I just smile at her and pretend, I'm free of you
I'm free of you, God knows you're free of meEmbed
