Panzer Attack Lyrics

Short sleeved shit kicking animals lining me up
It's all over their face
Here's a new chicken shit angel eyed boy
With a face to rip open all night
Step up to the line, boys
Cover your eyes as they fire their guns
The friday night abattoir spills out into
The streets

Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack

This boy's taking the easy way out
Cos there's nothing like a midnight run
Don't you tell me not to hide
You've got to grit your teeth and try to keep them too
Curled up in a can they don't know where I am
I'll spend the night in here
Cowered in the trash till 4 A.M
You missed another one
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack


Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack

Panzer attack
Panzer attack
Panzer attack
Panzer attack
Panzer attack
Panzer attack
Panzer attack
