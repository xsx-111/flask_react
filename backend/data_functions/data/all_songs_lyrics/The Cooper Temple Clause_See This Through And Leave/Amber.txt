Amber Lyrics
Remember the time I couldn't speak, everybody heard
The pin didn't drop, it came and crashed down
Then there was the time I couldn't walk, everybody laughed
So entertaining was this breakdown

Turn and face the wall
I'm only drinking
Eyes to the floor
I'm merely sinking

Remember the time when I couldn't see
Blind as a bat for drink and easy laughs
A terrible time but keep it in mind
You can't tell your friends, man, cos this shit is mine

Turn and face the wall
I'm only drinking
Eyes to the floor
I'm merely sinking
So leave me alone

And why does it have to get like this?
It always seems to get like this
Well, I never meant to get like this
Every night
Turn and face the wall
I'm only drinking
Eyes to the floor
I'm merely sinkingEmbed
