Digital Observations Lyrics
I guess I'm not the kind of boy
Who's seen it all before
Anymore
I thought I'd figured out the way
To see the sunny side
Of the day

Making plans, making good
And keep on asking on
Could it be so good

I'll have to sit and calculate
Think myself a mess
For the best
It seems I have to complicate
All the things I see
Lucky me

Making plans, making good
And keep on asking on
Could it be so good
And when you all go out to play
I'll keep an eye on you
For a clue
Cos I won't take it anymore
Being the jealous one
In the sun

The LED in the sky is a concern
There were children in the park yesterday
Programmed to play
Yesterday was grey, but today the sky is nothing but blue
The children will have returned
Smiles wider, eyes more open
They operate without direction
Every program runs the same, unanswered
It is merely a sunny day
And to think I was doing so well
Sense of identity sufficiently simulated
GSOH, a-ok
Mannerisms chosen at random from a list for visual personality
They look to the sky and see the sun
Somewhere along the line I seem to have gotten my words crossed
Digital in-joke
Sad and jealous on a sunny day
Pause for emotional impact
Maintain direct lens contact
I just want to see the sun
When I come and see the light
Heaven help you all
At the sight
Cos fireworks and movie screens
Can't prepare you all
For the scene
All my plans making good
I can't stop thinking now it'll be so good
Cos now it seems I'm all the rage
Such a tender heart
Such and early age
Now tell me, where the hell were you
When I was the only one
Who couldn't see the sun

All my plans making good
I can't stop thinking now
It could be so goodEmbed
