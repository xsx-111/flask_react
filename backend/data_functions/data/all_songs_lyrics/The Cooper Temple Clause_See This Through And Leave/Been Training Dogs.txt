Been Training Dogs Lyrics
Been training dogs again
To bite your little princess
And making sure they make a scene
Running errands all the way
Communicate in codes
You've just gotta make the in-roads

(Holding on) to what you've got
(Making plans) just to stay alive
(Doing time) oh, you bet you will
(I'm doing mine) by the side of the road
(Making out) cos I'm making good
(What it's all about) like I said I would
(Then you realise) cos it's in my eyes
Yeah, look who's laughing now

We take pride in our work
The key's the execution
And hey, that's what we had in mind
But we're not just having fun
I wouldn't wanna be ya
Cos we're drawing blood if we see ya
(Holding on) to what you've got
(Making plans) just to stay alive
(Doing time) oh, you bet you will
(I'm doing mine) by the side of the road
(Making out) cos I'm making good
(What it's all about) like I said I would
(Then you realise) cos it's in my eyes
Yeah, look who's laughing now

And we're not afraid to use animals
Or anything else that'll tear itself a hole
Yeah, we'll be just like dumb fucking animals
If that's the kind of game you wanna play
