The Lake Lyrics
Hey you
Over there
Won't you help a stranger?
That's a sorry sight, my friend
It's not me
To make a fuss
It's just that the water's cold
And I can't feel my legs

Help me out
Don't let me drown in here
Can't you see
I'm gonna die in here

Please excuse
That outburst
I'm a little scared
I don't know what came over me
What's wrong
Don't close your eyes
I don't want to hurt you
I just need a little help
Help me out
Don't let me drown in here
Can't you see
I'm gonna die in here

"Swim", he says
Why do you say these things
One last chance
Just get me out of here
