Did You Miss Me Lyrics
Did you miss me?
I bet you did?
Did you miss me?
And what I did?
How's it going kid?
How's the love life?
Not good?
Good

I'm back now
Back with what I got
But its not for sale
Its for someone else
Someone beautiful
Someone who loves
Not you


She screams my name
Yeah she makes me rise
With the look in her eyes that you will never give
And she knows just how to hit the spot
She gives it all she's got
Then
Shit I blow my top
And we kiss
And we writhe
And this is everything I miss with you
And no matter how hard you try
With each and every lie
You'll never scream my name
She can scream my name

She can scream my name
She can scream my name
She can scream my nameEmbed
