Film-Maker Lyrics
This movie would've killed us
It would've made a mess
I'd have lit the fires but I'd have pulled you out
Take a shot from every angle
Yeah, I'd have shot you down
I'd have made you look fucking beautiful

Don't think cos you can't see me that I'm not watching
Yeah, he got leather, he got car
Well, me got channels on CCTV

This movie would've killed us
We'd have cut a deal
I'd have set the traps but I'd have pulled you out
Lend a hand make all the right moves
I'd have helped you out
I'd have made it perfect just for you

Don't think cos you can't see me that I'm not watching
Yeah, he got leather, he got car
Well, me got channels on CCTV

This movie would've killed us
We would have made a hit
But now it's turned to shit and it's because of you
But hey, you didn't want to make it
Instead you made it with him
Guess I just didn't make the final cut

Don't think cos you can't see me that I'm not watching
Yeah, he got leather, he got car
Well, me got channels on CCTV

Yeah, this movie's gonna kill me
But it'll kill you first
We could've made it out, but oh
It's just too late now

I'd have made us a killer movie
I'd have made us a killer movie
I'd have made us a killer movie
I would have made us a killer movieEmbed
