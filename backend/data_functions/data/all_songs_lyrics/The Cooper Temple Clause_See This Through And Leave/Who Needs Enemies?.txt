Who Needs Enemies? Lyrics
My oh my, I'm seeing the potential
Let's just see what we can do
First we'll take you down back to the meathouse
And then you'll hold their hands again
I know tricks that you can only dream of
It looks like it's your lucky day

A killer key change
Is all you'll ever need

Who needs enemies
When you've got friends
And now your hands are tied
And who needs accidents
When you've got me
Now I'm on your side

Now let's try and teach you how to mingle
Then we'll teach you how to kill
Lies will always be your best of best friends
You'll never be alone again
A killer key change
Is all you'll ever need

Who needs enemies
When you've got friends
And now your hands are tied
And who needs accidents
When you've got me
Now I'm on your side

All these animals
That you call friends
Now they're on their knees
Man, you tricked 'em all
You played the fool
So damn easy to please

Made my name in function rooms
And drifted through the walls
Come on, let me teach you, boy
Teach you 'bout it all
Who needs enemies
When you've got friends
And now your hands are tied
And who needs accidents
When you've got me
Now I'm on your side

All these animals
That you call friends
Now they're on their knees
Man, you tricked 'em all
You played the fool
So damn easy to
