Murder Song Lyrics
As he sits on the moor
With his new found friend
Who had shown him the way
To bow out at the end
With a dignity only
A murder can bring
With sweet violation
That versatile thing

Please believe me when I say
This is how it has to end
This is easy on us all
Well, easier than other ways
Sleep is all I ask of you
Sleep and not to wake again
See this through and leave, my friend
Tears will come and I will end

While I hope you all miss me
And weep at my grave
I imagine you'll pray some
And give hope to the brave
To the ones who have loved me
And cared for me so
And who die when I tell them
I just had to go
Please believe me when I say
This is how it has to end
This is easy on us all
Well, easier than other ways
Sleep is all I ask of you
Sleep and not to wake again
See this through and leave, my friend
Tears will come and I will endEmbed
