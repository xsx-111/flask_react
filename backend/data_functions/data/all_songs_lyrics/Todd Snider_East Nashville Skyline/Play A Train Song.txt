Play A Train Song Lyrics
A smokin' long black Cadillac, the engine's winding down
He'd park it up on the sidewalk like he owned the whole damn town
I'd hear him talkin' to some chick through a thick ghost of smoke
Through a thicker haze of Southern Comfort and Coke

"Say girl, you're hotter than the hinges hanging off the gates of hell
Don't be afraid to turn to me, babe if-a he don't treat you well"
And by "he," he meant me, so I laughed and I shook his hand
He laughed a little bit louder as he'd yell up at the band

"Play a train song, pour me one more round
"Make 'em leave my boots on when they lay me into the ground
"I am a runaway locomotive, out of my one track mind
"And I'm a-lookin' for any kinda trouble that I can find"

I got this old black leather jacket, I got this pack of Marlboro Reds
I got this stash here in my pocket, I got these thoughts in my own head
The right to run until I've gotta walk or until I've got to crawl
This moment that I'm in right now and nothing else at all

Play a train song, pour me one more round
Make 'em leave my boots on when they lay me into the ground
I am a runaway locomotive, out of my one track mind
In the television, blizzard lights we looked around his place
We found him cold there on the sofa, a little smile across his face
And though I tried with all of my sadness, somehow I just-a could not weep
For a man who looked to me like he died laughin' in his sleep

Singin' a train song, drinkin' a-one last round
We made 'em leave his boots on on the day they laid him down
He was a runaway locomotive, out of his one track mind

Play a train song
Play a train song
