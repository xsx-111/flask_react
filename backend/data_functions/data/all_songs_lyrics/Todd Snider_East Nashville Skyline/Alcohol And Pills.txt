Alcohol And Pills Lyrics
Hank Williams
He came up from Montgomery
With a heart full
Of hard-luck country songs
But Nashville, Tennessee
They didn't understand him
'Cause he did things differently
Than the way that they were done
But when he finally made it to the Grand Ole Opry
He made it stand still
He ended up on alcohol and pills

Evil Presley
He came up from Jackson
With a brand new way of singing
A brand new way of dancing
And even from the waist up
He gave the world a thrill
He ended up on alcohol and pills

Alcohol and pills
It's a crying shame
You'd think they might have been happy
With the glory and the fame
But fame don't take away the pain
It just pays the bills
And you wind up on alcohol and pills
Janis Joplin
She was a wild and reckless
Then there was Gram Parsons
Then there was Jimi Hendrix
The story just goes on and on
I guess it always will
They ended up on alcohol and pills

Alcohol and pills
It's a crying shame
You'd think they might have been happy
With the glory and the fame
But fame don't take away the pain
It just pays the bills
And you wind up on alcohol and pills

Sometimes somebody
Won't wake up one day
Sometimes it's a heart attack
Sometimes they won't say
When they pulled poor old Hank Williams
Out of that Cadillac Coupe de Ville
He ended up on alcohol and pills
Alcohol and pills
It's a crying shame
You'd think they might have been happy
With the glory and the fame
But fame don't take away the pain
It just pays the bills
And you wind up on alcohol and pills
On alcohol and pillsEmbed
