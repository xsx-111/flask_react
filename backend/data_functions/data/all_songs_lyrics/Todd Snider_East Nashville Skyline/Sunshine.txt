Sunshine Lyrics
Standing on out on the
Edge of the building
Watching the traffic below
Drinking a beer and
Thinking of jumping
Not far from ready to go

Below me the crowd
Slowly gathers around
Cops cars with news cameras too
I just can't get out of
This pain I'm in
And I don't know what else to do

Sometimes I feel like
I'm so uninvited
Like somethin' so out of touch
They tell me depression
Runs in the family
Well, that doesn't help me much

The crowd's yelling "jump"
Over a cop on a bullhorn
Making him harder to hear
He's saying something about
Having so much to live for
I'm almost through with my beer
(Whistling)

Squinting my eyes to
See through the sunlight
The crowd's even bigger now
There's no point in wondering
What afterlife's like
It don't matter anyhow

We're already in hell
As far as I can tell
Just listen to these people scream
This feels like a rally
In a high school field house
I feel like the captain of the team
Well, here goes the captain of the team
(Whistling)

Follow the light to
The Garden of Eden
You stand at the Pearly Gate
Saint Peter comes over
His hand on my shoulder
He's tellin' me I gotta wait
He says, "You know you can't kill yourself and still get in here, kid
"But you look like a victim of circumstance
"So I'm just gonna break every bone in your body
"And give you another chance"

Wakin' up slowly
Lookin' around me
A lonely recovery room
But closing my eyes, I
Can see the new sunrise
Over acres of flowers in bloom

I don't know when it will be
But the next time you see me
I'll be tappin' to a whole new beat
Walking soles  into
The holes of my shoes
Down the sunny side of the street
Sunshine
