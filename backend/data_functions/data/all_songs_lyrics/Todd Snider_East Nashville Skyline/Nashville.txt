Nashville Lyrics
There isn't nothing wrong with Nashville
These rolling hills of Nashville, Tennessee
There isn't nothing wrong, nothing wrong with Nashville
There ain't nothing wrong with you or me

Well if you ever find yourself in Memphis, Tennessee
Be sure to look up my old buddy Jason D
He is as cool a rockin' daddy as you'll ever see
The stone second coming of Jerry Lee
Jumpin' like a monkey on them piano keys
A better rock-n-roller you will never see

But there is nothing wrong with Nashville
These rolling hills of Nashville, Tennessee
There isn't nothing wrong, nothing wrong with Nashville
We're makin' country music history

Well if you ever find yourself in some old Texas town
Look for my old buddy Jack out driving around
He's in a beat up Ford, he got a band in the back
Every time he pull over another place gets packed
People going crazy, people going wild
There's just something about country music Texas style
But there's nothing wrong with Nashville
There ain't nothing wrong with pickin' out in the sticks
There isn't nothing wrong with rolling in the Cashville
There isn't nothing wrong that we can't fix in the mix
Alright!


There isn't nothing wrong with Nashville
These rolling hills of Nashville, Tennessee
There isn't nothing wrong, nothing wrong with Nashville
There isn't nothing wrong
With pickin' country songs
Down in Nashville, TennesseeEmbed
