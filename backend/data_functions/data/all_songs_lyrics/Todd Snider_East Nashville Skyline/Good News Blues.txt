Good News Blues LyricsWell, my woman left me and I'm so glad she did
You know, my old gal left me and I'm glad she took the kids
Now I've got less mouths to feed and more room to sleep in my bed
I got the good news blues, I'm smiling on a rainy day
I got the good news blues, I sung all my troubles away
Ain't got no achin' bones, ain't got no bills to pay
You see these politicians just tell you what they think we want to hear
You know it's here one day and then it's right out that other ear
You know they promise us whiskey and won't even give us a beer
I got the good news blues, I'm smiling on a rainy day
I got the good news blues, I sung all my troubles away
Ain't got no achin' bones, ain't got no bills to payEmbed
