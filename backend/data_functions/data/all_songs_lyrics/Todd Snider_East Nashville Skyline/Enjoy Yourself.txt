Enjoy Yourself Lyrics
Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

You work and work for years and years, you're always on the go
You never take a minute off, too busy making dough
Someday, you say, you'll have your fun when you're a millionaire
Imagine all the fun you'll have in some old rocking chair

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

You're gonna take that ocean trip no matter, come what may
You've got your reservations but you just can't get away
Next year, for sure, you'll see the world, you'll really get around
But how far can you travel when you're six feet underground?

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Get out and see the world
You worry when the weather's cold, you worry when it's hot
You worry when you're doin' well, you worry when you're not
It's worry, worry all of the time, you don't know how to laugh
They'll think of something funny when they write your epitaph

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think1Embed
