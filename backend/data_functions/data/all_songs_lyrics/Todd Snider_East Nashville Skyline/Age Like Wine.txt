Age Like Wine Lyrics
Old timer
Old timer
Too late to die young now
Old timer
Five-and-dimer
Tryin' to find a way to age like wine somehow

My new stuff is nothing like my old stuff was
And neither one is much when compared to the show
Which will not be as good as some other one you saw
So help me, I know, I know, I know

I am an old timer
Old timer
Too late to die young now
Old timer
Five-and-dimer
Tryin' to find a way to age like wine somehow

I've met every fool that ever signed their name up on these walls
In the backs of all these beer joints and concert halls
I been through seven managers, five labels
A thousand picks and patch cables
Three vans, a band, a bunch of guitar stands
And cans and cans and cans of beer
And bottles of boozes and bags of pot
And a thousand other things that I forgot
I thought that I'd be dead by now
But I'm notEmbed
