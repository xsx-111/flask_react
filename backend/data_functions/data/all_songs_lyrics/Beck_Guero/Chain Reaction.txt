Chain Reaction Lyrics
Coming thru the barricades
Cutting the lines
The red lights going round
Like insanity sirens
The end of the galaxy
The middle of the road
Where the blackout moons
Cut the weather of couls
Black engines grind down
Teeth are raw the rubber juggernaut
Rots in a shattering jaw
Helter skelter bulldozers
Running over the block
Where a pawn shop clock
Is ticking out like a bomb

It's a chain reaction 

Like a chain reactor blowing out of my arms
Shoot every paranoid phantom
That's done me harm
Like a desolate specter in a pummel of fists
Kicking against the pricks
Burning black like wicks
They spit pig iron
Tell you nothing is wrong
Put a heart on a pike
Sing a resurrection song
For a paralyzed mind in a kerosene jar
Barracuda believer with a heathen guitar
Apocalyptic nostalgia tokens
Dark arts sell sail for antarctica oceans
