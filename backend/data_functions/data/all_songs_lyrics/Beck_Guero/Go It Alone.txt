Go It Alone Lyrics
I'm coming over
See me down at the station
By the lane
With my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain
That was drowning all the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back porch fence
Just to see the dogs running
With a ring and a question
And my shivering voice is singing
Through a crack in the window

I better go it alone 

Down on the corner
See me standing
On a makeshift road
With the dust storm blowing
In a long black shadow
Pull a hammer from a coal mine
Down where your daddy was working
Comb my hair back
Strike a match on a bathroom wall
Where my number was written
Driving on the sidewalk
Looking back and the sky is burning
In my rear-view mirror
I better go it alone 

I'm coming over
See you down at the station
By the lane
With my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain
That was drowning all the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back fence
Running with the dogs that I'm coming with
A ring and a question
Dime a dozen and a voice that was singing
Underneath the window

I better go it alone9Embed
