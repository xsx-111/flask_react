Scarecrow Lyrics
I'm walking through the other side
With the devil trying to take my mind
And my soul's just a silhouette
From the ashes of a cigarette
Illusions never fake their lies
Trick cards fool the eye
Carry zeros over 'til they add up
Bury tears in the chapters you shut
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell
And the rain's too plain to tell
All alone but living well
The scarecrow's only scaring himself

I've been digging the ground
In the dust and the clouds
I see miles and miles
And junkyard piles
I wanted hope from a grave
I wanted strength from a slave
What gives you comfort now
Might be the end of you then
Crows are pulling at my clothes
The wind got my fingers froze
Standing all day keeping watch
Over all the treasures we lost
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell
And the rain's too plain to tell
All alone but living well
The scarecrow's only scaring himself1Embed
