Black Tambourine Lyrics
Black hearts in effigy
We sing a song that was hated
All dressed in rag and bones
Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleeding
I know there's something wrong
Might take a fire to kill it
Might take a hurricane
Don't know what life that I'm livin
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Black tambourine
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Black tambourine

My baby run to me
She lives in broken down buildings
Can't pay the rent again
These spider webs are my home now
And when the sun is down
We'll shake and rattle our bodies
To keep it warm at night
My tambourine is still shaking
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Black tambourine
Oh-oh-oh-oh
