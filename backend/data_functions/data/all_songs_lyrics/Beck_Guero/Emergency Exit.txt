Emergency Exit Lyrics14 miles away from a landfill grave
Never pawned my watch and chain
To the landlord living inside my head
Never paid my rent till the lights went dead
Then I saw my sign coming up the road
A dead ditch waiting for to bury my load
On the avenues in the plain of day
I threw a Roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain
Now hold your hand onto the plow
Work the dirt (Probably not: body ) till the sun goes down
What's left of death is more than fear
Let dust be dust and the good Lord near
It's a little too much to ask of faith
A little too late to wait for fate
So tell the angels what you seen
Scarecrow shadow on a Nazarene
Kindness will find you
When darkness has fallen round your bed
Kindness will follow
Children will wander til the endEmbed
