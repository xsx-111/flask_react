Missing LyricsI prayed heaven today
Would bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it
I dragged all that I owned
Down a dirt road to find you
My shoes worn out and used
They can't take me much farther
Something always takes the place
Of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
The sun burned a hole in my roof
I can't seem to fix it
I hope the rain doesn't come
And wash me down the gutter
Something always takes the place
Of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing
She rides in a car like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind aim a line
Straight at mine to a heart that was broke
Tried to feel but got choked in the smoke of a desert
A beach with no treasure
A night that's so blue
Feed the aching in you and the background
Birds take a flight from the earth
Where the bonfire burns and the night
Current turns on a lifeboat floating
Down a river of sleep
I can't see her hollow eyes
I'm walking along with my boots full of rocks
I can't believe these tears were mine
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
Something always takes the place of
Missing pieces you can take and put
Together even though
You know there's something missing
Something always missing always
Someone missing somethingEmbed
