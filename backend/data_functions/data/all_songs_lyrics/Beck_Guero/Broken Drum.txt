Broken Drum Lyrics
I see you there
Your long black hair
Your eyes just stare
Your mind is turning

You know I'll laugh
And I won't take it back
I've seen your eyes
I know what you're thinking

And one by one
We'll shoot our guns
We'll have fun
Don't ever doubt it

And when I say
Fare thee well
My only friend
Oh, how the days go
Oh, how the days go

Your setting sun
Your broken drum
Your little drugs
I'll never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you

Ooh
