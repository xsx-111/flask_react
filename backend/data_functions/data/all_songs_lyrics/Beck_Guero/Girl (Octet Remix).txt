Girl (Octet Remix) LyricsI saw her, yeah I saw her
With her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring, stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand
Where their bones are bleaching
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try
I saw her, yeah I saw her
With her hands tied back, and her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Hands tied back
Her rags are burnin'
Hands tied back
Her rags are burnin'
Throw a coin in the fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try
Tongues are... black tongues tied around the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Black tongue... are ringing... fists
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
My summer... my summer girlEmbed
