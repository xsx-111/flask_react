Make Up Mind LyricsI can't seem to make up my mind
I can't tell the colors
That will fit this room
I can't tell a thing about you make up my mind
I can't seem to make up my mind
Are you laughing at me
Or telling a joke, the cigarette on the sheet
Begins to smoke, make up your mind
Right or left, up or down
In or out, straight or round
Love or lust, rain or shine
I can't seem to make up my poor mind
I can't seem to make up my mind
I can't tell the difference between wrong and right
Are you laughing at me in your sleep tonight
Leaving me behind
Leaving me behind
Why don't you make up your mind
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
About leaving me, baby
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
(I can't seem to make up my mind)Embed
