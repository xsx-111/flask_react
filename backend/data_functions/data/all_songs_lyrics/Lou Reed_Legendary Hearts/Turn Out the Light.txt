Turn Out the Light LyricsLover, lover, why is there light
In the itchy gitchy evening and it's dark outside
And what's the difference between wrong and right
Wrong and right
Isn't it funny how pain goes away
And then comes back another day
The air feels very good today
Good today
Lover, lover, why is there light
Did you forget to turn off that light
Well that's all right but it's way too bright
Way too bright
See the eagle above the hill
The lake reflects and is so still
The tension has gone from my will
From my will
Moon on the mountain shining bright
First there is dark and then there is light
And sometimes the light is way too bright
It's way to bright
Why don't you turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
Why don't you turn out the light
Turn out the light
Turn out the light
Turn out the lightEmbed
