Home of the Brave LyricsHere's to Johnny with his Jo
And Mickey's got a wife
And here's to Jerry
He has got his Joyce
And me, I'm shaking
In my boots tonight
For the daughters and the sons
Lost in the home of the brave
And here's to the home of the brave
And here's to the life that's not saved
Here's to the home of the brave
Here's to the home of the brave
Here's to Frank hit in some bar
In picturesque Brooklyn Heights
And here's to a friend who jumped in front of a train
At seven o'clock one night
And another friend who thinks he lacks worth
Has disappeared from sight
Somewhere in the home
Of the brave
And here's to the home of the brave
And here's to the life that's not saved
Here's to the home of the brave
Here's to the home of the brave
The stars are hiding in their clouds
The street lights are too bright
A man's kicking a woman
Who's clutching his leg tight
And I think suddenly of you
And blink my eyes in fright
And rush off to the home
Of the brave
And here's to the home of the brave
Here's to the home of the brave
And here's to the life that is saved
Here's to the home of the brave
And everyday you have to die some
Cry some and die some
And everyday you have to die some
Cry some and die
In the home of the brave
Home of the braveEmbed
