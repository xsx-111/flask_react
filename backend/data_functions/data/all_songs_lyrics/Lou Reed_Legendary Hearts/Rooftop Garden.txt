Rooftop Garden LyricsSitting in our rooftop garden
Looking down below
Sitting in our rooftop garden
Waiting for the sun
Isn't it lovely watching
A plane go by
What a lovely couple
Are you and I
Sitting in our rooftop garden
A few drops of rain
The lights in the city blinking on
Just the same
No sugar in my coffee
How's your tea
In our rooftop garden
Above the city
Let's not see any letters
Let's not answer the phone
Let's just pretend that
There's no one at home
In our rooftop garden
In our rooftop garden
In our rooftop garden
Up on the roofEmbed
