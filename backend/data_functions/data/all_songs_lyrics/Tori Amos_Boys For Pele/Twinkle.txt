Twinkle Lyrics
Sure, that star can twinkle
And you’re watching it do
Boy, so hard, boy, so hard
But I know a girl twice as hard
And I’m sure, said I’m sure she’s watching it, too
Said no matter what tie she’s got in her right dresser tied
I know she’s watching that star
Gonna twinkle, gonna twinkle, gonna twinkle

And last time I knew she worked at an abbey in Iona
She said, “I killed a man, T, I’ve gotta stay hidden in this abbey”
But I can see that star when she twinkles, and she twinkles
'Cause I sure can
That means I sure can, that means I sure can
So hard, so hardEmbed
