Walk to Dublin (Sucker Reprise) Lyrics
If I walk to Dublin
'Cause my feet all got a sole but I sure don't
I've got a girl in my pocketbook
And some proverb is gonna take it, take it there

Books and killing and something's happening
I'm property of my family
And Gideon told me where to go
I'm gonna sure break down your father's altar and meal

Do a jig, do a jig, do a jig
Do a jig, do a jig, do a jig, do a jig

If I walk to Dublin
I'm gonna pass that Turquoise Lady in her new white
Nike flats and something's flat
I said, I need size 10,000 for my ass, yes

Do a jig, do a jig, make 'em laugh
Do a jig, do a jig, hey, make 'em laugh
'Cause he won't be coming back
Said, he won't be coming back

If I make the golden host
And the Lord needs men, he needs good men
The Lord needs U.S. Marines
I said I got her numbers in my shear machine
I got me an electric shear machines

Do a jig, do a jig, do a jig
Let me plague myself with the west in his head
I said, do a jig, make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh, just make him laugh

'Cause he won't be coming back
(Won't be coming back)
Yes
'Cause he won't be coming back
Said, he won't be coming back
Got it

"The drinking test is p-p-puzzling
The drinking test is puzzling, Marcel
For those that laughed are described both as drinking as a dog
Drinking as a dog-phase, they say was misplaced
We wonder whether the Lord chose a few good men
Whether the Lord chose the U.S. Marines"Embed
