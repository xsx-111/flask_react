Professional Widow (Merry Widow Version - Live)  Lyrics
"Okay, so I - AH! I promised this girl I'd give this a go. So I don't know what's gonna happen here, but we're gonna - I've only tried this one more other time in my life and I gave myself a brain aneurysm, so - I'm not sure, but it's okay. I'll get some seafood later. Okay, let me just think."
"You can do it!"
"Okay, if you're wrong, you won't lose your head, don't worry."
"Love you anyway!"
"Very good, you're gonna need to."

Slag pit, stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips, yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We gotta be big
We gotta be big, boy
We gotta be big

Starfucker just like my daddy
Said, starfucker just like my daddy, yes

What is termed a landslide?
Said, what is termed a loving, loving?
What is termed a little girl trusting
A little boy trusting her?

Yes, said, starfucker, just like my daddy
Starfucker, just like my daddy
Selling his baby, selling his baby
Said, just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, selling his baby
Selling me, selling his baby, yeah
What is loving you?
Just like my daddy
Selling his baby
Said, mother Mary China white
Said, let it be, let it be, let it be
Give me peace, love, and a hard cockEmbed
