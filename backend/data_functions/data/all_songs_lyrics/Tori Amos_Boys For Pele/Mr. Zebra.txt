Mr. Zebra Lyrics
Hello, Mr. Zebra
Can I have your sweater?
'Cause it’s cold, cold, cold in my hole, hole, hole
Ratatouille strychnine
Sometimes she’s a friend of mine
With a gigantic whirlpool that will blow your mind

Hello, Mr. Zebra
Ran into some confusion
With a Mrs. Crocodile-dile-dile
Furry mussels marching on
She thinks she’s Kaiser Wilhelm
Or a civilised syllabub to blow your mind

Figure it out, she, she’s a good-time fella
She got a little fund to fight
For Moneypenny’s rights
Figure it out, she, she's a good-time fella
"Too bad the burial was premature," she said and smiledEmbed
