In the Springtime of His Voodoo Lyrics
Hey, yes, ay, play, play, yeah
Hey, hey you, sweet, sweet, sweet to my loo, yes
Hey-hey, yeah, ay
Such a wang-stang watch you
You keep walking, keep walking boy, yeah
Ay, see, what?
Let me watch me you, yeah
Walk down, just keep on boring me, watch me
Let me, let me, yeah

Standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And I’m quite sure I’m in the wrong song
2 girls, 65, got a piece tied up in the back seat
“Honey, we’re recovering Christians”

In the Springtime of his voodoo
He was going to show me spring

And right there for a minute
I knew you so well
And right there for a minute
I knew you so well
Got an angry snatch, girls, you know what I mean
When swiveling that hip doesn’t do the trick
Me pureed sanitarily, Mr Sulu
Warp speed, warp speed, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

In the Springtime of his voodoo
In the Springtime of his voodoo

Every road leads back to my door
(And right there for a minute)
Every road I will follow
(I knew you so well)
Every road leads back to my door
(And right there for a minute)
Got all your crosses loaded
(I knew)

And I know she’s not that foxy, boys, yes
I said I know she’s not that foxy, but
You gotta owe something sometimes
You gotta owe, boys
When you’re your momma’s sunshine
You’ve got to give something sometimes
When you’re the sweetest cherry in an apple pie
I need some voodoo on these prunes
In the Springtime of his voodoo
He was going to show me spring
In the Springtime of his voodoo, he
In the Springtime of his voodoo, yes, he
He was going to show me springEmbed
