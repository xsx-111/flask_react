Talula Lyrics
Congratulate you
Said you had a double tongue
Balancing cake and bread
Say goodbye to a glitter girl

Talula, Talula, you don’t want to lose her
She must be worth losing if it is worth something
Talula, Talula, she’s brand new now to you
(Sugar, sweet love)
Wrapped in your papoose, your little Fig Newton
(Softly)

Say goodbye now my baby, gotta go
Say goodbye my baby to the Old World

Ran into the Henchman that severed Anne Boleyn
He did it right quickly, a merciful man
She said, "One plus one is two
(Maybe I’m a happy man, maybe I’m a honeydew)
But Henry said that it was three"
(Maybe it’s a bad job)
So it was, here I am
(Maybe it’s a what you are)
Talula, Talula, I don’t want to lose it
It must be worth losing if it is worth something
Talula, Talula, she’s brand new now to you
(Listen, baby)
Wrapped in your papoose, your little Fig Newton
(Supper's chilling)

And Jamaica
Do you know, do you know what I have done?
Mary M weaving on
Said, "What you want is in the blood, Senators"
Said, "What you want is in the blood, Senators, yes"

I got Big Bird on the fishing line
With a bit of a shout, a bit of shout
A bit of an angry snout
He’s my favourite hooker of the whole bunch
And I know about his only Bride
And how the Russians die on the ice
I got my rape hat on
Honey, but I always could accessorise
And I never cared too much for the money
But I know right now, honey
That it’s in God’s hands, oh
But I don’t know who the Father is
Talula, Talula, I don’t want to lose him
He must be worth losing if it is worth something
Talula, Talula, he’s brand new now to you
(Listen, baby)
Wrapped in your papoose, your little Fig Newton
(Supper's chilling, supper's chilling)
Your little Fig Newton
Your little Fig NewtonEmbed
