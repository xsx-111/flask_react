Frog on My Toe Lyrics
Papa, I know there's a frog on my toe
Maybe I'll call him Jethro
Maybe I'll grow up to be quite as good as he
And maybe you'll come back after you're long gone

And papa I'm sure the worms have eaten you now
And Jethro's been on some Frenchy's plate long ago
And now I'm pretty sure that I listened to every word
'Cause I still hear you telling me still

"Slap them boys when they're naughty
Make 'em crawl, make you haughty
Make you strong little girl
You paint them toes the reddest colour
And you know one day you're going to be bigger than a flea
You're going to be bigger than that old poison ivy tree"

Now I'm pretty sure that I think you come and visit
And talk sometimes kind of like Gidget
And in funny little chants like an Indian Brave
You said "We all grew fat when the old white man came
"But one day girl you're going to learn to make them crawl
Make them grow tall but have the grace
To be a lady with disgrace
And you fry them taters
And you make them with lady's hands
And I know you're my pappy's baby"

"That's all. That's for Papa."Embed
