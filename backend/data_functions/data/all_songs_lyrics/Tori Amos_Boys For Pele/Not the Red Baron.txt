Not the Red Baron Lyrics
"What language? No, Dutch."


Not the Red Baron, not Charlie Brown
Think I got the message figured, another pilot down
And are there devils with halos in beautiful capes
Taking them into the flames?
Taking them into the flames

Not Judy G, not Jean, Jean, Jean, with a hallowed heart
I see that screen go down in the flames
With every step, with every beautiful heel pointed

He said
"Not the Red Baron I’m sure, not Charlie’s wonderful dog
Not anyone I really know, just another pilot down"
Maybe I’ll just sing him a last little sound
Many there know some girls with red ribbons
The prettiest red ribbonsEmbed
