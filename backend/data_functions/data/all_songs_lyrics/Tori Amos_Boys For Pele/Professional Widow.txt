Professional Widow Lyrics
Slag pit, stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips, yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We gotta be big, boy, we gotta be big

Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like my daddy, yes
Gonna strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
Running in the family
It's running a family

Rest your shoulders, peaches and cream
Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see
Beautiful angel calling
We got every re-run of Muhammad Ali

Prism perfect
Honey bring it close to your lips, yes
What is termed a landslide of principle proportion, boy?
It's gotta be big, I said it better be big, hey, hey
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like your daddy, yes
Selling his baby
Gonna strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
It's running in the family
It's running a family, hey
It's running in the family, hey baby
It's running a family, hey yeah

Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter, may be sweeter
Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter
She will supply, she will supply
She will supply, she will supply, supply, supply
Give me peace, love, peace, love
Give me peace, love and a hard cock2Embed
