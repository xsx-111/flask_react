Horses Lyrics
I got me some horses to ride on, to ride on
They say that your demons can't go there
So I got me some horses to ride on, to ride on
As long as your army keeps perfectly still

And maybe I'll find me a sailor, a tailor
And maybe together we'll make mother well
So I got me some horses to ride on, to ride on
As long as your army keeps perfectly still

You showed me the meadow and milkwood and silkwood
And you would if I would, but you never would
So I chased down your posies, your pansies in my hosies
Then opened my hands and they were empty then

Off with Superfly, sniffing a Sharpie pen
Honey, it's Bill and Ben
Off with Superfly, counting your bees
Oh, me, honey, like one, two, three
The camera is rolling
It's easy, like one, two, three
And if there is a way to find you, I will find you
But will you find me if Neil makes me a tree
An afro, a pharaoh - I can't go, you said so
But threads that are golden don't break easily

So I got me some horses to ride on, to ride on
You say that your demons can't go there
So I got me some horses to ride on, to ride on
As long as your army keeps perfectly still
Keeps perfectly still
Keeps perfectly still1Embed
