Doughnut Song Lyrics
Had me a trick and a kick and your message
You’ll never gain weight from a doughnut hole
Then thought that I could decipher your message
There’s no one here dear, no one at all

And if I’m wasting all your time this time
Maybe you never learned to take
And if I’m hanging on to your shade
I guess I’m way beyond the pale

And southern men can grow gold, can grow pretty
(You can tell me it’s over, it's over)
Blood can be pretty like a delicate man
(You can tell me over, over your shoulder)
Copper to steel to a hinge that is faltered
(You can tell me it’s over and over)
That lets you in, lets you in, lets you in
(Come in, Houston)

And if I’m wasting all your time this time
I guess you never learned to take
And if I’m hanging on to your shade
I guess I’m way beyond the pale
Something’s just, something’s just
Keeping you numb

You told me last night you were a sun now
With your very own devoted satellite
Happy for you and I am sure that I hate you
Two sons too many, too many able fires, hey, yes

And you’ve been wasting all my time this time (I saw you)
(You can tell me it’s over, it's over)
I said you never learned to take
(You can tell me over, over your shoulder)
And if I’m hanging on to your shade
I guess I’m way beyond the pale
I guess I’m way beyond the pale

Had me a trick and a kick and your message
You’ll never gain weight from a doughnut holeEmbed
