This Old Man Lyrics
This old man he played one
He played knick knack on my thumb
With a knick knack paddy whack, give your dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man he played two
He played knick knack on my shoe
With a knick knack paddy whack, give your dog a bone

This old man he played three
He played knick knack on my knee
With a knick knack paddy whack
This old man

This old man he played four
He played knick knack on my door
With a knick knack paddy whack, give your dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man he play ten
He played knick knack on my shin, on my shin
With a knick knack paddy whack, give your dog a boneEmbed
