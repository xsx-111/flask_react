Sugar (Live)  Lyrics
"So, I had to get this song together in about um, two hours. And uh, this boy really pissed me off because I had a crush on him - right? And he'd been making me tea for me for nine months."
"Father Lucifer!"
"Hang on, I'm telling a story! And so, the whole thing is, he would sit there and ask me - now if you're making tea, for a girl, right, for nine months, don't you think, guys - I mean, help me out here, your noodle, I know it can hold a lot of information, right? - but don't you think you can remember how many sugars a girl takes in her tea after nine months? Yo!"

Don't say morning's come
Don't say it's up to me
If I could take twenty-five minutes
Out of the record books

And sugar, he brings me sugar

Bobby's collecting bees
And hammers, he used one on me
Cold war with little boys
Get in with a bubblegum trade and

And sugar, he brings me sugar
I know the robins bring
Bring me many things but
Sugar, he brings me sugar
As far as I can tell
I've been gone for miles now
And you know and I know
I don't know me very well
And I know and you know
If they found me out...
Yes, sweet, sweet
Sweet boy, when they find you out
Tell me what you think they'll do
When they find you got a little in here
Tell me what you think they'll do
When they find you out
When they find you out
When they find you, find you, find you out

You're just sugar, yes, sugar
And all the robins bring
Bring me many things
But sugar, bring me sugar
And all the robins bring
Bring many things
But sugar, yes, sugar

Aah, aah, yes
Yeah, aah, aahEmbed
