Sucker Lyrics
I said I'm not gonna run
'Cause I don't have the breath control
And I know that there's someone behind me
I said I'm not gonna run 'cause if they get me, if they get me, I

Oh well, I just have had a kind of vision that
I know what it is and if it is what it is
Well I think I'm gonna just stay right here 'cause it could be fun
I think the wolf's a vegetarian

And you're a sucker
Said, you're a sucker, man
Said, you're a har, har, har!
And you like it spanked

I'm watching Gary get a tattoo
Gabriel likes his lilies

Hmm, I said hey, hey
'Cause you're a sucker, man
And I thought you were my friend
But you're a suckerEmbed
