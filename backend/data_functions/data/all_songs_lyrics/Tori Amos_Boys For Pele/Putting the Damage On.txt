Putting the Damage On Lyrics
Glue stuck to my shoes
Does anyone know why you play with an orange rind?
You say you packed my things and divided what was mine
You’re off to the mountain top, I say, "Her skinny legs could use sun"
But now I’m wishing for my best impression of my best Angie Dickenson
But now I’ve got to worry
'Cause boy you still look pretty

When you’re putting the damage on
Yes, when you’re putting the damage on

Don’t make me scratch on your door, I never left you for a banjo
I only just turned around for a poodle and a corvette
And my impression of my best Angie Dickenson
But now I’ve got to worry
'Cause boy you still look pretty

When you’re putting the damage on
Pretty when you're putting the damage on

I’m trying not to move
It’s just your ghost passing through
I said I’m trying not to move
It’s just your ghost passing through
It’s just your ghost passing through
And now I’m quite sure
There’s a light in your platoon
I never seen a light move like yours can do to me
So now I’m wishing for my best impression of my best Angie Dickenson
But now I’ve got to worry
'Cause boy you still look pretty

To me but I’ve got a place to go, I’ve got a ticket to your late show
And now I’ve got to worry
'Cause even still you sure are pretty
When you’re putting the damage on, yes
When you’re putting the damage on, you're just so pretty
When you’re putting the damage on1Embed
