Blood Roses Lyrics
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now
Can’t forget the things you never said
On days like these starts me thinking

When chickens get a taste of your meat, girl
Chickens get a taste of your meat, yes

You gave him your blood and your warm little diamond
He likes killing you after you’re dead
You think I’m a queer, I think you’re a queer
Said I think you’re a queer, I think you’re a queer

And I shaved every place where you’ve been, boy
I said, I shaved every place where you been, yes

God knows I know I’ve thrown away
Those graces
God knows I’ve thrown away
Those graces
God knows I know I’ve thrown away
Those graces
The Belle of New Orleans
Tried to show me once how to tango
Wrapped around your feet
Wrapped around like good little roses
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now
Blood roses, blood roses back on the street now, now, now, now
You’ve cut out the flute from the throat of the loon
At least when you cry now, he can’t even hear you

When chickens get a taste of your meat, girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
When he sucks you deep, yes
Sometimes you’re nothing but meatEmbed
