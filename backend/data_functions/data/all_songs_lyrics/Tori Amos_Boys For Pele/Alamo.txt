Alamo Lyrics
Alamo, heard all about your fandango
Banged on my knees on your back door
Only to wake you to blues on the way
Blues on the way, blues on the way

Embarcadero, figures you’ll see me as older
Twenty-three hours till the border
Don’t think I’ll be going as fast as I came
Fast as I came, fast as I came

Tears on my pillow, of course, they’re not mine
Alter that altar, making a play
Somebody invent the telephone line
I’ll take my chances

Alamo, wish I could do what gold does
Heard that the stars were in order
Got yourself dealt a hand with two queen of spades
And blues on the way, blues on the way

Tears on my pillow, of course, they’re not mine
Alter that altar, making a play
Somebody just... somebody invent the telephone line
I’ll take my chancesEmbed
