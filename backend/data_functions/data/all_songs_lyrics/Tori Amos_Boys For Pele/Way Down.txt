Way Down Lyrics
Maybe I’m the afterglow
’Cause I’m with a band, you know
Don’t you hear the laughter on the way down?
Yes, I am the anchorman
Dining here with Son of Sam
A hair too much to chat of on the way down
Gonna meet a great big star
Gonna drive his great big car
Gonna have it all here on the way down

The way down, the way down
He knows, let’s go way down
Way down, way down
She knows2Embed
