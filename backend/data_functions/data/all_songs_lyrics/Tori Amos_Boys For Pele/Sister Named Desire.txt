Sister Named Desire Lyrics
Got a sister named Desire
They don’t let you light those little boys by their house
On the backhand swing, yes
Know a Vicar who coughs a lot
I thought we told some little sweet stories
In the parking lot

They say the girl lost her sway
They say the girl lost her sway that day

God I’d like to drag him for a long way ‘cause maybe I...
Then I’d just cry a little tear near
To that sleepy safe place
And I’m gonna take it by myself if I’ve got to go
Don’t let you, let you know where she goes to
With those, me as I interfere

They say the girl lost her sway
They say the girl lost her sway that day

Teach me about them old, old worlds big brother man
In an elevator where somebody can get out with the sound
They say the girl lost her sway
Just watch it, just watch it slip through my hands, boy
Watch it go, what you know
Hey, yes
See, just see
'Cause she still can swayEmbed
