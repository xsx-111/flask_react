Marianne Lyrics
Tuna, rubber
A little blubber in my igloo, yeah
And I knew you, pigtails and all
Girls when they fall
And they said Marianne killed herself
And I said, "Not a chance, not a chance"
Don’t you love the girls, ladies, babes
Old bags who say she was so pretty?
Why, why, why, why did she crawl down
In the old deep ravine?

Come on, pigtails, girls and all those sailors
Get your bags and hold down
Won’t you just hold down, hold down?
'Cause Ed is watching my every sound
I said they’re watching my every sound

The weasel squeaks faster than a seven day week
I said, "Timmy and that purple monkey
Are all down at Bobby’s house
Making themselves pesters and lesters
And jesters and my traitors of kind"
And I’m just having thoughts
I said I'm just having thoughts of
Having thoughts, having... Marianne
She could outrun the fastest slug, she could have
Just having thoughts of Marianne
Quickest girl in the frying pan
I'm just having thoughts of Marianne1Embed
