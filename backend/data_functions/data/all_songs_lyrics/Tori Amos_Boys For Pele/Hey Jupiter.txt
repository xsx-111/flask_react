Hey Jupiter Lyrics
No one’s picking up the phone, guess it’s me and me
And this little masochist, she’s ready to confess
All the things that I never thought that she could feel

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
And I thought I wouldn’t have to be with you, something new

Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know you know
And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
If my heart’s soaking wet
Boy, your boots can leave a mess

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
And I thought you wouldn’t have to keep with me, hiding

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, yes
Thought I knew myself so well
All the dolls I had
Took my leather off the shelf
Your apocalypse was fab
For a girl who couldn’t choose
Between the shower or the bath

And I thought I wouldn’t have to be with you, a magazine

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, yes
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, yes

No one’s picking up the phone
Guess it’s clear, he’s gone
And this little masochist
Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel
Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you safe, now we’re through?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Hey JupiterEmbed
