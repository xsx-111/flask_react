Hey Jupiter (Dakota Version) Lyrics
No one’s picking up the phone
Guess it’s me and me
And this little masochist
She’s ready to confess
All the things that I never thought
That she could feel

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to

Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know you know
And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
If my heart’s soaking wet
Boy, your boots can leave a mess

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Ooh, ooh, yes
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, yes
And he isn't you (Ooh)

No one’s picking up the phone
Guess it’s clear, he’s gone
And this little masochist
Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
I thought you wouldn’t have to keep with you, hiding

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, yes
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, yes
I go from day to day (Ooh)
I know where the cupboards are (Ooh)
I know where the car is parked (Ooh)
I know he isn't you (Ooh)
Nothing is (Ooh, yes)

(Ooh, ooh) Hey Jupiter
(Ooh, yes, ooh) Never you
(Ooh, yes, ooh) Nothing's been the same
(Ooh, ooh) Nothing
(Ooh, yes, ooh) Nothing, nothing's gonna save us
(Ooh, ooh) Never you
(Ooh, yes)Embed
