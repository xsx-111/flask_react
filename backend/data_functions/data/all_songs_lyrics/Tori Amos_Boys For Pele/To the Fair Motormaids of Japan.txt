To the Fair Motormaids of Japan Lyrics
And the girls say
And they still say

So I took a trip to the center of him in a California track suit
But you fell too hard for a little Deuce Coupe, but she ran off with a Nazi
And let's not forget that sea foam suit she put you in to see the Greyhounds
Sure they run real faster than you ever could or will

Say goodbye to the fair motormaids of Japan
Yume no yoida wa, you said, "We're dead, not sleeping"
The things that I would go through to turn you back around
The laces I would trip on would bring on the circus crowds
The last banana hair-do got a laugh from the samurais
The things that I'd turn into to turn you back to me
Again

Summer comes and summer goes
Shells and shells and a bad girl's balm

So say goodbye to the fair motormaids of Japan
Yume no yoida wa, you said, "We're dead, not sleeping"
The things that I would go through to turn you back around
The planes that I have died on, trade you for another cloud
The mountain biking posse that brought back another man
The things that I'd turn into
Watch me turn
The things that I'd turn into
Watch me turn, watch me turn
Watch me turn
The things that I'd turn intoEmbed
