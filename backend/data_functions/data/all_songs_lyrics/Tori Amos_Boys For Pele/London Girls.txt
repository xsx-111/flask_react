London Girls Lyrics
Some people sing about Deutsche girls
And girls from California
They might be alright for a night all right
But don't trust them, I warn you
I've been to the east and I've been out west
And I've been the world around
But I ain't seen none come anywhere near
A girl from London town

Give me a London girl every time
I've got to find one, I've made up my mind
Give me a London girl every time
I want a London girl

Marry a girl from London town
You know that you can trust her
She'll darn your socks and wash your...
Your trousers if you bust 'em, yes
They're all good cooks and they got good looks
And they won't lead you a dance
Said I got to find a London girl
If I get a half a chance
Give me a London girl every time
I've got to find one, I've made up my mind
Give me a London girl every time
I want a London girl

London girls are the best in the world
There ain't no doubt about it
If you can't find a girl from London town
You're better off a doing without it
They don't create when you just come home late
And you're crawling up the passage floor
And they won't muck about, yes, when you've gone out
With the geezer from the house next door

Give me a London girl every time
I've got to find one, I've made up my mind
I said, honey, give me a London girl
Babe, every little old time

Your legs turn to jelly and I got a little smelly
But I know it's just what I want
'Cause I need a London girl every time
They've always got a pound to buy their round
When it's their turn at the barEmbed
