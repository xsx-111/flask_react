Toodles Mr. Jim Lyrics
Hey yes
I said, yes
I said, hurray yay yay yippy yay
I said, diddly hey and

"Toodles Mr. Jim you cherry picker
Toodles," I say, "So long
Hear that your grave's a little warm, you stickler
Sing them all your happy song"

It's today, today
Sunday by your grave

I say "Toodles Mr. Jim, you cherry picker
Taught me so well
How to spell those red in...
And... and... hey...

You know she deserved that nose
Splattered and swattered blood in my hands
Not a nice day for your little girl
But you came to my aid instead"
But now it's "Toodles, Mr. Jim, you cherry picker
Build that ladder well
Teach me just where those boys can climb
When they've got a spell"

Toodles Mr Jim, you are my sweet favourite neighbour
Of them all of them
Girls go to their parties
I don't care 'cause I'm with you still"

"That was Toodles Mr. Jim
Mr. Jim died two weeks ago
And he taught me how to pick cherries
And I punched his daughter in the nose because she was mean
Mr. Jim was good"Embed
