Margaret downe LyricsMargaret in the morning
Sleeping on her side
Tossin' men like nickles
Into an ever-rising tide
I guess she was a dentist
Before she fell in love
Freezin' leaden smiles
Just to give 'em up
Oh oh oh
Margaret downe
Margaret at the office
Margaret at eighteen
She said sit right down a minute
She said lemme clean your teeth
So we settled down in bozeman
In the corner of the world
And we raised a couple children
But we lost a little girl
Oh oh oh
Margaret downe
Heartsick in montana we slowly grew apart
The grocery clerk in moncton
As you were dancing in the bar
You rushed him to the courtroom
Before the bed was cold
And defrosted out my windshield
When you smile then lemme know
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Margaret downe
Many cavities pulling
At our marriage's tender mouth
And at the root of all the problems
Was a man across the canal
Margaret left the practice
Late in '86
And I left behind the midwest
And forgot we ever kissed
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Margaret downe
I knew she changed her number
But couldn't shake the cough
The doctor gave her 6 weeks
Which only made her shrug it off
Resting in her 5th week
I brought her buttercups
There was too much to say between us
And I'd only fuck it up
So I stared up at the ceiling
And I held her little hands
And you knew that I forgave you
For making other plans
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Margaret downe
Margaret in the morning
Sleeping on her side
Strolled into the waves
Of an ever-rising tideEmbed
