Creatures Great & Small LyricsYou wonder what I do
With myself in the dark
Outside with the birds
It's a mouthful
I run like I was never yours
Don't you ever feel
That the room just got bright
Like a million big ideas
Or your brother's eyes
Don't choose me
I was never yours
There's gonna be a time
When I leave you in the night
To sit on top of roofs
Return, like I was never yours
