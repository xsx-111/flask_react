Dream Team LyricsNever understand
Never could be
Good but you know I try
To keep the future close
Closed up like a fist
You've been sleeping in the wild
Oh, the blackest wave
Was I swimming just to drown?
I have seen you in the world
I have seen you in my mind
Would you put it all at ease
Or make me feel uneasy
Cause I feel 25
And it never was that way
Something's changed inside my heart
And I'm unsure of everything
Holding sea salt in your hands
Don't you ever want to pour it outEmbed
