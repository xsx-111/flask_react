Farewell My Friend LyricsFarewell my friend
My beautiful friend
Farewell
You take the high road
And I'll take the low road
And we'll meet again
Farewell my friend
I love you
In a funny way
You take the high road
I'll take the low road
And we will meet again
Farewell my friend
Oh, I want to see you again, oh farewell
Oh, I want to see you again, farewell
Oh, I'm on the mountain again, oh farewell
Oh, I want to see you again, oh my friend
Oh, that's when I'll see you again, farewell
Oh, I want to see you againEmbed
