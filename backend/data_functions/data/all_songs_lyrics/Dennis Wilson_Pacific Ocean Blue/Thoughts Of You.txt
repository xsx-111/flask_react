Thoughts Of You LyricsThe sunshine blinded me this morning love
Like the sunshine, love comes and goes again
I love you, I love you
The sea air is flowing through my room again
Like the thoughts of you fill my heart with joy again
I'm sorry, I miss you
All things that live one day must die, you know
Even love and the things we hold close
Look at love, look at love, look at love
Look what we've done
Loneliness is a very special place
To forget is something that I've never done
Silently, silently you touch my faceEmbed
