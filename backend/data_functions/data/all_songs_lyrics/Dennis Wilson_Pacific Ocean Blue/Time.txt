Time LyricsHome, home sweet home
I'm going home
To where she waits
To share love with me, yeah
I'm the kind of guy
Who loves to mess around
Know a lot of women
But they don't feel my heart
With love, completely free
Ooh, I love you, I really do
Hold me, hold me close
Completely free, yeah
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
(Take me there)
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
(Take me there)
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
(Take me there)
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
(Take me there)
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
(Take me there)
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
(Take me there)
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
(Take me there)Embed
