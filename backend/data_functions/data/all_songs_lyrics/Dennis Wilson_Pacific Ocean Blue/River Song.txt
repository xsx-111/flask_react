River Song LyricsWalkin' down by the river
Water running through my knees (ooh)
River, oh river moves so free (ooh)
Oh mighty river endlessly
Ooh, mighty river
I would love to be like you
Ooh, lonely river
Has not got the time to say
I was born into the city life
It's all that I've ever known
You know it's rough gettin' round this place
So crowded I can hardly breathe
You can only see about a block or two
In L. A. that's the truth
I'm lookin' for some country life
Some kickin' room no more city life
I want the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on
It breaks my heart to see the city
I wonder why it ain't pretty
Oh I want to cry, want to cry
Come on you've got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run awayEmbed
