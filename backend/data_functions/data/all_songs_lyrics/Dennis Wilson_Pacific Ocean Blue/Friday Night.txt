Friday Night LyricsOh, it's Friday night
The white punks play tonight
Shirts off you motorcycle rider
Night hider and people who pray
I believe my Jesus is in my soul
Come on my brother, let's a-rock and roll
What's that feeling down inside of me?
Rock and roll, food for the soul
She made me happy, she made me mad
Hats off to the drummer's little lady
See ya sugar, all alone
The white punks play tonight
Play your guitar
Play your guitar
Come on brother play your guitar
Come on brother play your guitarEmbed
