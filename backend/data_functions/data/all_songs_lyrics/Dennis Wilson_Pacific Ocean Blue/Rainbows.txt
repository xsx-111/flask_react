Rainbows LyricsRainbows shining on my shoulders
Ooh, sunshine warming up my day
Birds sing and in the air the sound of spring
And in the wind the flowers bring
Their presents to the day
Earth opens up its arms for me
When you get the feelin'
The feelin' everything's all right, alright
And I want you to know
I love you, I love you so
Night and day
People love to have a good time
They're dancing in the golden light
It'll get you feelin' fine
Ooh honey, hold me
I want to feel you close to me
I want to know the funky things
You mean everything to me
Love I really want to be with you
I don't have a reason
I could never tell you why I know
But I do
Hon I love you, I love you so
Night and day, everyday
Come on baby come on
Don't miss our chance
Oh let it shine on you
Oh let the sun shine shine shine
Let it shineEmbed
