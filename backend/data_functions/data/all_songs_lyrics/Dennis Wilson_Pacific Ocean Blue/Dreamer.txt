Dreamer LyricsI know a carpenter who had a dream
Killed the man, but you couldn't kill the dream
Who said it was easy?
People gotta be free
And the band keeps on playin'
Oh, I know people who want to go far
Make big movies and become a star
People got to dream
Dreamer, who said it was easy?
And the band played
Play for me
Now I've seen people from near and far
They couldn't get to heaven in their car
Who said it was easy?
Driver, drive on
Ooh, let the wind carry your blues away
That's all we're tryin' to say
How 'bout a better day
Fall in love, ooh
And the band keeps on playin'
Play for me
Do you wonder where you are
Wake up in bed with a star
That was easy
Dreamer, dream on
And the band keeps on playing
