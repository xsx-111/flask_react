End Of The Show LyricsHere we are
With our dreams in the sky
We all have our dreams
It's wonderful to know we're alive
At the end it's over
There you are
At the end of the show
Mem'ries are real
It's wonderful to know you're alive
At the end
Thank you very much
For everything you've ever wanted, oh
Thank you very much
For everything you've ever needed, oh
Thank you very much
For everything you've ever dreamed of
Whoa, whoa, it's over
Thank youEmbed
