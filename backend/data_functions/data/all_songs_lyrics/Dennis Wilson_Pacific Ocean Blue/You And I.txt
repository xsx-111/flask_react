You And I LyricsI've never seen the light that people talk about
You open up my wallet and dust falls out
That's alright with me
Because the songs that I'll sing won't be blue
Mmm yeah, 'cause honey you and I
No more lonely nights
I'll never make the headlines or the evening news
There won't be rags to riches story for me
Oh, but the songs that I sing won't be blue
Ooh yeah, honey you and I, oh you and I
No more lonely nights
Take me there
The truth, the faith I have in you
Yeah, it's our melody
It's what we do together
My Jesus, you open up my heart
You make me laugh
When I'm feelin' down
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nightsEmbed
