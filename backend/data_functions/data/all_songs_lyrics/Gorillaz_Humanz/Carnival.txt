Carnival Lyrics
Carnival

We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming, coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a

Just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing

We, just like a carnival
We laughed, just like a carnival
Sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
Playing with your mind, just like a
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival, yeah7Embed
