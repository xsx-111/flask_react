Strobelite Lyrics
Momentary pain can be pleasure lain
Millisecond change; magic lantern strings
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it ends?

Girl, your life will turn, just like a strobe
'Cause your daddy's vain, and your mother won't
And your heart engages into heartless throes
Are we obsidian? Is this how it goes?

If when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light

Slide the light off you, you may find some peace
All will come to you, if you come with me
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it is? Yeah

If when your private life is dreaming (When your pri-)
You're living the strobe light (Oh, living the strobe light)
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light
{unintelligible vocals}

And when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
(You're living the strobe, when your private life is dreaming)
And you will find the life you're needing
(You'll find the life you're needing)
You're living the strobe light
And when your private life is dreaming
(When your private life is dreaming)
You're living the strobe light
(Living the strobe, you're living the strobe)
And you will find the life you're needing
(You will find the life you're needing, yeah yeah yeah)
You're living the strobe light

Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
And when you're private
And then you're dreaming
(You're living the strobe light)
You hit the light
When your private life is dreaming
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
You've got to find it
You know you need it
(Like you need it)
(You're living the strobe light)
You're living the strobe light
You hit the light
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
When your private life is
And when you're private
Dreaming
And then you're dreaming
(You living the strobe light)
You hit the light
You're living the, living the
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
You've got to find it
You know you need it
(You're living the strobe light)
You hit the light
You're living the strobe light17Embed
