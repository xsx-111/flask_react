Charger Lyrics
I am the ghost
Provocative
That's what I want

A cha-charger, everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger, what is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger, what do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger, what did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger

Okay
Yeah, okay

A cha-charger, everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger, what is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger, what do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger, what did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger

I am the ghost
I am the sword
I am the ghost

I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
Everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting from
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What do you say now?
Thought you could teach us as the flowers have grown
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)

I'm gonna take you for a ride

No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
I'm inside you
No antennas

I'm in charge
