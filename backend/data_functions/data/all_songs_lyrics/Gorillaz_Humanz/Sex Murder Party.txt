Sex Murder Party Lyrics
Yeah, see, we gone
Sex murder
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder

I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas
Of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas
Of your priorities

I'm caught up in this
I'm caught up in this murder
I'm trying to get away, but
I'm trapped in this phase
I'm caught up in this masquerade
I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas
Of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas
Of your priorities

You always said
I was out of control
Teach me hatred
Then let me go
You didn't care, no truth and no dare
In the bathroom, blow everywhere
Now you're so high, kiss all the guys
Making me jealous, I wonder why

I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas
Of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas
Of your priorities
Sex murder
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder3Embed
