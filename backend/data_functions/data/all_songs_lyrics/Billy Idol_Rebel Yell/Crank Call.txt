Crank Call Lyrics
If you're waiting for a call
There's double trouble, the pressure of it all
This line is due for communication
Not if you've lost all reason

Crank call, yeah
Ain't no fun at all (oo)

They want love, they want a pantomime
To cut you in two, that's a sexual crime
They dig the dirt they deal in
They dig the dirt they feed on

Crank call, ow
Ain't no fun at all

Oh yeah, all right
We don't waste time tonight
Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight?
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad and I might
Tonight
Ow!

There's nothing new in heaven or hell
Hate has taken control
They're breakin' the kids
They're beating the bids
And that is all they feed on

Crank call (oh)
Ain't no fun at all (uh huh)

Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight?
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad and I'm right
Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight?
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad I'm might
Tonight
Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight?
Oh yeah, all right
You know I'm mad I'm all right
Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight?
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad, and I bite
Tonight1Embed
