Ow
Tonight a little dancer came dancin' at my door (oh)
Tonight a little dancer was pumping at my floor (ooh)
For what you want, baby, what you want so much
You know little angel has a touch too much

Because
In the midnight hour, she cries more, more, more (wow)
With a rebel yell  more, more, more, wow!
In the midnight hour, she cries more, more, more (whoa)
With a rebel yell she cries more, more, more

Don't you know, little angel
You know you reap what you sow
I know you're not sweatin'
You're blowin' hot and cold (ooh)
Your itchin' lips have their limits 
For a love stranger
Oh, no, you ain't dreamin'
I won't go no further
Let me go
In the midnight hour, babe, she cries more, more, more (ooh)
With a rebel yell she cries more, more, more  ow!
In the midnight hour, babe, she cries more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cries more, more, more

He lives in his own heaven
Collects his goods 
 out all night to collect a fare
Just as long, just as long it don't mess up his hair

Rowar!
Ooo!
In vain, little angel, in vain, all in vain
Trouble  lover  pain
You know that there's something more in heaven than in hell
Come on, little baby, come on 
Tonight, little angel, you were dancin' on the floor
Oh, yeah, little baby, ask 
Oh, yeah, little baby,  for lovers like you and me
Oh You know where you should be
And that's right by me
In the midnight hour, she cries more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cries more, more, more (ooh)
In the midnight hour babe you cry more, more, more (oh)
With a rebel yell you cry more, more, more
More, more, more!
More, more, more
More, more, more! Wow!
Come on, little angel
More, more, more
Come on, little angel
More, more, more
More, more, more
With a rebel yell
More, more, moreEmbed
