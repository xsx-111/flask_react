Blue Highway (Original Demo) Lyrics
Wooooow!

So, my good friend
The super drug ends
I go up to the stratosphere
Brain fry Day-Glo
Holy water for your soul
And I wake up in the U.S.A
Ow!

Yes, we're gonna ride on the blue highway (oo)
Walk with electro glide on the blue highway
Say hello to Christ on the blue highway
Yes, I almost died on the blue highway

Oh, Sons from Mars
On stolen guitars
Out to ride the night
Soul sisters, soul hitters
I hear you, and I miss you
Co-starring in the U.S.A
Aaaw, yes, we're gonna ride on the blue highway
Come, we've got less pride on the blue highway
 and love on the blue highway
Yes, it's true I almost died on the blue highway
Ow!

Why do I miss you?
Why did I kiss you? Oooh!
Yes, we're gonna ride on the blue highway
Come on and shake a leg on the blue highway
Be a mother and father of the bride on the blue highway
Yes, I almost died
So glad that you’re living now
I’m glad that you’re here
I’m glad that you want to stay, because
You know we gotta ride on the blue highway
 another chance on the blue highway, hey hey
 on stolen guitar on the blue highway
There's a chance you might die on the blue highway (oh)
On the  blue highway (ow, oo)
Quaaludes and red wine for love
Yes, there's a time, a time for love
Can I kiss you on the blue highway? Hey
Yes, I almost died on the blue highway
Wave hello to Jesus Christ on the blue highway
Just another month on the blue highway
Up in the stratosphere
Ow!
Why do I miss you?
Why did I kiss you?
Ow  Ssss...Embed
