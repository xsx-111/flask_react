The Dead Next Door Lyrics
Watch the sky
For a reason why
I was safe here
Sunday was hot
Monday was not
Monday was not
For the dead next door
One error, silent terror
And, and we're the dead next door

The heat of the day, fade, fades away
Fades into night
The heat of the day
Suffering away
Suffering away
For the dead next door
You see
One error, silent terror
And, and we're the dead next door

In animal love
In dark as ink and blood
One thing you should know
Don't hear their cries
Don't eat out of their hands
Ghosts don't die
You see
Ghosts don't cry
It's easy
You and me
You and me
With the dead next door
You and me
With the dead next door
You and me
With the dead next door
You and me
With the dead next door1Embed
