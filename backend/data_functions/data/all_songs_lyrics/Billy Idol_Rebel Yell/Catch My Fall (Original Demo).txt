Catch My Fall (Original Demo) LyricsWhen I'm a man, will I still sin, yeah
I'm just a boy, will I still win, yeah
Lost song of lovers and fellow travelers, yeah
Leave me sad and hollow, yeah, out of words
It could happen to you
So think for yourself:
If I should stumble
Won't you catch my fall, yeah
If I should stumble
Won't you catch my fall
Catch me
Catch my fall
If I should stumble and fall
I've traveled and unwound my truth, yeah
Laid my head on the rock of youth, yeah
I've trusted and then broken my own word
Just to keep me free in this mad, mad world
It could happen to you
So think for yourself:
If I should stumble
Won't you catch my fall ,yeah
If I should stumble
Won't you catch my fall
Catch my fall
Friends and lovers
Keep your uphill face
Friends and lovers
Even those who hate
We're strong when we're one
We're humble when we're wrong
And then I know
You'll catch me, catch me, catch me when I fall
So we'll say it once more, say it
And if I stumble
Won't you catch me when I fall
And if I stumble
Catch my fall, yeah
Catch my fall
Catch my fall
And if I stumble
Won't you catch my fall
Catch my fall
Yes, I know
Catch me when I fallEmbed
