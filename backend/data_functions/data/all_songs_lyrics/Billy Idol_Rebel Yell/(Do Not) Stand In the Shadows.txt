(Do Not) Stand In the Shadows Lyrics
Hearts which beat to a precise beat
Painting shadows on the wall
We'll cut out cars
Drive out bars
All for one, one for all
Like teenage sleaze
And comic book cheese
With your heart on your sleeve
Well, you know you won't run
You won't hide
And you jump like a son of a gun
Ow!

Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow, oh oh
Do not stand in the shadow

Oh lonely
Oh lonely
Watching people on my wall
Well my Mama and Dadda thought they had me fooled
I was thinking, not at all
Well, I got out
Not gonna stand
In the dark without a light
Forget ill luck
If you believe that chance can sit and wait
Wow!
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Dark even in the shadow, oh oh
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow, oh oh
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow, oh oh oh
Oh oh
Rowarh!


And now we've touched down
Moving all around
Yeah, living to a blaster sound
No preachers, teachers freak out man
To the sound of false alarm
They ain't here today
Let me hear you say
You're alive and you're living with me
So, don't try to hide
Don't try to die
In the dark of the night
Wow!
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow, oh oh
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
In the shadow
In the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow1Embed
