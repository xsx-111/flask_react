Daytime Drama Lyrics
Day by day, hour by hour
What haunts my nighttime starts my daylight
Even good friends have no answers
Beautiful stars
(Ow) You don't want hard cash, just a few facts
Its use and abuse, you'd write your story
As work for playtime, time for love
My beautiful stars, beautiful stars

Don't touch her, man
I want her over and over again
Don't touch her, man
I want her over and over again

Beautiful star in my daytime drama
When I ask the question for an answer
See you dancing, romancing what I want
My beautiful star, beautiful star  (ow ow ow)

Don't touch her, man
I want her over and over again
Don't touch her, man
I want her over and over and over and over
Oh..
Beautiful star of my daytime drama
Yes, it's in my hand now
You're my hope for a future
Beautiful star of my daytime drama
Love to win a boy
You're my hope for a future
Some are happy
Some are amazed
Some are devoted
Some are saved
I was one, but I was saved
Again, again
Beautiful star of a daytime drama, yeah
