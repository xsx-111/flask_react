Flesh for Fantasy (Session Take) Lyrics
2! 1, 2!

There's been a change of pace
Of fantasy and taste, yeah
Want to make your fortune
Would you use your face?
Do you like good music?
Do you like to dance?
You know, this is my address
Woke up single

Back to back and face to face
Well, here you are in a new place

Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy

Well, it's after - oh
You know it's after midnight
It means you feel uptight
You know this physical attraction
And you better understand
Back to back and back to back
Here am I and my sex attack

Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Ow!
Whoo! Ow!

Face to face and back to back
Flesh for flesh and a  attack
When you want good music
You want to dance, oh yeah
When you know it's in your pants
Wow!

Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Flesh for fantasy
Ooo, there's a change of pace
Of fantasy and taste
I'll send some information
Feel that 
Do you like good music?
Do you like to dance? Yeah
 of fortune
Don't try to
It's written in my hand
You better understand, yeah
Yeah
