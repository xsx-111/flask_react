Blue Highway Lyrics
Wooooow

So, my good friend
The super drug ends
I go up to the stratosphere
Brain fry Day-Glo
Holy water for your soul
And I’ll wake up in the U.S.A

Aaaw, you know we gonna ride on the blue highway
Walk with electro glide on the blue highway
Wave below to Christ on my highway
Yes, I almost died on the blue highway, hey hey

Oh, the Sons from Mars
On their stolen guitars
Out to ride the night, aah
Soul sisters, soul hitter
I hear you and I miss you
Co-starring in the U.S.A

Aaaw, you know we gotta ride on the blue highway - oh!
Walk with electro glide on the blue highway
Wave below to Christ on my highway - oh!
Yes, I almost died on a blue highway, hey hey
Ow!
Why do I miss you?
Why did I kiss you, because

You know we gotta ride on the blue highway (oh)
Walk with electro glide on the blue highway
Wave below to Christ on my highway
Yes, I almost died
So glad that you’re living now
I’m glad that you’re here
I’m glad that you want to stay, because
You know we gotta ride on the blue highway (ow)
Walk with electro glide on the blue highway, hey hey
Wave below to Christ on my highway
Aah yes, I almost died on a blue highway, hey hey, aaw
On a blue highway

Ahhh cha singing, singing
Quaaludes and red wine for love
Yes, there's a time, a time for love
Can you kiss me on a blue highway, hey hey
(ow,  roawar)
Why do I miss you?
How do I kiss you? (ow, whoo)2Embed
