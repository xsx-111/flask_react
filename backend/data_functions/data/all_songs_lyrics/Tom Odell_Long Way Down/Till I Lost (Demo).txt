Till I Lost (Demo) Lyrics
A coffee stain on a window sill
A bad translation to a foreign film (maybe)
Just walking around with you
Walking these towns with you
Oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

The tiny crack on the city stone
A welcome back to your troubled home (maybe just)
Just walking around with you
Just walking around with you
Oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

Ohhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhh
I didn't feel her love until I lost

The moving shadows on a swaying light
These dusty pillows to hold at night (or maybe just)
Walking around with you
Just waking around with you
Oh oh oh oh would that be enough
The market gifts that fill her drawers (yeah)
Or her little feet on my creaking floors (or maybe just)
Just walking around with you saying
Just walking around with you saying
Oh oh oh oh it might be enough

Ohhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed (no)
Ohhhhhh
I didn't feel her love until I lost (you know)
Ohhhhhh
I didn't see the see until I crossed (no, no)
Ohhhhhh
I didn't feel her love until I lost
Lost, lost, 'till i lostEmbed
