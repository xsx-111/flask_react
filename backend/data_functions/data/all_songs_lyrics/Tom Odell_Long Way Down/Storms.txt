Storms Lyrics
So long
So long living
With these heavy clouds
Following me

I can't go on
I can't go on running
With these muddy roads
Holding my feet

Need one of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash me clean

So long (so long)
I've spent so long
Just living
With these heavy clothes
Upon my skin

I've spent so long (so long)
So long thinking
These sleepless nights
They keep me thin
I need one of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash us clean
One of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash us clean
Oh, yeah!


Need one of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash us clean
I need one of these storms
One of these storms
One of these storms
To wash us clean

Oh, honey, I'll see2Embed
