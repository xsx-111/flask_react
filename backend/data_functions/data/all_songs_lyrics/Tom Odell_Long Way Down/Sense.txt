Sense Lyrics
Hard to know, maybe if I skim the stone
Walk a different way back home, it would all make sense
Oh, shut my eyes, lose myself in teenage lies
If I fell in love a thousand times, would it all make sense?

'Cause I've been feeling pretty small
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line I ever get a hold it seems to break

Could call you up
I could tell you just how much
No, no, maybe I will just get drunk and it will all make sense
Or if I weren't so nice, I'd convince my friends that you weren't right
I could promise you my heart don't cry
But would it all make sense?

'Cause I, I've been feeling pretty small
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line I ever get a hold it seems to break
Oh I, I've been feeling pretty small
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line I ever get a hold it seems to break9Embed
