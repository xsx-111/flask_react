Long Way Down Lyrics
Walking on the rooftops
Talking of times
With our eyes a-glowing
Like the city lights
She stands on the ledge
She says, "It looks so high"

You know it's a

Long way down
Feels like a long way down
It feels like a long way down
Like a long way down
Oh, honey, don't leave, don't leave
Please, don't leave me now

'Cause I can feel the rivers
Winding through the lands
Two lines, and a poet
You know, like a kind old rye
You know we could talk in that language
Only we understand
But you know, honey, it's a

Long way down
You know love, is a long way down
It feels like a long way down
Oh, it feels like a long way down
Oh, honey, don't leave, don't leave
Please, don't leave me now13Embed
