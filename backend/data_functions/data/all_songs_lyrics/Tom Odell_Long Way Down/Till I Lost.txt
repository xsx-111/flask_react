Till I Lost Lyrics
A coffee stain on a window sill
A bad translation to a foreign film
Just wandering 'round with you, you know
Just wandering town with you
Oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

The tiny cracks on the city stone
A welcome back to your troubled home
Just wandering 'round with you
Just wandering town with you, you know
Oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

Oh, oh, ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhhhhh
I didn't feel your love until I lost

The moving shadows on your swaying light
Or your picture notes of your porcupines
Just wandering around with you, you know
Just walking these towns with you
Oh oh oh oh
Would be enough
But, ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhhhhh
I didn't feel your love until I lost
Ohhhhhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhhhhh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost7Embed
