Supposed to Be Lyrics
Sat on the rooftop
Watching the birds flying free
Watching the clouds walk
And watching the rain become the sea
Hearing my love talk
In every breath she ever breathes
Like it was always supposed to be like that

But then we broke up (Oh, no)
And she went west and I went east
She got a new boyfriend (Oh, no)
A little too soon if you're asking me
But I've heard that she loves him
A little bit more than she'll ever love me
And it was always supposed to be like that

I looked to the skyline, I said:
"How many falls until I fly?"
Looked to the old times, I said:
"How many wrongs until I'm right?"
I know it's tough now
'Cause love always, love always is unkind
I sat on the rooftop
And I watched the birds flying free
I watched the clouds walk (Oh)
And I watched the rain become the sea
And just for a moment, yeah (Oh)
Just for a moment I felt so free
From all I'm supposed to be

I looked to the skyline, I said:
"How many falls until I fly?"
Looked to the old times, I said:
"How many wrongs until I'm right?"
I know it's tough now
'Cause love always, love always is unkind9Embed
