Tonight LyricsTonight I am on top of the world
Tonight I'm the center of the universe
Tonight I am
Tonight I am
Last night I was nobody at all
Last night I was waiting for somebody to call
Last night I was
Last night I was
Last night was the one that nobody wants to see
The one that nobody ever tries to know
Or even wants to be
Oh, isn't it good to say
That everything comes your way
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Tonight
Tomorrow I'll be the same again
Tomorrow I'm gonna stop to pretend
Tomorrow I'll be
Tomorrow I'll be
Tomorrow I'll be
I'll be
I'll be do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Pa, pa, pa, da, da
Do, do, doEmbed
