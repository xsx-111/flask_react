James Last Experience LyricsYou can teach me every rule that's been made
And you can tell which one I should break
You can criticize the name of my game
But you don't now what it means to come home
By the end of the day
You can say that I'm a pain in the ass
And you can tell me that I've got no class
You can laugh and say I'm out of date
But you don't know how it feels to come home
By the end of the day
Into the tunnel we travel again
We're you of our heads
And it's the end of the day
You can sing me any song that's been made
And you can show me just how I should play
You can tell me about the meaning of words
But you don't now what it means to come home
By the end of the day
Into the tunnel we travel againg
We're out of our heads
And it's the end of the day
It's the end of the day
It's the end of the day
It's the end of the day...Embed
