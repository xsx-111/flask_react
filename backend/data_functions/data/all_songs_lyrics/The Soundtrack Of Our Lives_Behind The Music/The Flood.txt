The Flood LyricsThey say, we're overrated
By the things we do
They say, we're all backdated
Well, you know it's true
Life is not calling for you
When you don't know
Where you belong into this world
They say, we're complicated
Well, I don't know why
And they say, we're all forsaken
Well, at least I try
Life is not calling for you
When you don't know
What turns you on into this world
We're coming out of nowhere
And we've got nothing to lose
'Cause you can't see what you are
And you don't know what to do
Well, life is not calling for you
When you don't know
Where you belong into this world
I thought, I was somebody
I thought, I had it made
And I thought, I knew someone
Who could take me away
But life will be calling for me
But I don't think it's today
So please wash me awayEmbed
