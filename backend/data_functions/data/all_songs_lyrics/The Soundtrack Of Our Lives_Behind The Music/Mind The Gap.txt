Mind The Gap LyricsMind the gap, mind your head
Mind the things your mama said
Mind the future, mind the past
If you think we move too fast
Mind when green turns to red
Mind the people that are dead
And the things they've said and done
If it turns you on
'Cause you can draw the line
Don't throw your pearls at swine
Mind the fortune, mind the fame
Mind the ones who live in shame
Mind the missions you fulfill
And the people that you kill
Mind the net you cast out
And the fields full of doubt
Mind the circle that you're in
When it all begins
'Cause you can draw the line
Don't throw your pearls at swine
Yes, you can draw the line, 'cause we're takin' over
If you got nothing to say
Yes, we're takin' over
And we might as well blow you away
Mind the gap, mind your head
Turning back
Mind your future, mind your past
If you think you're gonna last
'Cause we're takin' over
When you've got nothing to say
Yes, we're takin' over
So we might as well blow you away
Yes, we're takin' over
If you've got nothing today
Yes, we're takin' over
And we might as well blow you away
And we might as well blow you away
We might as well blow you awayEmbed
