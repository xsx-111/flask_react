Nevermore LyricsNevermore
Everybody's knockin' on you door
Nevermore
Everybody wants to know what for
There's a million ways to make I sway
If you roll it for another day
Nevermore
Everybody's climbing on your walls
Nevermore
Everybody wants to see you fall
There's a million ways to step aside
When the situation wants to die with you
Nevermore
Well, everybody wants to have it all
Nevermore
Everybody's waiting for a call
Well, there's a million ways to make it sway
So let's roll it for another day
And belong for evermoreEmbed
