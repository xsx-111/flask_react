Slow Drift Away LyricsTake your time for asking
'Cause I cannot let you fall
Take your time for asking
'Cause I cannot let you fall
Take your time for asking
'Cause I cannot let you fall
Take your time for asking
'Cause I cannot let you fall
Take your time and tell me what you see
'Cause I cannot let you fall in love with me
Is it any wonder if my world is inside out
And you don't even want to ask me how I feel
Take your time for asking
'Cause I cannot let you fall
Take your time for asking
'Cause I cannot let you fall
Take your time for asking me and stay
'Cause I cannot let you fall down in my way
Is it any wondеr if my world is inside out
When you don't ask me whilе I slowly drift away
While I slowly drift away
While I slowly drift away
While I slowly drift away
While I slowly drift awayEmbed
