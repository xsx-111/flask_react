Still Aging LyricsI'm still aging, so won't you please come home?
Yeah, I'm still aging, so won't you come back home?
Oh, here's a song I wrote a hundred thousand years ago
It was the time when the earth was covered in snow
Well, I was the ground and you were the sky
Oh, it was so hard to reach you and I just wanted to cry
Well, here's a song I wrote when I was about a hundred and forty-four
It was the time when I just couldn't take it anymore
I had to split into pieces to get by
It was a time of delusion, to live I just had to die
But what does it matter when you know it's not too late?
Yeah, what does it matter when you know it's not too late?
'Cause I'm still aging, so won't you come back home?
Yeah, I'm still aging, so won't you please come home?
The pressure's rising and I can feel it inside
It's an expanding field of magnetic flies
It's buzzin' in my head and I don't know what I'm doing
It's just a way of perception and what I'm trying to ruin
But what does it matter when you know it's not too late?
Yeah, what does it matter when you know it's not too late?
Yeah, what does it matter when you know it's not too late?
'Cause I'm still aging, so won't you please come home?
(Won't you please come home?)
Yeah, I'm still aging, so won't you come back home?
Yeah, I'm still aging, so won't you please come home?
(Won't you please come home?)
And I'm still aging, so won't you come back home?
Won't you please come home?
(Won't you come back home?)
Won't you please come home?
Please come home
Daddy's waiting for youEmbed
