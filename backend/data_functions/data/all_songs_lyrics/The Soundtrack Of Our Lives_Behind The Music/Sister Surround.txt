Sister Surround LyricsYou're a rhyme without a reason
And you know it so well
Who's the king of the season
Well you never can tell
Though it's so plain to see
You think you like to be normal
You think you're in control
But the action you take only makes you small
Just like the way it should be
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister take care of me
You're a book out of nowhere
Being read all the time
And the things that you give me
Only shows that your blind
And when you know it's all over
And you're goin' insane
Well I'm just there to remind you that I can't feel no pain
Why don't you let it be
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister
Cause I'm not afraid to fall
No I'm not afraid to fall
I'm not afraid at all
At all
Come on
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister
Cause I'm not afraid to fallEmbed
