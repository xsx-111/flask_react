Infra Riot LyricsIt's time to take control again and be the only one
It's time to take control again and be the only one
'Cause I just wanna play with myself and I don't need anyone else
Rising with the sons of madness crossin' over the road
It's time to take control again and be the only one
It's time to sell your soul again and be the holy one
'Cause I just wanna finish this race and I don't wanna lose my face
Looking for a new direction crossin' over the road
So welcome to the other side
Don't be afraid to testify, it's not too late to get you high
Reaching for somebody in your image world
Waiting for a sign of a change crossin' over the road
It's time to take control again and be the only one
It's time to play your role again and be the holy one
'Cause I don't think that anyone knows
So welcome to the other side
Don't be afraid to crucify, it's not too late to free your mind
Reaching for somebody in your image world
Waiting for some kind of a change crossin' over the road
It's time to take control again and be the only one
It's time to sell your soul again and be the holy one
It's time to rise above again and be the only one
'Cause I don't think that anyone cares
So welcome to the other side
Don't be afraid to testify, it's not too late to get you high
Reaching for somebody in your image world
Waiting for a sign of a change crossin' over the road
Reaching for somebody in your image world
Waiting for some kind of a change crossin' over the roadEmbed
