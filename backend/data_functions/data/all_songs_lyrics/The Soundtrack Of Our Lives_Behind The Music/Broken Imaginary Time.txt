Broken Imaginary Time LyricsIt's the end of a broken imaginary time
It didn't stay long, your famous superficial golden tan
When it comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
When it comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a nobody at all
It's the end of a broken imaginary time
It didn't last long, your famous superficial golden tan
When it comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
When it comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a nobody at all
You're such a nobody at allEmbed
