Hang Ten LyricsTen little boys went out to swim
Nine came home with a stronger chin
Nine little boys went out to ride
Eight came home, with a tide
Eight little boys went out to fly
Seven came home and they started to cry
Seven boys went out for food
Six came home in a different mood
Six went out for some kicks
Five came home, telling the same
Telling the same
Telling the samе
Five little boys went out to gеt cured
Four came home, easily bored
Four went out for some truth
Three came home, loose in their youth
Loose in their youth
Loose in their youth
Three went out for some share
Two came home trying to hide it somewhere
Two little boys went out for a friend
One came home in the end
One went out, for a refrain
No-one came home, can someone explain?
Oh, isn't that a shameEmbed
