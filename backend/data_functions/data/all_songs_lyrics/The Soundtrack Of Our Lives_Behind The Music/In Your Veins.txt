In Your Veins LyricsTrees are falling all around
Silence clouds are on the ground
Someone whispers in your ear
This is what you like to hear
I'm on your side
And I am also blue
'Cause I am still a child
And I know that you are too
Pancakes spinning 'round the sun
Flat earth projects has begun
Catwalk on suburban trains
Summer is inside your veins, your veins
And I am on your side
And I am also blue
'Cause I am still a child
And know that you are too
Yes, I am on your side
And I am all so blue
And don't you feel inside
That I still believe in you?
I still believe in youEmbed
