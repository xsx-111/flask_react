Dow Jones Syndrome LyricsI'd like to stay here for a while
But I just have to leave today
I guess I have to much inside
That's way I'm giving it all away
This is not what you've asked for
And there's nothing you can do
I guess I'm not afraid to die
That's why I'm giving it all away
Yes, I'm giving it all away
My point of view has changed
And I can't stand to watch you fall
It only brings me sorrow
By the numbers you call
I do not want to use you
As a cause for my disease
But I can't wait until tomorrow
So I'm giving it all away
Yes, I'm giving it all away
I guess I'm doing it all the way... now!
People want to find out things
That cannot be explained
They try to look for answers
Just to help them ease the pain
I tried to sing along
But something didn't catch my ear
Because I got no time left to borrow
So I'm giving it all away
Yes, I'm giving it all away
I guess I'm doing it all the way now...
Down! Down! Down! I wanna beat it down!
And try to reach above it now
Down! Down! Down! I wanna beat it down!
And try to reach above it now
Down! Down! Down! I wanna beat it down!
And try to reach above it now
Because down, that's the way it goes
Down, that's the way it goes...Embed
