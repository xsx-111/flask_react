Ten Years Ahead LyricsWell it's so good, I didn't have to make it
It's so good I didn't have to break it
Cause I'm ten years ahead, and your the echo of the things I say
Yes I'm ten years ahead....
It's so hard I didn't want to guide you
Right from the start I only wanted to please you, didn't mean to kill you
But I'm ten years ahead, and your the echo of the things I say
Yes I'm ten years ahead....
Well it's no good revolving around me
You know you shouldn't try to stay behind me, when you cannot reach me
Cause I'm ten years ahead, and your the echo of the words I say
Yes I'm ten years aheadEmbed
