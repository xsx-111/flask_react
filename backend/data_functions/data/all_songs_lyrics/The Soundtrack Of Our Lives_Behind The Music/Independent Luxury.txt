Independent Luxury LyricsRemember how it all used to be
Remember how it all used to be
Well, everybody wants to be
In independent luxury
Everybody wants to be, the enemy
A remedy for independent luxury
Remember what we all used to say
If ever we could find a better way
Well, people find their proper place
I'm trying not to lose my face
So remember what we all used to say
Well, everybody wants to be
In independent luxury
Everybody wants to see the enemy
A remedy for independent luxury
Well, it's better to burn out than play
It makes no difference anyway
Just remember, if it ever comes your way
That everybody wants to be, in independent luxury
Everybody wants to see
The enemy a remedy, for independent luxury
The enemy a remedy, for independent luxuryEmbed
