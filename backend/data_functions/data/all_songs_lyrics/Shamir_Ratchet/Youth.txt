Youth Lyrics
Show me your glowing armor
My shining knight
Blind me with valor and honor
Shaded from the wicked night

My eyes seem to deceive me
But my heart knows the truth

We wish that blithe behavior
Was left in our, our youth
But we, we have no clue

Charm on through as you do
But your horns are peaking out
I know the game you're playing
No more cat and mouse

We wish that blithe behavior
Was something we can choose
And was left in our, our youth
But we, we have no clue
Was left in our, our youth
But we, we have no clue

Youth, youth, youth, youth, youth
Wish we left it in our...  (x16)
Oh youth! (x8)Embed
