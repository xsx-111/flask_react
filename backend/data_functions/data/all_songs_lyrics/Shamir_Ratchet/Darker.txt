Darker Lyrics
We're just shells
That are dwelled
But our souls blow
To a new dimension of self
But the love we leave
Is our legacy
So we'll keep it alive
And our memory

Because it doesn't get darker
Unless you expect it to
Cause it's getting harder to contain the truth
It doesn't get darker
Unless you expect it to
It's just getting harder to contain the truth

And they tell us things
And say it's universal love
But they're just lying
And slowly getting caught
Whether pale skin
Or melanated flesh
Yeah, we'll keep it alive
Above all the rest
You know it doesn't get darker
Unless you expect it to
Cause it's getting harder to contain the truth
You know it doesn't get darker
Unless you expect it to
Cause it's getting harder to contain the truth

You can't contain the truth
You can't contain the truth
You can't contain the truth
You can't contain the truth1Embed
