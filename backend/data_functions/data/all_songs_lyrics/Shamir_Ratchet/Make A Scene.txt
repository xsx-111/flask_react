Make A Scene Lyrics
Stranger kisses and pixie dust
Crazy nights that’s filled with lust
I don’t know you, and really don’t care, ‘cause
I’m never really aware, and
Girls like guys who’s ripped and buff, and
Guys like girls who have big butts, and
Girls are sad all of the time, ‘cause
Good guys are so hard to find

So why not, go out and make a scene?


Live it up, it’ saturday night, so let’s
Puke our guts and start some fights
It’s side-effects of teen idleness, so
Adulthood is one big mess
They say I’m a big party machine, and
And all my friends say i get so mean, but
What do they know?  They’re just all upset because
Life’s no answers, just one big guess

So why not, go out and make a scene?
So why not, go out and make a scene?

So don’t complain, complain, complain
Just do something, something, something
We’re giving up on all our dreams, so
Why not go out, and make a scene?
So don’t complain, complain, complain
Just do something, something, something
We’re giving up on all our dreams, so
Why not go out, and make a scene?

So why not go out, and make a scene?3Embed
