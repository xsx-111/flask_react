KC Lyrics
She came up to me and said," my name is KC."
And I like koala bears
Said I think they're so cute
And I think you are too
You look so smart
When you ponytail your hair

Ooh. (x2)

KC's got style
She's as sharp as a child
And always comes with a sunny disposition
She says "I think you're so cool,"
And she has one simple rule
She's lived life without a single care

Ooh. (x2)
