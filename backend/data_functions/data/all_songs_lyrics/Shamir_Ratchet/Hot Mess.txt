Hot Mess Lyrics
What ever happened to Mort Marcus or Satcha. How about Hugo Mittens or Elijah Smoothe or Alfonse Decree? And Teddy Pasta, a straight hair rasta, with a bone straight weave that will bring you to your knees. Assuming they're all hot messes like me. Mm... who knows?
This is the time
This is the time
This is the time
This is the time

Never thought I'd be this cold
'Cause of my life, I've lost a hold
You can have it, it's yours, not mine
'Cause the only thing on my mind is...

It's all of me what's born to be
'Cause what they say is not what it seems
Feel like I'm right but always wrong
Guess I just don't belong

Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot

Can I have a drink? Don't wanna think
'Cause my outlook's on my enemy
Just wanna sleep 'cause I miss the link
Between what I want and what's given to me
It's all of me what's born to be
'Cause what they say is not what it seems
Feel like I'm right but always wrong
Guess I just don't belong

Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn

My body aches
My mind's at rest
Thinking about every bad decision
Feel so alone
Don't have a home
But I'm part of a bigger mission
It's all of me what's born to be
'Cause what they say is not what it seems
Feel like I'm right but always wrong
I guess I just don't belong

Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn he's a hot mess
Damn

Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Damn, he's a hot mess
Damn, he's a hot mess
Damn, he's a hot mess
Damn, he's a hot mess
Damn, he's a hot mess
Damn, he's a hot mess
Damn
The time...Embed
