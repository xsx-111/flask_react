Call It Off Lyrics
Shamir Bailey
North Las Vegas
It’s not time to get started
It’s time to call it off

I’ve been trying to find a reason to keep us together
Try to make up my bed of lies and call the night my shelter

It’s time to call it off
And this time, it’s not my fault
(Hey Shamir what time is it?)

It’s time to walk out the door
It’s time to get gone
It’s time to walk out the door
It’s time to

You tried to blindfold me from the pain you breathe
And you said you’d never leave
You had me blame myself, question my mental health
Like I’m the one who needed questioning
It’s time to call it off
And this time, it’s not my fault
It’s time to call it off
(It's time to It's time to It's time to)
And this time, it’s not my fault
(It's time to It's time to It's time to)
It’s time to call it off
(It's time to It's time to It's time to It's time to)
(It's time to)
It's time to)
It's time to)

Just can’t make a thot a wife
No more basic, ratchet guys
Listen up, I’m saving you
From all the hell that you’ll go through
Just can’t make a thot a wife
No more basic, ratchet guys
Listen up
I’m saving you
I’m saving you
I’m saving you

It’s time to call it off
And this time, it’s not my fault
It’s time to call it off (It’s time to) (It’s time to)
(It’s time to)
(It’s time to)
(It’s time to)
And this time, it’s not my fault
It’s time to
It’s time to
It’s time to
It’s time to5Embed
