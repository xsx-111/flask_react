On the Regular Lyrics
Hi, hi, howdy, howdy, hi, hi!
While everyone is minus, you could call me multiply
Just so you know, yes, yes, I'm that guy
You could get five fingers and I'm not waving "hi"
Guess I'm never-ending, you could call me pi
But really, how long till the world realize?
Yes, yes I'm the best, fuck what you heard
Anything less is (obviously absurd)

Haters get the bird, more like an eagle
This is my movie, stay tuned for the sequel
Seems so wrong, seems so illegal
Fellas in the back like a foul-ball free-throw

Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know
Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know

I come with the tip, with the blow, with the boom
And if you're in my way, there's nothing but doom
Ain't got no time for you ratchet-ass goons
And just settle down, listen to my tunes
Ever since I was eight I was attached to the mic
Wanted a guitar before I wanted a bike
Had an Epiphone, fuck a Fisher-Price
Never see the sun cause I'm up all night (what?)
Really, really? Really, really?
You want to talk shit but you know that I am illy?
Illy to the fullest, you can call me cancer
No multiple choice, cause I'm the only answer
Ain't got no wallet, only use rubber bands
You know my chick is ratchet cause bands a make her dance
You wanna get at me, but you don't stand a chance
And if you wanna fuck with us you can get these hands

Haters get the bird, more like an eagle
This is my movie, stay tuned for the sequel
Seems so wrong, seems so illegal
Fellas in the back like a foul-ball free-throw

Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know
Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know

Five-foot-ten, about a buck twenty
Skinny as a rod but still won't fuck with me
Wise ass nigga, you'd think I was 50
But I take your 50 after you take this spliff, see?
Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know

Don't try me, I'm not a free sample
Step to me and you will be handled
See, that's my crown on the mantle
And if you try to touch it, yes, there will be scandal
Don't try me, I'm not a free sample
Step to me and you will be handled
See, that's my crown on the mantle
And if you try to touch it, yes, there will be scandal

This is the end, but you really feeling it
Here's one more verse, cause I ainâ€™t no stingy bitch
Ain't got much to say cause it's in my piece
Guess my words are blunt and I ain't talking weed

Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know
Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know22Embed
