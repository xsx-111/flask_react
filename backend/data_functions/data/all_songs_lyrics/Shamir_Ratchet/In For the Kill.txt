In For the Kill Lyrics
Cut me off and say goodbye
I'm ready to be sacrificed
Tell my loved ones I wished them well
And I'm sorry and always will be

I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Go in for the kill

Well I know, I'm just a compromise
But still, there's life in my eyes
Stay still and surrender to defeat
Where pain and madness meet

I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Go in for the kill

Please don't cry
Turn around and say goodbye
I'll be back someday
And when I do
I promise you
I won't make the same mistakes again
I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Go in for the kill
But can't you see
I'm holding on desperately
But you know they always will
Go in for the kill1Embed
