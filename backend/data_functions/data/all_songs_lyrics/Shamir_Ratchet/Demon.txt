Demon Lyrics
The honor roll was all I'd known
'Til you took me over to the dark side
The thrill was good, together we stood
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde
We'll stay on the run
Forget the bad things we done
We were fit for survival, no books but the Bible
Held out with a gun

My wings turned black, no turning back
Yeah you have me completely
Enriched in you, together we flew
Yeah you're the trap that captured me
And I don't wanna go on
Don't let my momma know
That I'm a ride or die and it feels so right
And I've gone and sold my soul

If I'm a demon, baby
You're the beast that made me
Falling from grace
We're falling oh so gracefully
It's in your nature, girl
You're not to blame
I chose to go with you and leave
So much shame
If I'm a demon, baby
You're the beast that made me
We're on the fast lane
It's you and me together, baby, always
We're on the fast lane
It's you and me together, baby, always
We're on the fast lane
It's you and me together, baby, always
We're on the fast lane
We're on, we're on

If I'm a demon, baby
You're the beast that made me
Falling from grace
We're falling oh so gracefully
It's in your nature, girl
You're not to blame
I chose to go with you and leave
So much shame
If I'm a demon, baby
You're the beast that made me
If I'm a demon, baby
You're the beast that made me
Falling from grace
We're falling oh so gracefully
It's in your nature, girl
You're not to blame
I chose to go with you and leave
So much shame
If I'm a demon
You made me
We're on the fast lane
It's you and me together, baby, always
We're on the fast lane
It's you and me together, baby, always
We're on the fast lane
It's you and me together, baby, always
We're on the fast lane
We're on, we're on1Embed
