Sharleena LyricsI'm cryin'
I'm cryin'
Cryin' for Sharleena
Don't you know
I called up all my baby's friends
'N ask'n um
Where she done went
But nobody 'round here seems to know
Where my Sharleena's been
Where my Sharleena's been
Ten long years I have been lovin' here
Ten long years
And I thought deep down in my heart
She was mine
Ten long years I have been lovin' here
Ten long years and I would call her my baby, and now
I'm always cryin'
I would be so delighted
I would be so delighted
If they would just
Send her on home to meEmbed
