Would You Go All the Way? LyricsRemember Freddie and Jo?
The night you went to the show?
(A monster movie)
Clutchin' at yer hand
(Wait ten seconds)
Clutchin' at yer arm
(Wait ten seconds)
Clutchin' at yer elbow â€“
(Wait ten seconds)
Where did your brassiere go?
When the monster came out
Everybody shout
People all around you, screamin' at the monster
The Monster From The U.S.O
Who's this dude with his hair straight back?
His new white socks and his pants all black
His T-shirts rolled, his watch is gold
A '55 Chevy that his brother just sold
With his arm's around yer waist
An' his hand is in yer pants
An' he asks you for a date
To the servicemen's dance
Suppose you don't wanna?
What can you do?
When a joker like that
Got his hands on you
Oh, baby
T-T-T-Tell me baby
Would you go all the way for the U.S.O.?
Would you go all the way for the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way for the U.S.O.?
Lift up your dress, if the answer is "no"
Would you go all the way for the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way for the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way for the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way for the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way for the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way for the U.S.A.?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?
Would you go all the way?Embed
