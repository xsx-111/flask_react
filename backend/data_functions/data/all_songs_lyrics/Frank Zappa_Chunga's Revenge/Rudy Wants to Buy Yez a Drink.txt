Rudy Wants to Buy Yez a Drink LyricsHi and howdy doody
I'm the union man
You can call me Rudy
Any you boys not paid up on your cards? Huh?
You know I'm pleased to meet ya
Been tryin' all day to reach ya
The union's here to help everyone of you
Rock and roll stars
Rock and roll stars
You boys know we care so much
About the way they treat ya
They send a guy like me to every gig
Just to get a chance to meet ya
To check and see
No wrong's been done
That's one good reason
I carry a gun
I hope the bulge
Don't bum you out
Wanna get a good look?
Let me pull it right out
Let me pull it right out
Let me pull it right out
Let me whip it right out
Rudy!

Welcome to Chicago
Welcome to L.A
Welcome to our local here
You'll always hear me say
The work is here, it's a couple a bucks
I'm sure you're glad to pay
Whip it out, here's your receipt
Now I'll go away
Now I'll go away
Now I'll go away
Now I'll go away
Away, yeah
Away, yeah
Away, yeah
Poo-aah...Embed
