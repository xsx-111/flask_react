Road Ladies LyricsDon't it ever get lonesome?
Yeah! Sure gets lonesome
Don't it ever get sad when you go out on the road?
Oh, there was one time in Minneapolis when I thought I had the clap for sure
Don't it ever get lonesome?
Lonesome ain't the word
Don't it ever get sad when you go out on a thirty day tour?
Oh, I'll take away...
You got nothing but groupies and promoters to love you
And a pile of laundry by the hotel door
Don't it ever get lonesome?
Don't it ever give a young man the blues?
Don't it ever get lonesome?
Don't it ever make a young man wanna go back home?
When the P.A. system eats it
And the band plays some of the most terriblest shit you've ever known
Don't you ever miss your house in the country
And your hot little mama too?
Don't you ever miss your house in the country
And your hot little mama too?
Don't you better get a shot from the doctor
What the road ladies do to you?

I know someday I will never
I'll never go out on the road again, oh yeah
I know someday I will never
I ain't gonna roam the countryside no more
I'm gonna hang up them ol' Holiday Inns, yeah
And heal my knees up from when I was doin' it on the floor
See me doing it, see me do it on the floor
Don't you ever miss your house in the country
And your hot little mama too?
Don't you ever miss your house in the country
And your hot little mama too?
Don't you better get a shot from the doctor
What the road ladies do to you?Embed
