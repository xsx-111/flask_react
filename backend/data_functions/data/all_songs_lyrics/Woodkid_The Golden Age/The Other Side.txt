The Other Side Lyrics
I heard a whisper on my shoulder
Pretending life is worth the fight
Oh can you hear the song of thunder
When fear strangles a soldier's pride
And on the surface of the waters
Will dance reflections of the fire in the night

I remember cheering from towers
A face is smiling in the light
I remember the bells, the flowers
Those days are dying in the dark
Boy I was shaped for the fury
Now I pay the price
Of the human race's vice
And I was promised
The glorious ending of a knight
But the crown is out of sight

I'm slowly drifting into slumber
'Cause I have lost the force to fight
It's like a cold hand on my shoulder
I'll see you on the other side
And in the arms of endless anger
Will end the story of a soldier in the dark10Embed
