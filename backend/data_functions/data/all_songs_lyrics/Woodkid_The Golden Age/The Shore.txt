The Shore Lyrics
I walked all day along the shore
I was made for loving you
I drown my pain in alcohol
How could you feel the same way too?
My feet will not walk anymore
So I guess you ought to know the truth
I wonder what I am made for
If I'm not meant to be with you

I wish you were here on the shore
That we could build up something new
I wonder why I am so sure
Nothing's stronger than me and you
Now I'm leaning on the stage door
As I'm writing these words for you
You don't remember anymore
The kisses that I stole from you

I spend my days without you now
And the sky doesn't look that blue
Cause every day I love you more
How could you feel the same way too?
My life is full of wine and gold
But it's not worth it without you
Just like my bed my heart is cold
Now you know I've always loved you10Embed
