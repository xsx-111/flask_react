Stabat Mater Lyrics
In the glorious days till we lost our way
Hey, do you recall when the war was just a game?
Now the wind ventures to other plains
Hey, when will I see you again if I go?
This train whistles and blows all sounds away
Hey, how could we be close again?

Now the night is bathing in disgrace
Hey, do you still braid some flowers in your hair?
Comes the sound of boots and metal chains
Hey, will the perfume of the daisies remain?
A circus of horses is dancing in the bay
Hey, now the fire is in the way
The past is sucked by quick-sands Iâ€™m afraid
Hey, do you recall when the war was just a game?2Embed
