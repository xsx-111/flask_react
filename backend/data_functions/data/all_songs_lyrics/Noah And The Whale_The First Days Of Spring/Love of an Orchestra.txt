Love of an Orchestra LyricsIf you gotta run, run from hope
I know I'll never be lonely
I've got songs in my blood
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra (x3)
So now in my deepest sorrow
There's no need for despair
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra (x3)
If you gotta run, run from hopeEmbed
