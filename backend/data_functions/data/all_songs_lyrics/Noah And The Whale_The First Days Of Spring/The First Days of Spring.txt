The First Days of Spring LyricsIt's the first day of spring
And my life is starting over again
Where the trees grow, the river flows
And its water will wash away my sins
For I do believe that everyone
Has one chance to fuck up their lives
Like a cut down tree, I will rise again
And I'll be bigger and stronger than ever before
If I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back
There's a hope in every new seed
And every flower that grows upon the earth
And though I love you, and you know that
Well I no longer know what that's worth
But I'll come back to you
In a year or so
And rebuild, ready to become
The person you believed in
The person that you used to love
For I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back
For I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back1Embed
