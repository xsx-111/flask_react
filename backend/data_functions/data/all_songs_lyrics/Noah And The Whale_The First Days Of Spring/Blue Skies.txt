Blue Skies Lyrics
This is a song for anyone
With a broken heart
This is a song for anyone
Who can't get out of bed

I'll do anything
To be happy

Oh, 'cause blue skies are coming
But I know that it's hard

This is the last song that I write
While still in love with you
This is the last song that I write
While you're even on my mind

Cause it's time to leave
Those feelings behind

Oh, 'cause blue skies are coming
But I know that it's hard
I don't think that it's the end
But I know we can't keep going
I don't think that it's the end
But I know we can't keep going

But blue skies are coming
Oh, yeah, blue skies are coming
Oh, blue skies are coming
But I know that it's hard1Embed
