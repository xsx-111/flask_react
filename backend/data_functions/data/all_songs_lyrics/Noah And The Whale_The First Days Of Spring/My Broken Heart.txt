My Broken Heart LyricsYou can give up anything when you're following your heart
I never had the time to show I could depart
With my whole being, go back to the start
Oh I promised more in vows than I ever give with my heart
But I'll be lonely
Oh I'll be lonely
Oh I'll be lonely
Oh again
Broken hearts are a fickle thing and complicated too
I thought I believed in love but I've never seen it through
Oh I didn't marry the girl I loved
I saw my world cave in, felt like giving up
But I'll be laughing
Oh I'll be laughing
Oh I'll be laughing
Oh again
I've been looking for hope these days
But love's not finding me
But now my heart's been broken there is nothing you can do
I'm impenetrable to pain
Oh, you can't break my broken heart
Oh no, you can't break my broken heartEmbed
