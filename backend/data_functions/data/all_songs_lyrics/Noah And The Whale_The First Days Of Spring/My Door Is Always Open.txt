My Door Is Always Open LyricsI will only, let you down
I will only, let you down
But my door, is always open
Yeah my door, is always open
Well I don't think, that I ever loved you
But the world is dying to meet you
Oh black birds they sing off the mountains
Joyous love songs that drift through the houses
But now I'm free
Now I'm free
Now I'm free from all your pain
Oh well church bells, they are ringing for you
Oh and choirs are singing in red
Oh your voice could summon the angels
And your beauty, could waken the dead
But now I'm free
Now I'm free
Now I'm free from all your pain
Well you have only let me down
You have only, let me down
But my door is always open
Yeah my door is always open
Yeah I love with my heart and I hold it in my hands
But you know, my heart's not yours. (4x)Embed
