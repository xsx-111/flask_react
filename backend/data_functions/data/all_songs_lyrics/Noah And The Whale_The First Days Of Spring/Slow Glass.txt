Slow Glass LyricsWe'll sing love songs about heartbreak and grief
Sing it's not just music but the pains not brief
We sing, how your love is like a knife to the back
Well I was stabbed and bleeding
But still begging for attack
But I was looking through slow, slow glass
Looking through slow
Slow glass
Well I heard you been singing
Well I was, what I am
Well I never tried to change you, honey I'm your biggest fan
And I loved you back then
But I don't recognize you now
Yeah in fact we're almost strangers and I don't know how
But I've been looking through slow, slow glass
Yeah I've been looking though slow, slow glassEmbed
