Our Window LyricsWell it's four in the morning, things are getting heavy
And we both know that its over, but we're both not ready
And you're talking like a stranger, so I don't know what to do
And I'm calloused and I'm cruel to everyone but you
Yeah the stars shining through our window
And the stars shining through our window
And it's been a while since I stared at the stars
Yeah it's been a while since I stared at the stars
Spring can be the cruelest of months
By bringing in your life
Yeah we're promising so much
Like the pledge that you gave when you said that you'd always love me
But we both know by autumn you're like the color of leaves
Yeah the stars shining through our window
And the stars shining through our window
And its been a while since I stared at the stars
Yeah it's been a while since I stared at the stars
Well I don't think that it's the end, but I know we can't keep going
Well I don't think that it's the end, but I know we can't keep going
Because blue skies are coming, but I know that it's hardEmbed
