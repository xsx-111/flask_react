Stranger LyricsLast night I slept with a stranger
For the first time, since you've gone
Regretfully lying naked, I reflect on what I've done
Her leg still forced inbetween mine, sticking to my skin
Stroking my chest and my hair, head resting below my chin
I'm a fox trapped in the headlights
And I'm waiting, for the tyres to spin over me
Cos everything I love has gone away
Oh, cos everything I love has gone away
Oh the dark night is moving slower, and sleep won't rescue me
Leaving me here to suffer, this shameful misery
So I long for a taste of freedom, or at least freedom from this bed
Silently picking up my clothes, I turn on my heels and I fled
And the dark of the street is no solace to me
Oh and I don't believe my conscience, will ever be clear again
Cos everything I love has gone away
Oh, cos everything I love has gone away
You know in a year, it's gonna be better
You know in a year, I'm gonna be happyEmbed
