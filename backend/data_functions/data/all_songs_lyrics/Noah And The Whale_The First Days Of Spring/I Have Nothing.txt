I Have Nothing LyricsWell I have nothing
I have no one
And I've been so quickly set free
And I love nothing
I love no one
Are words that you whisper in my mind
To someone I don't know
To someone I don't know
To someone
So walk with me
On this new spring morning
I'll walk you til your fears are numb
I'm a new baby weeping
And the flower you're keeping
That without love will wilt and die
I need your light in my life
Need your light in my life
Need your light
So come back to me my darling
Come back to me my darling
I'd do anything to be at your side
I'd be anyone to be at your side
I need your light in my life
Need your light in my life
Need your lightEmbed
