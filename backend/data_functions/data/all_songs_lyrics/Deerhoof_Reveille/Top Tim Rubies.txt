Top Tim Rubies LyricsHe was born here
He should die here
So what can we do without you?
He was born here
He will die here
And what can we do without you?
Oh no, he's already gone, oh no
Top down Jimmy in a stagecoach
Top down Jimmy should have stayed
Top down Jimmy in a stagecoach
Top down Jimmy should have stayed
Jesus should know about that Wednesday
Yes, Jesus should know about that Wednesday
He was born here
He should die here
So what can we do without you?
He was born here
He will die here
And what can we do without you?
Oh no, he's already gone, oh no
Top down Jimmy in a stagecoach
Top down Jimmy should have stayed
Top down Jimmy in a stagecoach
Top down Jimmy should have stayedEmbed
