The Crying Light LyricsLet I shy cry
Under the light
Let I cry sight
A child at night
I can have courage
To receive your love
I can step steps
Follow my blind
Inside myself
The secret grows
My own shelter
Agony goes
The crying light, crying light
I was born to adore you
As a baby in the blind, ooh
I was born to represent you
To carry your head into the sun
To carve you face into the back of the sun
The crying light, crying light
Crying light, crying lightEmbed
