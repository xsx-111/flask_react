Dust and Water LyricsLove the coal
Love the way you're waiting
I love your kind patience
Dust and water, water and dust
Water and dust
Did you think I'd leave you here
Forever?
Dust and water, water and dust
Water and dust
How long can dust wait?
Ask the moon
But ask him soon
Ask him soon
Dust and water, water and dust
Water and dust
Dust and water, water and dustEmbed
