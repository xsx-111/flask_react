Epilepsy Is Dancing LyricsEpilepsy is dancing
She's the Christ now departing
And I'm finding my rhythm
As I twist in the snow
The metal burned in me
Down the brain of my river
For the fire was searching
For a waterway home
I cry, "Glitter is love!"
My eyes pinned inside
With green jewels
Hanging like Christmas stars from a golden vein
As I came to a screaming
Hold me while I'm dreaming
For my fingers are curling
And I cannot breathe
Then I cried in the kitchen
How I'd seen your ghost witching
There's a soldering blue line
Between my eyes
Cut me in quadrants
Leave me in the corner
Cut me in quadrants
Leave me in the corner
Cut me in quadrants
Leave me in the corner
Cut me in quadrants
Leave me in the corner
Ooh now, it's passing
Ooh now, I'm dancing
Ooh now, it's passing
Ooh now, I'm dancing
Ooh now, it's passing
Ooh now, I'm dancing
Ooh now, it's passing
Ooh now, I'm dancingEmbed
