Daylight and the Sun LyricsNow I cry for daylight
Daylight and the sun
Now I cry for daylight
Daylight everyone
Daylight in my heart
Daylight in the trees
Daylight kisses everything
She can see
There was no light
Only the white night
First born when the sun
Screamed her eyes wide open
Daylight in the fields
Daylight mountains
Fire kisses the floor
Of the lakes and makes shadows
Now I cry for daylight
Daylight and the sun
Now I cry for daylight
Daylight everyone
Daylight in my heart
Daylight in the trees
Daylight kisses everything
She can see
Daylight in my heart
Daylight in the trees
Daylight kisses everything
She can see
Ooh, your dream
Here on the water
Warm the sand
The seagulls calling
Kissed by kindness
Kissed by kindness
Kissed by kindness
Kissed by kindness
Ooh, your dream
Here on the water
Warm the sand
The seagulls calling
Kissed by kindness
Kissed by kindness
Kissed by kindness
Kissed by kindness
You gave me this
Your fire becomes a kiss
You gave me this
Your fire becomes a kissEmbed
