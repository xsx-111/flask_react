Another World LyricsI need another place
Will there be peace?
I need another world
This one's nearly gone
Still have too many dreams
Never seen the light
I need another world
A place where I can go
I'm gonna miss the sea
I'm gonna miss the snow
I'm gonna miss the bees
I'll miss the things that grow
I'm gonna miss the trees
I'm gonna miss the sound
I'll miss the animals
I'm gonna miss you all
I need another place
Will there be peace?
I need another world
This one's nearly gone
I'm gonna miss the birds
Singing all their songs
I'm gonna miss the wind
Been kissing me so long, oh
Another world
Another world
Another world
Another worldEmbed
