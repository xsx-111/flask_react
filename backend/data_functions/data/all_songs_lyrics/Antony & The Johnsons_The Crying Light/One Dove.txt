One Dove LyricsOne dove
You're the one I've been waiting for
Through the dark fall
The nightmares, the lonely nights
I was born
A curling fox in a hole
Hiding from danger
Scared to be alone
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
One dove
I'm the one you've been waiting for
From your skin I am born again
I wasn't born yesterday
You were old and hurt
I was longing to be free
I see things you were too tired
You were too scared to see
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy
Eyes open, shut your eyes
Eyes open, shut your eyes
Eyes open up1Embed
