My Lord My Love LyricsThe cream pooled cry, gone astray
In the park or on the lawn
My lord, my love
Take care of those you're dreaming of
My sister put it right
My mind, lock me down at night
My lord, my love
Take care of the ones you say you love
When we were children in the hay
We felt your eyes were upon us
My lord, my love
Help me to remember
My sister put it right
My mind lock me down at night
My lord, my love
Take care of the ones you say you love
My fear is to put it right
My mind don't lock me down at night
My lord, my love
Take care of the ones you say you love1Embed
