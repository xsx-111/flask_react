Her Eyes Are Underneath the Ground LyricsHer eyes are underneath the ground
I have heard the crying sound
No one can stop you now
No one can stop you now
Her eyes are basking in the sun
No one knows why she did the things she's done
Ocean, swallow me now
Ocean, swallow me now
In the garden with my mother
I stole a flower
With my mother, in her power
I stole a flower
I saw six eyes glistening in my womb
I felt you calling to me in the gloom
Rest assured your love is pure
Rest assured your love is pure
In the garden with my mother
I stole a flower
With my mother, in her power
I chose a flower1Embed
