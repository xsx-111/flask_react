Kiss My Name LyricsKiss my name
Mama in the afterglow
When the grass is green with grow
And my tears have turned to snow
Well, I'm only a child
Born upon a grave
Dancing through the stations
Calling out my name
Kiss my name
Kiss my name
Kiss my name
Kiss my name
Oh Mama, Kiss my name
I am trying to be sane
I'm trying to kiss my friends
And when broken, make amends
Kiss my name, the curtains white
The turtle doves embroider light
As I lie, murdered in ground
The rain compacting sodden sound
Of songs I sang the years before
Kiss my name
When it was my time to rain
Upon the coal that I became
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Won't you kiss my name
Won't you kiss my name
Won't you kiss my name
Kiss my name
Kiss my name
Kiss my name
Kiss my name
Oh now, kiss my nameEmbed
