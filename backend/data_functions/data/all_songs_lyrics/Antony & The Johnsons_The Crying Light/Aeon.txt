Aeon LyricsOh Aeon, my baby boy
Oh Aeon will take care of me
All the stars, your eyes
Raining just for me
Oh Aeon will set me free
Ooh Aeon, my baby boy
Ooh Aeon will repair me
Ooh his heart enjoyed
Restores eyes alloy
Carry me through the olden void
Ooh Aeon, his arms are warm
Ooh Aeon was never born
Aeon's eyes forlorn
He contains the storm
He's the pasture of my dawn
Ooh Aeon, my baby boy
Ooh Aeon will take care of me
Hold my father
For it is myself
Without him I wouldn't exist
Without him I wouldn't exist
Oh Aeon, my baby boy
Ooh Aeon will take care of me
Hold that man
In your tender clutch
Hold that man I love so much
Hold that man I love so much
Ooh Aeon, my baby boy
Ooh Aeon will take care of me
Hold my father
In your tender clutch
Hold that man I love so much
Oh
Ooh Aeon, ooh Aeon
Let's do something differently
Let's take our power back, power back
It doesn't have to be this way
It doesn't have to be this way
Hold on, we don't know nothing
Nothing, daddy, but this world
Oh no, no, no, no
Oh Aeon, my baby boy
Oh Aeon will take care of meEmbed
