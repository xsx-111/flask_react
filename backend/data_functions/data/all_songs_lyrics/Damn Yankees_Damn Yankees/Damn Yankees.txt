Damn Yankees Lyrics
Hey brother
Ready for another
Dose of my Yankee Pride?
In the jungle
You just might stumble onto something that you never tried
Got that right
There was trouble in the east
Worry in the west
'Til the wall came tumblin' down
Shift in the sand
Rockets to the madman
Haven't heard a sound

You don't have to worry
Help is on the way
We don't need no "Thank you, ma'am"
We know what they're gonna say

They say, "Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woah, oh, oh, damn Yankee"
(How we doin'?)

Now I say what I want
And I do what I want
And I go where I wanna go
Ain't no strong man
Safe from the hang man
Baby, now, don't ya know?
If you need assistance
I'll be on the way
Run into a little resistance
You know what they're gonna say

They say, "Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woah, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Hey, hey, damn Yankee"

They landed at Plymouth Rock
The kids was ready to roll
Greasy dictator down south of us, lost all control
He didn't have time to see me
He didn't have time to thank me
Suck on the barrel of my hot shotgun
Smile when you say "Damn Yankee"

Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woah, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woah, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Damn Yankee
Damn YankeeEmbed
