Runaway Lyrics(Everyone needs a place to run away, run away)
Summer night, moonlit sky
Tearing pages from a magazine, she cries
"I don't wanna be the lonely one tonight."
She said, "I came to this place, full of dreams
Young and innocent and only 16
Now I wonder if it's too late to turn back
So she runs, and she hides, and she dries the tears from
Her eyes
And the night goes on, and on, and on
She's in the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
It's such a long way home
When it hurts so bad you gotta run, run, run away
Perfect day, feels like Spring
Can see forever but you can't see anything
Now I wonder why they call it "paradise"
It's a crime, it's a shame
And they won't remember your name
And your life goes on, and on, and on
It's like the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
But she won't go home
So she's gotta run, run, run away
She came from a small town
So tired of getting pushed around
In the dark of the night, no one around
She'll run from this shabby town, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a laugh, it's a game
Don't you let it drive you insane
Cause your life goes on, and on, and on....
It's like the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
But she won't go home
When it hurts so bad you gotta run, run, run away
She's in the twilight zone (twilight zone)
Yeah, you gotta run, run, run away
It's such a long way home
When it hurts so bad you gotta run, run, run awayEmbed
