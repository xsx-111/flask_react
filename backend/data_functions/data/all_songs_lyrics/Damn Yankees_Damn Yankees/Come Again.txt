Come Again Lyrics
I was a loner cruisin' with the wind
I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
I had to leave you like I always did
You knew damn well I'd come again

Now I'm falling where I've never been
My resistance is wearing thin
Somewhere in the distance
Like a long lost friend
Whoa oh oh oh, yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again

Yeah
Been so long since I've seen you girl
Swear I've been around the world
Every room is an empty space
In the darkness, I see your face
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
When I finally get my hands on you
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Lay you down, strip you bare
Make love to you 'til the morning comes around

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again
Come again
I said Lord
Yeah! Whoo!

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--
Lord, here I come again

Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Yeah! Whoo!
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa Whoa

I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah--
Lord, here I come againEmbed
