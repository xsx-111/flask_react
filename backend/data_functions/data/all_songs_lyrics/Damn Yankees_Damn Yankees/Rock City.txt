Rock City LyricsHere comes the night time
And it's knockin' at my door
Lady luck, she's come around
And she wants a little more
Down on the boulevard
They're screamin' like a child
"If I can't play that mean guitar
It's gonna drive me wild, wild"
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.A
The sidewalk's moving
The palm trees sway
The switchblade girls line 'em up in L.A
Everybody came here from somewhere to play
They wear their guitars low just like Jimmy Page
Well, I've been to London
I've been to France
I've been to Mississippi
Where they taught me to dance
Lord, have mercy, I ain't never seen
Nobody going down like this beauty queen
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.A
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.A
(I'm on fire)
(I'm on fire)
I'm on fire
(I'm on fire)
Just can't get enough (I'm on fire)
You can't stop me now (I'm on fire)
You can't hold me down (I'm on fire)
I said come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Can't stop rockin'
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.A
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, here I come
Rock City, U.S.AEmbed
