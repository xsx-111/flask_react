Bonestripper LyricsOoooh ya got busted
On a midnight ride
And now ya want justice
Well, just step inside
He's gonna roll ya
Like a loaded gun
You pulled the trigger
I heard the shot
You better get your mother
Ready or not
Goin' down (Goin' down)
Bonestripper
Ya don't know what ya got
Until you turn to Mister
(Goin down)
Mr. Bonestripper
Do ya feel lucky
Are you ready to pay
Do ya feel guilty
'Cause it's judgment day
He's got a notion
You'll never see the sun come up again
You make a motion
But he make the law
You're guilty, son
So down you go
Goin' down (Goin' down)
Bonestripper
You don't know what you got
Until you turn to Mister
(Goin down)
Mr. Bonestripper
Time to take your medicine son
He's got a notion
You'll never see the sun come up again
You'll make a motion
But he makes the law
You're guilty, son
So down you go
Bet you wish you was never born
C'mon
Goin' down (Goin' down)
Bonestripper
You don't know what you got
Until you turn to Mister
(Goin' down)
Mister Bonestripper
Goin' down (Goin' down)
Bonestripper
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Until you've seen her Mister
Going down down down down
Mister Bonestripper
I'm goin' down
Yes, I'm goin' down down
Down down down down down down down
Yeah down downEmbed
