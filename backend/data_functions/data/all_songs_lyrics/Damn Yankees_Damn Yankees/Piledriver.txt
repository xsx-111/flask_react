Piledriver Lyrics
Nice lick
I have a feeling this is gonna be a rhythm and blues song
Nice, real nice, tasty
Wait a minute

Well, if you want it, baby
Slide on up and take me home
And go ahead and drive me crazy
You can't leave well enough alone, ow

'Cause I'm a piledriver
Piledrivin' man
I'm a piledriver
Piledrivin' man

So you say you love me
Well, shake me up and cut me loose
Then chase me down like you've got rabies
And slip your neck inside my noose

I'm a piledriver
Piledrivin' man
I'm a piledriver
Piledrivin' man
Another nasty situation (Come on, baby)
I heard that story line before (Oh, hey)
We're gonna rock this fuckin' nation (Oh, ow, yeah)

There I was cruisin' backstage in Des Moines, Iowa
And a little girl comes up next to me and says
"Mr. Nugent, do you think my skirt is short enough?"
I said, "Baby, you want to be alive, you've got to piledrive"

That was fun
That was good, what's next?
Did anybody get the license plate number on that truck?
Oh, Jesus Christ, here we go again
Fuck

Piledriver
Piledrivin' man
I'm a piledriver
Piledrivin' man
Yes, I am
Piledriver
Piledrivin' man
Piledriver
Yes, I am a
Piledrivin' man
Whoa, niceEmbed
