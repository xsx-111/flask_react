Tell Me How You Want It Lyrics
Hey, yeah

Look out, I'm a man with a mission
Tell you what I wanna do
We've gotta move, we don't need no permission
Just need me and you
And you oughta know

If there's a way, I will come crashing through your door, mhm
I'll take you higher than you've ever been before
So come on, won't you

Tell me how you want it
Tell me what you want me to do
Someday I'm gonna be a rich man
Baby, you got nothing to lose

Now I know you've got a heart like a lion
How much can you take?
You and me gotta run like the river
This dam's about to break
Rolling like thunder from above, I'll take you there, hey, yeah
It's now or never
Gotta get up while we can, you gotta

Tell me how you want it (Ooh, how you want it)
Tell me what you want me to do
Someday I'm gonna be a rich man
Baby, you got nothing to lose
Whoa-oh-oh, tell me how you want it (How you want it)
Tell me what you want me to do (Ooh)
Someday I'm gonna win you over
You got nothing to lose

Going nowhere ain't no pleasure
Just pain when you're living a lie
Don't think it over, don't talk it over
Just jump in my car, jump in my car and we'll
Run, run, run like there's no tomorrow (Whoa-oh-oh)
Run, run, run, run
Ooh, oh, yeah

Rolling like thunder from above, I'll take you there, yeah, yeah
I'll take you higher than you've ever been before
Now come on, yeah, you gotta
Tell me how you want it (Won't you tell me?)
Tell me what you want me to do
Someday I'm gonna be a rich man
Baby, you got nothing to lose
Oh-oh-oh, tell me how you want it (Tell me how you want it)
Tell me what you want me to do
Someday I'm gonna win you over
You got nothing to lose, oh yeah

Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want itEmbed
