Mean to Me Lyrics
She came all the way from America
She had a blind date with destiny
And the sound of Te Awamutu
Had a truly sacred ring
Now her parents
Are divorced
And her friend's committing suicide

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
You said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
Well, please don't be mean to me

So I talked to you for an hour
In the bar of a small town hotel
And you asked me what I was thinking
I was thinking of a padded cell
With a black and white T.V
To stop us from getting lonely

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
You said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me
You know I could not escape
A plea from the heart
Mysterious sympathy
I couldn't wait for a chance
To walk out the door
You know what it means to me

I...
I...

I saw you lying in the arms of a poet
I...
I heard him tell you
T-tantalising
Lies
What'd 'ya know
What'd 'ya know

I could not escape
You're down on the floor
You know what it means to me
I couldn't wait for a chance
Walk out the door
Mean
(Mean)
I could not escape
Down on my knees
You know what it means
What it means
Ah oh no-o-o-oh

What it means
What it means
In the arms of the poet
You know what it meansEmbed
