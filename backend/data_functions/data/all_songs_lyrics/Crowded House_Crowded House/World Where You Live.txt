World Where You Live Lyrics
Here's someone now who's got the muscle
His steady hand could move a mountain
Expert in bed, but come on now
There must be something missing
That golden one leads a double life
You'll find out

Tell me, I don't know where you go
Do you climb into space?
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-hoo

So here we lie against each other
And these four walls can never hold us
We're looking for wide open spaces
High above the kitchen
And we're strangers here
On our way to some other place

But I don't know where you go
Do you climb into space?
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-ho
To the world where you live
Friends come 'round
You might remember and be sad
Behind their eyes is unfamiliar

Do you climb into space?
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-oh
To the world where you live, yeah, yeah
To the world where you live, hey, hey
To the world where you live
To the world where you live
To the world where you liveEmbed
