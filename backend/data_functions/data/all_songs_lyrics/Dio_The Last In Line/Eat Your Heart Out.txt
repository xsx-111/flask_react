Eat Your Heart Out LyricsWell, it's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat your heart out
Eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
Eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
Eat your heart out
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he diesEmbed
