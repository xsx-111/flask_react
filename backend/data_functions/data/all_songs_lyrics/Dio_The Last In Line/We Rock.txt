We Rock Lyrics
You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind (Oh-oh) can penetrate your mind

But sail on, sing your song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock
We rock

We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, 'Oh we can find the way'

But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock
We rock, we rock
We rock, we rock
We rock, we rock
We rock

(We rock)

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind

Sail on, sing your song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock
We rock, we rock
We rock, we rock
We rock, we rock

Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
Sail on, sing your song, carry on
'Cause we rock, we rock
See how we rock
We rock, that's rock
We rock, we rock
We rockEmbed
