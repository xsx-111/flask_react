I Speed at Night LyricsDark touches send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure, I hate the light
I speed at night, at night, alright
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've go some stairs to Heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world, I hate the light
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night, alright
Dark touches send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
You've got some stairs to Heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world, I hate the light
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night, yeah
I speed at night, night, night, night, night
I speed at night, night, night, night, night
No shadows, no faces
Just whispers in dark places
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night, alrightEmbed
