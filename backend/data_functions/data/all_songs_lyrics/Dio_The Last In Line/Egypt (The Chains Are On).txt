Egypt (The Chains Are On) LyricsIn the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
My, my, my
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free but still
Your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
Oh my, the chains were on
In the land of the lost horizon
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still, the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still, her chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Yeah, the chains were on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Seen them walking on the water
The chains were on
Seen them flying through the sky
My, the chains were on
They were frightening in the darkness
Yes, the chains were on
They had rainbows in their eyes
The chains were on5Embed
