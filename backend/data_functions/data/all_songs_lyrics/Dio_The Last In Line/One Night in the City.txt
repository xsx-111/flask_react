One Night in the City LyricsJohnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night in the city
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night in the city
One night
One night feeling pretty
One night in the city
One night
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One night, one night
One night in the city
One night
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night
One night in the city
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city
One night in the city
One night in the cityEmbed
