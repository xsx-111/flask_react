Mystery LyricsCan you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Always a mystery
Just like you and me
It's always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Always a mystery
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to seeEmbed
