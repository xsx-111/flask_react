The Last in Line Lyrics
We're a ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness that it needs, yeah…
We're a laugh without a tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming… home!

We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down

We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
And quickly moves away

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line, oh!
Two eyes from the east
It's the Angel or the Beast
And the answer lies between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase is worth the pain

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line
Yeah, we're the last in line, oh


Yeah!
We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
You know we're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way to go is down
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, oh
We're the last in line
See all we shine

We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're a laugh without a tear
We're the far without the near

We're the last in line
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
See how we shine
We're the last in lineEmbed
