Making Up and Breaking Up (And Making Up and Breaking Up Over Again) Lyrics
We can't keep
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again

Our love like Humpty Dumpty up on the wall
And just like Humpty Dumpty it had a great fall
But all this huggin' and all this kissin'
Can't put back together the love we're missin'

We can't keep
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again

I know  I've been your fool
But in this case our love just ain't cool
Cause I've been strong and I've been trying
And I ain't the only one that ends up crying
 X 2
We can't keep
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over againEmbed
