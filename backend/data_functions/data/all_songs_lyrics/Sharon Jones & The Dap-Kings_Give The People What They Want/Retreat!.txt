Retreat! Lyrics
I see you coming from a mile away
And you're looking real cocky
You think you can keep the sea at bay
But it's about to get mmm choppy
Play with me and you'll play with fire
I can make you pay
I'll burn you up if it's my desire
Do you hear what I say?

Boy you don't know what I'm all about
I'll chew you up and then I'll spit you out
So if you know what's good for you

Retreat
Yeah ah ah
Retreat yeah
Step back boy cause you can't fix "crazy"
Retreat, Retreat, yeah
Raise your wife at night cause I'm comin' in blazin'
Retreat, cause it's my way baby
And I don't care none about the rest of you
Retreat
That's what I say baby
And I don't care if it makes sense to you
Taking you apart is my kind of fun
I count to three and you better run
One, two, three
Here I come
Retreat
Retreat, yeah
Retreat
Hell hath no furry like a woman scorned
Retreat
Retreat retreat
I will make you wish you was never ever born
Retreat
Retreat, retreat yeah
What a fool you'd be to take me on
Retreat
Retreat yeah come one
Come on
Retreat, yeah
Retreat
Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
Retreat
Retreat retreat
I will make you wish that you was never ever born
Retreat
Retreat, retreat yeah
What a fool you'd be to take, to take me on
Retreat
Retreat yeah come one
Come on uh
Come on come on yeah
Retreat
You know you can't fix things
Come on yeah
Step back I'm coming in blazing ooh
Retreat...Embed
