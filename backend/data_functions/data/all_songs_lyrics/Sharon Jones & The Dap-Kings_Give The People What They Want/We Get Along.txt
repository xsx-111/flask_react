We Get Along Lyrics
There's a child crying all by himself
His parents left him by the time he was twelve
He feels all alone
He don't want to live
He'll get along I'm not often wrong

(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife
(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife

There's somthin' a brewin' up in the sky
We're stuck inside with the candle light
But the sun is comin' with all of its might
I know, I know it'll be alright

(Through darkness and pain)
(Through sorrow and pain)
We prove again and again and again
(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife
(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife

As these wars keep rolling on
All of our young ones are fighting strong
Who's to know if it's right or wrong?
I just know we got to get along

We got to (get up)
And come together
(Get up)
And come together
Don't you know we got to (get up)
And come together
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come together
Don't you know we got to
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come together
Don't you know we got to (get up)
And come together
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come together
Don't you know we got to
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come togetherEmbed
