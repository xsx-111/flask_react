Now I See Lyrics
There was a time, when we were friends
Was it all in my mind, or was it just pretend?
It was  and great, when he and I met
I remember the way, you started to get

He had my heart
When we were apart
You tried to take my man away

Now I see what you wanna be
You want to take it all away from me
Once a friend now an enemy

You used to steal my toys
When you was just a child
I should have known then, girl
That was just your style

I have his heart
Now we're apart
I hope you know to stay away
Ow!
