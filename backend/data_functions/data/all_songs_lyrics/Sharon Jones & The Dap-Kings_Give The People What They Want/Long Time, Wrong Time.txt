Long Time, Wrong Time Lyrics
Long time since I've seen your face
Been running round trying to make my way
Long time since we said goodbye
I'm coming home baby don't you cry

What am I going to find?
Crazy thoughts running through my mind

It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)
It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)

When I left you said you missed me so
Looked in my eyes said, "Baby, please don't go."
I took for granted that your love was strong
Now I'm wondering if you did me wrong

But what am I going to find?
Crazy thoughts running through my mind
It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)
It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)

Now what am I going to find?
Crazy thoughts running through my mind

It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)
It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)Embed
