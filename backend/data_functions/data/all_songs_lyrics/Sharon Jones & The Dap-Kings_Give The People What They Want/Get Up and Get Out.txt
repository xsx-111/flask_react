Get Up and Get Out Lyrics
I been laying night after night
You leave me before I see the morning light
I always say you're welcome no more
But when you knock I open up my door

I say
Get up, get up, get up
And get out
I say
Get up, get up, get up
And get out

No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears
No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears

All my friends they ask me about you
I swear up and down that we are through
Oh, if only what I say was true
Why can't you find someone new?
No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears
No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears

Get up, get out...Embed
