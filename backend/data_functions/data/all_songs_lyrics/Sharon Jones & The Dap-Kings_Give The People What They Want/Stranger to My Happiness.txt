Stranger to My Happiness Lyrics
So many times there was a man, he met a girl, took her hand
Told her, "Never will I leave you my love" ( no no no no)
But just as soon as he gone again she's flapping in the wind wondering what she must have been thinking of ( hey hey hey hey)
She's a darling (darling)
I've been in and out so many doors
And I've always tried to keep my head
With all the men I've known before
I've seen plenty places
That I'll never see again
I've seen a hundred thousand faces
And only called a few my friend

But it's a mystery
Just how you came right in
And stole my heart away
And left me there again

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
To my happiness
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)

Now if you think that's a thing that only evil men can bring
Let me skin this cat another way (hey hey hey hey)
There was a man who had a plan
To settle down with Mary Ann
But she left him on his wedding day
He said "Darling (darling)
I've been in and out so many doors
And I've always tried to keep my head
With all the girls I've known before
I've seen plenty places
That I'll never see again
I've seen a hundred thousand faces
And only called a few my friend
But it's a mystery
Just how you came right in
And stole my heart away
And left me there again
I'm feeling

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I feel like a stranger to my happiness
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
Feel like a stranger

I'm feelin' (feelin')
I'm feelin' (feelin')
I'm feelin' (feelin'!)

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I feel like
A stranger
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I feel like
A stranger to my happiness
To my happiness
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I've seen pretty faces
I've been to a lot of places
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I'm feelin'
Yeah I'm feelin'
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)Embed
