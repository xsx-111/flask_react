Slow Down, Love Lyrics
Slow down love
I can't pick up on your
Put it down
Your words fall all around me
Seen 'em laying here on the ground
Don't be cross with me baby
If I leave them there for the birds
Slow down love and come closer
Your kiss can tell me more than words

Not much time remaining
Let's not spend it explaining
One more

Slow down love
I've been waiting so long to see you
All alone
There ain't nothing left to say now
You can't save tomorrow on the phone
Our time is fleeting yes I know
But baby that's no cause to rush
Slow down love
And come closer
The time has come for you to hush
Not much time remaining
Let's not spend it explaining
Slow down loveEmbed
