Pain Killer Lyrics
Most when it's almost like a bane
You arrive like a siren refrain
Like death, she takes everything
And dazes me like patent medicine
Into this strange divine
The road was serpentine
A network of silken threads
Spider's trapping web
Makes me rue the day

You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright

Praying at the altar of your legs and feet
Your saliva is a drug so bittersweet
I'll arrogate what's there to take
In an evanescent embrace
Anesthetic liaison
Honey honey youâ€™re my medication
Like love, you take everything
And this static yearn
Makes me rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright

Strange divine
Strange divine
Strange divine

I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright
I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright
You became my pain killer
You became my pain killer1Embed
