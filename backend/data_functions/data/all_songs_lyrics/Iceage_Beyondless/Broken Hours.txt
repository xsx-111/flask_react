Broken Hours Lyrics
At times it's a struggle to forget
At others, it spills right out of my head
These antics so grotesque and alive
Ling an image, a mid-fall swan dive

It lingers on, by in waves
Broken hours alleviate
Dying figures, they settle in
Broken hours
It lingers on

By the harrow, we were taught to beset
We shoved through the ground
Like marbles jumping in roulette
Pick a number, we haven't much time
Choose your losers, go stand them in line

It lingers on, by in waves
Broken hours accelerate
Dying figures, they settle in
Broken hours
It lingers onEmbed
