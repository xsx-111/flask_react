Hurrah LyricsHeading for the last roundup
Hardware at hand
I was told to protect and serve
But I'm here to supply a demand
Like roaring free jazz fireworks
Follow its beat
Dancing to the sound of the enemy's guns
Boogie as we drop one by one
An abstract notion
That I'm flagless at last
I'm not fighting for a country
I'm fighting to outlast
I found there to be an instinct
Our inherent tissue
Jump off the diving board and cannonball
Into the bottom of the genetic pool
'Cause we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah
No, we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah
A carpet bomb a lethal dose
Shotgun blow that bastard home
'Cause we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah
Some are awarded shell shock
Or the loss of a limb or two
You'll just have to take heart
If it hasn't already been taken from you
Patrimonial heritage
The urge is there from the start
There is always something there beneath
Shedding the sheep cloth and baring its teeth
All the boys are at action
Across the two hemispheres
Oh yes, we're living it large
Supplied with big-ticket gear
Pardon me, good sir
I consider myself a peaceful man
But I got orders to make you flee your home
Split your family and pillage your town
'Cause we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah
No, we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah
A carpet bomb a lethal dose
Shotgun blow that bastard home
'Cause we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah
Because we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah
No, we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
Hurrah-rah-rah
A carpet bomb a lethal dose
Shotgun blow the bastards home
'Cause we can't stop killing
And we'll never stop killing
And we shouldn't stop killing
