Thieves Like Us LyricsHelp I think I blindfolded the chauffeur
The coordinates are off track
Makes one want to file a restraining order
On humanity or myself
Thieves like us
Postulate we must
In echo chambers of fermented ethanol
Listen to reason as I voice my speculations
With the brains of a blowup doll
Hush as I spill my wayward theories
I'll stack them Pre-Raphaelite scaffolds
Drag the boys back up who fell across the railing
If we must, we'll have us pinned like butterflies
Framed in glass displays
As we're three sheets to the wind
We got ourselves a hostage situation
With well developed Stockholm syndrome
There'll be taken no negotiations
Our complexions are monochrome
Thieves like us
Postulate we must
Here, there's no regard for tact
Don't stop drilling
Perforate the willing
Leave them thoroughly ransacked
Hush as I spill my wayward theory
I'll stack it on Pre-Raphaelite scaffolds
Drag the boys back up who fell across the railing
If we must, we'll have us pinned like butterflies
Framed in glass displays
As we're three sheets to the wind
Drag the boys back up who fell across the railing
If we must, we'll have us pinned like butterflies
Framed in glass displays
As we're three sheets to the windEmbed
