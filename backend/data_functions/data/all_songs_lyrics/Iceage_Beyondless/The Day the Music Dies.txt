The Day the Music Dies Lyrics
It takes character to make a decision
It takes more to stand firm and follow through
But some stand points are more than I can live up to
Performed an exorcism on myself
Cited prayers and rites of deliverance
Yet here I am, somehow still possessed

The future's never starting
The present never ends
I left us both bombarded
But I'm not here to make amends

Fondling the thighs of forfeit
I guess I can't brush aside
I'm waiting for the day the music dies

Oh the places one looks for makeshift
I tried to ruin myself for you
Hoping that you'd rather resent than miss
How can one kill an impulsion
When it's still kicking and breathing
Forces are a cut above the will of the self
The future's never starting
The present never ends
I left us both bombarded
But I'm not here to make amends

Fondling the thighs of forfeit
I guess I can't brush aside
I'm waiting for the day the music dies

Jumping from one bosom to the next
Hitting every branch in the fall
Beaten to a pulp by every caress
In the tempest, unaffected by it all
And Iâ€™m hoping that the end is nigh
I'm waiting for the day the music
Waiting for the day the music diesEmbed
