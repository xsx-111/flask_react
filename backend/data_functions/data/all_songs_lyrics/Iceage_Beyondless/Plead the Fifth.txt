Plead the Fifth LyricsFrom the first heartbeat in the womb
Between the fourth and fifth rib, was an eclipse
It veiled this ticker like the sun behind the moon
And masked the rest of it, bit by bit
A painted face seems more striking at far
Draws attention to its prominent parts
A performance of this caliber can outsmart
Even its component parts
Unravel and come undone
Plead the fifth on all accounts
We keep on running ‘till we hit the ground
And no head is left uncrowned
La la
La la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la la
And there are those who will name you a fraud
A great pretender, corseted in gilded halls
Line ‘em up in the toilet stalls
Open mouthed, backs against the walls
STDs on the tip of my tongue
Perfumed like a common whore bargaining for scant amounts Complacent with the faults in our blazing stars
We're heading out tonight
Unravel and come undone
Plead the fifth on all accounts
We keep on running ‘till we hit the ground
And no head is left uncrowned
La la
La la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la laEmbed
