Take It All LyricsWhile there was an air of a paradigm shift
And men were dying for the death of the west
Oh yeah
And the last thing I ever wanted to see was these brand new sparkles
Coming from your ever loving God damned eyes
Yeah
If you want it
You can have it
If you want to reap me
Take it all away
And everyone's a criminal
Everyone's a criminal, every single last one of you is a criminal
â€˜Cause the world is a crime
Yeah
You stood there as some small and frail deity in front of me
Shining like the fall sun, making lucent patterns in our room through the windows
Yeah
If should want it
Go ahead and take it
If you wanna reap me
Take it all away
Take it all away from me
Take it all away from me
Not an asset I possess measures up in merit next to this
Take it all away from me
From me
From me
From meEmbed
