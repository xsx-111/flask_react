Under the Sun LyricsFrom the heights of the low
I shall wallow in the mire
As above, so below
These transgressions take me higher
Until I'm laid to rest
I'll be reaching to undress
This here harness I possess
The derisions of the flesh
Anything grown under the sun
Or subterranean slums
If it brings me closer to God
I'll go there at any cost
The seed of his call
Causes moderation to appall me
Brings me closer to God
I'll purchase at any cost
I will breed like a rat
Spread them all over the map
The day they all come crawling back
A whole procession nearly cracked
One will ask where were you then
Through my struggle as I went
Come sit down boy, I'll explain
I gave you the mark of Cain
Anything grown under the sun
Or subterranean slums
If it brings me closer to God
I'll go there at any cost
The seed of his call
Causes moderation to appall me
Brings me closer to God
I'll purchase at any cost
Lift it up, lift it up, lift it up to where
It sets it deems on the horizons with its tender loving care
Yeah
Move it up, move it up, move it up into
Altitudes that strike up taller than the tallest buildings grew
Now push it up, push it up, push it up
Push it in every compartment that has still space left to fill
Now push it up, push it up, push it up
Lord, do you need a savior
Have you lost the steering wheel againEmbed
