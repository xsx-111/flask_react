Blood Pressure Lyrics
Why can't you
Be more like your older brother?
Why can't you?
Ooh, blood pressure
Why can't you
Do a little more for Jesus?
Why can't you?
Blood pressure

Blood pressure
Do better
Keep rising
Blood pressure

You're on the road
On a road that's bound for nowhere
Why don't you do what you're told?
Blood pressure
Don't worry I
Will help you out on one condition
Be more, do more
Check your blood pressure
Blood pressure
Do better
Keep rising
Blood pressureEmbed
