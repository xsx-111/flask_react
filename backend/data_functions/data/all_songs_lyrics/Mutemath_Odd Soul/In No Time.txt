In No Time Lyrics
Where’s your heart gone
And where’s your soul?
Where did all of your faith go?
And where's that old spark, a failure stole?
Well, I bet we'll find it in no time at all

We'll find it in no time
We'll find it in no time
We'll find it in no time
We'll find it in no time at all

Where's your nerve gone
And where's your hope?
And where's that sunrise you been waiting for?
And where's that one day you got it all?
Well, I bet we’ll find it in no time at all

We'll find it in no time
We'll find it in no time
We'll find it in no time
We'll find it in no time at all
When the wars start falling on the world you had
Just hold tight, in no time we can get it back
When the wars start falling on the world you had
Just hold tight, in no time we can get it back

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We can get it back
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We can get it backEmbed
