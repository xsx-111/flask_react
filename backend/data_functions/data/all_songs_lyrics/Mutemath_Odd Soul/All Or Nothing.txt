All Or Nothing Lyrics
Aligning stars that you wait for
Always know if you're holding back
Don't slow yourself down anymore

We watch the days fly
While all the years try
Telling us something
Don't waste a whole life
On just a half try
It's all or nothing

Cold sparks are seconds from burn out
Everyone has an hour glass
To turn back upside down

We watch the days fly
While all the years try
Telling us something
Don't waste a whole life
On just a half try
It's all or nothing
We watch the days fly
While all the years try
Telling us something
Don't waste a whole life
On just a half try
It's all or nothingEmbed
