Walking Paranoia Lyrics
I am a nervous wreck
Jesus is coming back
Gonna catch me at the porno rack
I'm about to have a heart attack

Am I on hell's highway
'Cause I'm walking paranoia
Oh, I'm walking paranoia

Preachers are on the prowl
And they got me on the TV dial
Say your prayers or burn and rot
Gotta move fast when you're on the spot

Am I on hell's highway
'Cause I'm walking paranoia
Oh, I'm walking paranoia
If I'm on hells highway
Then I'm going there the right way
'Cause I'm walking paranoia
I'm walking paranoia
Better get right or get left
Better get right or get left
Don't you forgetEmbed
