Amendment Lyrics
Find me a better place
Find me a home in this world that I can afford
(Find me) find me a better space
(Oh, find me) find me a corner of some hopeful corridor

(Show me) show me a better way
(Show me) show me a higher intention for breathing in
(Aahh) show me a better fate
(Show) show me a cross with a cause worth believing in
