Cavalries Lyrics
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Troubled waters, showboat martyr's fall
Overbooked cavalries avoiding everyone's calls

Stand on your own, your own
Every chance you take you own
You own, you own
You own, you own

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Haven't you suffered enough
On the straight and narrow
Stand on your own

Stand on your own, your own
Every chance you take you own
You own, you own
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, laEmbed
