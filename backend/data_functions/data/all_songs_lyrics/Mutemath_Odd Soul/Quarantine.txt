Quarantine Lyrics
I’m undecided if kidding or not
Under the smiling, you never know
Fall in a line if you’re standing around
Let the harvester carve your soul
Blind eyes still rely on a sign anywhere they go
Let it heal someone, heal someone
Who really needs to understand what they know
If they know it well
Say all you can to convince yourself
If it’s real than it’s hard to tell
Fly high to paralyze any karma you left below
Let it heal someone, heal someone
In my mind, I can hear the river
Wondering why, the sound is getting thinner
It’s no use to pretend you’re not
We’re all fish out of water
Believe it
Love is keeping everyone liable
Slow down the spiral now
It’s no use to pretend you’re not
We’re all fish out of water

Didn’t you know
Should we by now
Can’t ever let the children out
Can’t ever let the children out of your sight
There you heart rate goes again
No one knows what’s happening
Can’t ever let the children out
Can’t ever let the children out of your sightEmbed
