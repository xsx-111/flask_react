Tell Your Heart Heads Up Lyrics
When I was young and unafraid, it was all a game
I was wrong to tell you that
And when I thought all was fair in love and war
I was wrong to tell you that
But it always sounds so good in my head, you know

I don't have to tell you that
Better watch yourself, you know me well
I'm on a trail and here I come

Tell your heart heads up 

Well, I don't have that thing inside
That tells me when I've said enough
I was going to tell you that
And I don't have a perfect line
For every fight to cheer us up
Or I was wrong to tell you that?
And I know no one keeps you on guard more than I do


Watch out
Tell your heart heads up
And I don't get it
I don't know
What do you want?
Honey, you better


You better, better tell your heart heads up
Better, better, heart heads up
Tell your heart heads up

Heart heads upEmbed
