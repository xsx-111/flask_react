Equals Lyrics
Rise under pressure
We get tired of learning lessons
On the go is how we survive
We don't know when it's goodbye

But as long as we have
Faith in each other

Nothing's going to stop what we started
Nothing's going to break what we've bonded
We can make the world spin however we want
It's all on us, ah

The goal is to stay above ground
Control the nervous breakdown
Watch your step, the floor will crumble
We don't know how it all will end up

But as long as we have
Faith in each other
Nothing's going to stop what we started
Nothing's going to break what we've bonded
We can make the world spin however we want
It's all on us

If we've got the same heart that we use to trust
The same spark in our eyes
If we've got the same love that used to carry us
Then we can make it out alive

Nothing's going to stop what we started
Nothing's going to break what we've bonded
We can make the world spin however we want
It's all on usEmbed
