Allies Lyrics
Allies, fire in the sky
Splinters in the eye, don't know any better
Keep your arsenal at bay
Live another day, pull yourself together
Every war you wanna win
There's nothing to defend, nothing to surrender
I don't want to fight alone
No one does

Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy
Somehow, this war is out of control
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes

Nice try, cross enemy lines
Look out for the mines, buried in the mirror
Fall out, target on the move
Coming into view, coming in clearer
By now, no one else around
Narrowing it down, guess I got to figure
One war is all I can afford
No more
Hey, look high, and we look low
We never find our enemy
We never find our enemy
Somehow, this war is out of control
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes

Here we go
Wasting lives one way or another
Here we go
Vacant eyes rearranging their color

Somehow, this war is out of control
We never find our enemy
We're gunning down whatever breathes

Here we go
Wasting lives one way or another
Here we go
Vacant eyes rearranging their color

Wasting lives one way or anotherEmbed
