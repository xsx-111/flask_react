One More Lyrics
Serving the time
I walk in shackles across your mind
Dead in the water
I know I've got to convince you why

You should give me one more reason
Give me one more try
Give me one more feeling
Give me one more high, oh yeah

Flower made fool
I keep parading while dressed in rain
Oh, what else can I do
Might as well wait here until you break

Just gimme one more reason
Give me one more try
Give me one more feeling
Give me one more high
Just gimme one more reason
Give me one more try
Give me one more feeling
Give me one more high
I've been changed
I swear I've been changed
Anything for you
Why not for old times just smile for me
Am I getting through
Or is this just how it's got to be

Just gimme one more reason
Give me one more try
Give me one more feeling
Give me one more high, high
One more high, highEmbed
