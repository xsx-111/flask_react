Outlaw LyricsTerrorize, prophesize
Small town any place
Prodigal son, hey loyal to none
He had it all to say
Renegade from another world
Child, he was the wild one
Outlaw
From the badlands baby, badlands baby
Outlaw
Tomorrow will never come
Jimi was a boogie man
Took a shotgun in his hand
Turned on dude candy-man
He walked into the wrong town
Deputy dog man wait inside
Jimi thought he'd better hide
Suddenly changed his mind
Shot 'em all on sight, yeah
Outlaw
From the badlands baby, badlands baby
Outlaw
Dizzy in the head and feelin' bad
Bandito
Fallen angel, out of time
Outlaw
Tomorrow will never come
Renegade from another world
Child, he was the wild one
Outlaw
From the badlands baby, badlands baby
Outlaw
Dizzy in the head and feelin' bad
Bandito
Fallen angel, out of time
Outlaw
Tomorrow will never comeEmbed
