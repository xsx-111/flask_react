Peace Dog LyricsOh, peace is a dirty word
She used to be a painted bird, yeah
And war, she's a whore
Don't you know we love her more and more?
Peace is a dirty word
She used to be a painted bird, yeah
War, she's a whore
Don't you know we love her more and more?

Come droppin' your lovin' on me, child
