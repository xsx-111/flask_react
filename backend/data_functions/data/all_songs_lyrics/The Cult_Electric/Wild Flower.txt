Wild Flower LyricsHey you
You're a wild honey child
I'm out of control
Every time you are near me
I'm a wolf child, baby
And I'm howlin' for you
My heart beats faster
Hey hey, and it's overpowered, ow
I'm a wolf child, girl
Howlin' for you
Wild flower
Star of my dreams
The most beautiful thing, yeah
Yeah you
Sweet sensation of a nation
Oh, my soul
You're a perfect creation
You're an angel, baby
And I'm cryin' for you
My heart beats faster
Hey hey, and I'm overpowered
I'm a wolf child, girl
Howlin' for you
Wild flower
Star of my dreams
The most beautiful thing
Wild flower
I love you every hour
Wild flower
Burning down the night
Set the world alight, yeah
Wild flower
I'm a wolf child, girl
Howlin' for you
Wild flower
You're the star of my dreams
Most beautiful thing
Wild flower
I love you every hour
Wild flower
I love you every hour
Crazy 'bout you, yeah
