Aphrodisiac Jacket LyricsOw, ow, ow
Sittin' on a mountain, looking at the sun
Plastic fantastic lobster telephone
Drive on baby, through the electric night
All the way sister, in the taxi of life
Cookin' in the kitchen, insects on the bone
Hazy, lazy, dream world drippin' on
Waitin' for a time bomb, yeah, tick tick tick away
Somethin' on the radio, yeah yeah, drip drip drip all day, yeah
Drive on baby, through the electric night
All the way sister, in the taxi of light
The sunshine glows, but nobody knows
The nighttime's gone, keep drivin' on, yeah
Aphrodisiac jacket
Napoleon machine gun
Livin' on a subway, yeah yeah
From dusk till dawn, yeah
Push baby, push, push, push, yeah...
Sittin' on a mountain, we're looking at the sun
Plastic fantastic lobster telephone, yeah
Drive on baby, through the electric night
All the way sister, in the taxi of light
The sunshine glows, but nobody knows
The nighttime's gone, keep drivin' onEmbed
