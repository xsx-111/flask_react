In the Light Lyrics
I don't know why I just can't let it go
I don't know why I just can't let it go

Save it for all you had in your eyes

Fate dealt you a tricky hand
Now you're just left alone in your mind
And I have gone away

Mm-mm-mm
I don't know why I just can't let it go

Hold me and don't you ever let this die
Right here in the light
And in the day time
Right here in the–
Hold me and don't you ever let this die
In the light
And in the daytime
Right here in the–5Embed
