Gun Song Lyrics
I don't own a single gun
But if I did, you'd be the one
To hold it, aim it, make all of the bad men run
But I don't own a single gun

And I don't have a sweetheart yet
But if I did, I'd break my neck to please her
Make her want to stay in my arms, she'd rest
But I don't have a sweetheart yet

I can't believe what I found in daddy's sock drawer
Sock drawer, today
It was a pistol, a Smith & Wesson
Holy— Holy shit!

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
One, two— One, two, three, four!
Things I knew when I was young
Some were true and some were wrong
And one day, I pray, I'll be more than my father's son
But I don't own a single gun

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la3Embed
