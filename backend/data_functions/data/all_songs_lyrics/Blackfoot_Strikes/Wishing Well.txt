Wishing Well LyricsTake off your hat; kick off your shoes
I know you ain't goin' anywhere
Run 'round the town, singin' your blues
I know you ain't goin' anywhere
You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well
Oh, yeah!
Throw down your gun or you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through
You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishin' well
But I know what you're wishin' for:
Love in a peaceful world. Yeah!
Love in a peaceful world. Oh, yeah!
Love in a peaceful world
Mmmmmmm
Na na na na na na na-na
Na na na na na na na
You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well
Oh! Yes! My God, ow!
I wish you well
Oo-oo-ooh! The wishing well! Ow!
Everybody has a dream. Yeah, yeah!
Everybody has a wish
I wish you well! Ow!
Well, you dream your own timeEmbed
