I Got a Line on You LyricsYeah
Oh yeah, come on
Now, let me take you babe, down to the river bed
Well, I got to tell you something
That'll go right through your head
I got a line on you babe
(I got a line on you babe)
Yeah, I got a line on you
(I got a line on you babe)
Come on
Now, put your arms around me, every little bit of your love
Oh, you know what to do, I'll make love to you
You got the right stuff, and I do too
I got a line on you babe
(I got a line on you babe)
Yeah, I got a line on you
(I got a line on you babe)
Yeah!
Got my eye on you babe, on your velvet skin
I wanna put my hands were they've never been
Get real hot in the midnight steam
Soaking in the rain of my favorite dream
Your lips are red, the moon is blue
I only ask you once what you want to do
Gonna touch you babe 'til the night is through
Look out honey, got a line on you
Oh yeah
Oh, now the winter's almost over
The summer she's coming on strong
Oh I could love you, love you, love you, love you all year long
I got a line on you babe
(I got a line on you babe)
Yeah, I got a line on you
(I got a line on you babe)
Ah yeah!
I got a line on you babe
(I got a line on you babe)
Yeah, I got a line on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I got a line on you babe
(I got a line on you babe)
I got a line on you
I got a line on you babeEmbed
