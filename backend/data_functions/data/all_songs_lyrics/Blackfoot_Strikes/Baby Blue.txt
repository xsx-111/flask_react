Baby Blue LyricsWell the first time that I saw her
She was standin' on the floor
And it hit me like a bolt of lightnin' baby
When she walked through the door
And the time was right
Stars were shinin' bright
And I kept fallin'
Yes it may sound funny to you
Now she's my baby blue
Well it was a jumpin' night
And everybody playin' their games
When I saw her in the light
I knew I'd never be the same
Yes the stars were bright
A jumpin' Friday night
And I kept fallin'
Well it may sound funny to you
Oh she's my baby blue
(Solo)
There's no lies between us
No games we play
So why wait till tomorrow, baby
When we can live today
And now I'm the light
The light that's shinin' bright
In her eyes, oh yes
Well it may sound funny to you
Oh she's my baby blue
Oh now listen
It may sound funny to you
Oh she's my baby blueEmbed
