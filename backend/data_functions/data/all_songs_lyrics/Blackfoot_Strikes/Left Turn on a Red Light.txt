Left Turn on a Red Light LyricsIt's nine o'clock at this old station
And my silver linin' ride is right on time
And as I buy myself a one-way ticket
For somewhere else on down the line
And I see that on their faces
Of a people that will never come home
And when I stare into the mirror, mama
See myself all alone
And did you ever stop to wonder
About the times that she laid by your side
When you know that I was right
And you finally realize
You took a left turn on a red light
Sun shines down on the desert
And it seems to make my life a haze
And I dream of my childhood sweetheart
And the freedom that I had in those days
When I wake from all my dreamin'
Will this boxcar always be my lonely home, yeah
Well I don't know where I am
And I really don't give a damn
This crazy life of mine will soon be gone
And did you ever stop to wonder
About the times that she laid by your side
When you know that I was right
And you finally realize
You took a left turn on a red light
(Solo)
Well it's nine o'clock at this old station
Once again my ride is right on time
And as I buy myself another ticket, Lord
For somewhere else on down the line
Well I'll always be a rambler
Well the ones I love always keep tellin' me
You stare too long in the mirror, son
Someday you'll be too blind to see
And now I can stop my wonderin'
About the times that she laid by my side
Now I know that I was right
And I finally realize
I took a left turn on a red light1Embed
