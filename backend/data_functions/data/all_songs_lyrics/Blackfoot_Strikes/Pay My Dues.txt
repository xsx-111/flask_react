Pay My Dues LyricsWell I pay my dues by singin' the blues
Someday it's gonna end
Well the light that shines
In the sky up above
It's just around the bend
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Yes, you got to pay
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Lord, you got to pay your dues
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Pay your dues
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Well the light that shines
In the sky up above
It's just, just, just around the bend
I said the choice is yours how you wanna pay
There's no denyin' you owe
'Cause just as sure as we all came
Baby, we got to go
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Yes, you got to pay
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Lord, you got you got to pay your dues
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Ohh pay your dues
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
I said I'm just as sure
Just as sure, just as sure, oohh
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
(Solo)
Well just as sure
Baby Just as sure
Just as sure, ooh yes yes
Livin' a life, it ain't easy
Livin' a life, it ain't easyEmbed
