Run and Hide LyricsThat look is all over your face
You've passed this way before
And even though you've lost the race
You still come back for more
I've told you since way back when
There's nothin' you can do
And even though you've tried again
You've got no place to
Run and hide
Run and hide
Your hurt is a recurring thing
You think it's come to stay
But still you keep remembering
You hope it will go away
No matter how hard you try
There's nothing that you can do
Don't live a life that's just a lie
You've got no place to
Run and hide
Run and hide
Run and hide, run and hide
I guess it's time that I should leave
I guess I'll be on my way
'Cause stayin' here is to much pain
And there's nothin' that's left to say
So if you ever need someone
To show you sympathy
Just remember the important thing
You've got no place to
Run and hide
Run and hide
Run and hide
Run and hideEmbed
