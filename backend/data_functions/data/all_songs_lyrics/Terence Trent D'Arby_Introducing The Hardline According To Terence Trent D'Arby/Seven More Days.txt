Seven More Days LyricsTeardrops rusting on a steel bar
Harmonica blues
Heartblood thick enough for pine tar
I've got a hole in my delta shoes
Grown men wither and they dry away
Their lives compromised
I've gotta hold on
Struggle through another day
To see the fire in my baby's eyes
Society's debt have been more than paid
In seven more days
I'll be home to you
And the walls will tumble down
That's separating us two
The Jericho mile and a river so wide
In seven more days
There will be no more divide
Bad dreams, cornerstone realities
Bears witness to shame
Hell's gate - a landscaped brutality
All material gain
But she's home praying on her hands & knees
That safe shall I part
But I am guilty of her memory
But there's no crime in my heart
Society's debts have been more than paid
In seven more days
I'll be home to you
And the walls will tumble down
That's separating us two
The Jericho mile and a river so wide
In seven more days
There will be no more divide
Lawful society
Says this is what you get
Tearful sobriety of
Matters that you soon regret
It all adds up to time
Debts have been more than paid
In seven more days
I'll be home to you
And the walls will tumble down
That's separating us two
The Jericho mile and a river so wide
In seven more days
There will be no more divideEmbed
