If You Let Me Stay Lyrics
Sweetheart listen
I know the last few pages
Haven't been good for the both of us
And I've caused you a lot of grief
But put those bags down, o.k.?
Before you make a decision like that
Please just listen to me
'Cos I don't want you to leave
I definitely don't want you to leave
Just hear me out
Honey, don't leave me now
With my head on my shoulders wrong
Have I done something wrong for you to leave?
I know I've been careless, girl
And I must apologize
I'll try better next time, baby
If you let me stay
If you let me stay
I'll say what I should've said
If you let me stay
I should have said that I love you
It you let me stay
And I should have said it from my heart
If you let me stay
How can I compensate
For my indiscretions, dear
Tell me it's not too late
That I'd love to hear
If you walk out on me
You will see a grown man cry
I didn't miss my water
Till my well ran dry
But if you let me stay
If you let me stay
I'll say what I should've said
If you let me stay
I should have said that I love you
It you let me stay
And I should have said it from my heart
If you let me stay
Your pretensions aim for gullible fools
And now who needs you anyway?
I'll get mine elsewhere
I taught the school
You will regret it someday(someday)
If you let me stay
I'll say what I should've said
If you let me stay
I should have said that I love you
It you let me stay
And I should have said it from my heart
If you let me,cause i need yah im not a men
Without you baby whoah!
Gotta got to meet baby
I can't do without you baby, baby, baby, baby
Let me say
I'll say what I should've said
If you let me stay
I should have said that I love you
If you let me stay
And I should have said it from my heart
If you let me
Come back to me baby
I can't do without you baby, baby, baby, baby
If you let me stay
I'll say what I should've said
If you let me stay
I should have said that I love you
If you let me stay
And I should have said it from my heartEmbed
