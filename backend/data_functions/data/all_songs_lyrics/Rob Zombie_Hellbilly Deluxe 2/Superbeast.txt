Superbeast Lyrics(Verse 1)
Shriek the lips across a ragged tongue
Convulsing two agether, sing violently
Move the jaw, cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly
(Pre-Chorus)
Ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
Ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see
(Chorus)
Hey yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey yeah, I'm the superbeast
Hey yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey yeah, I'm the superbeast
(Verse 2)
Stir the limbs across the wrist
Full possession of a memory
Bury me, oh as a dog
Icy hands surrounding me
(Pre-Chorus)
Ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
Ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see
(Chorus)
Hey yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey yeah, I'm the superbeast
Hey yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey yeah, I'm the superbeast
(Verse 1)
Shriek the lips across a ragged tongue
Convulsing two agether, sing violently
Move the jaw, cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly
(Pre-Chorus)
Ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
Ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see
(Chorus)
Hey yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey yeah, I'm the superbeast
Hey yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey yeah, I'm the superbeast5Embed
