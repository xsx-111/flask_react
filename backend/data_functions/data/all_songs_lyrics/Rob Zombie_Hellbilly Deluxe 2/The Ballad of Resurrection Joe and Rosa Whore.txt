The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore LyricsInsane blues at the green man inn
Cut the lights and pray that you're dead
Opium dreams through the seven dials
And feel the pillow over your head
Rachel hides from Ned the crow
Keen eye on the peelers
Experiment from 53
And no scratch for the dealers
She wants some more
Sweet Rosa whore
She wants some more
Sweet Rosa whore
I say hell is love
You say I must suffer
She's a motherfucker
Resurrect me
I say hell is love
You say I must suffer
She's a motherfucker
Resurrect me
Sleep well in your killing bed
Give a jig and show some life
Favor for a favor
Don't separate the
Pain from the knife
All the doctors sing
You got to suffer for the cure
As the world fades away
You wonder where you were
She wants some more
Sweet Rosa whore
She wants some more
Sweet Rosa whore
I say hell is love
You say I must suffer
She's a motherfucker
Resurrect me
I say hell is love
You say I must suffer
She's a motherfucker
Resurrect me
She wants some more
Sweet Rosa whore
She wants some more
Sweet Rosa whore
I say hell is love
You say I must suffer
She's a motherfucker
Resurrect me
I say hell is love
You say I must suffer
She's a motherfucker
Resurrect meEmbed
