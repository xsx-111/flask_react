What Lurks on Channel X? Lyrics
Thirteen acres of Hell (scream)

Ladies and gentlemen (x4)
I would like to make the following statement (x2)
The young generation, that sick generation (x2)
Chorus
What is lurking? what is here?
What is lurking? what you fear
What is lurking? what is here?
What is lurking? what you fear
Channel X (x4)

Impressionable young people (x4)
Brutal honesty will be shown on this screen (x2)
The young generation, that sick generation (x2)
Chorus
What is lurking? what is here?
What is lurking? what you fear
What is lurking? what is here?
What is lurking? what you fear
Channel X (x4)Embed
