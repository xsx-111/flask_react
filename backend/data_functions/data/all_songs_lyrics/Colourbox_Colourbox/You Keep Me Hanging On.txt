You Keep Me Hanging On Lyrics
Set me free why don't cha, babe
Let me be why don't cha, baby
'Cause, you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Now, you don't really want me
But you keep me hangin' on
Why do you keep a comin' around
Playing with my heart
Why don't cha get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me

Set me free why don't cha, babe
Let me be why don't cha, baby
'Cause, you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Now, you don't really want me
But you keep me hangin' on
You say although we broke up
You still just wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again
Set me free why don't cha, babe
Get out of my life why don't cha, baby
Set me free why don't cha, babe
Get out of my life why don't cha, baby

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
But now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold onto me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else
Why don't cha be a man about it
And set me free, now you don't care
A thing about me, you're just using me
Go on, stay out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Set me free why don't cha, babe
Get out of my life why don't cha, baby
Cause you don't really love me
But you keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on
You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
But now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold onto me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else

Why don't cha be a man about it
And set me free, now you don't care
A thing about me, you're just using me
Go on, stay out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' onEmbed
