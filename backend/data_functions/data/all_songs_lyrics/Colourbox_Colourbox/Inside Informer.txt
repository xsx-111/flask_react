Inside Informer Lyrics
Inside informer
Working undercover where the night must fall
I'll need an inside informer
Working undercover where the night must fall

I'm playing games in a dangerous world
My instinct's dying
A can of  in a deadly prayer
It's too late to stop trying

I'm looking for blues in a perfect crime
But watch when they cut you down
Nobody's seen me turn, that's a call

I need an inside (inside) informer (ooh, informer)
Working undercover where the night must fall
I need an inside (inside) informer (ooh, informer)
Working undercover where the night must fall

In meantime let me sleep a while
Mind's spinning, dying
Says  is a government file
It's too late to stop trying
I'm looking for blues in a perfect crime
But watch when they cut you down
Nobody's seen me turn, that's a call

I need an inside (inside) informer (ooh, informer)
Working undercover where the night must fall
I need an inside (inside) informer (ooh, informer)
Working undercover where the night must fall

I'm looking for blues in a perfect crime
But watch when they cut you down
Nobody's seen me turn, that's a call

I need an inside (inside) informer (ooh, informer)
Working undercover where the night must fall
I need an inside (inside) informer (ooh, informer)
Working undercover where the night must fallEmbed
