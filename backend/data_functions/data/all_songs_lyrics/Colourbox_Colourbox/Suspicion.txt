Suspicion Lyrics
Today I felt the walls close in so I shut my eyes
It felt like someone dragging me down
Although they have it in for me you know I won't let go
Though they’re taking the life force out of me

Fight against them or they'll break your spirit down
Fight against them or they'll try, try to control you

It doesn’t matter what they're saying
They're only tryna break you
The smiles in their lying eyes
They're only tryna break you
Read between the lines and you will find
That they're only tryna break you
What more would they ever need
When they're only tryna break you down

I haven't seen the sun for days, only nights and dawns
And I don't see much of laughing days
And how can I ever learn to keep them down
When they hide in places inside me
Fight against them or they’ll break your spirit down
Fight against them or they’ll try, try to control you

It doesn't matter what they’re saying
They're only tryna break you
The smiles in their lying eyes
They're only tryna break you
Read between the lines and you will find
That they're only tryna break you
What more would they ever need
When they’re only tryna break you down


Fight against them or they'll break your spirit down
Fight against them or they'll try, try to control you

It doesn't matter what they're saying
They're only tryna break you
The smiles in their lying eyes
They're only tryna break you
Read between the lines and you will find
That they're only tryna break you
What more would they ever need
When they're only tryna break you down, down, down, downEmbed
