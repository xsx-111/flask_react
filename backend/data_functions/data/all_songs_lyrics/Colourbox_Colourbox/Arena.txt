Arena Lyrics
Long was the morning
When you left me
And deep as the yearning
That burns within me
Cool is the trickster
Dance on my sword
With palms held together
Lying visions on my wall

No matter how it hurts you
Nobody's gonna to help you, too
We're gonna shake your sleeping mind
You feel guilty
Walked off your liberty
We're gonna shake your sleeping minds

I could have learned a million little things
But then you found some wrong in everything

But now you're on my mind, on my mind
I don't know why I let you go
But I never thought you'd disappear without a trace
And I don't know what I must gonna do
And I don't want to be alone in this arena
Were you hunting for lovers?
Did you tire of me?
Frustrated and angry now
I started saying things I didn't mean

No matter how it hurts you
Nobody's gonna to help you, too
We're gonna shake your sleeping mind
You feel guilty
Walked off your liberty
We're gonna shake your sleeping minds

I could have learned a million little things
But then you found some wrong in everything

But now you're on my mind, on my mind
I don't know why I let you go
But I never thought you'd disappear without a trace
And I don't know what I must gonna do
And I don't want to be alone in this arena
In this arena
In this arena
In this arena
Long was the morning
Deep as the yerning
Stripped of all armour now
Everybody's gone, deserted me
In this arena
(Arena)
In this arena
In this arena
In this arena
In this arenaEmbed
