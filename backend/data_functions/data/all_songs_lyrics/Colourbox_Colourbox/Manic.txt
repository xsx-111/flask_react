Manic Lyrics
Just shake it baby
Let you love me ooh
Just shake it baby
Love me with your love right now don't go

You know that ain't no lie
Somehow to realize
Man is the sweetest burning
When everything I do is want one man

(Just shake it baby)
One man
(Let you love me ooh)
The last stand
(Just shake it baby)
Is for the lone man
(Love me with your love right now don't go)

I'm under cover now
Never thought I'd feel so down
All of my freedom's gone
Now everything I do is want one man
(Just shake it baby)
One man
(Let your love me ooh)
The last stand
(Just shake it baby)
Is for the lone man


You know it's in my blood
Because it's in my heart
So live within my soul
Trying to drag me out of my mind

But one man
(Just shake it baby)
But one man
(Let you love me ooh)
The last stand
(Just shake it baby)
It's for the lone man
(Love me with your love right now don't go)Embed
