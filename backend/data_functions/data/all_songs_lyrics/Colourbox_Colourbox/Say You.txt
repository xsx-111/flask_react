Say You Lyrics
Say you
Say you

Say you'll never leave me again
Say you'll never deceive me again
Say you'll never hurt no other one but me
Woah
Woah

Say you
Say you

Say you'll never walk out on me again
Say you'll come back and be my best friend
Say you'll never love no other one but me
Ooh
Ooh

Say you
Say you
Say you, say you
Say you'll never leave me again
Say you'll never deceive me again
Say you'll never hurt no other one but me

Say you
Say you

Say you
Say you'll never leave me
Say you
Say you'll never deceive me
Say you
Say you'll never love, love no other
Say you
I wil be you lover and no, no, no other
Say you
Say you'll never leave me, oh it would really grieve me
Say youEmbed
