Anniversary LyricsYou were standing next to me
Reciting poetry
Looking very pale
Like you lost a nail
But somehow beautiful
And beautiful you're still
As I look at you today
On the anniversary
On the anniversary
The anniversary
You were walking next to me
Clutching a diary
Trying to be heard
Without a single word
I knew you would leave soon
When he walked in the room
I still remember you this way
On the anniversary
On the anniversary
The anniversary
You were lying next to me
Breathing quietly
Looking very pale
I think you lost a nail
And somewhere in your eyes
You finally realize
I will remember you this way
On the anniversary
On the anniversary
The anniversaryEmbed
