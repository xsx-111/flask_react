A Different Room LyricsOnce in a while I see what's going on
And disappear into the world
Behind the one that's here
It never lasts as long as a dream can last
And then I'm back into
The ways that make the days go fast
So grab my hand and make it last
And hold me close, don't leave so soon
Let all the flowers bloom and don't let go
Or I will blow away into a different room
Is it so strange? Tell me you feel the same
Or shut my mouth, I can't pretend I haven't said it now
Let's just pretend our numbered days won't end
Infinity this endless space and time for you and me
And yours and mine forever we will
Hold me close, don't leave so soon
Let all the flowers bloom and don't let go
Or I will blow away into a different room
And there's no door to get me back
To get me back there
There's no window to see
I tell myself that it was no
That it was nowhere
And all becomes a dream
And hold me close, don't leave so soon
Let all the flowers bloom and don't let go
Or I will blow away into a different roomEmbed
