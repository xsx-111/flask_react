Boxes LyricsWhen everything, when everything was out of reach
The sky was up, the ground was right below our feet
We played in boxes, we played in boxes
Cardboard boxes
We played in boxes, we played in boxes
Cardboard boxes
We wasted time, we wasted time before we knew
Don't punch the clock or time will run away with you
We live in boxes, we live in boxes
Concrete boxes
We live in boxes, we live in boxes
Concrete boxes
And now your childhood is over
You're a man they have said
You silently shoulder all the plans they have made
You pack down your boxes and ask 'Who am I?'
The biggest trick, the biggest trick they play on you
To make you think the show won't go on without you
We go in boxes, we go in boxes
Wooden boss
We go in boxes, we go in boxes
Wooden boxes
And now the room has been emptied
I'm alone in my bed
The heart is a box which the soul has fled
The spell has been broken and the last word is saidEmbed
