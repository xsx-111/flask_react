Ferris Wheel LyricsMy heart is so full of love
My heart is so beautiful
Tell me a number that you think you know
Let’s find out if we’re compatible
My love is an open book
An open book with its pages torn
Stick with me and I will keep you warm
I’ll give you shelter from the coming storm
If you wanna know the way I feel
You can climb aboard my ferris wheel
We’ll go round and round
So far off the ground
These days seem to go so quick
These days disappear so fast
All is girl to make you see
Bottom things that will never last
So why don’t we disappear
Just like them between the tracks
Maybe you and I, we won’t come back
I’d take a lie after all those facts
If you wanna know the way I feel
You can climb aboard my ferris wheel
We’ll go round and round
So far off the ground
When I make a sound
If you wanna know the way I feel
You can climb aboard my ferris wheel
We’ll go round and round
So far off the ground
When I make a soundEmbed
