Parallel Lines (Daydream) LyricsAll these monochrome days
Are making me blue
And it's on these days
My mind strays to thoughts of you
Do you think of me too?
I think me and you
Are just like
Parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel lines
We're just parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel lines
A silver telephone rings
A picture of you
And I'm taken away from this humdrum day
To someplace new
But I don't hear you
I'll never get through
Just like
Parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel lines
We're just parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel lines
Just like parallel lines
Yours will never meet mine
Just like
Parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel lines
We are parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel lines
Just like
Parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel lines
We are parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel linesEmbed
