On My Wall LyricsI didn't ever mean to steal from you
But how could I resist?
When everything you are and say and do
Is perfect as it is
I didn't really mean to go this far
But now I've broken in
And now I wanna stay and stay away
From every place I've been
You see
These old record sleeves
Don't keep me warm at all
The TV won't answer me
Like all the people on my wall
I only want to try to be your friend
If you don't have enough
Sometimes I think you know that in the end
That you and I are 'us'
You see
These old record sleeves
Don't keep me warm at all
The TV won't answer me
Like all the people on my wall
And I don't mind if you don't write
Or call on me
One day the faces on my wall
Will fall for me
I don't have any choice
A little voice says I belong to you
And you won't ever be
Rid of me, no matter what you do
You see
These old record sleeves
Don't keep me warm at all
The TV won't answer me
Like all the people on my wallEmbed
