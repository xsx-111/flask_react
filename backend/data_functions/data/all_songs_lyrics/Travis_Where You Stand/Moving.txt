Moving LyricsAnother day, I feel the weight of the atmosphere’s pressure
And I can’t escape
I try to run, I try to find my feet
My soul is sticking to the street
I get a move, I got to get myself to clean my shoes
And take the cynic route
I was afar, I’m following the star
Home isn’t where you are
And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until we’re gone, we’re moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
I feel alive, I am aware of the colors in the sky
And where the birds don’t fly
And if the night is coming pretty soon
I’m walking through the dark with you
I’ve got to play
I’ve got to listen to my toy today
On the motorway
And I could feel, the ground beneath my wheels
Putting me back in my place
And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until we’re gone, we’re moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on
And on
Another day, another place where I can find my way
Take the avenue way
And I know exactly where to go
Home isn’t where you stay
And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until we’re gone, we’re moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
I feel alive, I am aware of the colors in the sky
And where the birds don’t fly
And if the night is coming pretty soon
I’m walking through the dark with youEmbed
