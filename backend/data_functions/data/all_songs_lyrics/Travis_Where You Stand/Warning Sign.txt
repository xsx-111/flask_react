Warning Sign LyricsIn the middle of the night I hear you
Talking in your sleep the same old story
All I know it's not me
You've been talking to
All the wishes
All the joy and wonder
Sleeping with the fishes
Six feet under
All I want can't be done
Locked without a key
Oh where you going now?
Don't let your heart run out on me
Don't set the horses free
We never laid it on the line
No time, no warning sign
In the middle of the day I find you
Turning round the tables
And turning off your mind
In rewind you can't find a silent night
All the paper lying on the ground
Burning pages and those spinning heads
Is something wrong in their lives?
We were paradise
Oh Where are you going wrong?
Don't let your heart run out on me
Don't set the horses free
We never laid it on the line
No time no warning sign
Where are you going wrong?
Where are you going wrong?
Where are you going wrong?
Where are you going wrong?
Where are you going wrong?
Where are you going wrong?
Where are you going wrong?
Where you going?
Don't let your heart run out on me
Don't set the horses free
We never laid it on the line
No time no warning sign
Don't let your heart run out on me
Don't set the horses free
We never laid it on the line
No time no warning signEmbed
