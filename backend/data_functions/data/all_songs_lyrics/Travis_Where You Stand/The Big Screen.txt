The Big Screen LyricsLife doesn't fit on the big screen
And I'm just a bit part in the scene
Sitting in the dark in the back row
Nobody's watching me
The lights all come on
And life carries on
I still love you
On the big screen
Uhhh, on the big screen
This won't turn out like the movies
Cause actors wash off their bruises
Believing all the madness
We're over the gallows they nailed me on
They cut from the scene
And wake from the dream
And I still love you
On the big screen
Uhhh, on the big screen
The big screen's aflame with desire
While we're fighting fire with fire
What I've already said?
Nobody to care and carry me home
The plans that we make
The last serenade
The roles that we take
The electric parade
I still love you
On the big screen
Ooh, on the big screenEmbed
