Send His Love to Me Lyrics
Lover had to leave me
'Cross the desert plain
Turned to me, his lady
Tell me, "Lover, wait."

Calling Jesus, please
Send his love to me

Oh, wind and rain they haunt me
Look to the North and pray
Send me, please, his kisses
Send them home today

I'm begging, Jesus, please
Send his love to me

Left alone in desert
This house becomes a hell
This love becomes a tether
This room becomes a cell
Mummy, daddy, please
Send him back to me

How long must I suffer?
Dear God, I've served my time
This love becomes my torture
This love, my only crime
Oh, lover, please release me
My arms too weak to grip
My eyes too dry for weeping
My lips too dry to kiss

Calling Jesus, please
Send his love to me
I'm begging, Jesus, please
Send his love to me1Embed
