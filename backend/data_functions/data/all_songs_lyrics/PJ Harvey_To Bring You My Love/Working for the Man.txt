Working for the Man Lyrics
In the night, I look for love
Get my strength from the man above
God of piston, god of steel
God is here behind my wheel

I'm just working for the man

Pretty things get in my car
Take them flying, it's not far
Take 'em handsome, take 'em mean
Look good in my steel machine

I'm just working for the man

Don't you know yet who I am?
Working harder for the man
Go around, I'm doing good
Get my strength from the man above

I'm just working for the man
I'm just doing what I can
Go around, I'm doing good
Go around, I'm doing good
Go around, I'm doing good
Go around, I'm doing good
Go around, I'm doing good
Go around, I'm doing good
Go around, I'm doing good
Go around, I'm doing good1Embed
