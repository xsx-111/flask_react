Long Snake Moan Lyrics
Dunk you under
Deep salt water
Bring me, lover
All your power
I'll be no hell
Out of your spell
Over, under
Die of pleasure

In my dreaming
You'll be drowning
Hell's low, God above
All drunk on my love

You ought to hear my long snake... moan!
You ought to see me from my... throne!

Dunk you under
Deep salt water
In my dreaming
You'll be drowning
Raise me up, lord
Call me Lazarus
Hey lord, heal me
Make ready my veil
You ought to hear my long snake... moan!
You ought to see me from my... throne!

It's my voodoo working
It's my voodoo working
It's my voodoo working
It's my voodoo working

Moan!
Moan!
Moan!
Moan!
Woo!
Moan!
Moan!
Moan!1Embed
