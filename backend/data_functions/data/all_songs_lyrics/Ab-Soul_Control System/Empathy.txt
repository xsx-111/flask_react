Empathy Lyrics

I got $700 dollars from my last show
And I would spend it all on you
So baby, won't you fall on through? (Fall on through)

Empathy
Empathy
Empathy
Empathy

It's been a little while since the last time I saw you (Saw you)
What's up with you and ol' dude? (Ol' dude)
I hope everything is all cool (All cool)

Empathy
Empathy
Empathy
Empathy

Can you feel what I feel?
When I feel what I feel?
Empathy
Empathy
Lady, if you would just give me the time
You could leave all of your problems behind
You got a past, but that's in the past
And we all know that, you can't press rewind
I understand, we're all human
I'll lend you a hand if you wouldn't mind
Pamper you and stand for you
The man to make everything right

I guess things ain't going as well as you expected
But baby, don't stress it
I hope you learned a lesson

Empathy
Empathy
Empathy
Empathy

I tell you, I been down that road before
If anyone can feel you, it is me
So won't you let your garments hit the floor?
And let me let you feel me
Lights, please; lights, please
Light-skinned, mighty feisty
Ojo, I see, I see
You like me too

Can you feel what I feel
When I feel what I feel?
