A Rebellion Lyrics
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
Say, I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one

See, I just wanna take my chopper
And aim it right at that copper
Who just locked up my partner
They can't stop us

I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one

Inhale
Exhale
Inhale
Exhale
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one

Who's bold enough to rebel?
That's the joint, that's the jam (Rebel?)
Turn it up, play it again (Re...)
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
Who bold enough to rebel?
That's the joint (Rebel?)
That's the jam (Re...)
Turn it up
Play it again

I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one
Said, I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one
Said, I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one
See, I just wanna grab that heater
And run right in the cathedral
And aim it right at that preacher
For miseducating the people

Said, I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one

Inhale
Exhale
Inhale
Exhale

And I just wanna take that banger
And aim it right at my Maker
For placing me 'round all this danger
I can't even trust my neighbor

I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
Inhale
Exhale
Inhale
Exhale

I know I'm all alone on this one
I said, I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
Yeah

Who's bold enough to rebel?
That's the joint, that's the jam (Rebel?)
Turn it up, play it again (Re...)
That's the joint, that's the jam (Bel...)
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint
That's the jam
Turn it up
Play it again
