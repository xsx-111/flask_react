You Got to Me LyricsMama she always told me it would happen
But she never said
That it would happen like this
Papa said
"Some little girl'll catch you nappin'
Some little girl will get to you with her kiss"
You got to me
You brought me to may knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control you got to me
You got to be mine
Used to slip
Though every girl's hand like water
There never was one
Who could ever tie me down
Straight ahead and steady as Gibraltar
'Til you brought me tumblin' to the ground
You got to me
You brought me to may knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control, you got to me
You got to be mine
You got to me
You brought me to may knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control, you got to me
You got to be mine
You got to me girl
All right come on now
Say you got to meEmbed
