The Long Way Home LyricsHad to go
Had to know all there was out there
Now I'm back
I know that, girl
It's all right here
Girl, I took the long way home
It's true
The long way home to you, yeah
And I just wanna say
I'm home to stay
Ran a lot
Don't know what I thought I would find
Town to town
All I found was you on my mind
Girl, I took the long way home
It's true
The long way home to you, yeah
And I just wanna say
I'm home to stayEmbed
