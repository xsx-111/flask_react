I Do Believe You Are Blushing LyricsI do believe you're blushing
Everything in your mind is coming
Why, Miss J, I do believe you
I want to stick you gold and blue
Sucking boat where I want to be
Train, train in the ground with me
Sinking sky, the sky is falling
Looking now, I am calling you
I do believe your eyes
Your face is glowing
I do believe your face
Waking up to your eyes
Endless over
I do believe that you are blushing
Put me down on the ground, won't you?
Take a walk in the park, won't you?
Let's lay on the rock with me
Don't you, don't you, want to look me?
Push me to the wall, won't you?
Push a ring down my neck for you
What will they be like, like you?
Incredible eyes, incredible
I do believe your eyes
Your face is glowing
I do believe your face
Waking up to your eyes
Endless over
I do believe that you are blushingEmbed
