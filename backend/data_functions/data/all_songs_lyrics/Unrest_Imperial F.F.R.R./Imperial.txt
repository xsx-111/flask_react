Imperial LyricsSun is whiter than whiter
Could be a witness to
Burning out my eyes
Sun is whiter than whiter
Could be a witness to
Burning out, killing and talking
Burning out, killing and talking
Nananana nana na, nana nana na nana
Imperial
Nananana nana na, nana nana na nana
Imperial
Someone is coming, I can have her
Someday
She has me, she can have me
She has me, she has
Nananana nana na, nana nana na nana
Imperial
Nananana nana na, nana nana na
Imperial
Imperial
Where am I from
She, she, she is from
Nineteen hundred and twenty two
Nineteen hundred and two
Fine time to wish mine
She was, she was
Fine time to wish mine
Nananana nana na, nana nana na nana
Imperial
Nananana nana na, na na na na
