Suki LyricsKicking kicking
Kicking kicking
Kicking me kicking me
Kicking kicking
Stateside so i'm free
I want to be with you all the time
Suki
I want to lay down in sunshine
Suki suki suki
Kicking kicking
Kicking kicking
Kicking you
Kicking you kicking you
Kicking kicking
So weighty that's why i'm so blue
I want to be with you all the time
I want to lay down in sunshine
Keep repeating keep repeating
Kicking kicking kicking kicking
What you say
Kicking you kicking you
Kicking kicking
Always night and day
I want to be with you all the time
