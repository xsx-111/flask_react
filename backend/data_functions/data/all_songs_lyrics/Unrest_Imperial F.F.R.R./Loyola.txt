Loyola LyricsUno, due, tre, quattro, cinque, sei, sette
Oh the pressure
All the pressure
Sinking depression
All depression
I want you to be mine
I want you always
Lovey lovey
Here the pressure
Tell me, would you do me?
Could you see the headlight?
Coming closer closer
Love from you is what I need
Would you die for me?
Would you die for me?
Can you, can you die for me?
I can, can you die for me?
No, no, no, no, no, no, die
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, die for me, die
Will you die for me, die for me?
Will you die for me, will you die?
Will you die for me?
Will you die for me?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Can you die for me?
Would you die for me, die for me?Embed
