Isabel LyricsDoesn't matter where you're looking
It doesn't matter who you're painting
Taking time to watch the walking
Taking time to take the train off
Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel
One, four, five when I'm walking
In the square, in the subway
Detroit, home is coming
Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel
Three, two, five when I'm walking
Yes, you were a lovely child
She is a lovely child
Gone diving in the river
But your body kept on swimming
All alone from life's beginning
Admiration is still swelling
Isabel comes to here
(Let's go)Embed
