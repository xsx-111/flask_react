June LyricsAs you lay dying
Poppies are reddening
Bursting wide open, revealing their seeds
Tastes like the water that beads on white skin
As you lay dying
Morphine and ice cream
Staining your sheets, and confusing your mind
And it reminds me, they still get paid when you die
They took the heart right out of you
How did it feel to be twenty six degrees?
With your body split leaking all about your legs
Could you hear me call from your mountaintop
Crawling through the snow, crawling through the blood
To say, hey
Daddy
Daddy
How did it feel to be 26 degrees?
With your body split leaking all about your legs
Daddy
Don't go away
Daddy
Please stay
Could you hear me call from your mountaintop
Crawling through the snow, crawling through the blood
To say, hey
Daddy
