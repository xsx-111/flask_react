Yes, She Is My Skinhead Girl LyricsI said I want to meet you aah
I said I want to fuck you all the time
I said I want to fuck you aah
I said I want to meet you all the time
I said I want to need you aah

I said I want to fuck you aah
I said I want to meet you
Yes, she is my skinhead girl
Yes, she is my skinhead
Yes she is my skinhead girl
Yes, she is my little pet
I'm fuckin' fuckin' on sandy beaches
Kiss kissin' all over the places
Smash smashin' I'm a over and I'll race it
Suck suckin' where the eyes won't trace it
Yes, she is my skinhead girl
Yes, she is my skinhead
Yes, she is my skinhead girl
Check this girl, this girl is swirl
Yaaahhh!!!
Ah
Aaahhh!!
I'll tell you what is good as you look now
That would be impossible
For you are better than the face of God
On a sunny day
Sometimes I feel like I'm on a mission
I'm on a mission to kill myself
Yes, she is my skinhead girl
Yes, she is my skinhead
Yes, she is my skinhead girl
Check this girl, this girl is swirl
Yes, she is my skinhead girl
She's gonna take me for a whirl
Yes, she is my skinhead girl
Yes, she is wider than Embed
