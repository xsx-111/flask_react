Stanger Rises Lyrics
I’ve got a certain who-knows-what about me
And a small amount of time
To scheme a way out to leave my world behind for the night
But I love movies, my same two Genes
They lured me to escape, 'cause they come out early
I wish you’d go away
Generation Home does coke while I get stoned in my back yard
What a forceful release on my routine Rubicon

They can’t do this to me
I’m misunderstanding
I swear, I’ve improved in just one week
I shriek, I yell, I scream

Save the date but we’re not coming home
Meet my parents or leave that night
Should’ve known this was a long time coming
I hope you don’t mind that

Truth is, I want out
Transparent, no doubt
But I’m sure you can break me free from here
They won’t remember my name when it's compared to yours
Will they remember my name?
Will they remember my name?1Embed
