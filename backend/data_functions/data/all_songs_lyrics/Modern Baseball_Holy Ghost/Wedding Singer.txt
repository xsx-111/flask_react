Wedding Singer Lyrics
Find it hard to believe tonight
In a curiously well-kept house built before I was born
This year, we're gonna stamp out the sorry feeling
Rain on summer vacation
Five blocks from Tasker-Morris Station
Fucked for the ride home if I can't find two bills
To rub together before

Midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me sing your spirit's sound
But you turned in early
Left the TV flickering its staged romance across your face

Said goodbye from the front porch
I always wonder if you're smiling at us or if you're looking away
I'd ask, but either way, I feel sorry for you
Locked your love in a screenshot
They all work that way
And I've been wishing I could say that I don't
The selfish side likes to think my execution's more
Of an honest one
These artists all cut cloth with underscored conviction
Blacked-out friction flies me back to Baltimore to wait for you
But I'm stuck here, too
Until midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me sing your spirit's sound
But you turned in early
Left the TV flickering its staged romance across your face8Embed
