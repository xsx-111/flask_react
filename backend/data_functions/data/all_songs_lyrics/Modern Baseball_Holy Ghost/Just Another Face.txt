Just Another Face Lyrics
I'm a waste of time and space
Drifting through my selfish ways
I don't know how I got here
Travel light, endlessly
Distort all reality
I can't say how I got here

I'm a waste of time and space
Meandering, unwanted days
I don't know how I got here
Entering a well-known phase
I scream, "Get lost, I hate everything"
I can't say how I got here

Still, I can feel the need to change me from the inside
But I can't let anyone know just yet

If it's all the same
It's time to confront this face to face
I'll be with you the whole way
It'll take time, that's fact
I'm not just another face
I'm not just another name
Even if you can't see it now
We're proud of what's to come
And you
I'm a waste of time and space
Slipping past with getaways
I've let the days form weeks, form years
I'm a waste of rock and dirt
Grass and ground and all the earth around me
Around you

Still, I can feel the need to change me from the inside
But I can't let anyone know just yet

If it's all the same
It's time to confront this face to face
I'll be with you the whole way
It'll take time, that's fact
I'm not just another face
I'm not just another name
Even if you can't see it now
We're proud of what's to come
And you4Embed
