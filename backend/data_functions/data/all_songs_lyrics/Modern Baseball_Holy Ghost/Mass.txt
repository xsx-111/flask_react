Mass Lyrics
Pulled over at midday
The joker's still wet behind the ears
He hands off a novel of novice citations outside the service station
The glue sets beneath our heels

My baby's in Massachusetts
And all this booze is useless
Sunset, sing my scratched-out, sighing soul to sleep
And the cashier here is ruthless
Jeanette, I wrote your name down
But I'd hate that job as much as you do
If I was stuck between
Barton and Binghamton too

Days like this, I miss listening to records
Making coffee together, snowglobes and Jersey sheets
I tried sleeping in our bed without you last night
That didn't work at all, 'cause I couldn't sleep
Sometimes, I wish it was still last summer
And you still lived in South Philly
And I wasn't playing a show in Nebraska, or Austin, Texas
Asking the kids what they ate for breakfast
But here I am, Valero bathroom
Who's paid to keep these things clich√©?
Bury me beneath New York State
It's the only place where I feel dead

My baby's in Massachusetts
And all this booze is useless
Sunset, sing my scratched-out, sighing soul to sleep
And the cashier here is ruthless
Jeanette, I wrote your name down
But I'd hate that job as much as you do
If I was stuck between
Barton and Binghamton too1Embed
