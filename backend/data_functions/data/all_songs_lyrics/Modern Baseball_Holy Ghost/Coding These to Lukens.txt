Coding These to Lukens Lyrics
It's not just what you say
Or how you've come so far
The words that you repeat
When time tears us apart
That smug look on your face
When you have something to hide
Or at least that's what I think
Maybe I'm out of touch
You can tell me if I'm wrong
But you know I'm right

Spit fire, spit blood, spit fast, I'm heated
I'm sure this won't linger
Longer than it has to
Get out of my way, steadfast, I'm fiending
I'm a certain kind of way
A certain kind of way, tonight
I know it can't be in my head
It must be one of you who keep pulling me aside
To chitchat about me, who I am
What the deal is with who I was onceEmbed
