Breathing in Stereo Lyrics
I can’t help thinking
About you this whole ride home
From Alberta, Portland
To wherever I’ll soon unfold
Into oblivion
Or somewhere between here and fact
Forever waiting for you
Ever-aching, 'cause I’m

I'm longing for when I’ll be coming back
To you

Hopeless, I’m fading
It’s the same damn thing every night
Planning our future without you
Without me, at times
But hey, I digress
What I was saying before is more important

Well, I’m longing for when I’ll be coming back
To you
Why does it take two thousand miles
For me to say, “I love you” ?
Burnout by day, lover by night
(Why does it take two thousand miles)
I’m not the same as I was, but that’s cool, whatever
(For me to say, “I love you” ?)
Burned out by days without you
I’m lost, forlorn, I can’t do this alone

I feel safe, still with you
I’m safe, intact and hopeful
We’ll make it together
We'll make it together1Embed
