Holy Ghost Lyrics
Okay!

He's been haunting my dreams at night
I've been bleeding from tripping in the dark
Trying to turn on the light
Trying to turn on the light
He's been haunting my dreams, all right
I've been hollering at him in the dark
Trying to find the right switch
Yeah, my third wish
Has always been three more
But this time, my holy ghost is hovering over me
And I am passed out on the floorEmbed
