The Seventh Stranger Lyrics

Those words are all remainders
Echoes growing in the heart of twilight
They lay back laughing at naivete's star
Awaken all those whispers in the dusty shadow of a
Passing favor
I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right
I couldn't see from so far
Was I chasing after rainbows
One thing for sure you never answered when I called
And I wiped away the water from my face

To look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of a stranger

Can't tell the real from reflections
When all these faces look the same to me
In every city such a desolate dream
Some days are strange to number
Some say the seventh sounds a little bit stranger
A year of Sundays seems to have drifted right by
(I could have sworn) in one evening
And I'm not seized in desperation
No steel reproaches on the table from before
But I still can feel those splinters of ice
I look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of a stranger


I must be chasing after rainbows
One thing for sure you never answer when I call
And I wipe away the water from my face

To look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of a stranger

In the eyes of a stranger...1Embed
