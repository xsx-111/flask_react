I Take the Dice Lyrics
Midnight I think I'm going to make it
Feel the magical lash of the roll
And the crash in their lives
Headline in tomorrow's papers
Kill that light it's so bright
And you're shining it right in my eyes

Show me your secret and tell me your name
Catch me with your fizzy smile
Try to remember again and again
What it is that I recognize
Don't ask me now
When I need you I don't know how
To believe in your advice
Just this once I take the dice

Midnight so what's the point of faking
For a kiss or a whisper
You pull out a desperate prize
Hold tight onto Daddy's bracelet
Make them pay for their chances
With money they don't think that's nice
