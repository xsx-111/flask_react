Of Crime and Passion Lyrics
Why did you let me run
When you knew I'd fall for the gaping hole
Where your heart should be
Liar-couldn't cut me deeper with a knife if you tried
Just take a look (before you run off and hide)
At your victim
Arise
Clouds on you shoulder
Aren't they grazed by the afterglow
How quiet they gather
When the storm is about to blow

No don't look away
Caught in the crossfire
And it ain't no wind of change
I'm talking of crime and passion's rage

Summer of madness or the undertow
Dragged me up an alley for the blossoming fire
On a stranger's smile
Bride of wire-how disguise so easily cracked
Saw your heart turn spade
This orchid's turned to black
Graze on your shoulder
Like the clouds in the afterglow
How quiet they gather
When the storm is about to blow

Way down by the shoulder
In the haze of the afterglow
Stranded together
And the storm is about to blow
