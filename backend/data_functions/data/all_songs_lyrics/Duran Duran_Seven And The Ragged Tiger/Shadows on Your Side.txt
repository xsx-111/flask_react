Shadows on Your Side Lyrics
Shackled and raised for a shining crowd
They want you to speak but the music is louder than
All of their roar with the heat of the planet's core-but

The shadows are on your side
As soon as the lights go down
In the darkest place you can find
You belong to the hands of the night

Promises made with a distant friend
Truth should be known it can only bend
To a tune of its own
Hey you'll never hear that voice again
Scandal in white on a tangled vine
With everybody to say that you're having the
Time of your life when your life is on the slide-but


Spinning a compass to choose your way
You can run you can dive you can stand and you can soar
Whichever way you can be sure-that

Shadows on your side
The shadows are on your side5Embed
