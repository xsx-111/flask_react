Drops LyricsWhen you're so high you don't think
When you fall from the sky you won't break
So come down from the clouds
Come down now
So come down from the cloud
Come down now
I've been loving you, too long
I've been loving you, for too long
So come down from the clouds
Come down now
So come down from the cloud
Come down now
When you're so high you don't think
When you fall from the sky you won't break
I've been loving you, too long
I've been loving you, for too long5Embed
