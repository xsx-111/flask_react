Julia Lyrics
It's calling on me
If what I see is true
To me you're just a girl
Oh yeah
And it's starting, baby

Julia
I don't know a thing about you
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need

Too easy
All I ever need
Too cold
You're all I ever need
Are you mad about me?
You're all I ever need
Or do you see a fool?
To me you're just a girl
Tell me
All I ever need
If it's starting baby
All I ever need
Julia
I don't know a thing about you
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need

All I ever need
You're all I ever need
It's calling on me
All I ever need
If what I see is true
To me you're just a girl
You're all I ever need yeah
All I never need

Julia
You're all I ever need
I don't know a thing about you
You're all I ever need
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need
Julia
You're all I ever need
I can't do a thing without you
You're all I ever need
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need4Embed
