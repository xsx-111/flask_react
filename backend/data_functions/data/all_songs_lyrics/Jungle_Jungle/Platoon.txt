Platoon Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Brother
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's funny
How good you are

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

Under the rocks
Down by the beach
No, I'm not
Where you
Want me

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Brother
It's how good you are
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Brother
It's how good you are

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

I see the snake
Down by my feet
Walk on
Just you
Watch me

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to
Behind my back
And the love beneath
Whispered into
NothingEmbed
