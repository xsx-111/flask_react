The Heat Lyrics
Right on time
Back by the beach
Still gon' bring The Heat
Bring The Heat
The Heat

Doing all that I can for you
To be a warm-blooded man
So I can treat you better

No I, I can't feel The Heat, yeah!
Don't let it catch you!
No, I, I can't feel The Heat, mmm
I know I can't get you home, no!

Like a flash from a gun, I knew
That the more that I run, honey
Won't help to make it better!

Still I, I can't feel The Heat, yeah!
Don't let it catch you
No, I, I can't feel The Heat, hmm!
I know I can't get you home, no!
(Get up)
(Deliver)
(Don't you give up)
(Hell no, get up)
I know I can't get you home
(Get up)
(Deliver)
(Don't you give up)
(Hell no, get up)
I know I can't get you home

(Get up)
No, I (Deliver)
I can't feel The Heat (Don't you give up)
Yeah!
(Don't you give up)
(Hell no, get up)
I know I can't get you home (Get up)
No, I (Deliver)
I can't feel The Heat (Hell no, get up)
No!

(Get up)
(Deliver)
Doing all that I can for you (Don't you give up)
To be a warm-blooded man, honey
So I can treat you better
Bring The Heat
The Heat
Bring The Heat
