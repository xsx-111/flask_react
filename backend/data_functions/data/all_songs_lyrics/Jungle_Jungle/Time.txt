Time Lyrics
Saying
How I'm feelin'
Ain't easy

You know, you know
Time and time again
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah
Time and time again
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah
Say it again

Oooh
Just hold on tight
Don't let in, yeah
I'll run all night
Don't let me
Oooh
Just let it out
Time and time and time and time and time again
Time and time and time and time and time again

Breakin'
Now I'm feelin'
You see me
I know, you know
Time and time again
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah
Time and time again
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah
Say it again

Oooh
Just hold on tight
Don't let in, yeah
I'll run all night
Don't let me
Oooh
Just let it out
Time and time and time and time and time again
Time and time and time and time and time again

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm not even there (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
What these people want is mine
But my head is in space
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You know, you know
Time and time again

Just hold on tight
Don't let in, yeah
I'll run all night
Oooh
Just let it out
Time and time and time and time and time again

Oooh
Just hold on tight
Don't let in, yeah
I'll run all night
Don't let me
Oooh
Just let it out
Time and time and time and time and time again1Embed
