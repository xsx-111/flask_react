Lucky I Got What I Want Lyrics
I steal living
Tell me I'm wrong
Will I be forgiven?
I wanna walk like you
Swinging it back when I want

When I find myself next to the
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
When I find myself next to the
Don't you, I won't
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
Don't you forget about me

Inside this killing, cut if I want
Time to leave, lucky I got what I want

When I find myself next to the
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
When I find myself next to the
Don't you, I won't
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
Don't you forget about me
Slow, carefully
Slow, carefully

When I find myself next to the
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
When I find myself next to the
Don't you, I won't
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
Don't you forget about me

Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
