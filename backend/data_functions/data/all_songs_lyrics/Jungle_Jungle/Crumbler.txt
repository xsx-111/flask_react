Crumbler Lyrics
Who do you think you're kidding now?
Screaming, lying, it's about enough
And all you're kicking up
Yeah, it's covering everyone

There's something tonight
Going on down there
So crawl up me, baby
All I ever wanted tonight
It's going on down there
So crawl up me, baby

Can't wash it off, joke
Meaning crumbling, it's hard enough
Got to quicken up
'Cause it's all or never now, again

There's something tonight
Going on down there
So crawl up me, baby
All I ever wanted tonight
It's going on down there
So crawl up me, baby
Here we go again
Hey, something tonight
Hey, I want you tonight
Going on down there
Going on down there
Going on down there3Embed
