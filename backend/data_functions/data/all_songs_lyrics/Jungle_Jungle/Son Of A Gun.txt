Son Of A Gun Lyrics
I'm the son of a gun
You got a lot to show
Yeah, but nobody's talking now
You're the shock I need
Gotta give me a go
Yeah, I heard that you give it out

You made the elephant run
It took him to his knees
So, why are you giving up?
You can take it from my hands
I just watch you feed
Cause I know what you think about

I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you down
I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you down
I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you, let you down
I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you
I'm the son of a gun
I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you down
I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you down
I can't get you, oh
I won't let you
