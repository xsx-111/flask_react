Accelerate Lyrics
I'm sick of has-beens coming home
I'm coming home to the warmth
And it's madness
Who do you think you are?

So can I get the car to jump start, please
Let me hit the gas to go high, speed
'Cause everything just happened at once
Yeah everything just happened at once
You see, please

And it's magic
Are you strong?
Are you strong? Any more?
Yeah and imagine
If you knew who you are

So can I get the car to jump start, please
Let me hit the gas to go high, speed
'Cause everything just happened at once, yeah
And I don't remember a thing you see
So, please
Can I get the car to jump start, please
Let me hit the gas to go high, speed
'Cause everything just happened at once, ooh ooh
Yeah everything just happened at once to me
Yeeah, me2Embed
