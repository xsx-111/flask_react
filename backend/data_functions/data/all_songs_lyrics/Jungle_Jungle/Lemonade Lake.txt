Lemonade Lake Lyrics
So who do I see, heh, coming up from lemonade lake?
Has she come for me?
Is she coming in for something warm?
Coming up in from lemonade lake

Every day every night, che'yeah
I miss you
I miss you
Every day and every night
'Cause I don't know what went wrong, no
I miss you
I miss you

So who do I see, heh
Coming up from lemonade lake?
Yeah
The deep blue sea
Is coming in with something more?
She's coming in from lemonade lake

Every day and every night, che'yeah
I miss you
I miss you
Every day and every night
'Cause I don't know what went wrong, no
I miss you
I miss you
Every day and every night
Every day and every night
'Cause I don't know what went wrong
Uh-uh-uh
You better shine
My head is under water now
You better shine
My head is under water now

Every day and every night, che'yeah
I miss you
I miss you
Ever day and every night
'Cause I don't know what went wrong, no
I miss you
I miss you
'Cause I don't know what went wrong

(I don't know what went wrong my dear)
I miss you
(I've been searching for you for all these years darling)
Everyday and every night
'Cause I don't know what went wrong
I miss you
I miss you
Everyday and every night
(I don't know what went wrong my dear)
(I've been searching for you for all these years darling)
(I don't know what went wrong my dear)
I miss you
(I've been searching for you for all these years darling)
I miss you
(I don't know what went wrong my dear)
(I've been searching for you for all these years darling)
(I don't know what went wrong my dear)
(I've been searching for you for all these years darling)
I don't know what went wrong my dear
I've been searching for you for all these years darling3Embed
