As Hard As It Is LyricsLife's been quiet since you've been gone
It's no fun burning for one
I was happy before you came
Lord know as hard as it is, as hard as it is
Now you've gone, it's just not the same
He knows just how hard it is
It drives me mad not now having you
They know how hard it is
Lord knows as hard as it is, as hard as it is
I missed you bad, I want you now my darling
They know how hard it is
Lord know as hard as it is, as hard as it is
Lord knows as hard as it is, as hard as it is
He knows just how hard it isEmbed
