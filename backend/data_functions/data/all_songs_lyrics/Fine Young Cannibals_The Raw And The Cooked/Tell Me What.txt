Tell Me What LyricsTell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what I gotta do
To make you notice
To make you look this way
What Did I have To say?
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what I have to say
To keep you with me
To make you want to stay
To have you every day
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what I gotta do
Are you happy
I can never tell
You keep it to yourself
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what it is you feel
Do you get frightened
Am I comin' on
Just a little strong
And you're so quiet
I never know or not
If I'm right or wrong
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what I gotta do
Is there somethin'
I ought to be told
Do you want to go
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what it is you know
So it's over?
Then we're really through?
What I heard is true?
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me whatcha' gonna' do
To keep you with me
To make you want to stay
Too have you every day
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what I gotta do
Tell me
Won't you tell me?
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what I gotta do
No
Whoa girl
Won't you just, now
Tell me what
Tell me what
Tell me what I gotta do ...Embed
