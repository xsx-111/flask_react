The Lover Lyrics
There's a feeling washing over me
It was built by you and me
Our unity makes me feel so free to say...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"
I feel the feeling and the feeling's pure
I got a feeling I ain't scared no more
Because my people love me and make me feel sure to say...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?

Look Ma, I'm a soul singer
Singing in the faces of the middle finger
So, I bite my thumb and let it linger
To say, "fuck you, I'm a lover"
If I don't like the music you fake
I just won't listen to the piss you take, 'cause
Sycophants does not a good band make and...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"
You say you don't like my clichés
Our sloganeering and our catchphrase
I say, "love is like a freeway" and...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?

I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
Eat shit!
Eat shit!
Eat shit!
Eat shit!
Eat shit!

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it taste good?Embed
