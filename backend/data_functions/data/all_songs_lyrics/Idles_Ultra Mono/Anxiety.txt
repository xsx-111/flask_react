Anxiety Lyrics
My girlfriend just dumped me
For Friday night TV
And a boy who's six-foot-three
She hates me
I fix the numb, but the numb don't fix
Now I'm fixed and I just feel sick
Sick sick, I feel kicks
But the kicks don't kick so I act a prick

I've got anxiety
It has got the best of me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Anxiety

Our government hates the poor
Cold leaders, cold class war
Keeping drugs you can't afford
So the poor can't buy the cure
Car crash country, car crash scene
Car crash dislocated me
Car crash tabloid guillotine
Car crash counts for the votes you see
I have got anxiety
It has got the best of me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Anxiety
Anxiety
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)Embed
