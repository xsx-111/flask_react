Mr. Motivator Lyrics
Woo, repeat after me

I am I, and I intend to go, go, go
Like Conor McGregor with a samurai sword on rollerblades
Like Vasyl Lomachenko after four pints of Gatorade
Like Kathleen Hanna with bear claws grabbing Trump by the pussy
Like Delia Smith after ten chardonnays makin' me a nice cookie

How d'you like them clichés?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it
Yes, you can
Woo

I am I, and I intend to go, go, go
Like Frida Kahlo painting "arm the poor" on your fuck-off wall
Like Tracey Emin in her unmade bed listenin' to The Fall
Like Flavor Flav in the club ridin' on the back of John Wayne
Like David Attenborough clubbin' seal clubbers with LeBron James
How d'you like them clichés?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
Woo

It's all about the confidence
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it1Embed
