Model Village Lyrics
(I'm off to the château)

A lot of nine-fingered boys in the village
They haven't got much choice in the village (Yeah)
Model car, model wife, model village
Model far, model right, model village
They ain't too friendly in the village (In the village)
There’s a tabloid frenzy in the village (Don't read The Sun)
He's "not a racist but" in the village
Gotta drive half-cut in the village
Model low crime rate in the village
Model race, model hate, model village (Village)
Got my head kicked in in the village (Wah)
There’s a lot of pink skin in the village
"Hardest man in the world" in the village
He says he got with every girl in the village

Take flight, take flight
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Model village

I beg your pardon
I don’t care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death
(Yeah, I'm a fuckin' dragon)
Still not in love with the village
Homophobes by the tonne in the village
A lot of overpriced drugs in the village
A lot of half-pint thugs in the village
Model car, model wife, model village
Model far, model right, model village (Model village)
I see a lot of gammon in the village (Hey)
I don’t see a lot happen in the village (Nothing happens)
Just give them an anthem and they'll sing it
Still they don’t know the meanings in it (Meanings in it)
Just saluting flags 'cause it's British
Idiot spirits think they're kindred
Model low crime rate in the village (In the village)
Model race, model hate, model village
It feels like the village is self-pillaged
Still someone's making a killing

Take flight, take flight
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Take flight
Model village (Dragon!)

I beg your pardon
I don’t care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death
I beg your pardon
I don’t care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death
You gotta laugh as the curtain twitches
And the villagers bury their riches
But the village doesn't know what rich is
Just snitches snitchin' on snitches
Only one thing to do in the village
Just say toodle-do to the village
Toodle-fucking-do4Embed
