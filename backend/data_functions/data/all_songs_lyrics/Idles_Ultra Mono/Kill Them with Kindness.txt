Kill Them with Kindness Lyrics

"Ar! Ar! Ar! Ar! Ar!", said the puppy to the snake
I've got a real big mirror of a smile and I hold it to the fakes
Hard boot slammed to the ground so I see what shakes
And I kill 'em with kindness

I kill 'em with kindness
Ain't no doormats here

It doesn't mean you have to bow, or say "Your Highness"
Just kill 'em with kindness
If you wanna beat the machine, keep your teeth clean
And kill 'em with kindness

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kindness

I guess you cannot tell from my tone, I mean ba-ba-business and I ain't on my own
I'm guessing it is hard for you to see, that-that-that-that empathy will cut down your throne
Don't you mind people grinning in your face, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, said the champ to the chase
Woo
'Cause we're killing 'em with kindness (kill 'em with kindness)

Your hum-drum, sarky slow lines don't bother me none
"Wa-wa-wa, woo-woo-woo" said the flower to the sun
Our love-locked congregation gift will get you slapped
"Gna na na na na gnaw", said the beaver to the dam

'Cause we're killing with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
We'll kill 'em with kindness

Woo!
Ay ya ya ya ya ya ya ya there ain't no doormats here
Shake!Embed
