A Hymn Lyrics
I wanna be loved
Everybody does
I find shame in the crack-like corpse un-cadaver reign
I wanna be loved
Everybody does
I find shame in a bag gripped tight like your withering fame
We made it
Shame

Hot Zumba classes at the new church
I lost ten pounds for the wedding
I played happy 'til my teeth hurt
Sofa surfer extraordinaire
Lambert’s ash in my falling hair, yeh

I wanna be loved
Everybody does
I find shame cuts rips real nice as we change lanes
We made it
I wanna be loved
Everybody does
We made it
We made it
Shame
Teletext has a place in my heart
Ten percent discount, I’ll show you how
Gregory’s birthday in a placid town, wow
Janine held the flag with white knuckles
I’m burning the Astra 'til the wheels buckle, yeh

I wanna be loved
Everybody does
Shame
