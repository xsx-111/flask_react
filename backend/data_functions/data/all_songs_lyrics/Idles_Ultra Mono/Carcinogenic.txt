Carcinogenic Lyrics
Working people down to the bone on their knees
9-to-5 every day of the week is...
Carcinogenic (carcinogenic)
Getting minimum wage, while your boss takes a raise
As he lies through his brand new teeth, he is...
Carcinogenic (carcinogenic)
Over-working, working nurses and teachers
Whilst you preach austerity is...
Carcinogenic (carcinogenic)

You only die once
You'll never come back
You’re gone when you're gone
So, love what you can
You only die once
You'll never come back
You’re gone when you're gone
So, love what you can

Cramming people into high-rises, while selling their welfare for low prices
Public spending gets big slices, while ignoring the true crisis
Where were you when the ship sank?
Probably not queuing for food banks
Probably waving your Union Jack
Probably rallying for new tanks
Probably to blow up the ice caps
Because the lunatics have taken over the asylum
Ah-ahhh
You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can
You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can

Methamphetamine, crack and heroin and living a life on tick is...
Carcinogenic!
Ten pints of G, Mad Dog 20-20, two pints of Bucky and some bouzi oozi is...
Carcinogenic!
Class division and bear-baiting on television for better ratings is...

You only die once
You’ll never come back
You’re gone when you're gone
So, love what you can
You only die once
You’ll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you canEmbed
