Grounds Lyrics
You will not catch me starin' at the sun
Not suckin’ on a Dum Dum, not turnin' 'round to run
No hallelujahs, and no kingdom comes
So you will not catch me starin’ at the sun

Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers

Fee-fee-fie-fie-fo-fo-fum
I smell the blood of a million sons
A million daughters from a hundred thousand guns
Not taught by our teachers on our curriculum

Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers

I am I
Unify

(Hey)
Not a single thing has ever been mended
By you standin' there and saying you're offended
Go ahead, tell them what I've intended
I'll say what I mean, do what I love, and fucking send it
Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers

There’s nothing brave and nothing useful
You scrawlin’ your aggro shit on the walls of the cubicle
Sayin' my race and class ain’t suitable
So I raise my pink fist and say black is beautiful

Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers

I am I
Unify
I am I
Unify, unify, unify

Do you hear that thunder?2Embed
