Danke Lyrics
Hey! Ha Hey!
Hey! Ha Hey!
Hey! Ha Hey!
Hey!

True love will find you in the end
You will find out just who was your friend
True love will find you in the end
(Hey! Ha Hey! Hey! Ha Hey!)
You'll find out just who was your friend
(Hey! Ha Hey! Hey! Ha Hey!)

I'll be your hammer
I'll be your nail
I'll be the house that allows you to fail
I'll be your hammer (Hey! Ha Hey!)
I'll be your nail (Hey! Ha Hey!)
I'll be the house that allows you to fail (Hey! Ha Hey! Hey! Ha Hey!)
I'll be your hammer (Hey! Ha Hey!)
I'll be your nail (Hey! Ha Hey!)
I'll be the house that allows you to fail (Hey! Ha Hey! Hey! Ha Hey!)
I am IEmbed
