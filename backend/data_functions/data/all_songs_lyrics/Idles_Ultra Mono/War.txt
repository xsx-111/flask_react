War Lyrics
Wa-ching
That's the sound of the sword goin' in
Clack-clack, clack-a-clang clang
That's the sound of the gun goin' bang-bang
Tukka-tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk-tukka
That's the sound of the drone button pusher
Shh, shh, shh
That's the sound of the children tooker
Ahh (Ahh), ahh (Ahh)
Ahhh (Ahh), ahh (Ahh)

This means war, anti-war
War
This means war, anti-war
Anti-war

Send Sally to the sandbox, baby
Send Johnny into open fire
Send Sally to the sandbox, baby
We're gunnin' for the stone-faced liars
Send Johnny to the sandbox, baby
Send Sally into open fire
Send Johnny to the sandbox, baby
We're dyin' for the stone-faced liars
And we're all going straight to hell2Embed
