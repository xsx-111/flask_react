Come to Daddy (Pappy Mix) Lyrics
I want your soul
I will eat your soul
I want your soul
I will eat your soul
I want your soul
I will eat your soul
I want your soul
I will eat your soul

Come to daddy, come to daddy
Come to daddy, come to daddy
Come to daddy, come to daddy
Come to daddy, come to mummy!

I want your soul
I will eat your soul
I want your soul
I will eat your soul
I want your soul
I will eat your soul
I want your soul
I will eat your soul
The flowers that bloom in the warmth of the sun
Are there to be loved by everyone

I want your soul5Embed
