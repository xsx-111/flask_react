Come to Daddy (Little Lord Faulteroy Mix) Lyrics
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy

Watching the water flow past in the canal
Watching the water flow past in the canal
Watching the water flow past in the canal
Watching the water flow past in the canal

Looking at the swans and hearing the birds singing
Looking at the swans and hearing the birds singing
Looking at the swans and hearing the birds singing
Looking at the swans and hearing the birds singing
Looking at the swans and hearing the birds singing

Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boy
Oh, you dirty little boy, dirty little boyEmbed
