The Only Way Lyrics
Calm down now baby
The end of the journey's in sight
You've traveled so far love
Now all of the stars are aligned

Say goodbye (I don't want to, I don't want to)
Don't you fight (I don't want to, I don't want to)
Leaving your life's no easy ride

All the grief you gave
All the love you made
All your yesterdays
Everything you were
Will fade
This is the only way (This is the only way)

Calm down now baby
The end of the journey's in sight
You've traveled so far love
Now all of the stars are aligned

All the things you thought you came here for
Everything you thought you knew for sure
No meandering, no more wondering
Everything is true
All the things you thought you had to say
Everyone you left along the way
So you gather how nothing matters now
That your time is through
Say goodbye (I don't want to, I don't want to)
Don't you fight (I don't want to, I don't want to)
Leaving your life's no easy ride

This is the only way (This is the only way)
This is the only way (This is the only way)
This is the only way (This is the only way)
This is the only way (This is the only way)
This is the only way
This is the only way
This is the only way
This is the only wayEmbed
