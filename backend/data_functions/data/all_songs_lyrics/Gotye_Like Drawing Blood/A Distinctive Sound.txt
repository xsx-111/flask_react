A Distinctive Sound LyricsThis will teach them how to groove
All right, let's get aquatinted
(hello there)
Music from the bass perspective
This is a journey into sound
A journey which along the way will to bring you
New color, new diminution, new values
And a new experience - stereophonic sound
(and now ladies and gentlemen, our feature act tonight)
(Stop!)
(Get it, get it, get it!)
Come on, Come on, Come on
That was the harpsichord
Now-a-days, most homes seem to prefer
The television or radio, to the harpsichord
But you still hear the piano, all the time
A flute couldn't do that
These are some of the difficulties
With being in this position and talking to you
And just wanting really deeply to relate to you
And touch you - not physically - but with vibration
(ha ha ha ha)
Never heard metal sound like that before
The drummer is the heartbeat
Everything comes from him
He is the beat, the time, the heartbeat
It's just like a heart pumping blood
To the rest of the body
He is the heartbeat of a band, a group
He is the heartbeat
I think around midpoint in my career
I started to experiment with sounds
And then it became very important to
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Maybe if I spend more time practicing
Eventually I can get it together
Um - here's some more music
All right! Here we go!
Now were going to use a little power kicks
Like I showed you before
We're going to chuck-em real good
A-minor to F
Just like all the heavy metal guys use, okay
Lets get some of that smoke just like on MTV
Yeah! all right!
Music - all right
Yeah! all right!
Would you say that again
Yeah! all right!
Let's play a note
Yeah! all right!
Here's some more music
Yeah! all right!
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
We've covered a lot of ground, haven't we?
If there's a part of our story you don't understand
Why don't you turn this record over
And start playing over again
Over again
