Thanks for Your Time Lyrics
You have been placed in a queue
But your call is valuable, it's very valuable
We hope this does not inconvenience you
(Because you're valuable, you're so very valuable!)

If you wish to make a complaint
We can handle it, we're well prepared to handle it
Of course you may have to wait
But that's understandable, isn't that understandable?

Don't ask me, I just work here man
Don't ask me, I just work here man
Don't ask me, I just work here man (Work here man)

It sounds to me like you need help!
We're very good to you
I hope you know we're good to you
Let me put you through to someone else
They'll know just what to do!
Me, I'm sorry, I can't help you

Don't ask me, I just work here man
Don't ask me, I just work here man
Don't ask me, I just work here man
Don't ask me, I just work here man (Work here man)
Don't ask me, I just work here man
Don't ask me, I just work here man
Oh, don't ask me, I just work here man (I just work here man)
Directory assistance
Hi, could I please speak to Miss
What name please?
Oh, shit
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that
Just put me through
I'm sorry, yes or no, did you request Melbourne Zoo?
No, you bitch!
Please hold, and an operator will complete your request
****

Why don't you fill out a form?
We can't get back to you
Of course we can't get back to you
But rest assured, we'll take your comments on board
Your thoughts make change!

Thanks for your time
