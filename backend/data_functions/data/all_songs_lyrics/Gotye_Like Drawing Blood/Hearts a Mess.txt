Hearts a Mess Lyrics
Pick apart the pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind as you do mine

You have lost too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust, it's not enough
You just threw away the key to your heart
You don't get burned 'cause nothing gets through
It makes it easier, easier on you
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see

Love ain't fair
So there you are, my love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense, but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense, but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense, but I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Love ain't safe, you won't get hurt if you stay chaste
So you can wait, but I don't wanna waste my love21Embed
