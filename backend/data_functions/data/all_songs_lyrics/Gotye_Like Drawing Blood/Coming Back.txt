Coming Back Lyrics
You've been gone much longer than you
Ever said you had the plan to
I'm just gonna wait 'til you come home

Though I count the days, they're grey without you
The weather's much better when I think about you
I'm just gonna wait 'til you come home


Empty glasses, burnt out matches
Curtains drawn on near-full blackness
I'm sleeping through the day you're coming home
To reclaim this heart you owned

Lover, leave me
Make me burn
You're coming back!
You're coming back!
I'll wait patiently
For your return
You're coming back!
You're coming back!
I'm clutching at straws
I'm climbing up the walls
But every time I fall
Back into my hole
I'm feeling like a wretch
I'm looking for a catch
But you're an itch that I can't scratch
I know you're coming back

You've been gone so long you're fading
And it takes all the time I can find just retaining
Thoughts of things we did while you were here
But I know you will return my dear

La composition

Lover, leave me
Make me burn
You're coming back!
You're coming back!
I'll wait patiently
For your return
You're coming back!
You're coming back!
I'm clutching at straws
(You've been gone much longer than you)
I'm climbing up the walls
(Ever said you had the plan to)
But every time I fall
(I'm just gonna wait 'til you come home)
Back into my hole
I'm feeling like a wretch
(Though I count the days, they're grey without you)
I'm looking for a catch
(The weather's much better when I think about you)
But you're an itch that I can't scratch
(I'm just gonna wait 'til you come home)
I know you're coming back

You're coming back!
Oh, you're coming back!Embed
