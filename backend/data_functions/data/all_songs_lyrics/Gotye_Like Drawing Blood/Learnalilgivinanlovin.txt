Learnalilgivinanlovin Lyrics
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

If you always tryin' to get to the top
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'
Then you gone before you know it;
You'd better stop! (STOP!)
Learn a little givin' and lovin'

It's been done before (Ooh ooh)
C'mon, do it again! (Whoa, do it again)
'Cause if it's good (Ooh ooh)
Then you should share it round (Whoa)
What's the use of keeping (Whoa)
All the good things that you've found
To yourself?

Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
You don't gotta keep no other man down
For you to get up
There's no need to worry
Just don't give away your self-respect
'cause if it's all you've got left
The rest don't really matter now anyway honey

Give away love (Love, give it!)
Give it for free (Ooh ooh)
No strings attached (whoa)
Just don't ask for it back (Ooh whoa whoa)

Learn a little, learn a little (ooh ooh whoa)
Learn a little givin' (ooh ooh whoa)
Learn a little, learn a little (ooh ooh whoa)
Learn a little givin' and (ooh ooh whoa)
STOP!

Givin'! Learn a little givin' (givin'!)
It's been done before
C'mon do it again!
(Learn a little, learn a little)
(Learn a little givin' and lovin')Embed
