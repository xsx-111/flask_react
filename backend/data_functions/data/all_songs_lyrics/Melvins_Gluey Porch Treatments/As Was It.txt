As Was It Lyrics
Twist
You're holy opposition
Twist
The twisted parts and pieces
This
I guess you'd better think it God
You knew that, easy as it was

Come on
Give me somethin' special, somethin' I need
Drain vagina circle
Lay low
Never prove your power
Say so
So I can hear your words

Peel the skin away from my eyes
And look in
See all the things that you put away
But you rolled inside

Listen to me
'Cause I can hardly
Exist
Without your little
Pussy
Bring your holy water
I know that you will let me know
Aah, Ah-oh-aah, Ah-oh-Aah, Ah-oh...AahEmbed
