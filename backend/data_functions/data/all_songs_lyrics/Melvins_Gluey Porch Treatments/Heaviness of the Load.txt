Heaviness of the Load LyricsYou're little heavy
Of your droppin' down load
You're thinkin' of your influence
But with a right to unload
Cuz you're ready for your tenure
And the droppin' down disease
There's somethin' in your influence
Take the right to unleash
Your whistle rolly
Sneakin' up behind me
But goin' lots o' lonely
But never gonna know it
You're the one that takes it to theEmbed
