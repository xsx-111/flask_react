Iron Lyrics
I love the way I feel
Streets replaced with fields
Wide awake in here, you shine
I ran away from goals
Left you in the cold
Nothing's in our way tonight

You know that you'll never be replaced
And everyone here made the same mistakes as me
And either way, our time won't go to waste
Ourï»¿ hearts will never be the same again
Our hearts will never be the same again


Our hearts will never be the same againEmbed
