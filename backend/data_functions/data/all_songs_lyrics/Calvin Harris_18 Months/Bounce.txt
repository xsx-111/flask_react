Bounce Lyrics
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce

I can't believe it, every day and every night (Bounce)
Is gettin' better with you out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked a switch, and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes, I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means?


Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

Bounce
Bounce
Bounce

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that
