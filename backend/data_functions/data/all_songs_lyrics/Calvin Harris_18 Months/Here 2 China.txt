Here 2 China Lyrics
Yeah (Getting it in from here to China)
Yo
Aight, let me just kill this right now, quickly

Super trippy, riding through the gritty inner city
Roll with the committee, handle your business or handle the pity
All I see is arse and titties
And a bunch of hippie chicks that's ready to show me tricks
They're doing the splits, I'm all up in the mix
A choir out the mist, I'm taking trips
I'm in a Ferrari looking sick
I'm in a Ferrari looking slick and letting the engine rip
And gettin' the tyre a-grippin', a-slippin' and slidin'
Turning the music up, I'm vibing
Now I'm flying, Lord, strike me if I'm lying
I ain't perfect, but I'm trying
Going Super Saiyan, buying anything that catches my eye
'Cause I'm a provider, getting it in from here to China
It's so minor, I'm a survivor, never retire
I'm a black tiger, I'm ready to blaze the fire, live wire
Now I'm rolling through the shires
Blazing the green to get me higher
Now I'm inspired, putting the pressure on the back tyres
Making a hasty get away
Having a better day in every way than yesterday
I guess thereâ€™s nothing left to say
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)

Yo, yo
Wind in my face, chilling in Versace shades
Wearing a fresh pair of gaze, looking like I've just been paid
Stupid, I don't play no games, switching out lanes on these lames
Switching out dames, simple and plain, no, I can't be contained
Plus, I'm raw and untamed, I'm so far from mundane
Getting ghost is my aim, I suggest you do the same
Taking a trip out to Spain with my girl Mary Jane
And she stays on my brain, life's a big gravy train
Paparazzi on my case, giving chase
Cameras flashing in my face
All up in my space, gotta pick up the pace
Singing Amazing Grace
I'm in an amazing place with crazy peeps
I ain't like them other lazy apes, I used to blaze the tapes
So now I stay, hoping for my break, making no mistakes
Now I'm rolling with the breaks
But still book time for my original mates
So we don't bubble with hate, we just get on with it
You brothers are constipated and your shit is overrated
You should save it
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)2Embed
