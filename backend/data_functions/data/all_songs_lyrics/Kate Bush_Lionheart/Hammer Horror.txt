Hammer Horror Lyrics
You stood in the belltower
But now you're gone
So who knows all the sights
Of Notre Dame?

They've got the stars for the gallant hearts
I'm the replacement for your part
But all I want to do is forget
You, friend

Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
The first time in my life
I keep the lights on to ease my soul
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?

Rehearsing in your things
I feel guilty
And retracing all the scenes
Of your big hit
Oh, God, you needed the leading role
It wasn't me who made you go, though
Now all I want to do is forget
You, friend

Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
The first time in my life
I keep the lights on to ease my soul
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?


Who calls me from the other side
Of the street?
And who taps me on the shoulder?
I turn around, but you're gone

I've got a hunch that you're following
To get your own back on me
All I want to do is forget
You, friend
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
The first time in my life
I keep the lights on to ease my soul
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?2Embed
