Coffee Homeground Lyrics
Down in the cellar
You're getting into making poison
You slipped some on the side
Into my glass of wine
And I don't want any coffee homeground

Offer me a chocolate
No thank you, spoil my diet, know your game!
But tell me just how come
They smell of bitter almonds?
It's a no-no to your coffee homeground

Pictures of Crippen
Lipstick-smeared
Torn wallpaper
Have the walls got ears here?

Well, you won't get me with your Belladonna (In the coffee)
And you won't get me with your arsenic (In the pot of tea)
And you won't get me in a hole to rot (With your hemlock)
On the rocks
Where are the plumbers
Who went a-missing here on Monday?
There was a tall man
With his companion
And I bet you gave them coffee homeground

Maybe you're lonely
And only want a little company
But keep your recipes
For the rats to eat
And may they rest in peace with coffee homeground

Pictures of Crippen
Lipstick-smeared
Torn wallpaper
Have the walls got ears here?

Well, you won't get me with your Belladonna (In the coffee)
And you won't get me with your arsenic (In the pot of tea)
And you won't put me in a six foot plot (With your hemlock)
On the rocks
With your hemlock on the rocks
"Noch ein Glas, mein Liebchen"
With your hemlock on the rocks
With your hemlock on the rocks
"Es schmeckt wunderbar!"
With your hemlock on the rocks
"Es schmeckt wunderbar!"
With your hemlock on the rocks
With your hemlock on the rocks
With your hemlock on the rocks
With your hemlock on the rocks2Embed
