Oh England My Lionheart Lyrics
Oh, England, my lionheart
I'm in your garden fading fast in your arms
The soldiers soften, the war is over
The air-raid shelters are blooming clover
Flapping umbrellas fill the lanes
My London Bridge in rain again

Oh, England, my lionheart
Peter Pan steals the kids in Kensington Park
You read me Shakespeare on the Rolling Thames
That Old River Poet that never ever ends
Our thumping hearts hold the ravens in
Keep the Tower from tumbling

Oh, England, my lionheart
Oh, England, my lionheart
Oh, England, my lionheart
I don't want to go

Oh, England, my lionheart
Dropped from my black spitfire to my funeral barge
Give me one kiss in appleblossom
Give me one wish and I'd be wassailing
In the orchard my English Rose
Or with my shepherd who'll bring me home
Oh, England, my lionheart
Oh, England, my lionheart
Oh, England, my lionheart
Oh, England, my lionheart
Oh, England, my lionheart
I don't want to go3Embed
