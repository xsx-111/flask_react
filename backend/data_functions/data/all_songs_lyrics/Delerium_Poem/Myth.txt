Myth LyricsIt's a weird game
I'm lonely without skin
No end to begin and only
Your mind to hide in
I nudge life
Like an unborn child. a dream
Inside but now I live behind your eyes
I'm uninvited. and I'm only
A memory that comes through
I'm living in your dreams
I'm where you cannot be
I'm way out of your reach
I'm living in your dreams
I'm where you cannot see
Is it you or is it me?
I can't protect what you can't forget
But now I live behind your eyes
You recognize me as only a memory
That comes through
I'm living in your dreams
I'm where you cannot go
Beyond everything you know
I'm living in your dreams
You won't find me anywhere
I've vanished in the airEmbed
