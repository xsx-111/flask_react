Aria LyricsI have wist, sin I couthe meen
That children hath by candle light
I have wist, sin I couthe meen
That children hath by candle light
Her shadewe on the wal iseen
And ronne therafter all the night
Bisy aboute they han they han ben
And whom they catchen it best wolde wene
I have wist, sin I couthe meen
That children hath by candle light
The shadewe catchen they ne might
For no lines that they couthe lay
This shadewe I may likne aright
To this world and yesterday
Bisy aboute they han they han ben
And whom they catchen it best wolde wene
I have wist, sin I couthe meen
That children hath by candle light
Her shadewe on the wal iseen
And ronne therafter all the night
Bisy aboute they han they han ben
And whom they catchen it best wolde wene
Bisy aboute they han they han ben
And whom they catchen it best wolde weneEmbed
