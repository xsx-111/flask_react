Inner Sanctum LyricsInfinity... infinity?
Sky cold, skin blue, when I wake
So swim into essential, you've swam a thousand voids
Why is eternity forever? Why is eternity forever?
Skin screams bear me again, inner sanctum?
We watch from dry land
While waves destroy our theories
So swim into essential, you've swam a thousand voids
Why is eternity forever? the horizon deceives
Some say 'their ships above sea' sailing on winds of belief
Why waves destroy our theories bear me again
Sky cold, skin blue, when I wake to worship water
Sky cold, skin blue, when I wake, infinity waving
Sky cold, skin blue, when I wake, infinity wavingEmbed
