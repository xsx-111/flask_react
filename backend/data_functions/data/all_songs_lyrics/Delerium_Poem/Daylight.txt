Daylight LyricsIf you can believe you're turning all the world that broke your mind
Then I can do something for you even though you're lost in time
You won't have to be my heaven. I won't have to be your friend
Daylight, daylight comes every time it's calling
Daylight, daylight it goes away again now
Don't let go don't let go of your heart
Don't let go don't let go of your heart
Feel like your skin is burning into many drops of rain
But it's doing nothing to me drowning in a sea of pain
You won't have to be my heaven. I won't have to be your friend
Daylight, daylight comes every time it's calling
Daylight, daylight it goes away again now
Don't let go don't let go of your heart
Don't let go don't you know who you are
Don't let go don't let go of your heart
Don't let go don't let go of your heartEmbed
