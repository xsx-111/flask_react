Innocente LyricsYou can't see my eyes
You can't see my eyes
They don't see yours
Hear me when I say
I don't mind at all
It's the rain that I hear coming
Not a stranger or a ghost
It's the quiet of a storm approaching
That I fear the most
It's the pain that I hear coming
The slightest crystal tear, drops to the ground
In silence, when my love is near
Darling, when did you fall? When was it over?
Darling when? When did you fall? When was it over?
It's marching through my door now
The stony cold of lonesome
A bell tolls for my heart and then my lonesome song begins
It's marching through my door now
The stony cold of lonesome
A bell tolls for my heart and now my lonesome song begins
Darling, when did you cry? I couldn't hear you
Darling when? When did you cry? I couldn't hear you
I suppose it is the price of falling in love
I suppose it is the price of falling in love
It's the rain that I hear coming
Not a stranger, not a ghost
Of the quiet of a storm approaching
That I fear the most
It's the pain that I hear coming
The slightest crystal tear drops to the ground
In silence when my love is near
It's marching through my door now the stony cold of lonesome
A bell tolls for my heart and now my lonesome song will end
Darling when did we fall? When was it over?
Darling when? When did we fall? When was it over?
I suppose it is the price of falling in love
I fear that it's the price of falling in loveEmbed
