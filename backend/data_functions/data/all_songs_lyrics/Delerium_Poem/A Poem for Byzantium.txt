A Poem for Byzantium LyricsUnbidden shadows of you formed yesterday
I ran away to a room here on the bay
Interrupted life again, another new beginning
Where the silence echoes you're no longer with me
Here and now, I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone, but that's okay
Through the darkness I would walk in the streets
Confessions never seemed to provide me with a release
Held me down and tried to cure me, tried to give me reason
But nothing could separate this burdened mind from me
Here and now, I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone, but that's okay
And looking out to a different sky will disengage me
Absence is never the answer, I know, but it serves as my shade
I do not seek and do not intend to find
A calmer ocean or a sun that will never rise
My world will never change and time will bring you to my thoughts
And I'll move on and then forget you all over again
Moving on, I can forgive you all over again
Here and now, I feel that I'm embracing freedom
Even though I may be alone, but that's okay
And looking out onto a different sky, it seems so easy
Absence is never the answer, I know, but it serves as my shadeEmbed
