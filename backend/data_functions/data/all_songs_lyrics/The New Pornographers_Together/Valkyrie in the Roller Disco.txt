Valkyrie in the Roller Disco Lyrics
Bounce off the walls
Valentine, have your fun
C'mon, be the one
C'mon, be the one
Light up the floor
With your moves, valentine
C'mon, be the one
C'mon, be the one

Do your worst, worst, worst
Do your worst, worst, worst

Valkyrie, don't go home
It's not right, not right
Leave with the lights up
It's half for me, half for love
You're a goldmine, goldmine

Stand in the puddles
Of the disco ball's glow
C'mon, be the one
C'mon, be the one
There, just like that
There, you're doing it again
C'mon, be the one
C'mon, be the one

And what's worse, worse, worse?
There's no words, words, words

Valkyrie, don't go home
It's not right, not right
Leave with the lights up
It's half for you, half for love
You're a goldmine, goldmine


Valkyrie, don't go home
It's not right, not right
Leave with the lights up
It's half for me, half for love
You're a goldmine, goldmine
You're a goldmine, goldmineEmbed
