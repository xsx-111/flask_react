Silver Jenny Dollar Lyrics
She was only ever passing through
She's only ever passing through
Cartilage and Sinew
Was the name of her act

And it's true
To love her
Is all I can do
In a world that's beaten everything
Black and blue

They holler
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar

We're only ever passing through
We were only ever passing through
Cartilage and Sinew
Was the name of her act

And it's true you noticed
It's all I can do
In a world that's beaten everything
Black and blue
They holler
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar

The winter's over
The war is over
A parcel of land
Men are scum, it's true
They'll love you

Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
Silver Jenny Dollar
