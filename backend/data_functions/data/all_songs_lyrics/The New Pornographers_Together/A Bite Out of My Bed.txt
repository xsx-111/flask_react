A Bite Out of My Bed Lyrics
You live by another set of rules
A 747 just left with you
And now early every morning I come to
Somebody took a bite out of my bed - you

Well if it ever gets weird
Whenever Jane meets John Doe
You miss my meaning
And I miss my mark

(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
Oh my heart
(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
Oh my heart

I must have brought the weather back with me
Soaked us 'til we're see-through and dripping
Now early every morning I come to
Somebody took a bite out of my bed - you
Well if it ever gets weird
Whenever Jane meets John Doe
You miss my meaning
And I miss my mark

(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
Oh my heart
(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
(Oh my lover)
Oh my darling
Oh my heartEmbed
