Sweet Talk, Sweet Talk Lyrics
A mistake on the part of nature
You're so fabled, so fair, just sit anywhere
I've pencil sketched the scene
It's feeling Byzantine
Mistakes on the part of nature
The living proof of what they're calling love
On certain sideway streets
Where things that don't match meet

A mistake on the part of nature
You are a tall glass, a blast from the past
Yeah, things were simpler then
You ask, exactly when
A mistake on the part of nature
It's forgiven, moved on
Won't wear my Sunday suit to walk that street
That would feel Byzantine

Silhouette, tell me a tall tale, go
Shout it out
Silhouette, shout it from the top
Sweet talk, sweet talk
Your sweet talk, sweet talk
Amnesia becomes ambition
Ambition becomes a new sort of
Charming simplicity
Like always, Byzantine
A mistake on the part of nature
It's forgiven, move on
Won't wear my Sunday suit to walk that street
That would feel Byzantine

Silhouette, tell me a tall tale, go
Shout it out
Silhouette, shout it from the top
Sweet talk, sweet talk
Your sweet talk, sweet talk
Silhouette, tell me a tall tale, go
Shout it out
Silhouette, shout it from the top
Sweet talk, sweet talk
Your sweet talk, sweet talkEmbed
