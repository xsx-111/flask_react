Daughters of Sorrow Lyrics
You are the daughters of sorrow
And somehow I just know
I'm gonna have to hang around you

(Bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)

We walk through the world
As if by starlight
We've been alright
We'll kick 'em

(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)


You are the daughters of sorrow
And somehow I just know
And somehow I just knew!
(Bom bom bah)
Somehow I just knew
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
Somehow I just knew
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
And somehow I just knew
(Bom bom bom bom bah)

Bom bom bom bom bah
Bom bom bom bom bah
Bom bom bom bom bah
Bom bom bom bom bahEmbed
