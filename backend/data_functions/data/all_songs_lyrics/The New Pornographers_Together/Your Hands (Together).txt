Your Hands (Together) Lyrics
Put-put-put your hands together for the silver bullet make me
Put-put-put your heads together for the cause and cure we're waiting
Digging through and past the center of the earth go straight
Play the scientist and vandal sweating either way

Put-put-put your hands together for the silver bullet make me
Put the voice of the idol maker rising definite and shaking
Pick your gift for accident for wrapped it in skintight
Pull the strings that make this thing, you pushed with all your might

Crude plays they used to stage (oh my)
You've saved the best for later (oh my)
Crude plays, and yet they made you (mine, mine)
(You're mine, mine)
(All mine, mine, all mine)

Put-put-put your hands together for the silver bullet make me
Put-put-put your hands together for the future perfect waiting
You can only cover so much territory of course
Belting carols at the sun about the things you've lost

Put-put-put your hands together for the cause and cure is calling
Put-put-put your hands together for the silver bullet falling
Digging through and past the center of the earth go straight
Play the scientist and vandal sweating either way
Crude plays they used to stage (oh my)
You've saved the best for later (oh my)
Crude plays, and yet they made you (mine, mine)
(You're mine, mine)
(All mine, mine, all mine)
Crude plays they used to stage (oh my)
You've saved the best for later (oh my)
Crude plays, and yet they made you (mine, mine)
(You're mine, mine)
(All mine, mine, all mine)
(All mine, all mine, all mine)Embed
