Crash Years Lyrics
The skirts go up before the war
Among the madding crowds
They're ruined, like the rest of us, ruined
Rest of us, ruined
You are a living doll riding the circle tracks
Behind the walls of clocks
And you're ruined, like the rest of us, ruined
Rest of us, ruined

Traffic was slow for the crash years
There's no other show like it 'round here
As a rule
Windows were rolled for the crash years
There's no other show like it 'round here
As a rule

Light a candle's end, you are a light turned low
And like the rest of us
You got those old eternity blues
Eternity blues
Your fingers raised, you're looking for the word
What you want is 'accident'
Another drab spectacular view
Of what you can lose

Traffic was slow for the crash years
There's no other show like it 'round here
As a rule
Windows were closed in the crash years
Honey child, you're not safe here
As a rule


Traffic was slow for the crash years
There's no other show like it 'round here
As a rule
Windows were rolled for the crash years
There's no other show like it 'round here
As a rule

The ruins were wild
The ruins were wild
Tonight will be an open mic
The ruins were wild
The ruins were wild
Tonight will be an open mic
The ruins were wild
The ruins were wild
Tonight will be an open mic
The ruins were wild
The ruins were wild
Tonight will be an open mic
The ruins were wild
The ruins were wild
Tonight will be an open micEmbed
