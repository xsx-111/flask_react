Up in the Dark Lyrics
It's no secret why we're here
You can't keep me from it
In another moonless minute it's open wide
You hide secrets from them
You hide secrets but they're spent
All that kept the lights on when the power went

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
But what turns up in the dark?
What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
But what turns up in the dark?
What turns up in the dark
What turns up in the dark

You can't see clear in it
It gets weaker, watch it go
Wrap yourself around me in the shadow show
You had secrets, told them
They were the weakest ones we'd heard
Only when the lights were killed they sang like birds

What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
But what turns up in the dark?
What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
But what turns up in the dark?
What turns up in the dark
What turns up in the dark


What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
But what turns up in the dark?
What's love?
What's love?
What's love?
But what turns up in the dark?
What turns up in the dark
What turns up in the dark
What turns up in the darkEmbed
