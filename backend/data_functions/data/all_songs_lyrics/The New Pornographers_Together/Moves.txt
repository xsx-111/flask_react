Moves Lyrics
I believe you've had something that's mine
All this time
Slow to singalong crawl
Fork it over
I live among the alarms
Where I trip, where they sing
Slow to singalong crawl
Hey, come over
Uh uh uh uh uh oh

Up the hill goes the typewriter-ed beat
Of my step
Slow to singalong crawl
Undiscovered
And all the years at quarter speed
Haloed and trembling clean
Slow to singalong crawl
Turning over
Uh uh uh uh uh oh

Slow down ladies
Slow down
These things get louder
These things get louder
The live alarms and your true villain love
Are kept at bay
Slow to singalong crawl
Like you wrote this
Will the beams be broke and crossed
Motion sensed - it's all heat
Slow to singalong crawl
It's not over
Uh uh uh uh uh oh

Slow down ladies
Slow down
These things get louder
These things get louder

Slow to singalong crawl
Slow to singalong crawl
You with all your moves
You with all your moves
You with all your moves
You with all your moves
You with all your moves
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh oh
Oh oh uh uh oh ohEmbed
