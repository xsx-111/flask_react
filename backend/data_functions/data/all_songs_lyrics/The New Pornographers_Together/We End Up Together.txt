We End Up Together Lyrics
When you gonna do some damage, little brother?
Now that half your life is over, if you're lucky
Looking at the trends of men down through your family
Boom there go the treetops
Once more 'round the sun drop
Just in case you were not listening
I'm for damage
Sweet damage
Oh damage
Sweet damage
Oh damage

Come on tell us what we've won
Little brother's doing well
With his cave paintings selling
To the bandits and their brides
Little brother, you're inside
You're a natural we joke
In the early ABCs
Little brother couldn't see
Crossed his eyes once again
He thought you were in love
He's just glad to be free
To have come so highly recommended
Oh-uh-uh-oh
Oh-uh-uh-oh

And you looked
Oh like you were saying something
And you looked
Like you were saying something

With this slight victory
Little brother took the keys
To the city which he found
On the floor of his van
Little brother clapping hands
For the turn of events unexpected

Oh-uh-uh-oh
Oh-uh-uh-oh

And you looked
Oh like you were saying something
And you looked
Like you were saying something

Introductions have been made
Little brother I'm convinced
Yet again blew her off
She thought she'd stick it out
Little brother wished her well
The best wishes on both ends extended

Oh-uh-uh-oh
Oh-uh-uh-oh

And you looked
Oh like you were saying something
And you looked
Like you were saying something
