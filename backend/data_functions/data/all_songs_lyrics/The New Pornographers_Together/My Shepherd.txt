My Shepherd Lyrics
Glass-work shards decorate this house
We're tossing lost arts out windows
The splash and jangle of a secret science
Defined, you claimed, "Some golden age is upon us!"

You always love short story form
The science behind it, the hidden laws
You live for flame when the attraction's new
A lever's pulled from a secret room

Closed-eyed stare into morning sun
When the dots form into connection
If I'm honest, you come to mind but baby I'm not
If I'm honest, you come to mind but baby I'm not

The ink pot's polished into working script
We stare in wonder at the steps we skipped
Tripping wires we have so carefully crossed
The science behind it at a perfect loss

You're my lord, you're my shepherd
Careful kid, no one gets hurt
You made me
You're my lord, you're my shepherd
Careful kid, no one gets hurt
You made me

Used up all of the French we took
The science behind it was a dirty look
Ce joue pas de rock 'n roll
Ce joue pas de rock 'n roll pour moi

You're my lord, you're my shepherd
Careful kid, no one gets hurt
You made me
You're my lord, you're my shepherd
Careful kid, no one gets hurt
You made me


You're my lord, you're my shepherd
Careful kid, no one gets hurt
You made me
You're my lord, you're my shepherd
Careful kid, no one gets hurt
You made me this way
