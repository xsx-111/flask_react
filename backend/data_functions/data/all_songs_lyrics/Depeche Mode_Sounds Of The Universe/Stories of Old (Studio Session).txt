Stories of Old (Studio Session) Lyrics
What's a next one, boss?
I know, mean...
Next one, Martin,  is this old song, sort it out
Oh?
Yeah, because if you sort it out.. He's right, an old one maybe guys
Yeah
An old ones?
Let's go back to something like Some Great Reward, what's a good track on there?
I've got something here
Hehehe
Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what about Stories of Old?
Hehehe yeah!
What a good idea!
Bring it in
I've found it in in my pocket
Hahehehehehehehe
What?
Let's pick a key, any key, yes Peke?
Ay, hey Martin
Yeah, yeah
Alright, alright
Lay down minor
Like some weep instantly
Hehehehe
You hear stories of old, of princess bold
With riches untold, happy souls
Casting all aside to take some bride
To have the girl of their dreams at their side

But not me, I couldn't do that
Not me, I'm not like that

I couldn't sacrifice anything at all
To love

I really like you, I'm attracted to you
The way you move, the things you do
I'll probably burn in hell for saying this
But I'm really in heaven whenever we kiss

But oh no, you won't change me
You can try for an eternity

I wouldn't sacrifice anything at all
To love
Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect

Now I've got things to do, you have too
And I've got to be me, you've got to be you
So take my hand and feel these lips
And let's savour a kiss like we'd savour a sip

Of vintage wine one more time
Let's surrender to this love divine

But we won't sacrifice anything at all
To love

Very reward
Hahaha
Hehe
That's great
HeEmbed
