Come Back (Studio Session) Lyrics
Come back
(That's it)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Alright then)
(We'll give it a will?)

Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently

Walking a thin white line between love and hate
Wasting all my time in another world
In another place
I could use a little company
A little kindness could go a long way

Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently

A light will always shine in the heart of you
In truth and in reality
Only blindness can hide it away
I could use a little restraint
A little kindness can go a long way

Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
Living the same delusions
Gathering up the fear

Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
...
Alright, good, very good
Really good then
Oh! Wooo!
So right of course
That's fucking oddEmbed
