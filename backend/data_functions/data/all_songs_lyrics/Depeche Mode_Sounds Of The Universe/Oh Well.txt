Oh Well Lyrics
Oh you've got a way about you
Oh I know so much about you
Girl

Life won't be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell

Listen to what she's trying to tell you
She could be the one who's going to save you

Oh well
Oh well


It's nothing to feel ashamed about
Nothing I can complain about
