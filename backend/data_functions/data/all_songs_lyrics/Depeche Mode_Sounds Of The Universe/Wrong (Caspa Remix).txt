Wrong (Caspa Remix) Lyrics
Wrong
Wrong

I was born with the wrong sign in the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road that led to
The wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique

Wrong
Wrong

Wrong
Wrong
Wrong

I was marching to the wrong drum with the wrong scum
Pissing out the wrong energy
Using all the wrong lines and the wrong signs
With the wrong intensity
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book
With the wrong rendition of the wrong look
The wrong moon, every wrong night
With the wrong tune playing till it sounded right, yeah
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong

Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong

I was born with the wrong sign in the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road that led to
The wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique

Wrong
Wrong
