Come Back Lyrics
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently

Walking a thin white line
Between love and hate
Wasting all my time in another world
In another place
I could use a little company
A little kindness can go a long way

Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear

Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently
Light will always shine
In the heart of you
In truth and in reality
Only blindness can hide it away
I could use a little restraint
A little kindness can go a long way

Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
You're living the same delusion
Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear

Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
