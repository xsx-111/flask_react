Corrupt (Studio Session) Lyrics
I could corrupt you
In a heart beat
You think you're so special
Think you're so sweet
What are you trying
Don't even tempt me
And soon you'll be crying
Unwishing you dreamt of be

You'd be calling out my name
When you need someone to blame

I could corrupt you
It would be easy
Watching you suffer
Girl, it would please me
But I wouldn't touch you
With my little finger
I know it would crush you
My memory would linger

You'd be crying out in pain
Begging me to play my games
I could corrupt you
It would be ugly
They could sedate you
But what good would drugs be?
But I wouldn't touch you
Put my hands on your hips
It would be too much to
Place my lips on your lips

You'd be calling out my name
Begging me to play my games

Good
