Jezebel (Demo Version) Lyrics
Jezebel

They call you Jezebel
Whenever we walk in
(Jezebel)
You're going straight to hell
For wanted acts of sin - they say
And that I'll have to pay
But I need you just this way
(Jezebel)

They call you Jezebel
For what you like to wear
You're morally unwell
They say you never care for me
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key
(Jezbel)

Open their eyes to the beauty
Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone
Jezebel

They call you Jezebel
Whenever men walk by
(Jezebel)
They say that they can tell
The longing in your eyes is real
And how you really feel
But they can't see your appeal
