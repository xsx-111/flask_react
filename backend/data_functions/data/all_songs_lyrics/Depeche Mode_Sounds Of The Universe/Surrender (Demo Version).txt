Surrender (Demo Version) Lyrics
Laying on your holy bed by the hallowed door
Feeling like an infidel not worthy of your floor
Tempted by your innocence, beckoned to my fate
I will face the consequence, I wouldn't hesitate

I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture rushing through my veins
Passion flaming in my heart
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah

Shackled like an animal, chained to my desires
Just another sacrifice to love's eternal fire
Tame me with your tenderness and break my brittle heart
Easily and elegantly tear my world apart

I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture rushing through my veins
Passion flaming in my heart
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah

We're living in a world full of illusion
Everything is so unreal
My mind is in a state of confusion
But I can't deny the way I feel
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture rushing through my veins
Passion flaming in my heart
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah

I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture rushing through my veins
Passion flaming in my heart
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah

I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture rushing through my veins
Passion flaming in my heart
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah

I'm a man of flesh and bone...Embed
