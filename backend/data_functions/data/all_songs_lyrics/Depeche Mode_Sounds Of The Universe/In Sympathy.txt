In Sympathy Lyrics
They're almost falling over you
Why don't they call a truce
Whatever they are trying to do
It's of little use
They're drowning you in compliments
Trying to furnish proof
Although they speak with eloquence
There is little truth

You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy


I'm watching your serenity
The way your soul transcends
The tedious absurdities
Your patience never ends
And as the night begins to fade
You're heading for the door
Followed by a sad parade
You're on your own once more
You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy
You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy1Embed
