Corrupt  Lyrics
I wouldn't
I wouldn’t
I wouldn't
I wouldn't
I wouldn’t
I wouldn't
I wouldn't

I could corrupt you
In a heartbeat (I wouldn't)
You think you're so special
Think you're so sweet (I wouldn't)

What are you trying
Don't even tempt me (I wouldn’t)
And soon you’ll be crying
Unwishing you dreamt me (I wouldn't)

You’d be calling out my name (I wouldn't, I wouldn't)
When you need someone to blame (I wouldn't)

(I wouldn’t) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't)
I could corrupt you
It would be easy
Watching you suffer
Girl, it would please me

But I wouldn't touch you
With my little finger
I know it would crush you
My memory would linger

You'd be crying out in pain
Begging me to play my games

Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't) Corrupt you
(I wouldn't)
(I wouldn't)
Corrupt you
Corrupt youEmbed
