Bo Diddley LyricsBo Diddley, Bo Diddley where you've been
I've been to buy me a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
I'm gonna take it to a private eye
But if that private eye can't see
Why he better not take that ring from me
Bo Diddley worked for a nanny goat
To make my baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley bought a bear-a-cat
To make my pretty baby a Sunday hat
Mojo come to my house, a black cat bone
Take my baby all the way from home
Look Bo Duddley where he's been
Well, up to your house and gone again
Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard?
My pretty baby said she was a bird
My pretty baby said she was a bird
My pretty baby said she was a birdEmbed
