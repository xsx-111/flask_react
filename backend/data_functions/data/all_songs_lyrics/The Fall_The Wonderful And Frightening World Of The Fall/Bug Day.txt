Bug Day LyricsFirst off
You've got ze answer
(Misereen) all its skin
Bug day
Bug day
Midges - midges hovered over the heather
3 moths shivered
Green moths shivered
Cockroaches moldered in the ground
Tonguehorns belched fire
So, fleed at sea
Terrors hit water
Minoa said 'eek'
Minoa said 'eek'
Sea reaffirms some things
We learned some things
People behave very wrong
Create company
Green is starboard, back
Left is port, there
Old continental women
Coffee cups poised on front
Facing up to the sea is a very hard thing
Facing up to sea is a v. hard thing
Anything is better than bug day
Bug day
Bug day
Bug day
But day
(mumbles)
Bug day
Anything is better than bug day
Bug day
Bug dayEmbed
