Copped It LyricsSaid I ain't no millionaire
But I spent more money than one ever seen
I'm gonna change that scene one day
It's what you're supposed to say
Hey hey hey hey
Can't get far in land of immovable frogs
Can't get far in home of horrible hoax
And you don't last long on a diet of tea and toast
Hey hey hey
And I'm singing the song cause I copped it baby
I steal what I have
Confessions confessions
Bring detractors
Keeping shtum
Brings dough and attractions
Costello, ideas trenchant borrows
New song benefactor
Is the past tomorrow
Sing, sing a song
I'm singing the song cause I copped it baby
Don't last long
There's guns behind you
Aura of desparate boot licker
And you can't hang on with a cuff of him and girl
I'm singing a song cause I copped it baby
Taking out a policy for love and destruction
Can't operate with this vexation
Say it again, real real gone
I know I've copped but I'm not the only one
It ain't what you do it's the way that you do itEmbed
