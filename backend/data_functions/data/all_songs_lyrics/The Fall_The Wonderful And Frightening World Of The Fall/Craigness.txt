Craigness LyricsNeighbour downstairs with one eye
Co-habs with a mass of blonde curls
Ooo-ar
T'pau
(Mind moving fast is mad
Mind moving slow is sane)
It's (granpathy) fits set on eyes
(Mazim) peculiar tan
He sports the maroon flares
Mind moving slow is sane
Mind moving fast is mad
Mind left stopped he's got
Writer in bed insane
Clutches pen in hand
The scrawl he wrote
Neighbour downstairs with one eye
Co-habs with a mass of blonde curls
Her shadow face
Mind moving slow is sane
Mind moving fast is mad
Mind left stopped he's got
Neighbour downstairs with one eye
Co-habs with a mass of blonde curls
Their babe criesEmbed
