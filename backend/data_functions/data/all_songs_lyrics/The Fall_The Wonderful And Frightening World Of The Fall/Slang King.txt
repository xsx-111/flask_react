You feel depressed 'cause you've missed the day
Then you have to go to the hall
Whip wire
Whip wire
Hawk man
Slip down easy
Don't make me a go-between
This is Mr. and Mrs. Smith
To whom you are speaking
Slang King
Words from a cheap man
Part-paid type who got his style
From a press treatise
2 pound 50
Bottle of Brut and nausea
Magazine
It's no longer a journey down the road for him
It is now escape route
Bright, turn off sign
Swing, 14, turns off, between
Swingo greets lime green receptionist
All here is ace, All here is ace, All here is ace
Escape route
Caca-phony
Slang King
Swoop swoop
Foll media krieg, for his honour's binge
During his Scandinavian stint
He said hi to Horst, the viking
Hi Lo-l-lord Swingo
At his triumphant procession
Down the road of quease
Dropping off, he stopped
At a British shop
Swoop scoop
Slang King
At a British shop
Take it down easy
During a lull in his attack
3 little girls with only 50 pence
Had to take, had to put
The Curly Wurly back
Swoop swoop, scoop scoop
Slip down easy
Slip away at court or him and his bloody mother
We'll go together
Sugar down
Slip down easy
Hyper!
Slang King
Watch, the word had right
Biz by word processor
We'll go together, slip down down away
Hyper, with the young designers
The young designers are always there
Always wanted to be there
Slip down, caca-phony
Whip wire, whip wire
Slip down easy, sugar
Slip down easy, sugar
Slip down away, sugar
Hawkman, whip wire, whip wire
