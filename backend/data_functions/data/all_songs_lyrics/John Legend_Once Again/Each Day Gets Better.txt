Each Day Gets Better Lyrics
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

I'll write a song
I thought about it for far too long
But I've never had someone to sing about
Until I met her and each day gets better
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody else understands me like she
Now that I know what true love means
I Just hope she stays with me

Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
She wants to breathe
She wants to be where the grass is green
She wants to know how love's supposed to be
She wants it better
I want to let her know
She belongs right here with me
She's heard it all but I'll make her see
I'll make her fall
Make her believe
I promised her that I'll never leave

Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

I just had to write a song about her
Tell her I don't wanna leave without her
Tell her I would build my world around her
Deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter
I'll never leave her alone
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
Each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Each day kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, noEmbed
