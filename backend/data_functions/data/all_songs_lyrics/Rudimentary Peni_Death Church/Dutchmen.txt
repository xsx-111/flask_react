Dutchmen Lyrics1902 inside a British concentration camp-
Where 20,000 Dutchmen, including children die
Do you feel any pity for these murdered men + women
Who died at the hand of the British Empire

Victims they may have been-
But innocent they were not
They were murderers just the same-
With their own code of hate
These Dutchmen carried rifles-
Went out hunting on horseback
Delighting in the slaughter-
Of a bigger kind of prey
Taking part in the latest wave of genocide
They found killing Zulus much more-
Fun than any other game

Victims they may have been-
But innocent they were not
They were murderers just the same-
With their own code of hate
These Zulu warriors felt so proud-
Of all the suffering they had caused
Driven to a frenzy by the death hate-
Of tribal wars, bound up by their own morals-
Their own bigotry + lies + shit, it's just the same in-
Northern Ireland, Poland + Afghanistan
They're just fighting for the right-
To enforce their own oppression
Through the bigotry and blindness-
Of their moral lawEmbed
