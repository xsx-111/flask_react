1/4 Dead LyricsThree quarters of the World are starving
Three quarters of the world are starving
The rest are Dead
The rest are Dead
Overdosed on Insensitivity
All Varnished to Crosses
Three quarters of the world are starving
Three quarters of the world are starving
The rest are Dead
The rest are DeadEmbed
