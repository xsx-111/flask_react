Rotten to the Core LyricsHave you realised that rock stars
Always seem to lie so much?
John Lydon once said he cared
But he never really gave a fuck
Said he'd use the money he made
So that people would have somewhere to go
But now he lives in the USA
And snorts coke after the show
Why is it that rock stars
Always seem to lie so much?
Joe Strummer once said he cared
But he never really gave a fuck
Said he'd use the money he made
To set up a radio station
To make the airwaves full of something more than shit
Have you noticed we're still waiting?
You must realise that rock stars
Always seem to lie so much
Some will always tell you that they care
But they don't really give a fuck
Still you suckers don't ever learn
That rock stars deal in money not truth
It's good business to exploit you
Just look at Lydon or Strummer for proofEmbed
