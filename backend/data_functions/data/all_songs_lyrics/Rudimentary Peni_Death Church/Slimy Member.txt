Slimy Member LyricsGrind your bones to make their bombs
Nothing so slimy as a member
Or obscene as the prime cut
The real chaos merchant
Severed head of state
Masters of disasters
With jingo and jargon
Juggling with our jugulers
The iron lady cried
The people came to see
The rust blow down the street
Morbid crowdEmbed
