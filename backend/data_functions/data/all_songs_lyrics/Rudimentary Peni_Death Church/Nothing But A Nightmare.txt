Nothing But A Nightmare LyricsWhat's the point of living in your mindless life?
What's the point of living in your mindless life?
What's the point of dying in your mindless death?
What's the point of living in your lifeless mind?
Have you ever even had the thought of thinking?
Or is it you're just ignorant ignorant?
Have you ever even had the thought of thinking?
Pathetic fool trapped inside your skull
The pile of shit inside your brain in which you live-
Is not your own, you live out all the lies you're given-
You're too scared to face yourself, you're too scared to face yourself-
So you're too scared to please yourself
Living in your dreamworld is nothing but a-
Nightmare-
