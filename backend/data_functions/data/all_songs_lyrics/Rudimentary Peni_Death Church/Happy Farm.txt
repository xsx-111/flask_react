Happy Farm LyricsAs you walk out of the valium of death
A sad feeling limps around your brain
Funny farmers sowing seeds of discontent
Pumping nerve gas around unfeeling veins
War junkies perish in the wreckage
Of their brains, mindward earthlings seek to change our path
Stench crawling over the snow
Bilious bodies terrorized by fastfood sugar demons
Unhappy nuclear bomb-doubt families
Meltdown in the melting tin pot boilers
Another crutch splinters and snaps
Time to heal the split atoms now, happy farmEmbed
