Inside LyricsNo longer want to listen to your insane lies
Or call for the blood of those who've died
Or lust for the tears of another to be cried
No longer want to suffer this pain inside
No longer feel the need to crush all in sight
Or play any part in a cruel + bitter fight
To maintain a blood stained curse of pride
No longer want to suffer this pain inside
No longer want to suffer this pain insideEmbed
