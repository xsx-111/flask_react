Love Is Not LyricsLove is not your parents lies
It's a myth that they create
True expression you're denied
In their "love" it has no place
Love is not your parents lies
Do they really care for you?
Why then must they hide behind
Duty and guilt that smothers you
Love is not your parents lies
Strung up by hostility
Never doubt that they're so kind
It's a sordid parody
Love is not your parents lies
Blackmail keeps you in your place
You can struggle you can try
But they won't see your real face
Love is not your parents lies
But you dare not face this fact
Their pretense at paradise
Keeps you down + holds you back
Love is not your parents lies
Smash the myth of unquestioned love
It's a role they hide behind
Dumb pretense is not enoughEmbed
