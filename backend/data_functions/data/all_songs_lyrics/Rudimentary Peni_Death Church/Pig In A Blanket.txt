Pig In A Blanket LyricsI tell you about the animals-
How they suffer how they die
You try to hide your guilty doubt
From me with an appeasing smile
You never want responsibility
For this murderous cruelty
The wasteful piles of blood-soaked bodies
You won't let your conscience see
Ask yourself what makes you want this
Torn ripped flesh so desperately
Are you worthy of having this suffering
Brought about to fuel your greed?
Not satisfied with killing animals
You're killing millions of people as well
As the numbers increase of those dying-
In your man made third world hell
Millions dying all the time
Locked in your abattoir of greed
Whilst you destroy them and yourself
By taking much more than you need
There is no justice in this death
No illusion I'll let you hide behind
The tradition you use to hide animal murder is
Nothing but a thin disguiseEmbed
