The Cloud Song LyricsThe Black Cloud gathers smothers my brain
As I cry another tear in this struggle of pain
Another hurdle to clear is it all the same
Is the conquest of pain my only aim?
This pain has got to stop, it's eating into me
My apathy upholds this misery
This hatred for myself will destroy me
If I don't start to give it the love it needs
Have you ever realized you must love yourself
If you don't how can you love anybody else?
Nobody can reach you through your personal hell
You'll just eat yourself away in your tortured shellEmbed
