Radio Schizo LyricsTransatlantic titanic freakshout
Radio schizo, new empire's devouring old
Radio schizo, the one's called sane wanna self destruct
Radio schizo, peoples caught in poison webs
Radio schizo, chains their brains to the media mains
Radio schizo, fable and label make your tower of babel
