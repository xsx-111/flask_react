Army Of Jesus LyricsDrink their blood and eat their flesh, insane
Drink their blood and eat their flesh, insane
So we take to the homes of all their sisters and brothers
Sisters and brothers are gone
Stone the crows and fuck the pigs and pass the ammunition to Jesus
The holy ghost in mohawk hair has crept in every fucking where
Ten tons of the babes foreskin and 50,000 skeletons of Jesus
Army of Jesus, army of Jesus, army of Jesus
Drink their blood and eat their flesh, insane
Drink their blood and eat their flesh, insane
So we take to the homes of all their sisters and brothers
Sisters and brothers are gone
Though the world ate all your shits they're still allowed to starve
The turin shroud can't cover up your evil-smelling cloud
Deliver us from Jesus, forever and ever
Bloody men, bloody men, bloody menEmbed
