Blissful Myth LyricsIt's Escapist shit of a feeble kind
A fucked up institution for fucked up minds
Holy Matrimony is a Blissful Myth
Wholly based on tradition, wholly based on bullshit
Think you love each other, think you're so in touch
But its the shit institution you love so much
Is your caring so stifled so Perverted and Sick
That you need vows and Duties so that it won't Slip?
You make your love secure but what of Respect?
Does it only exist as another truth to forget?
So your limited caring is the best you can give-
Smeared with lies and traditions behind which you live
Holy matrimony is a Blissful myth
Wholly based on tradition Wholly based on bullshitEmbed
