Blasphemy Squad LyricsBlasphemy squad
Thriving on hate
In the warfare state
Like piss in a pod

Never forget
Never ever forgive
Wash your mouth out with pope
Death love god squad
The babies of christ
Pin you all down
In their burial mound

Never forget
Never ever forgive
Wash your mouth out with pope
No need to feed
From corpus christi
No need to cower
Inside you's the power
Never forget
Never ever forgive
Wash your mouth out with pope
Hairy white mouse
The rubber arch bish
The crazed entourage
Their immoral barrage
They censored this line
With a brick through my head
Washed my mouth out with popeEmbed
