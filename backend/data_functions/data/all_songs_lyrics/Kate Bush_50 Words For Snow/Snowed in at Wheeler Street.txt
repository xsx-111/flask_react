Snowed in at Wheeler Street Lyrics
Excuse me I'm sorry to bother you
But don't I know you?
There's just something about you
Haven't we met before?
We've been in love forever

When we got on top of the hill
We saw Rome burning
I just let you walk away
I've never forgiven myself

I saw you on the steps in Paris
You were with someone else
Couldn't you see that should have been me?
I just walked on by

Then we met in '42
But we were on different sides
I hid you under my bed
But they took you away

I lost you in a London smog
As you crossed the lane
And I'd never know where you'd gonna be next
But I'd know that you'd surprise me
Come with me, I'll find some rope
I'll tie us together
I've been waiting for you so long
I don't want to lose you again
I don't want to walk into the crowd again
I don't want to walk away again

I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you again

There's just something about you
Have we been in love forever?
9/11 in New York
I took your photograph
I still have your smiling face in a heart-shaped frame

Snowed in at Wheeler street
Just two old friends
Keeping the fire going
We looked so good together
Can't we just stay there forever?
We were so happy
I'd live that day over and over
But the world won't stop turning

When we got to the top of the hill
We saw Rome burning

I don't want to lose you
I don't want lose you again
Don't walk away again
Don't leave me unloved again

Don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you again
Don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you again

Oh no, not again
No, no, not again
Not again, not again
No, no, no, no, not again
Not again
Never again!2Embed
