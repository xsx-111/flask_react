Life Kills LyricsWhen you fall into your seat, you know you feel you might be dying
As the breath rasps in and out, of your burning throat
You can't control your lungs because you're so tired
You're half awake with one arm in your coat
Well thank God that there is someone there to drive you
You know you couldn't make it on your own
He helps you through the door
You sit down on the floor
And you're asleep before you are alone
Your life is like a schedule
You run to meet the bills
No one's awake to tell you
Life kills
Your life is like a schedule
You run to meet the bills
No one's awake to tell you
Life kills
For a while it seems exhaustion has subsided
The day is over and the moon is high
But your period of work is predecided
Funny how the hours of freedom seem to fly
Well thank God that there is someone there to drive you
You know you couldn't make it on your own
He helps you in the door
You sit down as before
Another shift to pay another loan
Your life is like a schedule
You run to meet the bills
No one's awake to tell you
Life kills
Your life is like a schedule
You run to meet the bills
No one's awake to tell you
Life kills
Your life is like a schedule
You run to meet the bills
No one's awake to tell you
Life kills
Your life is like a schedule
You run to meet the bills
No one's awake to tell you
