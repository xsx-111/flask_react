Only After Dark LyricsI feel my spirit fly
Only after dark - ahh
I kiss the world goodbye
Only after dark - ahh
Fight, with the city lights
Only after dark - ahh
Run, I'd like to run away
Only after dark - ahh
Won't you disappear into midnight with me
Why don't you come, why don't you come, why don't you fly, fly, fly with
Sweet elusive Fate, will be our company
Bring, out the vamp in me
Only after dark - ahh
Moon, sinful as can be
Only after dark - ahh
It's wrong, to feel so free (!)
Only after dark - ahh
Only you, know it can be
Only after dark - ahh
Won't you disappear into midnight with me
Why don't you come, why don't you come, why don't you fly, fly, fly with
Sweet elusive In Fade, will be our company
Personal Note from John Von Ahlen :
I give up. Anybody who knows what the words are in the chorus - PLEASE - email me!
I just can't figure it out :Embed
