Marianne LyricsI take one look at you
It leaves me breathless
I see your dream's come true
You're not so restless
Or light, or bright
Marianne
One day I might not care
What happens to me
Your lack of sympathy Fails to disturb me
I've got a life of my own
I remember the day
I thought we couldn't lose
Running round the garden In your mother's shoes
Playing silly sisters
And drinking green tea
On a cold autumn day
Someone's car had broken down
The best of summer ends
When you give a celebration
We can leave but we can't really go on
It would spoil the celebration
Add it up, all that's left is a space in your life
That goes on as before
One day I might not care
What happens to me
Your lack of sympathy
Fails to disturb me
I've got a life of my own
Add it up, all that's left is a space in your life
That goes on as before
Marianne
Add it up, all that's left is a space in your life
That goes on as before
Marianne
Add it up, all that's left is a space in your life
That goes on as before
Marianne
Add it up, all that's left is a space in your life
At the end of the world
