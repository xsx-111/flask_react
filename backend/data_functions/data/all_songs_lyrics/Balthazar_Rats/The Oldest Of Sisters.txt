The Oldest Of Sisters LyricsI am not sure is it how you would say yes
Your room's still open but I didn't miss the steps
Cause when I went nearby to see what I have missed
There was your doorman challenging me to confess
Friend of mine
My old friend refire
My old friend well tide
My old friend of mine
But I get someone behind
Oh
Oh you gave me shelter say a fool you must not learn
Why you've kept close will be left here to burn
Me oldest of sisters she was the greatest one to earn
So I wrote her this letter in advance of my return
Friend of mine
My old friend refire
Oh my old friend well tide
Old friend of mine
Well I get someone behind
Oh
As I get someone behind
Friend of mine
My old friend refire
My old friend well tide
Old friend of mine
