Sides LyricsMy assembled friends
Day and night wager on our soul
That's what we're up against
Undecided, undecided
Everything but that empty bed
We won't surrender our weapons yet
But what you can't bear you go down with
Undecided, undecided
Do yourself a favour and run
Do yourself a favour and run
Do yourself a favour and run
Do yourself a favour and runEmbed
