The Man Who Owns The Place LyricsI have seen the eyes upon us
And I don't think they want us together
I have thought it through
And now it's coming for you so shelter
All the lines that are drawn and the women I embrace
Are all agreed upon with the man who owns the place
It's over
It is walking evenly, between you and me
This toothless terror
And it stares us in the face until we break our nose
Against the mirror
I loved you for your madness but now it is grown
Out of proportion through the cracks in your throne
Sister
The number of eyes that are pointing at me are growing
And this fear takes the size my father before me was showing
We get tempted by the lies of the whores and their eyes of crystal
In which I can read the number of paces and the choice of the pistol
My soul conceals a lot of corners, their secrets are yours
Whereas I've never dared to descend through the doors
Leading to yours
All the lines that are drawn and the women I embrace
Are all agreed upon with the man who owns the place
It's over... over1Embed
