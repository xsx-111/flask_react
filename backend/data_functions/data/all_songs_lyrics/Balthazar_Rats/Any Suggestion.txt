Any Suggestion LyricsWhen we parted we swore we wouldn't try to win
The heart of the whore of Babylon again
We searched for devotion we kneeled at this bed
Honey the church wouldn't approve the things that you did
Any suggestion, any suggestion would do
Any suggestion, any suggestion would do
We were taught how to eat of the palms of their hands
They were listed the loudest of all carnival bands
Taught to accept the cards we were dealt
From this table of gold to the envy we felt
Any suggestion, any suggestion would do
Any suggestion, any suggestion would do
Not without you1Embed
