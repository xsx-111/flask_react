Do Not Claim Them Anymore LyricsHold me close my dear
There's nothing wrong with some twisted fear
Hold it out with a snear
Don't wait too long 'cause I'll be far from near
Battle dress show your teeth
We're right in front of this tempting heat
Leave your rags on the street
And leave them burning on the wet concrete
Far from this day you won, you won
The hearts of the ones before
But don't think this way you won, you won
Their hearts by the oath you swore
So do not claim them anymore
Hold me close my love
We'll walk this path to be in love
And leave the rest unclaimed
And leave it free and untamed
Far from this day you won, you won
The hearts of the ones before
But don't think this way you won ,you won
Their hearts by the oath you swore
So do not claim them anymore
So do not claim them anymore
So do not claim them anymore1Embed
