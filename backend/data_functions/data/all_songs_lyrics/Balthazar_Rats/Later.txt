Later Lyrics
Lay low don't put your head up high
This time is not right for you just ask me why
'Cause when I'm looking for some care
Baby I won't be found
By all aside be around so there you go

This island, the riff I, I'm to blame for this
'Cause I don't see myself round here anymore
So how will you do when I mark this page
And think later, see later, that I am no good

So when you're looking for some care
Maybe I did put it there
It's not the sweet on your tongue the taste with a Sunday stare
Put all your high cards aside
The joker's not anywhere but where you lay his coat
You will join, he will win

This island, the riff I, I'm to blame for this
'Cause I don't see myself round here anymore
So how will you do when I mark this page
Think later, see later, that I am no good
This island, the riff I, I'm to blame for this
'Cause I don't see myself round here anymore
So how will you do when I mark this page
Think later, see later, that I am no goodEmbed
