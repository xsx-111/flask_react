Listen Up Lyrics
There is no one, you said
That can get in your head, but I
Well I can't see the night which you wed
You transform every note
And join in with a quote, but no
Line is the one that will clear your throat

Hold your sign
Before I
Get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye
Hold your sign
Before I
Get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye

Now listen up
Now listen once again
Before we start this, before we begin
This isn't mine to win
It was never mine to say anything
But listen up
Yes listen once again
I know you're looking for the truth within
Another poet's sin
For all concern I ask stop listening
Hold your sign
Before I
Get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye
Hold your sign
Before I
Get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye

Now listen up
Now listen once again
Before we start this, before we begin
This isn't mine to win
It was never mine to say anything
But listen up
Yes listen once again
I know you're looking for the truth within
Another poet's sin
For all concern I ask stop listening

Now listen up
Now listen once again
Before we start this, before we begin
This isn't mine to win
It was never mine to say anything
But listen up
Yes listen once again
I know you're looking for the truth within
Another poet's sin
For all concern I ask stop listening

Now listen up
Now listen once again
Before we start this, before we begin
This isn't mine to win
It was never mine to say anything
But listen up
Yes listen once again
I know you're looking for the truth within
Another poet's sin
For all concern I ask stop listening1Embed
