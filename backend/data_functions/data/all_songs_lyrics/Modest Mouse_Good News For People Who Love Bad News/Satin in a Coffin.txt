Satin in a Coffin Lyrics
You were laying on the carpet
Like you're satin in a coffin
You said, "Do you believe what you're saying?"
Yeah, right now, but not that often

Are you dead or are you sleeping?
Are you dead or are you sleeping?
Are you dead or are you sleeping?
God, I sure hope you are dead

Well you disappeared so often
Like you dissolved into coffee
Are you here right now, or are there probably
Fossils under your meat?

Are you dead or are you sleeping?
Are you dead or are you sleeping?
Are you dead or are you sleeping?
God, I sure hope you are dead!

Now the blow's been softened
Since the air we breathe's our coffin
Well, now the blow's been softened
Since the ocean is our coffin
Often times you know our laughter
Is your coffin ever after
And you know the blow's been softened
Since the world is our coffin
Well, now the blow's been softened
Since we are our own damn coffins
Well, everybody's talking about their short lists
Everybody's talking about death!
You were laying on the carpet
Like you're satin in a coffin
You said, "Do you believe what you're saying?"
Yeah, right now, but not that often

Are you dead or are you sleeping?
Are you dead or are you sleeping?
Are you dead or are you sleeping?
God, I sure hope you are dead4Embed
