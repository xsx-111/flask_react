Blame It on the Tetons Lyrics
Blame it on the Tetons
Yeah, I need a scapegoat now

No, my dog won't bite you
Though it had the right to
You ought to give her credit
'Cause she knows I would've let it happen

Blame it on the weekends
God, I need a cola now

Oh, we mumble loudly
Wear our shame so proudly
Wore our blank expressions
Trying to look interesting

Blame it all on me 'cause
God, I need a cold one now

All them eager actors
Gladly take the credit
For the lines created
By the people tucked away from–
Sight–
Is just a window
From the room we're bound to
If you find a way out
Oh, would you just let me know how?
Would you just let me know how?
Blame it on the web, but the
Spider's your problem now

Language is the liquid
That we're all dissolved in
Great for solving problems
After it creates a problem

Blame it on the Tetons
God, I need a scapegoat now

Everyone's a building burning
With no one to put the fire out
Standing at the window looking out
Waiting for time to burn us down
Everyone's an ocean drowning
With no one really to show how
They might get a little better air
If they turned themselves into a cloud12Embed
