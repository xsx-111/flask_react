Dance Hall Lyrics
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall everyday
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
Well I'm giving myself another one, I have too much to say

Dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna angle for telepathy cause I don't know the words to say

Well I'm gonna act up but not in your fuckin' play
I'll let you win the argument if things still go my way
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day

I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day

Well I haven't had enough and I said, "I had my fill"
The past does not exist and I'm told it never will
I guess that I'm stuck here like a plant on a windowsill
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna tell you, what you want to hear anyways

I'm gonna give myself a shot, I could get myself a pill
I'm gonna go and try to buy a little more time to kill
I need a can opener cause I got some beans to spill

I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna tell you, what you want to hear anyways

Well somehow or another, I fell for every scam
But I was dancin' on the tin roof, cat be damned
Committin' crimes runnin' down the alley
I am the captain and you are in the galley

I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance hall every day
I'm gonna dance all, dance all night long right now1Embed
