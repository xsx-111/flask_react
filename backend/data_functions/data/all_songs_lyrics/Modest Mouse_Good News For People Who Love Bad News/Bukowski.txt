Bukowski Lyrics
Woke up this morning, and it seemed to me
That every night turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?
God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?

Well, we sat on the edge of the river
The crowd screamed, "Sacrifice the liver!"
If God takes life, he's an Indian giver
So tell me now why, you'll tell me never
Who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Well, see what you want to see
You should see it all
Well, take what you want from me
You deserve it all
Nine times out of ten
Our hearts just get dissolved
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten
Everything goes perfect for us all
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
Here we go
If God controls the land and disease
And keeps a watchful eye on me
If he's really so damn mighty
Well, my problem is I can't see
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Evil home stereo
What good songs do you know?
Evil me, oh yeah, I know
What good curves can you throw?

Well, all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding
But I'm sure I'll be at your wake
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day
When you get to the point
Make sure that I'm still awake, okay?

I went to bed and didn't see
Why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?
