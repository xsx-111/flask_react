The View Lyrics
Your gun went off
Well, you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
My mouth runs on too
Shouts from both sides
"Well, we've got the land but they've got the view"
Well, now here's the clue
Life, it rents us
And yeah, I hope it put plenty on you
Well, I hope mine did too

As life gets longer, awful feels softer
Well, it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss
Then I feel pretty blissfully

Your gun went off
Well, you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
My mouth runs on too
(Pow pow pow pow pow pow!)
Shots from both sides
"Well, we've got the land but they've got the view" (Pow pow pow!)
Well, now here's the clue
(We are fixed, right where we stand)
Life, it rents us
And yeah, I hope it put plenty on you
Well, I hope mine did too
(We are fixed right where we are)
As life gets longer, awful feels softer
Well, it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss
Well, I feel pretty blissfully

(For every invention made how much time did we save?
We're not much farther than we were in the cave!)

As life gets longer, awful feels softer
And it feels pretty soft to me
And if it takes shit to make bliss
Well, I feel pretty blissfully
If life's not beautiful without the pain
Well, I'd just rather never-ever even see beauty again
Well, as life gets longer, awful feels softer
And it feels pretty soft to me, oh-ho!

(For every good deed done there is a crime committed!)
(We are fixed)
(For every step ahead we could have just been seated!)
(We are fixed)
As life gets longer, awful feels softer
Well, it feels pretty soft to me
(We are fixed)
And if it takes shit to make bliss
Well, I feel pretty blissfully
(We are fixed)
We are fixed, we are fixed
We are fixed, right where we stand8Embed
