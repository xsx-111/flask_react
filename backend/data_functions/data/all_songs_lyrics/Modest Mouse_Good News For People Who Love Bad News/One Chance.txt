One Chance Lyrics
We have one chance
One chance to get everything right
We have one chance, one chance
And if we're lucky we might
My friends, my habits, my family, they mean so much to me
I just don't think that it's right
I've seen so many ships sail in
Just to head back out again and go off sinking

I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage

Didn't mean to laugh
Didn't know I had
Didn't know the better part of what you said
'Cause in your head you are not home
Didn't get the joke
Didn't mean to poke another
Just to save myself from some, something, something or another one
Well, walk home
I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
Yeah, I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage
A box in a cage

We have one chance, one chance to get everything right
My friends, my habits, my family, they mean so much to me
I just don't think that it's right I've seen so many ships sail in
Just to head back out again and go off sinking3Embed
