Devoid LyricsDevise a plan to make your life easier
Taking time to lose your mind
Your friends become uglier than before
Talking down at their pleasure
What do you expect from the same thing
When it's still devoid of
Anything worth trying
So still avoid it
Don't try so hard to be so kind
You might just find that being mean is worth the time
It seems wrong, takes a while
It makes sense when everything is getting stale
What do you expect from the same thing
When it's still devoid of
Anything worth trying
So still avoid itEmbed
