Corpse Pose LyricsSleeping is believing
Breathing is deceiving
Watch your heart, let it bleed
Don't have faith in anything
Corpse pose, corpse pose
Corpse pose, corpse pose
Corpse pose, corpse pose
The drawback to living
Is finding yourself
Watch your heart, let it bleed
Don't have faith in anything
Corpse pose, corpse pose
Corpse pose, corpse pose
Corpse pose, corpse pose
Don't believe it if you see it
Got to see it to believe it
Corpse pose, corpse pose
Corpse pose, corpse pose
Don't believe it if you see it
Don't believe it if you see it
Got to see it to believe it3Embed
