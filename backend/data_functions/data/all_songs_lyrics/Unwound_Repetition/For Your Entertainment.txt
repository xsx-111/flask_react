For Your Entertainment LyricsGetting sick of business
Overlook what's in us
Sugarcoat the palate
Lower all our standards
Cynical awareness
Lucky to be careless
Everybody's got it
Sickened by the thought of it
Suffer for your sins
Pay you by the hour
Follow any trend that comes their way
They will pick your life apart
And throw away your art
Finding something new is never hard
Entertainment!
Entertainment!
The hit machine is hissing
Do you find it insulting?
The critics are all missing
The point of what you're doing
This ugly conversation
Is getting really boring
We need a new sensation
For another story
Suffer for your sins
Pay you by the hour
Follow any trend that comes their way
They will pick your life apart
And throw away your art
Finding something new is never hard
Entertainment!
