Murder Movies LyricsPretty sure that you'd agree we only knew the first degree
Okay, what part is next? Okay, what part is next?
Meeting was the pleasure, knowing was the danger
Dreaming all the time, dreaming all the time
Murder movies, murder movies
Murder movies, murder movies
Always talked about your friends appearing in your movies
Okay, what part is next? Okay, what part is next?
I'd like to star as an alien killing all the humans
Remember what you said, remember what you said
Murder movies, murder movies
Murder movies, murder movies
My idea, my idea, my idea, my idea of you
My idea, my idea, my idea, my idea of you
My idea, my idea, my idea, my idea of youEmbed
