Fingernails on a Chalkboard LyricsExtend an invitation
To the most annoying
People of the world
Confine them to their chairs
See how long they can stare
Their personalities are frightening
Grotesque lives are boring
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboard
Fingernails on a chalkboardEmbed
