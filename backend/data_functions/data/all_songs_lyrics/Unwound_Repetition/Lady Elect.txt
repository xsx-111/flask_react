Lady Elect LyricsGoodbye to all the ones
Who left you to yourself
To be invisible
To seem impossible
Don't want to know
Don't want to know
Don't want to know
Leave it to yourself
To find it somewhere else
Safe outside of time
Martyr of a kind
Don't want to know
Don't want to know
They asked me why you died
I knew the reason why
Instead I gave a lie
Just came to say goodbye
Don't want to know
Don't want to know
Don't want to know
Leave it to yourself
To find it somewhere else
Safe outside of time
Martyr of a kind1Embed
