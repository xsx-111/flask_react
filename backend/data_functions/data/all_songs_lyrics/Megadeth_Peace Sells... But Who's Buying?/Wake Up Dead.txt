Wake Up Dead Lyrics
I sneak in my own house
It's four in the morning
I've had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her
I'll wake up - dead


Ooh, I wonder, will she find out
About the other, other lover - Diana?

Wake up dead (you die)
Wake up dead (and buried)
Wake up dead (you die)
Wake up dead4Embed
