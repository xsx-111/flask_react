Amazon Lyrics
I was missin' in action on the side of a carton
I was taken in a Datsun from a street in Acton
I was missin' in action on the side of a carton
I was taken in a Datsun from a street in Acton

I was sipping on a Rubicon, thinking 'bout where I come
It's all this for revolution
Cuttin' up the coupon, saving for a telephone
Can I call home? Please, can I go home?
I was sipping on a Rubicon, thinking 'bout where I come
It's all this for revolution
Cuttin' up the coupon, saving for a telephone
Can I call home? Please, can I go home?

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom
Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?

Smoking on a Benson, tryin' to get me undone
Let me go, I don't want your attention
Under submission, out of frustration
I'll do it, I'll scream for the nation
Smoking on a Benson, tryin' to get me undone
Let me go, I don't want your attention
Under submission, out of frustration
I'll do it, I'll scream for the nation

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom
Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees, silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under homemade lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?
Hello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?

Minutes turned to hours and became our dates
When we shared raindrops that turned into lakes
Bodies started merging and the lines got grey
Now I'm looking at him thinking maybe he's okay
Minutes turned to hours and became our dates
When we shared raindrops that turned into lakes
Bodies started merging and the lines got grey
Now I'm looking at him thinking maybe he's okay

Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me
Hello! This is M.I.A., it's okay, you forgot me2Embed
