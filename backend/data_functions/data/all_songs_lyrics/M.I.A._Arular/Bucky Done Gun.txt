Bucky Done Gun Lyrics
London, quiet down I need to make a sound
New York, quiet down I need to make a sound
Kingston, quiet down I need to make a sound
Brazil, quiet down I need to make sound

They're coming through the window
They're coming through the door
They're busting down the big wall
And sounding the horn
They're coming through the window
They're coming through the door
They're busting down the big wall
And sounding the horn

What you want? Bucky done gun
What you want? The fire done burn
What you want? Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get,  get crackin'
What you want? Bucky done gun
What you want? The fire done burn
What you want? Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get, get crackin'
Time to spit new shit
I'm rocking on this new beat
I'm hot now, you'll see
I'll fight you just to get peace
Heavy weight wrestler
Fight me in your comforter
Let you be superior
I'm flithy with the fury ya

London, quiet down I need to make a sound
New York, quiet down I need to make a sound
Kingston, quiet down I need to make a sound
Brazil, quiet down I need to make sound

I'll hard drive your bit
I'm battered by your sumo grip
Lucky I like feeling shit
My stamina can take it
Gymnastics, super fit
Muscle in the gun clip
Bite, teeth, nosebleed
Tied up in a scarf piece
What you want? Bucky done gun
What you want? The fire done burn
What you want? Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get, get crackin'
What you want? Bucky done gun
What you want? The fire done burn
What you want? Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get, get crackin'

Can I get control?
Do you like me vulnerable?
I'm armed and I'm equal
More fun for the people
Physical, brute force
Steel, lion you're the boss
Yeah, you're so doable
Grind me down sugar salt

What you want? Bucky done gun
What you want? The fire done burn
What you want? Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get, get crackin'
What you want? Bucky done gun
What you want? The fire done burn
What you want? Bucky done gun
Get crackin', get, get crackin'5Embed
