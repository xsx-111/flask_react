No Limits on the Words Lyrics
Put no limits on the words
Simply to live, that is my plan
Simply to live, that is my plan

In a city that breaks us
I will say nothing
I will say nothing
I will say nothing
I will say nothing

I can tell that the shadow likes you still
Like the memory, my heart keeps remembering
That simply to live that was my plan
That simply to live that was my plan

And I will say nothing
And I will say nothing
And I will say nothing
And I will say nothing1Embed
