Lightning Risked It All Lyrics
Still no guides
It's not a generous world
It is a separate world
The bad luck taste of the dark
The broad luck of blood on the water
I can see it will be red, the choice if it is a choice
It's too hard to tell
It's too hard to tell
It's too hard to tell
Lightning standing drained and like us deeply risked it all
And like us, deeply risked it all
And like us, deeply risked it all
And like us, deeply risked it all1Embed
