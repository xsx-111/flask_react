Incantation Lyrics
The sound of our feet against the road
It spreads through the night
It spreads through the night
And the city's ending
Speak to me, speak to me if we're near the bottom
Work it out with me
Work it out with me

Caution, like the moon, hangs on the tracks
Blood and the lightning hangs on the tracks and
It spreads through the night
It spreads through the night

To where the city's ending
An absent star
Worked it out with me
Worked it out with me
Spreads through the night
Spreads through the night1Embed
