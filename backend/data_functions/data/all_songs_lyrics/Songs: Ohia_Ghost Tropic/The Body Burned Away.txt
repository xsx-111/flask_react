The Body Burned Away Lyrics
Death as it shook you
You gave it a fool's look
You said I am an empty page to you
Give me your hand
Give me your blood

Don't misunderstand
I once had all the words
I forgot all the words
Held the binding lightning
I held the binding lightning
Began to burn away
We began to burn away
Held the binding lightning
We held the binding lightning

Began to burn away
Began to burn away
Body burns away
Body burns away
Body burns away
Body burns away
Body burns away
Body burns away
Ooh
