Huey Smith Medley Lyrics* I get high blood pressure
When you call my name
* Repeat with ad lib
I can't groove, with the stuff I use
(Don't you just know it)
Baby don't believe, I'm way into the blues
(Don't you just know it)
* High high high high (Repeat)
Hey Joe (Repeat)
Do ba do ba do ba do ba (Repeat)
High high high high (Repeat)
High high high high (Repeat)
Hey Joe (Repeat)
Die die brother, gonna set it on me
(Don't you just know it)
Young girl in trouble, all the Saturday's free
(Don't you just know it)
* Repeat
Baby, you ruled me once
You know I was a fool, for you baby
Oh baby you know that you ruled me once
Baby you know that I was a fool, for you baby
And I swear that I ain't gonna be
You're boppin' along, if I do
If I do, well I'll be John BrownEmbed
