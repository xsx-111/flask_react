Blow Wind Blow Lyrics
Blow wind blow
All my troubles away
Blow wind Blow
Until Judgement Day

You've got my ring, and everything
You know you are, so bad
Where can I go
Where can I turn
I'm walking in the rain

Blow wind blow
All my troubles away
Blow wind Blow
Until Judgement Day

My head is hung, way down low
It makes my poor heart yearn
It makes me sad
I feel so bad
The way that, it's all going
Blow wind blow
All my troubles away
Blow wind Blow
Until Judgement DayEmbed
