Somebody Changed the Lock LyricsSomebody changed the lock, on my door, yeah now
And my key, it won't fit in that lock no more
I've been standin', on my little porch
All night long
And I know, something is definitely going on wrong
You know that the lights, is dim
Your shades are way down low
And I knocked and knocked, until my fist got sore
From bangin'
I've been standin', on my front porch, all night long
And I. and I know something is definitely going on wrong
You changed the lock, on my door
And Lord, my key, it won't fit in my lock no more
Yeah now now now now
Yes the candle light won't fit in my, won't fit no more
You understand
You know my key, it won't fit in my lock no moreEmbed
