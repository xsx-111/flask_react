Stack-a-Lee LyricsStack-a-Lee shot Billy Lyons
He shot that boy so fast
The bullet went through Billy
It broke the bartender's glass
Stack-a-Lee went around the corner
Where they shot Stack in his side
Stack-a-Lee went stumbling
In his mother door
He said mother, oh mother
Won't you turn me, over slow
I've been jabbed in my left side
With a police 44
When all the ladies, heard that Stack
Oh Stack-a-Lee was dead
Some come dressed in orange colors
Some came dressed in red
Oh play it for him now
Stack-a Lee went to the devil
To identify poor Billy's soul
But the poor boy he was absent
He had gone down to Shango
Now the devil heard a rumbling
A mighty rumbling, under the ground
He said that must be Mr. Stack pointing Billy
Upsidedown
Now it seems that old devil
On top of his Devil chair
He said if you want Mr. Stack boy
Get him by yourself
Now I told you all my little story
And sang you all my little song
But Stack-a-Lee and Billy Lyons
They both dead and goneEmbed
