Big Chief LyricsMe got fire, can't put it out
Drink fire-water gonna make me shout
Me goin' down to get my squaw
We goin' buy a great big car
Me big chief, me feel-um good
Me goin' do everything me could
Me big chief me got-um tribe
Me gonna take 'em for a ride
My spy boy just went by
My flag boy is full of fire
My whole tribe is having fun
We goin' dance till morning come
Me big chief, me got my band
Girls in wild rags, near Tremayne
Me big chief, me got papoose
Drink fire-water, get me blues
Me big chief, me feel-um good
Me gonna do everything me could
Fire in the levee, burning down (Repeat ad lib.)Embed
