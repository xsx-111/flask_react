Let the Good Times Roll Lyrics
People see me, but they just don't know
What's in my heart and why I love you so
I love you baby, like a miner loves gold
Come yeah baby, let the good times roll

Let the good times roll
Oh let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Come on baby, get down
And let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

Love is nice when it's understood
It's even nicer when you're feelin' good
You got me slippin' like a flag on a pole
Come yeah baby, let the good times roll

Let the good times roll
Oh let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Come on baby, get down
And let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
A lot of people live in make believe
They got a lot of dirt up their sleeve
I wonder why baby you treat me so cold
Come yeah baby, let the good times role

Let the good times roll
Oh let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Come on baby, get down
And let the good times roll
Let the good times rollEmbed
