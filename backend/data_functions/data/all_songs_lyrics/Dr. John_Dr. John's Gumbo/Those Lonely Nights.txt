Those Lonely Nights LyricsThere's been some lonely lonely nights
Oh baby yeah, since you've been gone
Lay my head, on my pillow
Oh I cried, all night long
The things, you used to say to me
You said that we, would never part
Well you know. I love you darling
Tell me why did we, have to part
Days been dark, since you've been gone
Baby could you please come back, and bring the light
If you had only compromised
And free me from, the lonely nightsEmbed
