What Would You Do (If I Did That To You) LyricsFrancen-Porter
Ahh saw me walkin’ the other day
He saw me comin’ said get outta my way
He told me that I was in the wrong groove
He told me that I would have to move
I looked at him ah right in the eye
Ah say hey man! Tell me why
He said I was different
Didn’t fit in his grace
'cause all the people ‘round
Got the same kinda face
What would you do
If I did that to you hey hey hey hey
What would you do
If I did that to you hey hey hey hey
What would you do
If I did that to you Yeah
I went to see mah baby
Ta give me some love
I needed some understandin’
I need it so much
I went to see mah baby
Ta give me some love
The sugah that she gave me
I couldn’t get enough
Well she wouldn’t see me
She didn’t have time
Cause she found a new man
With better lovin’ than mine
I couldn’t get her ta see me
She closed her front door
She told me it was over
I was free once more
What would you do
If I did that to you hey hey hey hey
What would you do
If I did that to you hey hey hey hey
What would you do
If I did that to you ahh
What would you do
Hey what would you do now
What would you do
If I did that to you
What would you do
What would you do now
What would you do
If I did that to you
What would you do
What would you do now
What would you do
If I did that to you
What would you do
What would you do now
What would you do
If I did that to you...Embed
