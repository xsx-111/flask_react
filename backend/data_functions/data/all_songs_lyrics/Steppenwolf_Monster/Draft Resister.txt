Draft Resister Lyrics
He was talkin' 'bout the army
While he passed his pipe around
An American deserter
Who found peace on Swedish ground

He had joined to seek adventure
And to prove himself a man
But they tried to crush his spirit
'Til his conscience ruined their plans

And we thought of those who suffer
For the sake of honesty
All those who refuse to follow
Traitors to humanity

Here's to all the draft resisters
Who will fight for sanity
When they march them off to prison
In this land of liberty

Heed the threat and awesome power
Of the mighty Pentagon
Which is wasting precious millions
On the toys of Washington
Don't forget the Draft Resisters
And their silent, lonely plea
When they march 'em off to prison
They will go for you and me

Shame, disgrace and all dishonor
Wrongly placed upon their heads
Will not rob them of the courage
Which betrays the innocentEmbed
