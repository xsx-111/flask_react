New York Town LyricsWell I got a guest in the studio tonight. It's my old partner and road buddy: Woody Guthrie.
Hey, Woody, how've ya been? I haven't seen you in...seems like a year and a half now.
(Jack imitating Woody Guthrie): We-ell, Jack, bout the same to you. Seems like about eighteen years to me. Let's get on with somethin good. What do you say? Some old time number like we use to sing together. How about New York Town? That's a goodun.
Here come one of them old time gooders.
I was standing down in New York town one day
Standing down in New York town one day
I was standing down in New York town one day
Singing hey, hey, hey, hey
I was broke and I didn't have a dime
I was broke and I didn't have a dime
I was broke and I didn't have a dime
Singing hey, hey, hey, hey
Every good man gets a little hard luck sometimes
Every good man gets a little hard luck sometimes
Every good man gets a little hard luck sometimes
Play it out, man!
Singing hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna ride that new morning railroad
I'm gonna ride that new morning train
I'm gonna ride that new morning train
Singing hey, hey, hey, hey
Jack as Woody: Take a verse Jack!
Do you want to friend a guy like Jesse James
Do you want to friend a guy like Jesse James
Do you want to friend a guy like Jesse James
Pull out a six-shooter, hold up a passenger train
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Jack as Woody: That there's a goodun, Jack!
Jack: Anything for you, Woody.Embed
