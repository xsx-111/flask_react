The Boll Weevil LyricsOutside of man I guess the worst enemy of the cotton growin folks down south is a little black bug they call the boll weevil.
Well, the boll weevil am a little black bug
Come from Mexico, they say
Come all the to Texas
Just lookin for a place to stay
Looking for a home
Just lookin for a home
Well, the first time I seen the boll weevil
Settin on the square
Next time I see the boll weevil
Lord, he got all his family there
Lookin for a home
Lookin for a home
And the farmer said to the weevil
What makes your head so red
And the boll weevil said to the farmer
It's a wonder I ain't dead
Lookin for a home
Just lookin for a home
And the farmer took the boll weevil
Put him in a keg of ice
Boll weevil said to the farmer
This is mighty cool and nice
It'll be my home
It's gonna be my home
And the farmer took the boll weevil
Put him in the hot sand
Boll weevil said to the farmer
Mighty hot but I'll stand it like a man
It'll be my home
It's gonna be my home
Well the merchant got half the cotton
Boll weevil got the rest
Didn't leave that farmer's wife
But one old cotton dress
And it's full of holes
It's full of holes
It's full of holes
It's full of holes
And the old boll weevil gonna have a home
Well the captain said to the missus
What do ya think of that
Durned ol' boll weevil done made a nest
In my best Sunday hat
He gonna have a home
He gonna have a home
If anybody was to ask you
Who was it sung this song
Tell em it was ol' Jack Elliot
And I done been here and gone
I'm a-lookin for a home
Just lookin for a home
Lookin for a home
Lookin for a home
Got my blue duggins on
And I'm lookin for a homeEmbed
