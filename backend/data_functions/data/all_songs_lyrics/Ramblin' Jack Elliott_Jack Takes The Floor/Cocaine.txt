Cocaine Lyrics
Yonder comes my baby all dressed in blue
Hey baby, what are you going to do
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, come here quick
This old cocaine's going to make me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain

Yonder comes my baby all dressed in white
Hey baby, going to stay all night
Cocaine, all around my brain
