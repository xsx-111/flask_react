Salty Dog LyricsDown in the wild-wood, sittin on a log
Finger on my trigger and eye on a hog
Honey, let me be your salty dog
Salty dog, salty dog
I don't wanna be your man at all
Honey, let me be your salty dog
Standin on the corner shoutin the blues
I got a great big hole in the bottom of my shoe
Honey, let me be your salty dog
Salty dog, salty dog
I don't wanna be your man at all
Honey, let me be your salty dog
Well I pulled the trigger and the gun went blam
I shot my gal to Alabam
Honey, let me be your salty dog
Salty dog, salty dog
Now, I don't wanna be your man at all
I just wanna be your salty dog
Salty dog, salty dog
I don't wanna be your man at all
Honey, let me be your salty dog
God made woman and he made her mighty funny
The lips around her mouth a sweeter than honey
Honey, let me be your salty dog
Salty dog, salty dog
I don't wanna be your man at all
I'd just like to be your salty dogEmbed
