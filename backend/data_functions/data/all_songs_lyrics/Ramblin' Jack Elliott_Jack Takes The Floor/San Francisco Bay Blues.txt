San Francisco Bay Blues LyricsOakland is right across the bay from San Francisco. That's where Jesse Fuller lives. Jesse Fuller plays the twelve string guitar, like Lead Belly. Guitar and the harmonica too--electric. Also has a kind of five string bass like thing on the floor that he plays with his fotdella. And Jesse wrote this song, and I'll sing it to you know, I'll sing it all day long.
I got the blues when my baby left me by the San Francisco Bay
Ocean liner she's gone so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad
Best gal I ever have had
She said goodbye, like to made me cry
I'm gonna lay down and die
I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime
If she don't come back I think I'm gonna lose my mind
If she ever comes back to stay
It's gonna be another brand new day
Walkin with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
Sittin down lookin' through my back door
Wonderin which a-way to go
Woman I'm so crazy about she don't want me no more
Think I'll take me a freight train because I'm feelin' blue
Ride all the way to the end of the line
Thinkin only of you
Meanwhile in another city
Just about to go insane
Sound like I heard my baby
The way she used to call my name
If she ever comes back to stay
It'll be another brand new day
Walkin with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay, hey
Walkin with my baby down by the San Francisco BayEmbed
