NYC- Gone, Gone Lyrics
Gone, gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a head that empty?
Gone, gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone?

Down, down to Mexico City
Got myself a lady, she knows how to treat me
Down, down to Mexico City
Got myself a lady to lay me down, to lay me down, lay me down
All my friends that you don't know
I'm gonna miss you when I go
But I'll see you down your road
Meet me at the station way down low, way down low

Gone, gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a head that empty
Gone, gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone
Gone, gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a head that empty
Gone, gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone
Where you gonna go with a heart that goneEmbed
