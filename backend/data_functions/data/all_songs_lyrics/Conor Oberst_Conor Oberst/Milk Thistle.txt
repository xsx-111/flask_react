Milk Thistle Lyrics
Milk thistle, milk thistle, let me down slow
Help me go slow, I've been carrying on
I'm not scared of nothin', I'll go pound for pound
I keep death on my mind like a heavy crown
If I go to heaven, I'll be bored as hell
Like a little baby at the bottom of a well

Fairchild, Fairchild, how are you, man?
Did you fix that storefront, did you start that band?
Don't be scared of nothing, you go pound for pound
You'll bring peace to midnight like a spotted owl
I'll be rooting for you like my favorite team
If somebody sweats you, you just point 'em out to me

All the sights and sounds, this little world's too crowded now
And there's only one way out
An elevator ride through the tunnel towards the light
And I'm nowhere bound
Keep going up and down
Up and down

Newspaper, newspaper, can't take no more
You're here every morning waiting at my door
And I'm just tryin' to kiss you and you stab my eyes
Make me blue forever like an island sky
And I'm not pretending that it's all okay
Just let me have my coffee before you take away the day
Lazarus, Lazarus, why all the tears?
Did your faithful chauffeur just disappear?
What a lonesome feeling to be waiting around
Like some washed-up actress in a tinsel town
But for the record, I'd come pick you up
We'll head for the ocean, just say when you've had enough

All the light and sound, this little world's too fragile now
And there's only one way out
But if you let me slide, I'll do my best to make things right
And I'm nowhere bound
Just going up and down
Up and down

Milk thistle, milk thistle, let me down slow
Just help me go slow, I've been hurrying on
I was poised for greatness, I was down and out
I keep death at my heels like a basset hound
If I go to heaven, I'll be bored as hell
Like a crying baby at the bottom of a wellEmbed
