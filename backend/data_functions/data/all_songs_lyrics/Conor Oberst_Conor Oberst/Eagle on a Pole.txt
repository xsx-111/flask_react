Eagle on a Pole Lyrics
Saw an eagle on a pole, I think it was an eagle
Watched its' shadow fly 'cross the cement
And I woke up in the snow, all the trees, and crowds, and people
No shirt, no shoes, no idea where they went
I followed the fence line thin back where the yard begins
My woman, she stood crying like a man

Said, where have you been, where have you been?
I thought you said that all of that was done
El cielo es azul
Just don't go telling everyone

Thought the kettle was a train, thought that Monday was a doorframe
I tried so hard to finally settle down
Heard the fire pop and snap like a tack piano rag
I never could get used to happy sounds
Yeah, I hope the world's exposed a cruel and elaborate hoax
It convinces me to walk without a cane

But what can you do, child, what can you do?
I always heard that what is done is done
El cielo es azul
Just don't go telling everyone
The past don't ever quit, there's boxes in the attic
Baby shoes and taxidermy dreams
While the ashes of the dead, like a dandelion head
Explode and then are scattered by the breeze
It's such a long way back to all the fun I've had
When nothin' ever seemed to bother me

But what can you do, child, what can you do?
Sleep 'neath the stars, and toil in the sun
El cielo es azul
Just don't go telling everyone2Embed
