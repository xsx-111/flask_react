Souled Out!!! Lyrics
The barrio starts two streets over
Miguel, he's a friend of mine
With brick weed built a reputation
Like dry ice in the summertime
Now all you need is an electric razor
A magic bullet and a grassy knoll
The whole world is just a little oyster
To Snow White and her poison apples
I woke up in the age of wires
I fell asleep at the dusk of man
Now I'm cold as Popocatépetl
Fingers crossed in the promised land

But you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
All souled out in heaven

The barrio starts two streets over
Monse, she's a friend of mine
Keeps it peace like a whistleblower
Flying kites in the wintertime
Magic carpet is the transportation
Went to the moon in a soda can
Not all my boys believe in science
Stretching truth in the promised land

But you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
It's souled out in heaven
Chorus again, or another one? Another one
El Popocatépetl esta dormido pero pronto despertará

You know by now
You know by now
You know by now
But you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
It's souled out, in heaven
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
No, you won't be getting in (you know by now)
To heaven
To heaven (you know by now)
To heaven (you know by now)
(You know by now)
To heaven1Embed
