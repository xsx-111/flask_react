Moab Lyrics
I used up your compassion, so I've come to make a trade
You can hate me but just love me in return
And if I know where to find you, I'll stay out of your way
I won't come beg to borrow all the happiness you've earned

I'll just slide back down to the bottom
While you make your place in the hills

There's nothing that the road cannot heal
There's nothing that the road cannot heal
Washed under the blacktop, gone beneath my wheels
There's nothing that the road cannot heal
Claro que si!

They say the sun won't burn forever but that's a science too exact
I can prove it, watch, we're crossing the state line
See those headlights coming towards us, that's someone going back
To a town they said they'd never, yeah, they swore it on their life

But you can't break out of a circle
That you never knew you were in
There's nothing that the road cannot heal
There's nothing that the road cannot heal
Washed under the blacktop, gone beneath my wheels
There's nothing that the road cannot heal

Some would spend their precious time trying to decorate their lives
Taking measurements for some new look they want
So from one to ten, ten's exactly what I am
Zero being everything I'm not
Tell me what you like
Is it less than five?
Is it less than five?

There's nothing that the road cannot heal
There's nothing that the road cannot heal
When I make it to Moab, I'll get my canteen filled
There's nothing that the road cannot heal

Washed under the blacktop, gone beneath my wheels
There's nothing that the road cannot healEmbed
