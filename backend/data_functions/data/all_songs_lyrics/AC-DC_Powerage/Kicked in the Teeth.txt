Kicked in the Teeth Lyrics
Two face woman with your two face lies
I hope your two face livin' made you satisfied
Ya told me, baby, I was your only one
While you been runnin' 'round town with every mother's son
Hey

Two times, told about the women like you
Two times, told about the things you do
I used to think that you were sugar and spice
I shoulda listened to my ma's advice

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain’t this misery ever gonna end?
And I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again


Two face woman, such a cryin' shame
Double or nothin', you all the same
You run around, hope you had your fun
You never know who's gonna win
'Till the race been
Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain’t this misery ever gonna end?
And I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again1Embed
