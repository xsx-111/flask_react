Sin City Lyrics
Diamonds and dust
Poor man last
Rich man first
Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangri-La

I got a burnin' feelin'
Deep inside of me
It's a yearning
But I'm going to set it free

I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city
Oh, let me roll you baby

Ladders and snakes
Ladders give
Snakes take
Rich man, poor man
Beggar man, thief
Ainâ€™t got a hope in hell
That's my belief
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim
They're gettin' ready
Look out, I'm comin' in

So spin that wheel
Cut that pack
And roll those loaded dice
Bring on the dancing girls and put the champagne on ice

I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city3Embed
