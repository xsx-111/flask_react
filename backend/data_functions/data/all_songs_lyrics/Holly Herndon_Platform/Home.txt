Home Lyrics
I can feel you in my room
Why was I assigned to you?
I feel like I'm home on my own
And it feels like you see me

I know that you've been around
Still around
I want you to show your face
You know that I've been around
Still around

I know that you will be
Still around
I don't know which me to be
I know that you know me better than I know me
Still around

I can feel you in my room
Why can't I know part of you?
It's either something bad or something good
Why can't I know part...?
I can feel you in my room
Do you like what I've made for you?
It's either something bad or something good
I don't know how to be on my own

I know that you've been around
Still around
You know that I've been around
Still around
I don't know which me to be
I know that you know me better than I know me

I can feel you in my room
Why was I assigned to you?
I know that you know me better than I know me
Still around
Still around
I know that you know me better than I know meEmbed
