Locker Leak LyricsWho lasts?
Glass lasts
Who lasts?
Glass lasts
Who lasts longest?
Grass lasts longest
Glass lasts
Wet bar wax
Bleached in gold
(Glass lasts)
A garden hose
Organic flow
(Glass lasts, glass lasts)
(Glass lasts)
A friendly first
(Glass lasts, glass)
Inside shorts
On tap and terracotta
Be the first of your friends to like Greek yogurt this summer
(Glass)
Our liquor special
Aloe vera
Terracotta
Baked in Earth
Wet bar wax
Wet bar wax
Bleached in gold
And cardboard mists
(Glass lasts, lasts)
(Glass lasts)
Sculpted fury
Bubbling brawn
(Glass lasts)
Add it to your bucket list
(Glass)
Full framed in followed fog
Public runs and pressure points
Test results from watered lawn
Missionaries, camo thongs
Baked in Earth, jealous soles
In multichoice and cardboard mists
Dripping rain
Who lasts longest?
Grass lasts longest
Dripping rain
Like a desert
Browsed biotics
Scan fruit
With temporary freshness
Scan fruit
Youth abounds
For curbed removal
With temporary freshness
Renew feel
In distressed denim
This flow is organic
Claimed inactive
For salvaged cash
Iced naturals
Add to dash
Over curved plastic
Browsed biotics
Pressed in molds, add to dash
Pressed in molds
Over curved plastic
Pressed in molds
For easy shares
Pressed in molds, for easy shares
Found funds, renew feel
For salvage cash
Pressed in molds
In distressed denim
For easy shares
Claimed inactive
For salvaged cash
Glass
Dripping rain1Embed
