Morning Sun Lyrics
When I wake up
When I wake up
When I wake up
When I wake up

I begin the fall
You remain at all
I begin the fall, into your arms

I belong
I belong

In the morning Sun I will be gone
In the morning Sun I will be gone

I belong

I belong
Skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the...

In the morning Sun I call your voice
In the morning Sun I call your voice
Skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, skin
I begin the fall
You remain at all
I begin the fall, into your arms

I belong
Skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin
I belong
The skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin, the skin

In the morning Sun I will be gone
