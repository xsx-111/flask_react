Interference LyricsIn the seed, where we live
Always on
Seed, forced to wait
After all
Seed, without names
Everywhere and nowhere
In the seed, we can seed
In the seed, where we thrive
Always new
Seed, forced to wait
After all
Without names
Everywhere and nowhere
Everywhere, everywhere and nowhere2Embed
