Unequal Lyrics
Honesty, sing prayer to save
The human form
Dignity, cannot be broken
Our language is power
The action we've chose
Refuse, repose
Honesty, fight for each other
For one, as one
For one, as one
Fight for each other
Why unequal? Why unequal? Why unequal?
Honesty, parity, why are we?
To change the shape of our future, to be unafraid, to break away
Why unequal? Why unequal? Why unequal?
Dignity, identity, why are we?
A louder fight, a harder fight
For one, as one
HonestyEmbed
