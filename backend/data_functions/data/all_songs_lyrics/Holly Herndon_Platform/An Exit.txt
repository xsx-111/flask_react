An Exit LyricsDay after day, if you were to say, if you were to say
What could we be with will and belief?
Why stay apart when we can leave together?
Would you let us leave if I were to find a way out?
When there is nothing to gain
When there is nothing to lose
If I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to gain
When there is nothing to lose
If I asked the way would you know?
If I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to lose
I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to, nothing
I asked the way would you know?
Sail away, if I were to sail away, suddenly, sail away
What could we be, if I were to leave?
Sail away, if I were to sail away
Sail away
When there is nothing to gain
When there is nothing to lose
If I asked the way would you know?
Nothing to gain
When there is nothing to lose
Nothing to
If I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to lose
If I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to, nothing to
If I asked the way would you know?
Nothing to lose
If I knew the way would you go?
Nothing to, nothing to
Nothing to
Would you, would you know?
Nothing to, go
Nothing to, go1Embed
