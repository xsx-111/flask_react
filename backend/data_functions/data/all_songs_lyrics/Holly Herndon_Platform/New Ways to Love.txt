New Ways to Love LyricsLaw is a man you can’t see
Understand, you hold my hand
Who will stand next to me?
Common land, you hold my hand, you hold my hand
Law is a man you can’t see
(We demand)
Cloud is a hand
New ways to love
We will spread
New ways to love
We expand
New ways to love
You hold my hand
New ways to love
You hold my hand
New ways to love
Law is a man you can’t see
New ways to love
New ways to love
New ways to love
You hold my hand
You hold my handEmbed
