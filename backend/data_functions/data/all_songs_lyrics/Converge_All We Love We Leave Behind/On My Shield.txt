On My Shield LyricsAll of the wounded that need to be saved
Looked for a handout beyond the gates
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno and burn down to the bone
All of the arrows that plunge into prey
Are their promises of better days
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno, because I would rather
Die on my shield
I would rather die on my shield
All of the wounded that need to be saved
Looked for a handout beyond the gates
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno and burn down to the bone
All of the arrows that plunge into prey
Are their promises of better days
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno, because I would rather
Die on my shield
I would rather die on my shield
Die on my shield
Die on my shield
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
All of our pain is worth it
Together we fall apart
All of our pain is worth it
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
TogetherEmbed
