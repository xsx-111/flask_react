Tender Abuse LyricsWhen you chose to hurt the honest ones
They scarred effortlessly
Fading - felt but never seen
Something lost and nothing gained
This damage still looks the same
Darkness gets in the way
What I feel, I cannot say
When you chose to love all the wrong ones
I bruised beautifully
Fading - felt but never seen
When you chose to hurt the honest ones
They scarred effortlessly
Fading - felt but never seen
Something lost and nothing gained
This damage still looks the same
Darkness gets in the way
What I feel, I cannot say
It's my blood that's drowning me
My gift to you
Sweet tender abuseEmbed
