Predatory Glow LyricsI've found myself
Running out of time
Relating to those that
Just stopped trying
Clinging to those little things
And the light they bring
I bow down to you
Extinguished youth
Scavengers became
Future romancers
And my angels carry
A predatory glow
I'm weaker by the day
No way to be saved
I bow down to you
Extinguished youth
Emptiness
Drags me down
To the depths
With no sound
It's what I lack
That attracts (me)
To the jaws
Of defeat
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me
Let the future know
I won't be there tomorrow
Let the past know
I gave them my all
I'm aching for an end
Grown thinner every day
I bow down to you
Extinguished youthEmbed
