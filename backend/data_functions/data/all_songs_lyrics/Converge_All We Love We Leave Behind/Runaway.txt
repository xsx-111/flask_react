Runaway LyricsYou have stripped my heart of all it's parts
And gave away the scrap for free
You have sold your soul for some control
And gnawed at the hands that tried to love and feed
You are crying out to end the drought
Yet it's not your blood that filled this sea
All of the mistakes left in your wake
They all remind me of a younger me
To the parasites that have come and gone
This is your farewell song
To the parasites that have come and gone
This is your farewell song
Run, just run awayEmbed
