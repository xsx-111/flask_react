All We Love We Leave Behind LyricsYour roar of love
Slayed my despair
It ripped me from my path
That led me to nowhere
You shook me from my sleep
That willed me to die
A final goodbye
All we love we leave behind
I'm so sorry
That I missed your lives
While I was on the road
Learning to survive
You deserved so much more
Than I could ever provide
Thank you for loving me
And bringing light to my eyes
All we love we leave behind
Nothing in this world
Could ever compare
To the hole in my heart
And the weight in the air
When you took to the sky
And I lost you to time
A final goodbye
All we love we leave behind
I'm so sorry
That I missed your lives
While I was on the road
Learning to survive
You deserved so much more
Than I could provide
Thank you for loving me
And bringing light to my eyes
All we love we leave behind
You deserved so much more
Than I could provide
Thank you for loving me
And bringing light to my eyes
All we love we leave behindEmbed
