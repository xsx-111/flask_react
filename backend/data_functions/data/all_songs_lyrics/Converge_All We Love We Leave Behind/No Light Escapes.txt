No Light Escapes LyricsDon't let go
Don't leave me
Don't let go
Don't leave me
As i cried for you
Her lips were calling to you
Don't let go
Don't leave me
Don't let go
Don't leave me
As i reached for you
Cold hands were embracing you
Death can touch what we love
Death will touch what we love
Don't let goEmbed
