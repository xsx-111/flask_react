Kiss the Bride Lyrics
Well, she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle, everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said, "Is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed?"

I shoulda stuck up my hand
I shoulda got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

Underneath her veil, I could see a tear
Tricklin' down her pretty face
And when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did
And what I planned to say
Yeah, on her weddin' day
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

Oh, I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!Embed
