Evil Angel LyricsFor to see my depth of sorrow
You are not allowed to follow me
Unto this town square and then run away
Evil angel with your cleft tongue
When you kissed me
On this town square
All the lights came
On at sunset
Thought you'd stay
Evil angel bearin' apples
When you kissed me
On this drawbridge
As the boats do
How was I
To know you'd flee
Tear down these monuments
Bury the coat of arms
And build for me a factory
Evil angel when you're faced with
Hatred's daggers in my honor
You're no match no scratching
Hearts that no longer bleed
Oh evil angel tear down the monuments
Oh evil angel bury the coat of arms
And rebuild for me these memories
For to see my depth of sorrowEmbed
