Shadows LyricsWho will keep
Keep me in this evenin'
Even though
They are not here with me
I could be a great star
Still I'm far from happy
Finally feel the world around me
Fightin' through
Fightin' through the whisky
I could be a great star
Still I'm far from happy
Out of these shadows comes the light
Shadows comes the light
You will keep
Keep me in this evenin'
Even though
You are not here with me
I could be a great star
Still I'm far from happy
I could be a great star
(I could be a great star)
I could be a great star
(I could be a great star)
(I could be a great star)
I could be a great star
(I could be a great star)
(I could be a great star)
Still I'm far from happy
Out of these shadows
Comes the light
Out of these shadows
Comes the light
Shadows comes the lightEmbed
