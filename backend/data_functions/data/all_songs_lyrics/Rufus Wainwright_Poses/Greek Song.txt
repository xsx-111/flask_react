Greek Song LyricsYou who were born
With the sun above your shoulders
You turn me on
You turn me on
You have to know
You who were born
Where the sun she keeps her distance
You turn me on
You turn me on
But so does she
You who were born
There where beauty is existence
You turn me on
You turn me
Your body heals my soul
You who were born
Where you shiver and you shudder
You turn me on
The girl is gone
So come on let's go
All the pearls of China
Fade astride a Volta
Don't sew beelines to anybody's hide
Save your poison for a lover
Who is on your side
One way is Rome
And the other way is Mecca
On either side
On either side of our motorbike
One way is home
And the other way is papa
On either side
On either side and prepared to strike
When I get back
I will dream in Barnes and Noble's
Oh leave me here
Oh leave me where angels fear to tread
When I get back
I will bleed after my beating
Don't leave me here
Don't leave me here
I'm scared to death
All the pearls of China
Fade astride a Volta
Don't sew beelines to anybody's hide
Save your poison for a lover
Who is on your side
All the pearls of China
Fade astride a Volta
Don't sew beelines to anybody's hide
Save your poison for a lover
Who is on your sideEmbed
