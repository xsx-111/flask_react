In a Graveyard LyricsWandering properties of death
Arresting moons within our eyes and smiles
We did rest
Amongst the granite tombs to catch our breath
Worldly sounds of endless warring
Were for just a moment silent stars
Worldly bound'ries of dyin'
Were for just a moment never ours
All was new just as the black horizons blue
Then along the bending path away
I smiled in knowing we'd be back one dayEmbed
