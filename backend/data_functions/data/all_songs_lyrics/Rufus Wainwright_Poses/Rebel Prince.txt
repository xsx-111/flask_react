Rebel Prince LyricsWhere is my master the rebel prince
Who will shut all of these windows
It's these windows all around me
It's these windows who are tellin' me
To rid my dirty mind of all of its preciousness
Where is my master the rebel prince
Bet breakin' everything tryin' to get
To me in this two-bit hotel
Just to me before this windowsill
Does rid my dirty mind of all of its preciousness
Oh I can see him now
Though it's so far away
Amongst the rovin' crowd
Goin' the other way
Confounded anger burnin' with love for me
Où est mon maître le prince rebelle
Qui va fermer toutes ces fenêtres
Ce sont ces fenêtres autour de moi
Ce sont ces fenêtres qui m'appellent
Qui m'appellent
Marigold, marigold, marigold
I'm leaving the Roosevelt Hotel
Marigold, marigold, marigold
I'm leaving the room we knew so well
Da da da da da da nuh nuh nuh
Marigold, marigold, marigold
Marigold, marigold, marigold
Marigold, marigold, marigold
Marigold, marigold, marigoldEmbed
