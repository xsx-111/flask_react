Grey Gardens Lyrics
It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present... Do you know what I mean...?
Honey I'm a roller concrete clover
Tadzio, Tadzio
Arm wrestle your mother
Simply over
Tadzio, over you
But beware my heart can be a pin
A sharp silver dragonfly
Trying to get my mansions green
After I've Grey Gardens seen
In between tonight and my tomorrows
Tadzio where have you been
In between tonight I know it's Tadzio
Tadzio don't you fight
Honey can you hear me
In between been dragging a dragonfly
Trying to get my mansions green
After I've Grey Gardens seen
Honey won't you hold me tight
Get me through Grey Gardens tonight
Tadzio, Tadzio
Tadzio, Tadzio
Trying to get my mansions green
After I've Grey Gardens seen
Honey won't you hold me tight
Get me through Grey Gardens tonight
Tadzio, Tadzio
Tadzio, TadzioEmbed
