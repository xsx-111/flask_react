The Consort LyricsPrepare your things
Dissolve your mind
'Cause I'm your consort
Beautiful queen of seventeen
A blood red moon
Has spared our bed
But not your rivals
Beautiful queen
Prepare to reign
No more to hide
With I your faithful consort
By your side
Let streamers fly
And cannons roar
On your arrival
Beautiful queen
Tomorrow night
Prepare to walk
On anyone her highness ever wants
Entrust in me
You're not alone
Together we'll wreak havoc on the throne
Trust in me
You're not alone
Even though my throne's slightly smaller than yours
Beautiful queen
Together we'll wreak havoc
You and me
Together we'll wreak havoc
You and me
Together we'll wreak havoc
You
Prepare your things
Dissolve your mind
'Cause I'm your consort
Beautiful queen of seventeenEmbed
