The Tower of Learning Lyrics
I'm lookin' for the tower of learning
I'm lookin' for the copious prize
I saw it in your eyes
What I'm lookin' for
I saw it in your eyes
What I'm lookin' for

Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmmmmmm

I really do fear that I'm dyin'
I really do fear that I'm dead
I saw it in your eyes
What I'm lookin' for
I saw it in your eyes
What'll make me live

Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmmmmmm

All the sights of Paris
Pale inside your iris
Tip the Eiffel Tower
With one glance
Stained glass cathedrals
With one glint
You smashed them with your eyes
What I'm lookin' for
One blink and then my heart
Wasn't there no more
I'm looking for the tower of learning
I'm looking for the copious prize
Hmm mmm mmmEmbed
