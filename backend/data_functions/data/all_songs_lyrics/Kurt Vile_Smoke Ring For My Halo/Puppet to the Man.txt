Puppet to the Man LyricsWell I think by now you probably think
I am a puppet to the man
Well, I'll tell you right now you best believe that I am
Sometimes I'm stuck in and
I think I can unglue it
Sometimes I'm stuck in and then
I think I can unglue it
This one goes out to all those
Who want to rap to survive
Enough comes by saying, looting
I want 'em to die
My sister's stuck and
She don't think she can unglue it
Sometimes I get stuck in a rut too
It's okay girlfriends
Sometimes I been rough so much
I want it to end
Well I think by now you probably think
I am a puppet to the man
But I shout it out loud because I now that I am
Sometimes I'm stuck in and I think I can unglue it
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?Embed
