Runner Ups Lyrics
Hey old man how many times we gotta tell ya?
We don’t want none but where you been so long?
Hey girl come on over
That’ll be just fine

If it ain’t working take a whiz on the world
An entire nation drinking from a dirty cup
My best friend’s long gone but I got runner ups yeah

When I’m walking my head is practically dragging
Yeah and all I ever see is just a whole lot of dirt
My whole life’s been one long running gag
Two packs of red apples for the long ride home
Well you know baby

Sick of walking so you took a wrong way train
Then you sat down and couldn’t get up
My best friend’s long gone but I got runner ups yeah
My best friend’s long gone but I got runner ups

I don’t know if it’s real but it’s how I feel
Don’t know if you really came but I feel dumb in asking
You should've been an actress you're so domineering
Take two white gold earrings for your troubles, ma'am
When it’s looking dark punch the future in the face
Instead of standing I’m running around
The sharpest tool in school don’t even know what’s up
My best friend’s long gone but I got runner ups, yeah5Embed
