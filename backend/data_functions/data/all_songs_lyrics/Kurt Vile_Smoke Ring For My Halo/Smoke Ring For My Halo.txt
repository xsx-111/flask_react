Smoke Ring For My Halo Lyrics
Smoke ring for my halo
Angel demon human
Overestimated
Over and over
Think I can see it now
Think I can see it now
Think I can see it now
Think I can see it now

Smoke ring for my halo
Human angel demon
Underestimated
Right under the roof of your house
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then

Sipping from the soda can
Exercises my hand
Pacifies the land
Makes the most out of your chill time man
I feel like laying down
I feel like laying down
Yeah and I want to do it again
Oh what a mess I guess I'm inEmbed
