Peeping Tomboy Lyrics
I don't wanna change, but I don't wanna stay the same
I don't wanna to go, but I'm runnin
I don't wanna work, but I don't wanna sit around
All day frownin

I don't wanna give up, but I kinda wanna lie down
But not sleep, just rest
Give me a break, how much does it really take
To get my head outta here

I been searchin
I don't know what for
I came across some girl
She was a tomboy

And I was a peepin tom
On that scene
I was a peepin tom
You know what I mean
I was a
I was a
I was a
I was a
I don't wanna go, but it's a one-way street with me
So I've been told and I'm going
When I'm down, I would never come around
But you should be kind and read my mind

I been searchin
I don't know what for
She was a tomboy
And I admired her

Cuz I was a peepin tom
On that scene
I was a peepin tom
You know what I mean
I was a
I was a
I was a
I was a

I don't wanna change, but I don't wanna stay the same
I don't wanna go, but I'm runnin
I don't wanna work, but I don't wanna sit around
All day frowninEmbed
