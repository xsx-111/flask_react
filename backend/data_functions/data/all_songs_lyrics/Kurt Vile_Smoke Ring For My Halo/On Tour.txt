On Tour LyricsOn tour
Lord of the flies
Aw, hey, who cares?
What's a guitar?
Watch out for this one
He'll stab you in the back for fun
I'm just playin'
I know you, man
Most of the time
Watch out for this one
He'll pump you full of lead for turnin' your head wrong
I would know
I see through everyone, even my own self now
I wanna write my whole life down
Burn it there to the ground
I wanna sing at the top of my lungs
For fun, screaming annoyingly
Cause that's just me
Being me, being free
Watch out for this one
He'll pump you full o' lead for turnin' your head wrong
I would know
Cause I can see through him and them
On tour
Lord of the flies
I'm just playin'
I got it made
Most of the time
I wanna beat on a drum so hard
'Til it bleeds blood
Pull out the heart
'Til it don't start againEmbed
