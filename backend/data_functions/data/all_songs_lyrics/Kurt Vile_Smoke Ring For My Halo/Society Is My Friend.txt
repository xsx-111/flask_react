Society Is My Friend LyricsSociety is my friend
He makes me lie down in a cool blood bath
Society is my friend
He makes me lie down in a cool blood bath
Oh, society
Oh, yeah
Society is my friend
He makes me lie down in a cool blood bath
He stole my lady's hand
Hey how you doin' this kids
My hand is not for you to hold
So kiss me with your mouth without closing it all that much
Society is all around
Are you the beautiful sound of all the half pip-squeals
Ecstatic brilliance at it's finest, that's my friend
Society is all around
It takes me down
Society is my friend
He makes me lie down in a cool blood bath
Society is my friend
He makes me lie down, downEmbed
