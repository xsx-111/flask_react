Jesus Fever LyricsI'd pack my suitcase with myself
But I'm already gone
Cleanse myself with vitamin health
But I'm already gone
I saw it rising through the horizon
And I saw it fall
A Jesus fever's flowin all over
Believers and lovers
In a black hole I found a broken skull
Now I'm already gone
You can write my whole life down in a little book
When I'm already gone
I started shaking and my heart breaking
And my belly crawled
A Jesus fever's flowin all over
Believers and lovers
When I am a ghost, I'll see no reason to run
When I'm already gone
If it wasn't taped, you could escape this song
But I'm already goneEmbed
