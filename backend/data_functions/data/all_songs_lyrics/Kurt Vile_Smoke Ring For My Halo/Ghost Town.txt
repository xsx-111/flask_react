Ghost Town LyricsIn the morning I'm not done sleepin
In the evening I guess I'm alive
But that's alright, I can still peel myself up
Sleep walking in a ghost town
Think I'll never leave my couch again
Cuz when I'm out, I'm on it in my mind
Then again, I guess it ain't always that way
In the morning I'm not done sleepin
In the evening I guess I'm alive
That's alright, I can still peel myself up
Sleep walking in a ghost town
Think I'll never leave my couch again
Cuz when I'm out, I'm on it in my mind
Christ was born
I was there
You know me
I'm around
I got friends
Hey, wait, where was I?
Well, I am tryin
When I'm drivin, I find I'm dreamin
Jammin tunes and drifting
And it's just then sometimes I wanna pull over
Open up and stay
And uh, raindrops might fall on my head sometimes
But I don't pay 'em any mind
Christ was here
You just missed him
Now I'm out
Goin down second
To all the stores
To see my friends
To find Kinks vinyls
Yeah...
And when I'm drinking, I get to jokin
Then I'm laughin, fallin down
But that's just fine
And I just pick myself up and walk down
Ghost town
Raindrops might fall on my head sometimes
But I don't pay 'em any mind
Then again, I guess it ain't always that wayEmbed
