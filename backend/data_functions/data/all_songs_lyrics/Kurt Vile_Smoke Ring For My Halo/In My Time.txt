In My Time LyricsIn my day I was young and crazy
Sure I didn't know shit, but now I'm lazy
One day I won't even know what was better
Then again and now I want not much of nothing anyway
Two of us, one on each shoulder, I'm tryin' to turn
We're pullin' over, on this shoulder, ain't driving
I know when I get older, I'm dyin'
But I got everything I need and now
And it's fine now, it's fine now, it's fine
In my time I was whack and wild
I was just being myself then
But then I sat there just tryin' on faces
Wanna erase how discreet disgrace is
Pulling over on the shoulder, ain't driving
Put two of us, one on each shoulder, I'm tryin' to turn
I know when we get older, I'm dyin'
Well, I got everything I need and now
And it's fine now, it's fine now, it's fine1Embed
