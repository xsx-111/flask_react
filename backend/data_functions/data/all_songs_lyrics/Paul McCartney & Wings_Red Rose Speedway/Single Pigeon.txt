Single Pigeon Lyrics
Single pigeon through the railings
Did she throw you out?
Sunday morning fight about Saturday night

Single seagull gliding over Regent's Park Canal
Do you need a pal for a minute or two?
You do?

Me too (me too, me too)
I'm a lot like you
Me too (me too, me too)
I'm a lot like you

Did she turf you out in the cold morning rain
Again?

Me too, me too, me too
I'm a lot like you
Me too, me too, me too
I'm a lot like you
Sunday morning fight about Saturday nightEmbed
