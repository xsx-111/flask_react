Little Lamb Dragonfly Lyrics
I have no answer for you, little lamb
I can help you out, but I cannot help you in
Sometimes you think that life is hard
And this is only one of them
My heart is breaking for you, little lamb
I can help you out, but we may never meet again

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Dragonfly, fly by my window
You and I still have a way to go
Don't know why you hang around my door
I don't live here any more
Since you've gone (Since you've gone), I never know
I go on (I go on), but I miss you so

Dragonfly, don't keep me waiting
(I'm waiting, can't you see me, I'm waiting)
When we try, we'll have a way to go
Dragonfly, you've been away too long
How did two rights make a wrong?
Since you've gone (Since you've gone), I never know (I never know)
I go on (I go on), but I miss you so (I miss you so)
In my heart (In my heart), the feel the pain (feel of pain)
Keeps coming back again
Dragonfly, fly by my window
(I'm flying, can't you see me, I'm flying)
You and I (You and I) can find a way to see (See)
Dragonfly, the years ahead will show
How little we really know
Since you've gone (Since you've gone), it's never right (it's never right)
They go on (they go on), the lonely nights (lonely nights)
Come on home (come on home) and make it right (make it right)

My heart is aching for you little lamb
I can help you out, but I cannot help you in

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la laEmbed
