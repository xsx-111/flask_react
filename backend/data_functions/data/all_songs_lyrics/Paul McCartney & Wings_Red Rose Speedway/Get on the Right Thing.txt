Get on the Right Thing Lyrics

All at once, you get love on your mind
And your world is as kind as a penny
Oh....

Well, you knew it all along
You did the right thing
Believe me it's true
And it can happen to you

All at once, you get sound in your ears
And your cloud disappears into yellow

Well, you know they were wrong
Get on the right thing
Yeah, you knew it all along
Get on the right thing
Believe me it's so
Because I happen to know

Try a little love, you can't go wrong
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
My little love, you can't go wrong
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Do, get on the right thing, you

All at once, we see things in our skies
And we both realize it together

Well, you know they were wrong
Get on the right thing
Yes, you knew it all along
Get on the right thing
Believe me it's so (it's so babe)
Because I happen to know

You can't go wrong
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
You can't go wrong get on the right thing
Ah get on the right thing you
And try a little love
And it can't go wrong
Get on the right thing you
Try a little love, you can't go wrong
Get on the right thing
Oh, get on the right thing you

Try a little love, you can't go wrong
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Try a little love, you can't go wrong
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thing
Get on the right thingEmbed
