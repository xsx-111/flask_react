Medley: Hold Me Tight/Lazy Dynamite/Hands of Love/Power Cut LyricsHold Me Tight
I've waited all my life for you
Hold me tight
Take care of me and I'll be right

Hold me tight, hold me tight
Hold me tight, hugga me right
Hold me tight, squeeza me tight
Hold me tight, hugga me right
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Hold me tight

You won't be going out tonight
Candlelight
Make love to me and make it right

Hold me tight, hold me tight
Hold me tight, hugga me right
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Hug me right, hold me tight
Hold me tight, hold me tight

Well hold me tight, hold me tight
Hold me tight, hugga me right
Hold me tight, squeeza me tight
Hold me tight, hugga me right
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Lazy Dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite

Won't you come out tonight, when the time is right
Oh will you fight that feeling in your heart
Don't you know that inside there's a love you can't hide
So why do you fight that feeling in your heart?

Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, why do you fight that feeling in your heart
Don't you know that inside, there's a love you can't hide
So why do you fight that feeling in your heart?

Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite
Oh, lazy dynamite

Doo doo doo
Hands of Love
I can't get over myself falling into the hands of love
Just can't imagine myself falling head over heels in love
But when I saw you last night I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I can't get over myself falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love

But when I saw you last night I knew for the first time
That you were the one I've been dreaming of
I can't get over myself falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love
Love sweet love
But when I saw you last night I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I can't get over myself falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love
Love sweet love
Power Cut
There may be a power cut
And the candles burn down low
But something inside of me
Says the bad news isn't so

I may never tell you
But baby, you should know
There may be a miracle (miracle, miracle, miracle)
And baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so


I may never tell you
But baby you should know
There may be a miracle (miracle, miracle, miracle)
And baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so

Baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Baby, I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you so
Be I love you soEmbed
