When The Night Lyrics
Well the night (Well the night)
Was beautiful and mellow (Mellow, mellow)
And the light (And the light)
Of the night (Of the night)
Fell on me (Fell on me)

You said right (You said right)
Made me a happy fellow (Fellow, fellow)
And the light (And the light)
Of the night (Of the night)
Fell on me (Fell on me)

I never will forget the night
I held you close, I held you tight
Oh darling, don't you know?
The way you made my senses reel
I fell in love, and now I feel
Like I will never go
Oh little darling, don't you know?

That the night (That the night)
Was marvelous and yellow (Yellow, yellow)
And the light (And the light)
Of the night (Of the night)
Fell on me (Fell on me)
And the light of the night
Fell on me

I never will forget the way
You taught me how to swing and sway
Oh darling, don't you know?
That ever since that special day
My mind can only contemplate
The magic that you show
Oh little darling, don't you know?

That the night (That the night)
Is beautiful and yellow (Yellow, yellow)
And the light (And the light)
Of the night (Of the night)
Fell on me (Fell on me)
Fell on me (Fell on me)

Yeah the light (And the light, of the night)
Fell on me (Fell on me)
Yeah, fell on me (Fell on me)
Oh, the light (And the light, of the night)
Fell on me (Fell on me, fell on me)
Yes the light fell on me
(Fell on me)
(Fell on me)
(Fell on me)
(Fell on me)
(Fell on me)
(Fell on me)Embed
