Big Barn Bed Lyrics

Who's that coming round that corner?
Who's that coming round that bend?
Who's that coming round that corner?
Will they, will they be my friend? (my friend)

Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed

Who you going to weep on, who you going to sleep on
Who you going to creep on next?
Weeping on a willow, sleeping on a pillow
Leaping armadillo, yes

Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Will they, will they be my friend?

Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed

Who you going to weep on, who you going to sleep on
Who you going to creep on next?
Leaping armadillo, weeping on a willow
Sleeping on a pillow, yes

Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed

Keep on, woman1Embed
