This Bitter Earth - On the Nature of Daylight LyricsThis bitter earth
Well, what a fruit it bears
This bitter earth
And if my life is like the dust
Ooh, that hides
The glow of a rose
What good am I?
Heaven only knows
Lord, this bitter earth
Yes, can be so cold
Today you're young
Too soon, you're old
But while a voice within me cries
I'm sure someone may answer my call
And this bitter earth
Ooh, may not, oh, be so bitter after all
This bitter earth
Lord, this bitter earth
What good is love
Mmm, that no one shares?
And if my life is like the dust
Ooh, that hides the glow of a rose
What good am I? (What good am I?)
Heaven only knowsEmbed
