In a Stage Whisper LyricsDon't you sometimes feel
Someone cares
More than you
For the particulars of your own life?
Who held still?
And who walked into the knife?
Did you notice the face
She was wearing
When she stepped into the light?
Everyone wants their own piece of the pain
A lock of hair
Take out your clippers
Tell it in a stage whisper
Sometimes you wonder
How many sneaking fools
Have your number
Is it safe to move in?
Everyone is watching
You're a poster girl or boy
For a long, hot summer
Inches give way to lies
Paint a target on your chest
To make it easy
For the hunters
Everyone enjoys a piece of the pain
A lock of hair
Pull out your clippers
Tell it in a stage whisper
Everyone enjoys a piece of the pain
A lock of hair
Take out your clippers
Tell it in a stage whisperEmbed
