Why Do You Have to Put a Date on Everything LyricsYou've got your muscles in one big knot
Well mine are just loosening
You used to cut me up inside
I won't let you do it again
Make sure the fringe catches the first time
Make sure the flame catches the first time
Why do you have to put a date on everything?
Can't you just strike the bell to hear it ring
Thought that your skin would crack, it's just wrinkling
Why do you have to put a date on everything?
You think that something is turning?
Well it's not spoiled cause i tried it once
And if it's all the same to you at this point
You keep your face and i'll keep the rest
Why do you have to put a date on everything?
Can't you just strike the bell to hear it ring
Thought that your skin would crack, it's just wrinkling
Why do you have to put a date on everything?Embed
