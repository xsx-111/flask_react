Saving My Ticket LyricsWipes a little space at the window
Still can't see too well
And he spits into his hand
Not for luck anymore
Not for luck anymore
Plan to fill it in
Empty my spirit over anyway
All the bets are in
I'm saving my ticket for then
I'm saving my ticket for then
Always expecting the worst
My mouth cracked open spit out a curse
Well timed and well rehearsed
And that's no suprise
And that's no suprise
Plan to fill it in
Empty my spirit over anyway
All the bets are in
I'm saving my ticket for then
I'm saving my ticket for then
They rock back and forth on their heels
He cuts, she deals
They're not comfortable with how this feels
No matter now
No matter now
Plan to fill it in
Empty my spirit over anyway
All the bets are in
I'm saving my ticket for then
I'm saving my ticket for thenEmbed
