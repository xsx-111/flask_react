Water Wings LyricsIn the crowd
The crowd spreads out
Takes out its glasses
And you'd swear
Pulls out arrows from God knows where
The fires in full
They form a net
They drain their cups
And wait expectantly for their hero to blow up
She pointed at the black cloud in the sky
Said that's what happens when you're learning to fly
She pointed at the black cloud in the sky
Said that's what happens when you're learning to fly
She said those wings are just a disguise
And you cannot make me cry
She pointed at the black cloud in the sky
Yeah that's what happens
Was it worth the wait
Is that the wall where you marked off the date
With the wings
Made of wax
Made of water
He was too dumb to accept the offer
He was too smart
Step on into the leather
Fire it up
Pull out the feathers, one by one
As he got closer to the sun
She pointed at the black cloud in the sky
Said that's what happens when you're learning to fly
She pointed at the black cloud in the sky
Said that's what happens when you're learning to fly
She said those wings are just a disguise
And you cannot make me cry
She pointed at the black cloud in the sky
Yeah that's what happens
She pointed at the black cloud in the sky
She said with you it is no use
Why do you tryEmbed
