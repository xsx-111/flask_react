Keeping Track LyricsAll of this is so exhausting
But I don't want it to stop
Rubber ring around my neck
Lead me in circles til I drop
The sound of change beneath the grating
Pull a string and magnet through
Keep track how much this is costing
I'll give it back to you
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping, keeping track?
Can you let the rope down slowly
When you drop me to the dirt?
Can you pull the blanket over
And make this hole not hurt?
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Cause I am not
Cause I am not
All of this is so exhausting
And I am ready for it to stop
All of this has been exhausting
And I am ready
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Are you keeping track?
Cause I am not
Cause I am notEmbed
