Without Blinking LyricsWe kicked over every table
Put our last piece behind the bed
Took some pictures, held them by the edges
Folded every one so they could not be read
Folded all the pictures and the drawings
So they would not know what went on
Subtracted all the good stuff from the bad
So they would not know what went wrong
Did you really do this without thinking?
Or was there some concentration at work?
Cause when you say i'm sorry you were not blinking
You can't pretend to not know how that hurts
You can't pretend to not know now
You can't pretend to not know now
You can't pretend to not know
And even when the scenery looks good
Must you stare down at the floor?
You say that it will not rain upon us
And I could want nothing more
But I will not mark the time
No I just can't start the count
Dig up graves that we knocked over
So I'll meet you when you come down
Did you really do this without thinking?
Or was there some concentration at work?
Cause when you say i'm sorry you were not blinking
You can't pretend to not know how that hurts
You can't pretend to not know now
You can't pretend to not know now
You can't pretend to not know
Someone's biting the hook at both ends
Someone's biting the hook
And makes her spread her legs outEmbed
