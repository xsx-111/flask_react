Stretched Out LyricsLet's not count the last column of beads
Promised me I'd pass, then you present me with these
Letters all in code
Letters all in code
You never taught me how to read
And it's true I have no use
But instead I have a clue
And it's stretching out my skin
So I leave it to you again
All your spinning numbers
Only cross my eyes
And if this record's stuck
I guess that I don't take the prize this time
And it's true I have no use
But instead I have a clue
And it's stretching out my skin
So I leave it to you again
And it's true I have no use
But instead I have a clue
And it's stretching out my skin
So I leave it to you againEmbed
