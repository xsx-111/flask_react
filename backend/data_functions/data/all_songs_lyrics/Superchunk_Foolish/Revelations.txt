Revelations LyricsSo you left me in this disarray
What am i supposed to say
On the pile of blankets and pictures and bourbon
I can never see you the same way again
I need a second alone
You've stolen my call
I thought you'd cut your teeth
But you already need release
That didn't take you too long
One night, i know
But i can't get this out of my head
That someone ?? you ?? the ?ed
The memory kicked me in when you said
These revelations mean nothing
But you make them stick
I need a second alone
You've stolen my call
I thought you'd cut your teeth
But you already need release
That didn't take you too long
Does help you sleep to know
That you meant to keep what you gave away?Embed
