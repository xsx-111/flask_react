Future Shock LyricsWe've got to stop all men
From messing the land
When what we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's the Future Shock
Future Shock
Future Shock (Shock Shock)
Hey, little sister
Where's your brother?
See your momma
Standing on the soup line
Our blessed father
Ain't got the strength to be bothered
The almighty world, hear me, girl
Was bound to weigh him down
We've got to stop all men
From messing the land
When what we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's the Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock
Future Shock (Shock, Shock)
Future Shock
Future Shock
Our worldly figures
They're playing for niggers
Oh, see them dancing
See how they're dancing
To The Superfly
Woo! Yeah, ain't it dumb
When they don't know where we're coming from?
Dancing in our youth
Crying out for truth
To get over, over, over
We've got to stop all men
From messing the land
When what we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's the Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock
Hey, big sister
Where's your mister?
Dress to the pole
Try to get whole
It's all right
What's going on?
You seem always alone
Couldn't raise the bail
Man, he's in jail
Get over
We've got to stop all men
From messing the land
When what we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's the Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Price of the feat
Higher than the dope in the street
Is it any wonder
For those with nothing to eat?
Son's got it made
But still seems so afraid, my friend
There's no love for his brother
No friends for another
Future Shock
Hurts me, going on
Future Shock
Everyone's alone
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Don't know the people
Future Shock
Future Shock
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Everyone's alone
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Don't know the people
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Afraid of the steeple
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Future Shock (Shock, Shock, Shock)
Hurts me, going on, woo-ooh!
Future Shock
Future Shock
Everyone's alone
Future Shock
Future Shock
Don't know the people
Future Shock
Afraid, afraid of the steeple
Future Shock
Future Shock
Woo!
Future Shock
Future Shock
Not a lotta thinkers
