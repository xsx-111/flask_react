See Me Through, Pt. II (Just a Closer Walk with Thee) Lyrics
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus if you please
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee
I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, dear lord, close to Thee

See me through days of wine and roses
By and by when the morning comes
Just a closer walk with Thee
Jazz and blues and folk, poetry and jazz
Voice and music, music and no music
Grant it Jesus if you please
Silence and then voice
Music and writing, words
I'll be satisfied as long
Memories, memories way back
Take me way back, Hyndford Street and Hank Williams
As I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee
Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet on Sunday afternoons in winter
Sidney Bechet, Sunday afternoons in winter
I am weak but Thou art strong
And the tuning in of stations in Europe on the wireless
Before, yes before this was the way it was
Jesus keep me from all wrong
More silence, more breathing together
Not rushing, being
I'll be satisfied as long
Before rock `n' roll, before television
Previous, previous, previous
As I walk, dear lord, close to Thee
See me through, just a closer walk with Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus if you please
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee
I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, dear Lord, close to TheeEmbed
