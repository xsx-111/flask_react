By His Grace Lyrics
You've got to try for the kingdom
You've got to try for the kingdom
On high, you've got to try
By His grace
By His grace

You've got to live your religion
Deep inside when you try
For the kingdom on high
By His grace
By His grace (Mmm)

Open your mind to the wisdom
When you try for the kingdom
On high
By His grace
By His grace (Ooh)

Open your heart to the wisdom
In your mind when you try
For the kingdom on high
By His grace
By His grace (Mmm, yeah)
One day at a time, you got to try
Open your eye, it will come
By and by when you try
By His grace
By His grace (Yeah)
By His grace
By His graceEmbed
