So Complicated LyricsSo complicated, so complicated
Just wanna blow my horn
So complicated, so complicated
Just wanna know the score
Are you telling me that everything's fine
When I can't even tie my shoes
Better get into a new frame of mind
When I don't have to think about the business no more
'Cause I just wanna blow my horn
The telephone is ringing out
But it don't understand my blues
And how much longer will it take
Until they get the news
The weather man said it was good
He forecast it was truly great
So if you change your train of thought
You know it won't be late
Too complicated, too complicated
You know this crazy scene
Too complicated, too complicated
No one says what they mean
Are you telling me that everything's fine
When I can't even tie my shoes
Better get into a new frame of mind
When I don't have to think about the business no more
'Cause I just wanna blow my hornEmbed
