Some Peace of Mind LyricsYou see me on the street, well you guess I'm doing fine
But it's hustle, hustle baby, almost all the time
I've got to get away, get away by myself
Oh the way it's going now, can't you see I need some help
'Cause I'm just a man, doing the best I can
Don't you understand, I just want some peace of mind
You see me on the stage, on the stage doing my job
I learn to do it well, keep on singing, singing the song
But it gets so lonely sometimes, lonely out there
When you're on the road again but you're going nowhere
Because I'm just a man, just a man, I ain't got no master plan (got no master plan)
Don't you understand, I'm just try'n, try'n to find some peace of mind
I have to stand in line, baby when I'm in a queue
I've got to do the mundane things in life, just the same as you
Got my doubts about it, oh but I try
To make it work, make it work, make it work with tears in my eyes
Because I'm just a man, just a man, trying to do the best I can, do the best I can
I want you to understand, understand, you gotta get me some peace of mind
Alright
Oh I'm just a man, baby I ain't got no master plan (No matter what)
I want you to try and understand, understand, you got to give me some peace of mind
Got to get, got to get, got to get some
Got to get some peace of mind, peace of mind
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get
Got to get some peace of mind
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get, got to, got to get, got to, got to get, got to, got to get some peace of mind
Got to, got to, got to... got to get some, get some peace of mindEmbed
