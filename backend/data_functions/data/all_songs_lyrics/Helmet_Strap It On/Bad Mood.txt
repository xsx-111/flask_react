Bad Mood LyricsIt's no bad mood
It's a look you thought might kill
But you knew better
Wake up cold
Do you know you're not dead?
You make the same mistake
You've lost your head
Rearrange events again
Let them suit your next complaint
Self-absorbed
You're all wrapped up
So deep inside
Just think bland thoughts
Bad, good
Bad, good
Bad, goodEmbed
