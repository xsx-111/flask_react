Distracted LyricsConsolation don't account for it
Healing helpless want to look like this
Bet distraction whips it out of you
Pay to see it suck you down there too
Don't walk
One fuck now boost my self-esteem
One weak not a word sounds comforting
Beg forgiveness started back again
One for me said dig it deep and then...
You walkEmbed
