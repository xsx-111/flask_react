Sinatra LyricsI can't move her
Obsessed with protection
This is a bad idea
She needs affection
What, me?
Drive around town
Forced to talk
Pass that church again
Where's a parking spot?
It's Sinatra's world
She just lives here
I hate everything
As much as I hate me
What's the best for me?
What's the best for me?
What's the best for me?
What's the best for me?
She doesn't see me
I don't care
Just move around some
And fix your stare
I had more fun
Took half the time
Cost three bucks
Buy a magazine, oh
What's the best for me?
What's the best for me?
What's the best for me?
What's the best? YeahEmbed
