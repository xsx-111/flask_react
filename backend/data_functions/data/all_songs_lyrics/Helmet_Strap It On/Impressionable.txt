Impressionable LyricsSo sensitive
The creative mind
You say to yourself
It's just a matter of time
Recognition
By 9pm
What pays the bills
You know who to be seen with
So

So
You find a dog
You pretend he's blind
Fashionable
You're a merchant mind
Defintion
You forget you're a pope
There's a sense of mentalitiy
Of a pathetic oaf
So

Make money on something
He's a game show host
His memory
Has got to go
Newset left hand
Gor the teenage go
