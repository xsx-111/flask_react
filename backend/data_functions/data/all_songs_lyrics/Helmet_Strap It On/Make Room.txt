Make Room LyricsEmbrace the motivation goes
Passed off as unintentional
One look showed you had to think
Eat this and say it doesn't reek
Right
Make room you come with open arms
Talk fast before the greeting starts
Incensed you know you need to know
Whose scene you made you didn't though
Sad
Taste of the month
Voice for the cause
Make room you come
With open armsEmbed
