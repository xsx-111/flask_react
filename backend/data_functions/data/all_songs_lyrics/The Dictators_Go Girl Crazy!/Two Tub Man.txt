Two Tub Man LyricsTwo Tub Man
I am a pilgrim looking for danger
I am an outlaw, I am a stranger
I'm just a clown walking down the street
I think Lou Reed is a creep
I need a girl I need release
I can go anywhere, people look and people stare
They all know that I'm the one, not to let your son become
What I want to do I do, who I want to screw I screw
Playin in a heavy band, guess I'm just a Two Tub Man
I drink Coca cola for breakfast
I've got Jackie Onassis in my pants
I'm never gonna watch channel 13
Edjumacation ain't for me
I'm so drunk I can barely see
I can go anywhere, people look and people stare
They all know that I'm the one, not to let your son become
What I want to do I do, who I want to screw I screw
Playin in a heavy band, guess I'm just a Two Tub Man
I never graduated from high school
I wore paisley I was too cool
I think color TV's a gas
I think Joe Franklin is real flash
I don't mind if I gotta kick your ass
I can go anywhere, people look and people stare
They all know that I'm the one, not to let your son become
What I want to do I do, who I want to screw I screw
Playin in a heavy band, guess I'm just a Two Tub Man1Embed
