I Got You Babe LyricsThey say we're young and we don't know
Won't find out 'til we grow
Well, I don't know if all that's true
You got me and baby, I got you
Babe, I got you babe, I got you babe
They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned our money's always spent
I guess that's so we don't have a fight
At least I'm sure of all the things we got
Oh, babe, I got you babe, I got you babe
I've got flowers in the spring
I've got you to wear my ring
Don't let them say, we are a cloud
And if I get scared you're always around
Don't let them say your hair's too long
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb
Babe, I got you babe, I got you babe, I got you
I got you to hold my hand
And I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
And I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to just hold me tight
I got you and I won't let go
I got you oh, woh, oh, oh
I got you babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you babeEmbed
