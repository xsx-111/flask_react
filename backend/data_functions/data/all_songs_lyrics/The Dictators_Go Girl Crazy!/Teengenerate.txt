Teengenerate LyricsWho's that boy with the sandwich in his hand?
You won't miss me, even though you can
He could make a dead dog laugh
And watch me kick my mother on her ass
He's no boy and yet he ain't no man
He don't know what he's gonna do
In three years, I'm gonna be twenty-two-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo
All his friends think he's great
I'm their favorite degenerate
You might say he's just too crazy for you
BRIDGE
I'm the most outrageous
Hope it's not contagious
All the world's got a one-way ticket to heck, to heck, to heck
You can bet that he's no Mickey Mouse
Give me an hour, and I'll destroy your house
Eatin' eggs (?) all day long
Sleepin' with the TV on
He looks just like you, turn him inside out (x 3)Embed
