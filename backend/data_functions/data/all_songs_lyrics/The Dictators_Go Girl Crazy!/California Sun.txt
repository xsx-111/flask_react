California Sun LyricsWell, I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long
And I walk (and I walk) and I'd run (and I'd run)
And I'd fly (and I'd fly) and I'd boogaloo (and I'd boogaloo)
Where they're out there having fun in the warm california sun
Well, I'm going out west out on the coast
Ah yeah, the Santa Rosa chicks, man, they're really the most
And I'd jerk (and I'd jerk) and I'd monkey (and I'd monkey)
And I'd groove (and I'd groove) and I'd boogaloo-ooo-ooo (and I'd boogaloo)
Where they're out there having fun in the warm california sun
And I'd shake (and I'd shake) and I'd skate (and I'd skate)
And I'd shake (and I'd shake) and I'd boogaloo (and I'd boogaloo)
Where they're out there having fun in the warm california sun
Well, the girls are frisky in old 'frisco
Yeah, a pretty little chick, now, wherever I go
And I'd mouse (and I'd mouse) and I'd robot (and I'd robot)
And I'd twist (and I'd twist) and I'd shistaboobah (and I'd WHAT?)
Where they're out there having fun in the warm california sun
