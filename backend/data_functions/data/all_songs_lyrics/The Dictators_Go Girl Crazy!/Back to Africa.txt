Back to Africa LyricsOh, she runs through the jungle on a panther back, now
Drunker than a chocolate cake now
She want's to be a singer in America
I told her I could give her a break
Well I've been to England and I've been to Siam
And I love the girls wherever I go
But this one's love put a hole in my heart
Africa is always home
I think that I love you
You're too free to care
Religion will save you
Civilization's here
I wanna go back to Africa (x4)
I wanna goEmbed
