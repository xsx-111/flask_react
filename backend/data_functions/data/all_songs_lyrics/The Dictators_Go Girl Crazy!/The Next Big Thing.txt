The Next Big Thing LyricsI used to shiver in the wings
But then I was young
I used to shiver in the wings
Till I found my own tongue
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know baby
I'm the Next Big Thing
I knocked 'em dead in Dallas
And I didn't pay my dues
Yeah, I knocked 'em dead in Dallas
They didn't know we were Jews
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know baby
I'm the Next Big Thing
I'm a fuel injected legend
I don't wanna be a bore
I just wanna live a rich life
And I wanna die poor
Poor
Poor
Poor
Poor
Poor
Sorry baby, I just can't get it on anymore
But I won't be happy
Till I'm known far and wide
With my face on the cover
Of the TV guide
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know baby
I'm the Next Big Thing
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know baby
I'm the Next Big Thing
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know baby
I'm the Next Big Thing
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know baby
I'm the Next Big Thing
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know baby
I'm the Next Big Thing
I sock 'em everywhere that I sing
Cause you know babyEmbed
