Weekend LyricsOh Weekend
Benny took downs in class
The principal found his stash
His mother's gonna get his ass
Oh Weekend
In his room he'll stay
Dreamin when he's king he'll say
Everyday is Saturday
Set me free
I might know better when I'm older
But until then
Just give me a sopor for the weekend
Oh Weekend
Bobby is a local punk
Cuttin school and getting drunk
Eating at Mcdonald's for lunch
Oh Weekend
Soon he threw up in the store
But if he does it anymore
I'll make him eat it off the floor
Set me free
I might know better when I'm older
But until then
Just give me a sopor for the weekend
Oh Weekend
Time to go a bit insane
Beatin up the kids from Spain
I'm tired of this social change
Oh Weekend
Flashing rock and roll guitars
Cruising in my daddy's car
I'll do my homework in the bar
Set me free
I might know better when I'm older
But until then
Just give me a sopor for the weekendEmbed
