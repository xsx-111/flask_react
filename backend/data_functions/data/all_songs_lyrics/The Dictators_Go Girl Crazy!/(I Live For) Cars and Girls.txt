(I Live For) Cars and Girls LyricsWell I'm the type of guy who's into getting high
On a Friday afternoon
So now you know I'm a regular Joe
And I'll tell you what I like to do
I like to make the scene
In my machine
I like to make the scene
I leave 'em in another state
Whenever I accelerate
I live for Cars and girls, cars and girls
I live for Car, cars and girls
I live for Cars and girls, cars and girls
I live for Car, cars and girls
There's nothing else in this crazy world
Except for cars and girls
I got a lot of good sittin' under my hood
But it doesn't make me feel alright
The only time I'm feelin fine
Is when my baby's sittin tight
I like to get it down
I like to feel the sound
I like to get it down
I leave 'em in another state
Whenever I accelerate
I live for Cars and girls, cars and girls
I live for Car, cars and girls
I live for Cars and girls, cars and girls
I live for Car, cars and girls
There's nothing else in this crazy world
Baby you and me will go
A cruisin everywhere we know
We'll take a trip out to the west
Cause the coast's the most
Cause the surfin's best
The fastest car and a movie star
Are my only goals in life
It's the hippest scene, the American dream
And for that I'll always fight
I like to get it down
I like to feel the sound
I like to get it down
I wanna drive the fastest car
I wanna drive the fastest car
I wanna drive the fastest car
Cars, girls, surfin beer
Nothin else matter here
I live for Cars and girls, cars and girls
I live for Car, cars and girls
I live for Cars and girls, cars and girls
I live for Car, cars and girls
There's nothing else in this goddamn world
Except for cars and girlsEmbed
