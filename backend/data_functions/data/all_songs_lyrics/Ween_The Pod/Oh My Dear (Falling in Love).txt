Oh My Dear (Falling in Love) LyricsTell me where you come from. Was it heaven above?
Oh my dear, I must be falling in love
Can you climb the sunny peaks of a fortress in mud?
Oh my dear, I must be falling in love
Did I tell you I want more than you're really made of?
Oh my dear, I must be falling in love
Can you scope a purple blunder and admit that you are young?
Oh my dear, I must be falling in loveEmbed
