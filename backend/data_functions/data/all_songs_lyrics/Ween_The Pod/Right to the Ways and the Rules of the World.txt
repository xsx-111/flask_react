Right to the Ways and the Rules of the World LyricsMonsters that twinkle like cats in the night
The cosmic conceiver continues his plight
A war of the heavens, what's wrong and what's right
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Spraying the children with incense and myrrh
The hopeless confessions of minds unsure
Spraying the children with incense and myrrh
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
I tried to come over and see you today
I tried to come over to want you to say
I wanted you say to come today
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Mindlessly hoping she falls for their minds
Holding the sacraments, secrets unkind
Chewing the curdles of cream from the rain
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Chewing the grits...
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Monsters that tinkle, twinkle... the jam's gone astray...
It's cool dude, we gotta fill up the whole thingEmbed
