Pork Roll Egg and Cheese LyricsWhen you've had your fun, and your work is done
You must not succumb
I can feel you breathe. It's like a mega-weedge inside
Please don't hide
So mom, if you please
Pass me the pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, on a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please
Pass me the pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, on a kaiser bun
When the guava's drained, Eddie Dingle remains
But we must further ourselves on
So dynamic is life, staring into the sight's
Not right, but wrong in a good way
So mom, if you please
Pass me the pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, on a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please
Pass me the pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, on a kaiser bun
When you've had your fun, and your work is done
You must not succumb
I can feel you breathe. It's like a mega-weedge inside
Please don't hide
So mom, if you please
Pass me the pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, on a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please
Pass me the pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, on a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please
Pass me the pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, on a kaiser bun
Kaiser bun
Pork roll egg and cheese
(That's the end!)Embed
