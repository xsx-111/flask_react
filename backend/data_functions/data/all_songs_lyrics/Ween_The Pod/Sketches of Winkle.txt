Sketches of Winkle LyricsWell she danced like a floozie in a hot tub of guava
Aching 'round the scene, you know he's hip to her mantra
He was a meditated fucker all strung-out on Sinatra
Sketching Van Winkle like there ain't no tomorr-a
I saw Van Winkle show up on the scene
I'm rubbing elbows when I saw that's he's been doing all those
Sketches of Winkle -- crying to the heavens in a fit of rage
Sketches of Winkle -- keeping little pumas locked up in a cage
Sketches of Winkle -- I think I love her but she don't love me
Sketches of Winkle -- why don't she love me, dude?
(I don't know)
She drained all the fluid from the sink in the kitchen
Aching round these bitches all he's doing is bitchin'
Steven said he went and bought a new pair of mittens
Mean Ween cut me and he said he was kidding
I saw Van Winkle show up on the scene
I'm rubbing elbows when I saw that's he's been doing all those
Sketches of Winkle -- crying to the heavens in a fit of rage
Sketches of Winkle -- keeping little pumas locked up in a cage
Sketches of winkle -- I think I love her but she don't love me
Sketches of Winkle -- why don't she love me, dude?
(I don't know)
Rip Van Winkle -- Rip Rip Rip Van Winkle
