Pollo Asado LyricsCome on, it's a beautiful night for a walk on the beach, wouldn't you say?
Yes, I would say that, I would say that
Let me start off with a basket of chips
Then move on to the pollo asado taco
I would like two pollo asado tacos with one beef chimichanga
On the chimichanga, I would like a side of sour cream
I would like tomatoes and onions on my quesadilla
For the dessert I would like the sopapillas. I would like extra cinnamon
Do you make guacamole?
Yes, I do make guacamole
Uh, I would like a side of guacamole on my Tostitos
I like to dip the Tostitos in the guacamole
Can I get a basket, I told you about a basket of chips
I would like a large iced-tea, 2, uh, 2 large iced-teas
Ok, that'll be $16.07
Out of $20? Ok, $16.07's your change
Hi, can I help you?
I would like a basket of chips
A beef chimichanga with a side of sour cream
I would like some guacamole on my chimichanga
With a quesadilla of tomato, onion, and vegetables
I should like a burrito with beans, beef, and
I would like a carne asado taco
Could you put some hot sauce on that for me?
No, inside the taco. Not on the side
Yes, can I have a carne asado taco?
Not a pollo asado, we don't have chicken
Do you have guacamole?
Can you make me some guacamole?
I have guacamole
Ok, on my burrito I would like the muchaco beef and the shredded pork
And some more cheese, please
Ok, that'll be $22...
Uh, oh yes, I would like two lemonades and one medium iced-tea
Ok, that'll be $20.07
Out of $22? Ok, $1.52's your change
Thanks a lot. Your food will be up. Here, let me get your drinks
Hi, can I help you?
Yes, I would like a basket of chips
I would like a beef chimi...
Uh, what is, what is the, what is the, what is the pollo asado?
That's the chicken
Ok, what is the carne asado?
That's the beef
Ok, let me get two carne asado tacos...3Embed
