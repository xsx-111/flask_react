Mononucleosis LyricsWhen you came into the pod
You told me that something was wrong
Said you wasn't having no more fun
And you want to lick the sun
Couldn't say it was any fun
Oh, dude
Now, you're on the couch
You can't even move your fucking head
Tell me that you wish you was dead
Dude, I really don't wish you was dead
Better stay in your sweaty mucus bed
Oh, dude
I can't have a smoke
Can't even enjoy a little brew
What the hell's my buggy gonna do?
Can't even pet the horsies in the zoo
Little Miss Mandee's in this too
Oh, dude1Embed
