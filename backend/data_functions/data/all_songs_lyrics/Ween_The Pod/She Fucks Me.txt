She Fucks Me Lyrics
Pork roll, egg and cheese, on a kaiser bun
Pork roll, egg and cheese, on a kaiser bun

I met her at the Living Earth Show
She crossed the room, the lights sank low
We're together, she really digs me
She fucks me

Who would think I could be so happy?
When I'm cold, I know she's keepin' me warm
We're together, she really digs me
She fucks me

She's in my arms, she's in my heart, yeah
Pins and needles up and down my spine
We're together, she really digs me now
She fucks me

I met her at the Living Earth Show
She crossed the room, the lights sank low
We're together, she really digs me
She fucks me
Who would think I could be so happy?
When I'm cold, she's keepin' me warm
When we're together, she really digs me
She fucks me

She's in my arms, she's in my heart, yeah
Pins and needles up and down my spine
We're together, she really digs me now
She fucks me

She fucks me
She fucks me
She fucks me
She fucks me
She fucks me
She fucks me
She fucks me now, yeah1Embed
