The Stallion Pt. 1 LyricsYou crazy son of a bitch
Goddamn motherfucker
Do you know who you're fucking with?
You're fucking with the stallion, mang
You're fucking with the goddamn stallion, mang
You're fucking with the stallion, mang
Goddamn piece of shit
On my dick you should sit
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Prancing stallion, over hillside
Prancing on the grass
I'm the fucking stallion, mang
The stallion
I'm the fucking stallion, mang
The stallion
I am the stallion, mang
You get it?
I am the stallion, mang
You get it?
You see that I'm staying, mang...
You goddamn son of a bitch
You fucking piece of shit
Prancing stallions
Running through the meadow
Prancing stallion
Running over hillside
One must not fear to see the stallion
Now you stallion, drink it with a big gulp
I do not fear, I can see the stallion
Hence you forth will too be the stallion
I'm the man who must ride the stallion
It is I who rides the stallion
Goddamn son of a bitch
Goddamn piece of shit
Now it's clear, I can see stallion
Yes, I too can spot the little stallionEmbed
