Frank LyricsFrank, give me a pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, with some gravy fries
Sank into a greasy mega-weege
And I sneezed and it blew my mind
Time: it's in the hand of God
Chew on turkey or some cod if you please
Frank, give me a pork roll egg and cheese
If you please, with some gravy friesEmbed
