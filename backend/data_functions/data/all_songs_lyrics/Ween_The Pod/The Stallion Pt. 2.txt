The Stallion Pt. 2 LyricsFor hither not, I am the stallion
Come fear, come love, I am the stallion
You know that I am the stallion, mang
I am, I am the stallion, mang
You know that I am the stallion, mang
I live, I walk, I am the stallion, mang
Hair-throng goo-tongue, stallion mang
A 2 S-T-A-L-L-I-O-N
I am the stallion, mang
1: I can drink
2: I get groomed
3: I go for a walk
I am the stallion, mang
You know that I am the stallion, mang
Deaner! Deaner! Dude!
Where can you be?
Come hither
Who are you? The stallion
Deaner: What's goin' on?
Who are you, Deaner?
Deaner: I am, I am the stallion
You are the stallion
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-S-S-T-A-L-L-I-O-N
I am the stallion, mang
I can feel what I like to see in you and me and the stallion
I can play, I get to take the water because I am the stallion
O-P-L-G-H-M-F-S-T-A-L-L-I-O-N
Stallion, mang. Stallion, mang. Stallion, mang
I am the stallion
Wild stallion
Wild stallion.  Goodbye
Stallion.  Stallion. Goodbye
Stallion! Stallion! Stallion! Stallion! Stallion! Stallion, mmm, stallion!
Whenever forth to come hither, when I can see the wind
I shall too ride upon the stallion
I shall too lick the palm of the stallion
Whilst I drink the hair from the stallion. Mang
I am the stallionEmbed
