Moving Away LyricsGone away, gone away
Moving away, yeah
Moving away, yeah
All I wanted to say, girl
Ah, moving away
Left with my own blues
'Cause I love you, ahhh
Left here all alone, yeah
Left alone here to sing this song
Can't believe that you're gone
I love you, baby
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah, ah
Can't believe it, baby, ahhh
Ahhh, can't believe it
I feel my lovin' and I need you
I feel my lovin' and I need you, baby
Baby, yeah
I need you babyEmbed
