Strap On That Jammypac LyricsStrap on that there jammypac
Get a grip on your soul
Sip on that there family flask
And I'll guide you towards the door
She don't feed me in the morning
And I can't take no more
So strap on that there jammypac
And get up off my floor
Strap on that there jammypac
And slide a double dime my way
Dry off your distributor cap
And hip me to the game you play
Shes jonesing for a jammy
With a girl that I call Tammy
So strap on that there jammypac
It's time for you to pay
Strap on that there jammypac
Get hip to taekwondo
Stings you like a heart attack
Van Winkle says fuck you
Never made me no supper
A boy like me needs it, too
So strap on that there jammypac
It's time to pay your dueEmbed
