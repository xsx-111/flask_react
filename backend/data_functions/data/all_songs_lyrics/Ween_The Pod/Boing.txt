Boing LyricsYou know, she's smooth as a poodle licking shit on a shingle at dawn
Rip, Rip, Rip van Winkle, he can shit on a shingle at dawn
Would you like to do a boing, boing, boing, boing?
She's a fun-lovin' woman and I'd love to see her wiggle
She's a rooty-toot kid with a piggy in the middle
She'd like to do a boing, boing, boing... boing?
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh, yeahEmbed
