Dr. Rock LyricsI tried modulating and articulating
All the feelings that I have for you
(Dr. Rock) Help me out for I need to shout it
(Dr. Rock) Quickly Derek run and get your mammy
There is no denying all you've been supplying
Is a slathering ball of flesh
(Dr. Rock) The light of death is gonna shine again
(Dr. Rock) And I'll let you in with no restraint
(Let's just do it again)
Don't conceal your tragic flaw
Give the Dr. Rock a call
(Dr. Rock) Come quickly to see the scene
(Dr. Rock) Got everything that you need
You're the
You're the apple of my eye
But with some aid I feel you'll die
(Dr. Rock) Save the soul from a bottomless pit
(Dr. Rock) See what you can make of it
You like the s-
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh
You like the suffocating of a small crustacean
As you hammered your way to the truth
(Dr. Rock) But as examined by an Indian eye
(Dr. Rock) Another lie that you're going to die
I tried a-modulating and articulating
All the feelings that I have for you
(Dr. Rock) Help me out for I need to shout it
(Dr. Rock) Quick Derek run and get your mammy
Ahhhh, ahhhh1Embed
