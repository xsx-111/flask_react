Captain Fantasy LyricsPlease would you like to be
Somewhere floating free
Seems my destiny's
Captain Fantasy
Take a bit and go down
Beneath the reaches of sound
You could be with me
Captain Fantasy
And when I'm there, I'm here
And when you're near, I'm there
The only words in your life
Captain Fantasy
And when I'm here, I'm there
And when you're near, I'm here
The only words in your life
Captain Fantasy
Please would you like to be
Somewhere floating free
Seems my destiny's
Captain Fantasy
So take a bit and go down
Beneath the reaches of sound
You could be with me
Captain Fantasy
And when I'm there, I'm here
And when you're near, I'm there
The only words in your life
Captain Fantasy
And when I'm here, I'm there
And when you're near, I'm here
The only words in your life
Captain Fantasy
Wow!
Yeah!
Aaah! Hee-haa!
Hee ohhhh
Fantasy
Fantasy
So please would you like to be
Somewhere floating free
Seems my destiny's
Captain Fantasy
Uhn, take a bit and go down
Beneath the reaches of sound
You could be with me
Captain Fantasy
