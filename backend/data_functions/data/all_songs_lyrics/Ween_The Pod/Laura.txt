Laura LyricsDud'n dud'n dud'n dud'n, dud'n dud'n dud'n dud'n
The grain bag sits on the chair, and why the hell am I with you?
And if you told me that it wasn't there, why the hell am I with you?
You know I really don't care, and why the hell now with you?
I told my mommy that it was okay, and why the hell now with you?
Laura -- Laura
Oh baby I cut myself
And if you threw the garbage away, why the hell am I with you?
And if you knew you wanted to stay, then why the hell now with you?
Little Eddie Dingle is going away, and why the hell now with you?
Somebody wants to come and play, and why the hell am I with you?
Laura -- Laura
You know something? I've got something -- I've got something --
I've got something for all the people in the world1Embed
