Bastogne Blues Lyrics
I was hid behind the big tree that was knocked down or fallen
And I could see these Germans in the woods across this big field
And I saw this young kid crawling up a ditch straight towards my tree, so I let him crawl
I didn’t fire at him, but when he got up within three or four foot of me, I screamed at him to surrender
And instead of surrendering he started to pull his gun towards me, which was instant death for him
But this young man, he was a blonde, blue eyes, fair skin, so handsome, he was like a little angel
But I still had to shoot him, and it didn’t bother me the first night, because I went to sleep and I was so tired
But, the second night, I woke up crying, because that kid was there…
And to this day, I wake up many nights crying over this kid…
I still see him in my dreams and I don’t know how to get him off my mind

Men would fall on both sides, the attacks did surprise
I earned my colours true, as I lay dying with you in the forests of the Ardennes Mountains
Storms in the sky, the planes could not fly
Their sly minds desire, of trying to try, to reach the Meuse River in four (4) days
I know brother, we fear, and our wives are not near, and your child's unborn
Does here come the death? This daring we're reading of
The wind was too strong. Your war crimes are a rude sight, in Malmedy that night
In some SS fucks mind the thoughts come up to decide on the massacre of 84 men
So near, so far, the end of this War. Push your final offensive here on the Western Front
Where you try to divide us, but there's a line, where you'll retreat, defeated; Siegfried
Then the weather allowed a force to the sky, all progression needs fuel
Yet you try to pursue, or thieve it in your failed operations
Country wide, the levee's are smeared with my brother's demise
I'm trying to try, to remember some beautiful days
Your war crimes are a rude sight, in Malmedy that night
In some SS fucks mind the thoughts come up to decide on the massacre of 84 men
I know brother, we fear, and our wives are not near, and your child's unborn
Does here come the death? This daring we're reading of. The wind was too strong
So near, so far, the end of this War. Push your final offensive here on the Western Front
Where you try to divide us, but there's a line, where you'll retreat, defeated; The End3Embed
