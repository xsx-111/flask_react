Troublemaker Lyrics- "No, Sir." Why "No, Sir"? Why do you think you would not do it again?
- Because they'd send me back to this place, Sir. "Because they would send me back to this place, Sir."
- A conditioned response indicating fear of reprisal. There's no moral sense at work here at all
- In my experience psychopaths rarely show the least sign of inner change or development. "Vulpes pilum mutat, non mores", as they say
- The leopard never changes his spots
- Wolf, Sir
- Did you speak, boy?
- Sorry, Sir, but vulpes means wolf, Sir. "Vulpes pilum mutat, non mores" means, literally...
...the wolf changes its fur but not its nature
In 1605 he recoiled against the state
Packed explosives underground
Companions play out their roles like some game of chess, make diplomacy unsound
The grails man desires he destroys through the greed in his head
The Protestant King may go down, Trouble Maker was bred
Friends, trouble may rise and trouble may ebb
Of makers and weavers of lies, carefully tread
Trouble may rise, and trouble may ebb
Step back and envisage the whole game
The shipwrecked East End economic underclass knew of his modus operandi
His thrusting and cutting weapons put scars on faces so they'd stand out in a crowd
Whores talked too much for him
Trades in desire he wanted dead
This horse needs a cage not a stall
Trouble Maker was bred
Friends, trouble may rise and trouble may ebb
Of makers and weavers of lies, carefully tread
Trouble may rise, and trouble may ebb
Step back and envisage the whole game
There's ways out. We've seen them
We've heard those whispers spoken (of) corners inside this maze
Where Trouble Makers wills lay broken
Friends, trouble may rise and trouble may ebb
Of makers and weavers of lies, carefully tread
Trouble may rise, and trouble may ebb
Step back and envisage the whole gameEmbed
