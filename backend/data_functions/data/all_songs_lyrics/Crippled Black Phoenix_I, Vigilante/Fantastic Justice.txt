Fantastic Justice LyricsI had a terrible vision on the last night
I realised before we can approach we must separate
No system brings me down, so I won't let this be
As I sneak over in case our fires collide, medications for old and for wise
Thought I trusted her before, now I sigh at the logic, it sways from the left to the right
Then your mother comes over, improving her pace, as she's sinking her nails in a different face
And my brother was never afraid of the cold when his liver it failed at just nineteen years old
If you give me more time, I won't make you be dead
And I'll look to the side when you're walking ahead
I dare you one more time, try and fall in my way
With your whispers and secret and lies, it is her you betray
The justice will be so fantastic, crow's leaving
The Shitehawks will fall when their tails are re-feathered with lead
Truth's the first virtue in systems. Justice is trickery in my head
A terrible past situation I never took heed of your leading mind
Holler more! We shriek for the for the fights tonight
How we shriek for the for the fights
My head's seeing signs in your movements, like my eyes are an all seeing ocean
Distributive restorative enemies welcome in all the movemenets we need to breath
All the visions on our last night never appeared till you spoke all your fears
I'm struggling to see, and the crow is a fake
I'm hoping to change but you're walking away
Throw the coals to the fire so the levee may break
Dams will be busted so Justice will finally be made
Crow's private flight maps my leanings in life
And I love that bird more than it knows
Crow's private flight holds some inside its sights
And they hate that bird more than it knowsEmbed
