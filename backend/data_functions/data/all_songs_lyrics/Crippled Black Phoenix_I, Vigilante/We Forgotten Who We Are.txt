We Forgotten Who We Are LyricsWe've forgotten who we are as men
Make their own history, still they know
They are chained and bound by all the past
Traditions of dead generations
So let's raise this bitter glass to us never getting through
When I look into your eyes, I can see you see it too
For I know that you believe in truth I try to channel Hughes
Though you doubt me inconsequentially it gives me more to prove
Was there some hidden grin within your face when we met last win-
Ter? Our past still looms over us as we pretend to be friends. We
Exist through history, inquiry and knowledge acquired by
Investigation. You're like some poor Pharaoh, (but) no more meek tales of past
Seasons, for tonight we must make haste. You are the hunted King, un-
Crowned. Cars collide with horses, like mere stings of Civilisations
'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'
