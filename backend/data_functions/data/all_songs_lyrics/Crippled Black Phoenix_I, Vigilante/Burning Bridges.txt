Burning Bridges LyricsFriends all tried to warn me but I held my head up high
All the time they warned me but I only passed them by
They all tried to tell me but I guess I didn't care
I turned my back and left them standing there
All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore
Joey tried to help me find a job a while ago
When I finally got it I didn't want to go
The party Mary gave for me when I just walked away
Now there's nothing left for me to say
All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore
Years have passed and I keep thinking what a fool I've been
I look back into the past and think of way back then
I know that I lost everything I thought I that could win
I guess I should have listened to my friends
All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore
Burning bridges lost forevermoreEmbed
