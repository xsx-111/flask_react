Sticky Hulks LyricsAstral seasons drift on by
And waver in the light
Stretching on through time
As a soul could surely be
For all eternity
It's present in a sigh
At a pace so patiently
Waiting there for you and me
Drifting all the while
And the ticking of the clock
And the ringing of the stocks
Are relics of our lives  (?)
Our love flows on endlessly
Our love is pure and free
A vast and depthless sea
Astral seasons drift on by
And waver in the light
Stretching on through time
As a soul could surely be
For all eternity
It's present in a sigh
At a pace so patiently
Waiting there for you and me
Drifting all the whileEmbed
