Poor Queen LyricsI'm spinning right away
I feel sick and tired
But who's on the streets today?
Who's on the same pages, Oh Yeah?
And who will knock upon my door
All is right
All is right
A teenage Queen
Is locked up tight tonight
And on the streets
They cry "Hurray!"
The Queen will live
To see another day
She's slipping right away
She feels sick and tired
"But who's on the streets" she'd ask
"Where are my sweet pages
Oh yeah!
Will they knock upon my door?"
All is right all is right
Little Queen
She cried herself to sleep
Last night
But fear not
My little Queen
The people still love you
It would seemEmbed
