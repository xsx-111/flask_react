Withered Hand LyricsPluck your eyes out
With the master's withered hand
Where the planets
Grope around without a plan
On your knees now
Because you'll only suffer more
You must suffer
Yes, you mustn't only die
And the heavens
Grinding down, you can't be well
Hanging heavy in a sky
As black as oil
Crawling slowly
Face down in the muck
Crawling slowly
With an outstretched
Withered handEmbed
