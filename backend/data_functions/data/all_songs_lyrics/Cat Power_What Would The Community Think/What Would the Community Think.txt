What Would the Community Think LyricsMy God, what would the community think?
You are so beautiful, you are so beautiful
All the things that people do in winter
They all melt down in the summer
Things I never should say
On a very hot day
Been crying out in my eyes
Vacation, vacation, vacation, vacation, vacation
My God, what would the community think?
You are so beautiful, you are so beautiful1Embed
