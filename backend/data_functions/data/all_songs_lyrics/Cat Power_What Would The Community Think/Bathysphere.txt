Bathysphere LyricsWhen I was seven
I told my mother
"Take me to the bay and put me on a ship"
Silver swordfish, electric
I can feel a dream down here
If the water should cut my mind
If the water should cut my life
If the water should cut my mind, set me free
I don't care
I want to live in a bathysphere
When I was seven
My father said to me
"But you can't swim"
And I never dreamed of the sea again
If the water should cut my life
If the water should cut my line
If the water should cut my mind, set me free
I don't care
I want to live in a bathysphereEmbed
