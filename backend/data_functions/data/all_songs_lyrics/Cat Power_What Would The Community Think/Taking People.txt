Taking People LyricsWho, who never showed you
About the easy way?
Whose robes did they trade you
For such an easy life?
Who, who never showed you
About the easy way?
Who, who never told you
Oh, about the perfect life?
Guess it's some kind of
Some guarantee
You'll never see
If I was a photographer
Picture-taking, beautiful people
I guess I'd make a mistake
'Cause I'd probably take a
Picture of you
Who, who never showed you
Oh, about the easy way?
And whose robes did they trade you
Over such a perfect life?
Well, that's such a guarantee
It leaves some certain sickness
You'll never know
Inside of me
And that's all I haveEmbed
