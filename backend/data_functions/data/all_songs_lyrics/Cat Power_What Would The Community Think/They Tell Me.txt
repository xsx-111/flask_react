They Tell Me LyricsThey tell me what they do
I don't know what they're talking about
They tell me what they do
I don't understand what they're talking about
They're talking about it
I did not start this conversation
I don't intend to keep talking about it
They tell me about it
Maybe if I pray to the Lord above
I'll get some sleep
But the Lord don't give a shit about me
They tell me what they do
How can I help it?
How can I help it?
I sure can't shut them upEmbed
