Enough (Community version) LyricsMy intuition said it was fair
Only you should know there's
Not enough to go around
Here they come again
I can watch
As they try they'll try to take it out
Here they come again
I can watch closer now
I can watch closer now
They can't find enough
To take enough from me
They can't find enough
To take enough from me
I've seen the hordes, a horse
I've seen the hordes, a horse
Looking down that drain of yours
A cartoon, a blue jay
Cartoon and a black babe too
Cartoon, a blue jay
Cartoon, a black babe too
Intuition knocked again, fair
Only you should know by now there's
Not enough to go around
But I never go that way
Other half of me says I should
Other half of me says I should
Other half of me says I shouldEmbed
