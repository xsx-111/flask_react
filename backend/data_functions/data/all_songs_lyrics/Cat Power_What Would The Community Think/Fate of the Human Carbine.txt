Fate of the Human Carbine LyricsThinks of money all the time
Doing it to annoy her
She's on his conscience day and night
So he acts like her employer
They all come and peep through a hole in the wall
Keep the bastards guessing
He likes to take the long way home
It's another fine decision
From six to seven he'll be all alone
So he turns on televison
Doesn't even notice as the hours roll by
Gets lost inside the screen
Watches the film about the evening sky
It was someone else's dream
All come peep through a hole
Keep the bastards guessing
All come and peek through a hole in the wall
Just to watch his heart undressing
They all come and peep through a hole in the wall
'Cause you look so impressiveEmbed
