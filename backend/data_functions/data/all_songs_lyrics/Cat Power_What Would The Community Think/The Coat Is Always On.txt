The Coat Is Always On LyricsMother don't sit
Mother don't stand
Mother don't send me
(Smoking grass go into the movie
The ambulance is after you, too
Promise we were gonna go to New York City
Sorry about the fight in front of you
Angry women said 'motherfucker' on TV)
Sister come and lay your head on me
I can see you haven't had any sleep in a long time
That baby's gonna be so easy on me
Never see his smile
Never see his face
(Smoking grass go into the movie
The ambulance is after you too
Promise we're gonna go to New York City
Sorry about the fight in front of you
Angry woman said 'motherfucker' on TV)
Father said he was gonna give me something
Gave me hate
Mother don't sit
Mother don't stand
Mother don't send me
(The coat is always on
Because it's always cold)
(We always laugh when she wants to hear it
A lot of times we would just starve)
(They recognize the color of the smear
Maybe I'll listen and you can read my mind
I'm sorry, please don't be mad)
Brother can't even speak
He's got a tongue and two legs to walk on
And he can't leave
Brother is old and grey
Brother is old and grey
Brother is old and grey
And he's only
He's only seventeen
(The coat is always on
Because it's always cold
We always laugh when she wants to hear it
A lot of times we would just starve)
(We recognize the color of the smear
Maybe we will listen when we're all under
Maybe we will all listen when we're all under)
Father said he was gonna give me something
He gave me hate
Mother don't sit
Mother don't stand
Mother please don't send me
(Angry woman said motherfucker on TV)
(Maybe I'll listen and you can read my mind
I'm sorry, please don't be mad)
(One, two)
