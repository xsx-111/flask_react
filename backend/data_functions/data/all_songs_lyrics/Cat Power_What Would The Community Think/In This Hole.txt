In This Hole LyricsIn this hole that we have fixed
We get further and further and further
From what we must do
I saw you asleep beside a wall
Your skull inside a ball
Your eyes blackened by the sound
And the thought of God
Where should I hang my head?
Where would you like for me to hang my head?
One absence of truth
The one horrible thing I saw
What you truly wanted to become
And who you thought I was
The fall, the fall, afraid to love
Runs deeper than the grave
Goes all the way down those tracks
Everybody bow your head for the greatest inspiration
A complete contradiction, a waste
In this hole that we have fixed
We get further and further
From what we must do
I know this, I know this
You know this, you know this
In this hole that we have fixed
We get further and further and further
From what we must do
I saw you outside that wall
Your skull outside that wall
Your eyes perceived by the sound
And the light of God1Embed
