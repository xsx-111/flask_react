Water & Air LyricsI was dragged out by the shore man
A very poor man
A very nice man
A family man
My lover drifted down the river
Below the dark water
The devil all around
Yesterday on the street
Someone called out your name
Someone thought that you were me
Last night there was a party
I could not go
I walked around it
I thought about it
All night long
Today there's a newspaper
About you and me
And the day we were married
The same day
The same day they fell in love
The same day they died in love
I did not want you to die alone
Rusty river run down
Run, run as fast as you can, oh, run
Rusty river run ragged
And drag my lover's self back to me
I'll meet him there: water and air
Oh, to be at the bottom of a river
Below the dark water
The devil all around
The devil all aroundEmbed
