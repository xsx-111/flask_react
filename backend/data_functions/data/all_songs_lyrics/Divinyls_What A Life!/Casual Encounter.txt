Casual Encounter LyricsYou are always looking at me
Please don't stare
Everytime I turn around
Your standing there
Just because I sit alone
Don't' mean I'm free
You think your so cool
But you don't cut with me
Don't' ask me what my name is
I know what your game is
It's just a casual encounter
It's just a casual encounter
It's just a casual encounter
Don't come on to me
With all those fancy lines
I can read between them
They're like neon signs
You just want to get me get me into bed
So stop pretending
That you like my head
Don't' ask me what my name is
I know what your game is
It's just a casual encounter
It's just a casual encounter
It's just a casual encounterEmbed
