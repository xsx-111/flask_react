Good Die Young LyricsCity air, toxic taste
A girl falls from innocent grace
Where pleasure has it's price
Looking into your eyes your eyes
Are open are open wide
No ties no surprise in your eyes
Are open wide
Wonder if you got the chance
To let your real feelings show
Dry eyes men and women looking
Into your eyes your eyes
Are open are open wide
No ties no surprise in your eyes
Are open wide
Now I'm happy happy happy happy
Happy just to see you with a friend now and then
Happy happy happy happy
Music changes but the dance steps don't
When the good die young
City air, toxic taste
A girl falls from innocent grace
A girl disappears and leave no trace
Into your eyes your eyes
Are open are open wide
No ties no surprise in your eyes
Are open wide
Now I'm happy happy happy happy
Happy just to see you with a friend now and then
Happy happy happy happy
Music changes but the dance steps don't
When the good die youngEmbed
