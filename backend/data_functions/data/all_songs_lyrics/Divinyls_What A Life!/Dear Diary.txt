Dear Diary LyricsDear diary I'm lonely
Won't you send someone to hold me
Preston annual fair this room I share the market near
Dear diary I rode today
The ferris wheel carried me away
The jangling tune the dusty moon is it my turn soon
Dear diary I had a dream
A serpent came in a cloak of steam
He wraps me tight each coil a night my heart he bites
It's been a while so much to say
It's such a blur each long hot day
The ferris wheel man terrifies those violent eyes
The wheel the dust spins round too fast
The little lights like shattering glass
Is it a sickness and will it last he hands move fast
A nutty hole where the squirrels build
The fairground sky empty and chilled
The grass is white in squares and black where oil has spilled
These pages burn and the lonely learn
Why there still this memory please explain to me
And why people love so thoughtlessly dear diary
We all run after a dream in life
A heart is a lamb in a sacrifice
Did you ever expect such a struggle and strife
See how she runsEmbed
