Pleasure and Pain Lyrics
Lover, lover, why do you push?
Why do you push? Why do you push?
Baby baby, did you forget about me?
I've been standing in the back of your life
Back-row centre, just above the ice
Please don't ask me
How I've been getting off
No, please don't ask me
How I've been getting off

Break my body with the back of your hand
Doesn't make sense from where I stand
Baby, baby, oh, why you wanna mess it up?
Sooner or later I'll find my place
Find my body, better fix my face
Please don't ask me
How I've been getting off
Ha, no, please don't ask me
How I've been getting off

It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once, you could do it again
Whatever you done, don't try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
(It's all the same)
Sooner or later I'll find my place
Find my body, better fix my face
Please don't ask me
How I've been getting off
Ha, now, please don't ask me
How I've been getting off

It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once, you could do it again
Whatever you done, don't try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain

Pleasure and pain
You've done it once, you could do it again
Whatever you done, don't try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain

Pleasure and pain (It's all the same)
You've done it once, you could do it again (It's all the same)
Whatever you done, don't try to explain (It's all the same)
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
Pleasure and pain (It's all the same)
You've done it once, you could do it again (It's all the same)
Whatever you done, don't try to explain (It's all the same)
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain

Pleasure and pain (It's all the same)
You've done it once, you could do it again (It's all the same)
Whatever you done, don't try to explain (It's all the same)
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain (It's all the same)

Pleasure and pain (It's all the same)
You've done it once, you could do it again (It's all the same)
Whatever you done, don't try to explain (It's all the same)
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain (It's all the same)
