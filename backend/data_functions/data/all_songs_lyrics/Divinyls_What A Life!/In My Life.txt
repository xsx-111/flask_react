In My Life LyricsHow did you get this far, let's go
How did you get this far, let's go
I'm gonna get things
Gonna get things right
Cause in my memory
I've seen changes overnight
Hey, I mean in my life
Never much happening
Never much happening in my life
Hey, I mean it might change
So I still remain
So I still stuck it in my life
I might think of something
When life becomes a fight
And take relief in
What I think is right
How did you get this far, let's go
How did you get this far, let's go
How did you get this far, let's go
How did you get this far, let's go
Hey, I mean in my life
Never much happening
Never much happening in my life
Hey, I mean it might change
So I still remain
So I still stuck it in my life
We're out of it
I was born and brought up wrong
And I don't know where I come from
Mum had me when she was eighteen
A never was that always has been
When I grew up I went to school
They tried to make me a bloody fool
I woke up and I left that place
Now I run that long rat race
Hey, I mean in my life
Never much happening
Never much happening in my life
Oi, I mean it might change
So I still remain
So I still stuck it in my life
And any advantages
Oi, I mean in my life
Never much happening
Never much happening in my life
Oi, I mean it might change
So I still remain
So I still stuck it in my life
Modelling schools, and training schools, finishing schools
All kettle of fish schools, such advantages
Hard headed, solid fisted, hard times, a few a facts of life
Such advantages
Oi, I mean in my life
Never much happening
Never much happening in my life
Hey, I mean it might change
So I still remain
So I still stuck it in my life
I stuck it in my lifeEmbed
