Motion LyricsLying in the dark thinking all the night
Need to be sedated it's almost daylight
Tossing and a turning my bed's on fire
Feeling so frustrated don't' want to be a liar
You got motion motion motion motion
Sick of all my friends want to meed somebody new
They think I'm being phoney I think their phoney too
Felling so frustrated counting on sheep
Want to go to heave hell can keep
You got motion motion, you got motion motion
You got something they can't get enough
They can't' get enough now in a fit of emotion
Oooh la la
You got it you got it
You got motion
You got motionEmbed
