Sleeping Beauty Lyrics
Still waiting for my ship to come in
Still looking for the right kinda friend
There are things inside, things that can't be denied
What am I waiting for?

A sleeping beauty, so helpless
Unlock my fantasy
And while I slept, you came in
And gave to me your key
Oh, your key

Things that we did again and again
Things that I thought would never never end
There are things inside, things that can't be denied
What am I waiting for?

A sleeping beauty, I confess
Of perfect design
And while I slept, you came in
And took this heart of mine
A sleeping beauty, so helpless
Unlock my fantasy
And while I slept, you came in
And gave to me your key
Oh, your key
When I looked around I saw your face
Then I kissed you in a very nice place
What was I waiting for?
Still waiting, still waiting, still waiting
Waiting, waiting for you
Ooh baby
I'm still rooting for you, honey
You showed me how to give
This selfish heart of mine

A sleeping beauty, so helpless
Unlock my fantasy
And while I slept, you came in
And gave to me your key
A sleeping beauty, I confess
Of prefect design
And while I slept, you came in
And took this heart of mine
Oh, my heart

Still waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waitingEmbed
