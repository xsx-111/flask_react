All Night Long LyricsI ain't got nobody
In this world alone
I have nobody to love me
Give me my hope
Want you to love me
Want you to love me
I want you to love me baby
Love me all night long
Just like a rattlesnake
Crowded all in the mud
If I love you baby
Say that I’m no good
I want you to love me
Come on & hug me
I want you to love me baby
Love me all night long
Alright
Tell me baby
If you love me baby
I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I’d rob & I'd steal, I'd kill everybody
To get some love from you
Want you to love me
Come on hug me
I want you to love me baby
Love me all night longEmbed
