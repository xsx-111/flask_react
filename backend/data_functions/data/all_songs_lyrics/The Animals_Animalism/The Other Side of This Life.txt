The Other Side of This Life LyricsTo lie, to know a secret
Just between you and me
I don't know where I'm goin
I don't know where I wanna be
But that's another side to this life
I've been leadin'
Yes that's another side to this life
The whole world is in an uproar
My whole world is upside down
I don't know where I'm goin'
I'll always be bummin' around
But that's another side to this life
I've been leadin'
Yes that's another side to this life
I don't know what I'm doin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
Think I'll get me a sailin boat
Sail the Gulf of Mexico
But that's another side to this life
That I've been leadin
Yes that's another side to this life
I think I'll go to Natchez
In the state of Tennessee
The ten cent life I've been leadin here
Is gonna be the end for me
But that's another side to this life
I've been leadin'
Yes that's another side to this life
I gotta be movin' on
Things are bringin me downhill
Just no good
See the other side of my life?
Oh yeahEmbed
