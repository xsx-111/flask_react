Outcast LyricsGirl, what have I done?
For you to mistreat me this way
I'm left out of everything
Each and every day
I'm just an outcast
I don´t know how long I'm goin' to last
Lord, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
I guess I've got to do my best
But my girl gives me unhappiness
Lord, no matter how hard I try
Tears keep comin' down from my eyes
I'm just an outcast
I don't know how long I´m gonna last
Lord, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
You know, I'm just a young boy
But she treats me like last year's toy
I want her, for myself
I want her and nobody else
I'm just an outcast
Don't know how long I can last
Oh, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
I'm just an outcast--
Waauuggh!--
An' I don't know how long I can last--
Ow!--
I think I can make it--
I've got to try and make it--
Waauuggh!Embed
