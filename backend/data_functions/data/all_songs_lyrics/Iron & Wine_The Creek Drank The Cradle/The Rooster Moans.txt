The Rooster Moans LyricsCrack of dawn, the rooster moans
Wake up boy, you're far from home
Serpentine, the tracks in flames
Longest path the devil laid
Led you straight aboard this rusty train
Lift your head 'cause you can't sleep
Bite your lip 'cause you can't eat
Darkest den the devil made
Jesus weeps but he's been paid
Not to ride inside this rusty train
Buzzard's breath, the rooster moans
Stow it boy, you're far from home
Stow your sorrows, stow your fear
What'd you do to end up here
End up on the devil's rusty trainEmbed
