Promise What You Will LyricsLately she don't care for a warmer breeze
Or shade around the base of the maple trees
Spring was on the mountain we climbed upon
Stopped to see how high and how far we'd gone
I said, "Love is waiting and better days"
She smiled and placed a kiss on my waiting face
Promise what you will, something good for me
Time will take it all, and it will, you'll seeEmbed
