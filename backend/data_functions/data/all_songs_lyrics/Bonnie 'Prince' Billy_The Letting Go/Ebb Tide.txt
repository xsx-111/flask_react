Ebb Tide LyricsFirst the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then goes out to sea
And the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought:
Will your arms open wide?
At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel you are loved
You are really, really mine
In the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web
Of your heart's arms
Of your armsEmbed
