Big Friday LyricsYou saved me from melting, baby
You saved me from stinging and being holed up
And braking in snow and killing more
And overspilling my runneth cup
You had light in your hands and your eyes closed
You had movement out of my sight
You wore no shoes and ate like a leopard
And slept with your legs apart every night
And if I had to live
This is what it should be
To have such a woman with me
When tidal wave hit and our house was in splinters
I thought you had took all you had to take
But you snuggled to me on the ground in the winter
And your breath smelled like honey in the frosty air wake
And if I had to live
This is what it should be
To have such a woman with meEmbed
