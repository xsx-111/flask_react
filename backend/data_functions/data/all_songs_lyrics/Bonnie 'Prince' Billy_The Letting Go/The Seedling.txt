The Seedling LyricsI go out back to look up at her
Smiling unluckily at my red fur
And into my own I meld my nose
My full-sized child is fully unclothed
Birdies say I got no children, birdies never know
In my hidden life I've made a seedling grow
When it is cold I shelter her in
The wazimy warmth of the monkey skin
And into my own I fold my head
My full-sized child with full-sized spread
Birdies say I got no children, birdies never know
In my hidden life I've made a seedling grow
Hawks and doves and power fists
Black hand gripping our kid's wrists
Lanterns and arrows and little monk fish
They grant my every child wish
And birdies say I got no children, birdies never know
In my hidden life I've made a seedling grow
Birdies say I got no children, birdies never know
In my hidden life I've made a seedling grow
(Birdies say I got no children, birdies never know)
(In my hidden life I've made a seedling grow)
(Birdies say I got no children, birdies never know)
(In my hidden life I've made a seedling grow)Embed
