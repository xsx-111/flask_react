Wai LyricsThe lameness of an unborn child
The tidiness of cry
The only way I'm leaving here
Is curling up and die
The way our shelter moves above
Controlled by just my hand
Insures the death you're dreaming of
The drowning down of man
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my carefull love
I've found the hard way love is true
And always love the smiling one
And rounding out will come
With bitter bile and heartless fun
And consciousness made numb
And fearful hate that's steming out
From fear and only fear
Has made your inner croco shout
And bring his victims here
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my carefull love
I've found the hard way love is true
A creature born in listlessness
His hatred to become
It's here his love is swollen in
And consciousness made numb
And relegate your youth and trust
Your table and your skin
And share the love the godly must
And hold it til the end
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my carefull love
I've found the hard way love is true
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my carefull love
I've found the hard way love is trueEmbed
