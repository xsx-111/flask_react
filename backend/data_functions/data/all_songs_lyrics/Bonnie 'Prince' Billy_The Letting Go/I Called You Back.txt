I Called You Back LyricsAnd I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
Love found us easily
And if that's all we have you will find we need nothing more
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
And everytime we kiss
We find ourselves in love again
And the older that we get
We know that nothing else for us is possible
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
Mm, when I was quiet
Well, I heard your voice in everything
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside meEmbed
