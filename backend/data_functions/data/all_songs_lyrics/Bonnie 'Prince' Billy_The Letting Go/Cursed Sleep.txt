Cursed Sleep LyricsI slept sweetly unpretending
That the night was always ending
She breathes lightly right next to me
And I dreamed of her inside of me
And in my dream she sang so sweetly
A melody I hoped to sing
So enslaved by her sweet wonder
It cut my legs and fingered hunger
She sang my name and so engulfed
And I cried and felt my legs fail
In her arms I trembled electric
And she led me and she held me
Then waking she was older still
And holds my love against it's will
In spell cast with her palms extended
Cursed love is never ended
Cursed eyes are never closing
Cursed arms are never closing
Cursed children never rising
Cursed me never despising
I am loving always holding
While she sleeps her song enfoldig
Epic song it tells of how
She and I are living nowEmbed
