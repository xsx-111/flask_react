Lay and Love LyricsFrom what I've seen, you're magnificent
You fight evil with all you do
Your every act is spectacular
It makes me lay here and love you
From what I hear, you are generous
You make sunshine and glory too
When you walk in things go luminous
It makes me lay here and love you
From what I know, you're terrified
You have mistrust running through you
Your smile is hiding something hurtful
It makes me lay here and love you
It makes me lay here and love you
I'm filled with violet and red and blue
I have a feeling from what I do
That you might lay there and love me tooEmbed
