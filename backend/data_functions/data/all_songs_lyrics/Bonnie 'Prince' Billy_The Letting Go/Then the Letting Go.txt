Then the Letting Go LyricsThere was someone a long time ago
(Come follow me here and then we'll go)
Who played with me whenever it snowed
(To a fortress in the snow)
She lived nearby and I'd walk her home
(On these bushes berries grow)
Then I would go to my own house alone
Then one december bad weather came on
(We will eat them seeds and all)
I went to our shared place and nobody came
(Hand in my hand, nose and nose)
And it was dark before I made my way home
(Shall we marry or shall we go)
And sat at my window and watched the snow come
When I had children I asked them to stay –
When the weather turned bad – indoors to play
I tried to make games and be a bold friend
Though strong was the call of the harsh winter wind
They ran out of doors and shouted and sang
(They won't find us from the road)
Their voices went soft as they ran further on
(Thicker branches tangled so)
Till only a trace of their singing did hang
(Flashlights fading, the fire low)
On my eyes and my whiskers where they didn't belong
Then my, someone from childhood came into the room
And lay her wet head on my withering feet
Her tears wet my lap and she fell asleep soon
Saying nothing to me just going to sleep
O how my head burned as I sat unprepared
(Come marry me here and then we'll go)
I was rendered blind and of the world unaware
(To the places in the snow)
In the quiet of the day, well, I laid her low
(You a fire, me aglow)
And used her skin as my skin to go out in the snowEmbed
