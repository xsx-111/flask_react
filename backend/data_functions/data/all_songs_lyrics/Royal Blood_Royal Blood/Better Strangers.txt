Better Strangers Lyrics
There's nothing left inside, I found a whole new low
My heart is open wide, with no love to show
I know I got high but you didn't have to leave me so

Brother had beat me blue, sister bled me dry
It's why I count on you, but you don't treat me right
I know I held tight but you didn't have to leave me so

Hollow, hollow
I don't need you tonight so don't follow, follow
Left alone in the valley so hollow, hollow
I know you wanna be mine so don't follow, follow

Cross my heavy heart, you won't be replaced
I can't fill the void, walk the empty space
So remember my face every time you're left feeling so

Hollow, hollow
I don't need you tonight so don't follow, follow
Left alone in the valley so hollow, hollow
I know you wanna be mine so don't follow, follow
There's nothing left inside, I found a whole new low
My heart is open wide with no love to show
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from danger if I make a better stranger
Thousand miles from danger if I make a better stranger
Thousand miles from danger if I make a better stranger of you

I don't need you tonight so don't follow, follow
Left alone in the valley so hollow, hollow
I know you wanna be mine so don't follow, follow

Hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
Hollow
Hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from danger if I make a better stranger of you1Embed
