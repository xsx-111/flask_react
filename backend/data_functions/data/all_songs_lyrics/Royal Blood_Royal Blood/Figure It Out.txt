Figure It Out Lyrics
Nothing here to see, just a kid like me
Tryin' to cut some teeth, tryin' to figure it out
Nothing better to do when I'm stuck on you
I'm still, I'm here tryin' to figure it out

Getting hard to sleep, blood is in my dreams
Love is killing me, tryin' to figure it out
Nothing better to do when I'm stuck on you
I'm still in here tryin' to figure it out

I let it go 'cause I won't see you later
And we're not allowed to talk it out
I said I'd go, put myself on show
But I'm still tryin' to figure it out
I broke my shoe, tripped and fell on you
But you didn't know I planned it out
I said I'd go, yeah, I won’t see you later
And we're not allowed to figure it out, oh!

Nothing here to see, just a kid like me
Tryin' to cut some teeth, tryin' to figure it out
Nothing better to do when I'm stuck on you
I'm still, I'm here tryin' to figure it out
I let it go 'cause I won't see you later
And we're not allowed to talk it out
I said I'd go, put myself on show
But I'm still tryin' to figure it out
I broke my shoe, tripped and fell on you
But you didn't know I planned it out
I said I'd go, yeah, I won’t see you later
And we're not allowed to figure it out
