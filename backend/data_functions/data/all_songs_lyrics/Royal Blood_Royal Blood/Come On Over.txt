Come On Over Lyrics
I'm on a train going nowhere
I ran away to make you care
This ain't my house, this ain't your home
Not when I'm feeling this alone

So come on over.... yeah
I went to church and stopped believing
Yeah so come on over yeah
Well there's no god and I don't really care

Let's run away, get out of here
I got no money and I don't care
This ain't my house, this ain't your home
Not when I'm feeling this alone

So come on over.... yeah
I went to church and stopped believing
Yeah so come on over yeah
Well there's no god and I don't really care
I don't really care

I'm on a train going nowhere
I ran away to make you care
This ain't my house, this ain't your home
Not when I'm feeling this alone
So come on over.... yeah
I went to church and stopped believing
Yeah so come on over yeah
Well there's no god and I don't really care2Embed
