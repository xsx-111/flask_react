Blood Hands Lyrics
Took a lonely feeling
Just to let the meaning
Sink like the sun goes down
Never close to heaven
Felt my feet were burning from the same red hot ground
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood

It's getting hard to listen
When the clock is ticking
Counting down the days gone by
Praying for an answer to another question
That will only leave you dry
You won't understand
With your head in the sand
No, you won't

But I'll curse the ground where you kneel
'Til I grow my hair to my heels
Spike your water your wine
While you waste my precious time
Every time I drink and try to stop my thinking
Bout the things I've said and done
Stop the world from turning faster
Then I'm learning not to just hide and run
You won't understand
With your head in the sand
No, you won't
Yeah

Love came and went
Faster than a penny spent
In a slot machine
Nowhere near the devil, just somewhere in between you and me
Sworn to secrecy

And I'll curse the ground where you kneel
'Til I grow my hair to my heels
Spike your water your wine
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood
There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood

Took a lonely feeling
Just to let the meaning
Sink like the sun goes down
Never close to heaven
Felt my feet were burning from the same red hot ground9Embed
