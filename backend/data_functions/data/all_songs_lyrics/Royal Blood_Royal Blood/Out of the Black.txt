Out of the Black Lyrics
How did it feel when it came alive and took you
Out of the black? It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why and you didn't care when
It closed every door, and washed away no sin
And I promised you like you promised me
But those vows we made fucked it up for free

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket
And it tortures slow
Never lets you go
