Loose Change Lyrics
Loose change
Another penny in my pocket again
No shame
Another heart-shaped locket
Choke chain
Worth 24 carats just to hock it again
Like there's nobody home, yeah there's nobody home

'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
Yeah, your money don't fold

Stuck stood still with your door banging
Shadow through your little hole
Like there's nobody home, yeah there's nobody home
Teeth clean, nineteen, ice queen looking on the guillotine
Buckle down on your floor, buckle down on your floor

'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
All that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
I wanna double my money
So don't act, don't act like there's nobody home
Yeah quit playing God on your telephone
I've got love in my tummy
About as funny as a broken bone
But there's nobody home, yeah there's nobody home

'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold
'Cause all that glitters is gold
Till your glitter gets sold, then your money don't fold3Embed
