Ten Tonne Skeleton Lyrics
She took my heart, left me for dead
And drank my blood, told me she said
Our secret's worth, its weight in gold
That fire we had, now is turning cold

Cut loose like an animal
Fired out like a cannonball
But I waited too long
Yeah I waited too long
Got high from a holy vein
Crashed down in a hurricane
Love has been here and gone
Love has been here and gone

Where did you go? Where did you run?
I can't erase what you've done
Let's burn the past, forget the truth
You're still loving him, I'm still loving you

Cut loose like an animal
Fired out like a cannon ball
But I waited too long
Yeah I waited too long
Got high from a holy vein
Crashed down in a hurricane
Love has been here and gone
Love has been here and gone

Cut loose like an animal
Fired out like a cannon ball
But I waited too long
Yeah I waited too long
Got high from a holy vein
Crashed down in a hurricane
Love has been here and gone
Love has been here and gone

But I waited too long for you, only
Love has been here and gone, to die slowly
Going under again, so don't follow me14Embed
