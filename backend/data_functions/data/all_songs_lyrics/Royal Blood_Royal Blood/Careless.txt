Careless Lyrics
I'm tired of kidding myself
Another pill, no good for my health
I wish I could make this disappear
So I sit and smoke on my own
Think about you baby, are you feeling alone?
'Cause I'd die just thinking that you'll forget
But I guess you won't

I wish I cared less
But I'm afraid I don't
You couldn't care less
So I guess you won't
Change your mind again

I can't stop dreaming of you
It does me no good and it's turning into
A splinter that I can't find under my skin
So I'll make another hole in the wall
Think about the times I didn't love you at all
'Cause I just can't make myself forget
So I guess I won't

I wish I cared less
But I'm afraid I don't
You couldn't care less
So I guess you won't
Change your mind again
I've tried to make no sound
But our love came crashing down like a tidal wave
A tidal wave
But I'm fighting with my hands
And I hope you know we're digging our own graves
For your mistakes

I wish I cared less
But I'm afraid I don't
You couldn't care less
So I guess you won't
Change your mind again

I've tried to make no sound
But our love came crashing down like a tidal wave
I'm fighting with my hands
And I hope you know we're digging our own graves4Embed
