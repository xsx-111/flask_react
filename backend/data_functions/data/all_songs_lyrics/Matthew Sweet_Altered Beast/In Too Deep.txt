In Too Deep LyricsI'm in too deep
Drowning in the fire
Burning in the lake
Dying from desire
Dying for desire
I'm in too deep
Grasping like a liar
Yeah, and do you want me
Cause I am gonna fly yeah, I am gonna fly
I'm in too deep
And even when you think you already know what to do baby
There comes a hard road rushing at you
And honey ain't life sweet
Mmm'too deep
I'm in too deep
I've opened up my eyes now
Cause now I understand how
Cause there's nobody else
I'm in too deep
And even when you think you already
Know what to do baby
There come a hard road rushing at you
And honey ain't life
Honey ain't life sweet
Ah, it's too deep
(Solo)
I'm in too deep
Drowning in the fire
Burning in the lake
Dying from desire
Dying for desire
Dying from desire
Dying for desire
Dying from desire
Dying for desire
