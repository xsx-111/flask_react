Dinosaur Act LyricsBorne on a cloud
Stupid and proud
I'm gonna take you back now
Cursed by the past
Held under glass
I was too hard to shake down
And I'm coming back
With my dinosaur act
Did you forget me baby
After the fact (I'm telling you)
I'm coming back
With my dinosaur act
I still remember baby
What we both lack
We both lack
Lost in the head
Lost in your bed
I wouldn't call you lucky
You're getting old
Ready to fold
You do not feel like fighting
Don't worry
Cause I'm coming back
With my dinosaur act
Did you forget me baby
After the fact (I'm telling you)
I'm coming back
With my dinosaur act
I still remember baby
What we both lack
We both lack
We both lack
(Solo)
And I'm coming back
With my dinosaur act
Did you forget me baby
After the fact (I'm telling you)
I'm coming back
With my dinosaur act
I still remember baby
What we both lack
We both lack
We now lack
We now lack
We now lackEmbed
