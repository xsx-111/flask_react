Devil With The Green Eyes LyricsI can understand you're living in a prison
I know you can only see me as a vision
I might fade away
With the coming of a new dawn
And your heart is breaking
What are you gonna do now
That you're tired of faking it?
What are you gonna do now?
Well, it's hard to take it
When you know what happens each time
The devil with the green eyes
Said you were never meant to be mine
'Cause I came up from a dark world
And every love I've ever known is dead
If you come close enough to see I am inhuman
I will tell you why you're feeling so uncertain
Every word I say
Has a way of turning evil in you
And your heart is breaking
What are you gonna do now
That you're tired of faking it?
What are you gonna do now?
Well, it's hard to take it
When you know what happens each time
The devil with the green eyes
Said you was never meant to be mine
'Cause I came up from a dark world
And every love I've ever known is dead
And your heart is breaking
What are you gonna do now
That you're tired of faking it?
What are you gonna do now?
Well, it's hard to take it
You know what happens each time
The devil with the green eyes
Said you were never meant to be mine
'Cause I came up from a dark world
And every love I've ever known
Every love I've ever known
Every love I've ever known
Is deadEmbed
