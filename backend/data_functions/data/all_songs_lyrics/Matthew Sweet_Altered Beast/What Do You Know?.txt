What Do You Know? LyricsDo you want to tell me something
Open up my world for me baby
With another stupid lie that gets you by
One of those stupid lies that gets you by
Do you wnat to show me something
Or are you just describing it to me
Just look me in the eye / when you say why
Oh, look me in the eye / when you say why
'cause what do you know
That I would want to
Where do you go
That I could belong
Do you feel one little bit
What you've become
So go on shoot your mouth off
Like it might kill the silence
Say you would rather die
Than see me cry
You would rather die
Than see me cry
But what do you know
That I would want to
Where do you go
That I could belong
Do you feel one little bit
What you've become
Do you want to tell me something
Open up my world for me baby
With another stupid lie that gets you by
One of those stupid lies that gets you by
Then what do you know
That I would want to
Where do you go
That I could belong
Do you feel one little bit
What you've become
Do you feel one little bit
What you've become
Do you feel one little bit
What you've becomeEmbed
