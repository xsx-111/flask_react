Do It Again LyricsI'll do it again
If I have to love you from afar
You'll do it again
Before we get too far
And I'll hurt you again
Baby if you'll hurt me one more time
Cause love that's bad
Is better than none
You know breaking up is half of the fun
And who would want a dream
That can't be real
I'll do it again
I will let you take me for a ride
You'll do it again
Start opening the hide
And I'll hurt you again
Baby if you'll hurt me one more time
Cause love that's bad
Is better than none
You know that breaking up is half of the fun
Who would want a dream
That can't be real
And I'll do it again
(Solo)
A love that's bad
Is better than none
You know breaking up is half of the fun
Who would want a dream
That can't be real
I'll hurt you again
Baby if you'll hurt me one more time
Cause love that's bad
Is better than none
You know breaking up is half of the fun
And who would want a dream
That can't be real
I'll do it again
I'll do it againEmbed
