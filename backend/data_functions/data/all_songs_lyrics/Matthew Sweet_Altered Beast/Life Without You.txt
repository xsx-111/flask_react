Life Without You LyricsEvery time you go away
I know there's nothing I can say
But I don't know how to stay alive
No matter what I keep inside
Or what I let escape from the place where you walked through
But I wouldn't a life without you
No I wouldn't want a life without you
Every time you go away
There are some rules I do obey
If you had to watch me scream and cry
You'd feel the need I'm living by
A fragment of the pain that the world has put you through
But I wouldn't a life without you
No I wouldn't want a life without you
Solo
If you had to watch me scream and cry
You'd feel the need I'm living by
A fragment of the pain that the world has put you through
But I wouldn't want a life without you
No I wouldn't want a life without youEmbed
