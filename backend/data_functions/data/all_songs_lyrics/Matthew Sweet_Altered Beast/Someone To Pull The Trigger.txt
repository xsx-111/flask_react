Someone To Pull The Trigger LyricsWell, I'm loaded, ready
Calmly holding steady
Looking for a sign to show me when
Well, I'm waiting, willing
The clarity is chilling
And I'm not turning back, and neither can you
I need someone to pull the trigger
'Cause there's a hole in my heart getting bigger
And everything I'll ever be I've been
And I need someone to pull the trigger
So if you're what I think you'll be
If you're who I think I see, shoot
So hold me, love me
Tie me up and drug me
'Cause I'm not gonna beg you for my life
I need someone to pull the trigger
'Cause there's a hole in my heart getting bigger
And everything I'll ever be I've been
And I need someone to pull the trigger
So if you're what I think you'll be
If you're who I think I see, shoot
Shoot
Shoot
