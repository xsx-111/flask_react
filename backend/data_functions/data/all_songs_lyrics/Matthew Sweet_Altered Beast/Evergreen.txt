Evergreen LyricsAs soon as I found you baby you know
They took you away
You put your little hands together and
You started to pray
But all your prayers they brought no answer
Your faith was a lie
And there's no difference
Between the earth and the sky
There's no reason
We have to die
Whenever you talk that way you know
You're breaking my heart
How can we ever come together when
We're playing these parts
In every love there is a promise
So baby don't you cry
'Cause there's no difference
Between the earth and the sky
There's no reason
We have to die
In every love there is a promise
So baby don't you cry
There's no difference
Between the earth and the sky
There's no reason
We have to dieEmbed
