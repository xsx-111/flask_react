Ugly Truth Rock LyricsYou don't want to die
But the living gets you down
We want you to act like nothing's wrong
Even though you heard a sound
And then you're ripped right out of the ground
Like a fucking root
Ah, you simply cannot hide
From the ugly truth
You feel you must be wise
Cause you could find yourself
Among a sea of smiling faces
It's a way I've never felt
Yeah, it kinda flies right into my face
And out the other side
The ugly truth leaves nothing to decide
The ugly truth makes every one of us a liar
Ugly
If you can dig a big enough hole
To bury all your youth
No you still won't be prepared for the ugly truth
No you'll never be prepared for the ugly truth
You simply cannot hide from the ugly truth
