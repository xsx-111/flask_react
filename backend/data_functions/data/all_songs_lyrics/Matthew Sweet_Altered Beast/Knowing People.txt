Knowing People LyricsAre you made like God
When you start to bleed?
Do you really know
What it is to breathe?
Without a mind to think
Or a hand in fate
You're an animal
Filled with love and hate
Oh, you
And the way you move
And the things you say
Your desperate dreams are pathetic
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
Why should we care
What we do or say?
Why should we long
For yesterday?
What is here
And who wants to stay?
No lasting life
And no judgment day
And the fact of you
And the way you move
And the things you say
Your desperate dreams are pathetic
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
(What are you looking at?)
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
I don't like knowing people
And I don't like people knowing about me
Get out of hereEmbed
