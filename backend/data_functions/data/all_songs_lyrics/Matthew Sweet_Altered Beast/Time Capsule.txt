Time Capsule LyricsStop what you're doing to me
My love don't want to see
Then we were young and strong
Now everything is wrong
Did you want me
Did you need me
Could you not say
You believed me
And our love is in a time capsule
Dream what you want me to be
Come and dig for me
Then we were young and strong
Now Everything is wrong, so wrong
Did you want me
Did you need me
Could you not say
You believed me
And our love is in a time capsule
(Solo)
Then we were young and strong
Now everything is wrong, so wrong
Didn't you want me
Didn't you need me
Could you not say You believed me
Didn't you want me
Didn't you need me
Could you not say
You believed me
And our love is in a time capsule
Let's dig it upEmbed
