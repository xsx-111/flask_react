Trouble on the Line Lyrics
I can't understand a word you're saying
We've got a bad connection on our minds
Communication's one thing we never seem to find
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line

All I get is static when we're talking
You say my line is out of order all the time
We have nothing left in common, your thoughts are not like mine
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line

There's trouble on the line from your heart to mine
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but we're not getting through

The storm keeps gettin' worse
Lord, we might as well quit tryin'
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line

The storm keeps gettin' worse
Lord, we might as well quit tryin'
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the line
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but there's trouble on the lineEmbed
