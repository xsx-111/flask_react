This Old House Lyrics1, 2, 3
Oh if this old house could talk, what a story it would tell
It would tell about the good times and the bad times as well
It would tell about the love that lived and died inside these walls
And the sound of the little footsteps running up and down the hall
Oh if this old house could talk, it would break my heart in two
I couldn't stand to be reminded of all the things we used to do
There's no love in this old house no more, so I got it up for sale
Why, if this old house could talk, what a story it would tell
Oh if this old house could talk, I know what it would say
I'm as lonesome as you are and I feel more empty every day
I even miss the baby who built me up to feel this way
Why, if this old house could talk, Lord, I know what it would say
Yeah if this old house could talk, what a story it would tell
We'll build this home together and with love, we drove each nail
Take me in your arms and hold me 'cause we've been apart too long
Why, if this old house could talk, all it would say is 'welcome home'Embed
