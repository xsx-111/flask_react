Family Tree Lyrics
Woman, you don’t know me, but you can bet that I know you
Everybody in this whole darn town knows you too
I brought along our little babies 'cause I wanted them to see
The woman that’s burning down our family tree

No, I didn’t come to fight
If he was a better man, I might
But I wouldn’t dirty my hands on trash like you, no
Bring out the babies’ daddy
That’s who they’ve come to see
Not the woman that’s burning down our family tree

Their daddy once was a good man until he ran into trash like you
Take a look at the baby’s face and tell me who loves who
I brought along his old dog Charlie and the bills that’s overdue
The job you’re working, Lord, we need money too

No, I didn’t come to fight
If he was a better man, I might
But I wouldn’t dirty my hands on trash like you, no
Bring out the babies’ daddy
That’s who they’ve come to see
Not the woman that’s burning down our family tree
No not the woman that’s burning down our family tree1Embed
