Mrs. Leroy Brown Lyrics
I've been in and out of every honky-tonk in town
And I'm almost drunk from the drinks that I've turned down
Well, you told me you'd be happy bouncing babies on your knee
While I sit at home alone and I've been bouncing three
Yeah, and I'm tired of it too

I'm gonna call myself a long pink limousine
Yeah, believe it or not, it's the prettiest thing I think I've ever seen
There's a big bar in the corner and a TV on the side
This baby's sixty-feet long and forty-feet wide
Hey driver, pull this car, buddy, right inside the bar
Take it on back to the big old blonde that thinks she's a movie star
I'm gonna grab her by her ponytail, I'm gonna sling her around and around
When she wakes up she'll know she met up with mad Mrs. Leroy Brown

Well, the smoke's so doggone thick, you could cut it with a knife
And the music's so loud, you can hear the same line twice
Hey Leroy Brown, how do you like my big old pink limo
Just drawed all your money out of the bank today
Honey, you don't have no more

I'm gonna call myself a long pink limousine
Yeah, believe it or not, it's the prettiest thing I think I've ever seen
There's a big bar in the corner and a TV on the side
This baby's sixty-feet long and forty-feet wide
Hey driver, pull this car, buddy, right inside the bar
Take it on back to the big old blonde that thinks she's a movie star
Gonna grab her by her ponytail, I'm gonna sling her around and around
When she wakes up she'll know she met up with mad Mrs. Leroy BrownEmbed
