Portland Oregon Lyrics
Well, Portland, Oregon and sloe gin fizz
If that ain't love, then tell me what is uh-huh uh-huh
Well I lost my heart, it didn't take no time
But that ain't all, I lost my mind in Oregon

In a booth in the corner with the lights down low
I was moving in fast she was taking it slow uh-huh uh-huh

Well, I looked at him and caught him looking at me
I knew right then, we were playing free in Oregon

Next day, we knew last night got drunk
But we loved enough for the both of us uh-huh uh-huh

In the morning when the night had sobered up
It was much too late for the both of us in Oregon

Well, sloe gin fizz works mighty fast
When you drink it by the pitcher and not by the glass uh-huh
Hey bartender, before you close
Pour us one more drink and a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to go
And a pitcher to goEmbed
