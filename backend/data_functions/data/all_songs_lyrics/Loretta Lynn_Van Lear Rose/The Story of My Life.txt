The Story of My Life LyricsWell, here's the story of my life
Listen and I'll tell it twice
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Well, I was borned in old Kentucky
In them hills where folks are lucky
And it's paradise to me
Well, I got a feller right over the hill
If he asks me to marry, I know I will
He asked me to marry, got kids of four
And I'm telling you I don't want no more
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Doo got me a guitar, I wrote me a song
Moved to Nashville, it wasn't long
Till I was on The Grand Ole Opry
We bought us a mansion on the hill
Living big like we were big deals
Scarlett O'Hara, Gone With the Wind
I was pregnant again
Oh gee, oh Lord, I swear
The babies are coming in pairs
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Well, some big shot from Hollywood
Thought a movie about my life would be good
It was a big hit, made a big splash
What I wanna know is what happened to the cash?
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Now me and Doo married 48 years
Six kids later, a lot of laughter and tears
I have to say that I've been blessed
Not bad for this old Kentucky girl, I guess
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Well, here's the story of my life
Listen and I'll tell it twice
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey2Embed
