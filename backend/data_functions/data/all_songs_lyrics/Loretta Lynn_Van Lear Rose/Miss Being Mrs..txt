Miss Being Mrs. Lyrics
I lie here all alone in my bed of memories
I'm dreaming of your sweet kiss
Oh, how you loved on me
I can almost feel you with me
Here in this blue moonlight
Oh, I miss being Mrs. tonight

Like so many other hearts, mine wanted to be free
I've been held here every day
Since you've been away from me
My reflection in the mirror
It's such a hurtful sight
Oh, I miss being Mrs. tonight

Oh, I miss being Mrs. tonight
Oh, and how I loved them loving arms
That once held me so tight
I took off my wedding band
And put it on my right hand
I miss being Mrs. tonight

Oh, I miss being Mrs. tonight
Oh, and how I loved them loving arms
That once held me so tight
I took off my wedding band
And put it on my right hand
I miss being Mrs. tonight
Oh I miss being Mrs. tonight1Embed
