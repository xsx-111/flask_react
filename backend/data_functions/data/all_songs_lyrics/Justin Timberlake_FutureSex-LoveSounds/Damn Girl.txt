Damn Girl Lyrics
Damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn
Damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn
Listen to me, uh, ah

I've been around the world, seen a million honey's
Really special girls, gave all my time and money
But there something 'bout ya, something that's kinda funny
That is what you do to me, oh
Don't need no Maybelline, 'cause you a beauty queen
Don't need no L'Oreal, 'cause, bitch, you're bad as hell
If I'm a Casanova, then you're a supernova
Girl, it's what you do to me that's got me saying

Damn girl, you're so fine
The way you let me put it down, girl, blows my mind
I guess I gotta put it down tonight
I gotta put it down, oh, oh, oh, damn

Damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn
Give me something, uh
Damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn
I said there's somethin' 'bout the way you do the things you do
And when you do the things you do, it's got me (Oh, oh, oh)
I said there's something' 'bout the way you do the things you do
And when you do the things you do, it's got me (Oh, oh, oh)
I said, don't need no Maybelline, 'cause you a beauty queen
Don't need no L'Oreal, 'cause, bitch, you're bad as hell
If I'm Casanova, then you're a supernova
Girl, it's what you do to me that's got me saying

Damn girl, you're so fine
The way you let me put it down, girl, blows my mind
I guess I gotta put it down tonight
I gotta put it down, oh, oh, oh

Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo-woo
Baby, give me some of your tasty
Cinnamon, give me your feminine gelatin
'Cause got a sinner man goin' crazy
Hey, b-b-b-b, b-b-b-baby
You the one I've been feenin' for
When I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin' of you
When you're gone, I've been screamin' for ya
So why don't you be my chick and stuff?
Take you out to dinner, catch a flick and stuff?
If we spend time, I'll never get enough
Baby, so fine, make a dope brother blush
Got me looking like a black grape and stuff
First time I sayin' it, you had me gon' crush
And if you ever give it to me, give it to me rough
You got me sayin'... (You got me sayin')
You got me sayin'
Damn girl, you're so fine
The way you let me put it down, girl, just blows my mind
So now I guess I gotta put it down tonight
I gotta put it down, oh, oh, oh
I'm saying, damn girl, you're so fine
The way you let me put it down, girl, blows my mind, baby
I guess I gotta put it down tonight
I gotta put it down, oh, oh, oh

I said there's somethin' 'bout the way you do the things you do
And when you do the things you do, it's got me (Oh, oh, oh)
I said there's something' 'bout the way you do the things you do
And when you do the things you do, it's got me (Oh, oh, oh)
Sing it with me, go
I said there's somethin' 'bout the way you do the things you do
And when you do the things you do, it's got me (Oh, oh, oh)
Sing it with me, go
I said there's something' 'bout the way you do the things you do
And when you do the things you do, it's got me (Oh, oh, oh)

Damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damn girl, damnEmbed
