Aphasia Lyrics
So satisfied, I said a lot of things tonight
So long, aphasia and the ways it kept me hiding
It's not so much exactly all the words I used
It's more that I was somehow down to let them loose

So complicated, I can't wait to get explaining
Your listening distended out since I've been crying
So long, aphasia, and the ways it kept me hidden
So long to silent nerves and hesitant oblivion

You came and sent me out unfurling in the street
I felt unprecedented confidence in speaking
Just stick around, I'm thinking things'll be alright
Newly delivered, won't you live with me tonight?

Something tonight was such a let down on my pride
It takes a part of me I don't got to take some things in stride
I'd pace around the place so quiet in myself
I'd wake the next and see my silence went unfelt

Just when I thought I had this pattern sorted out
Apparently my ventricles are full of doubt, now
Nah, things go wrong sometimes, don't let it freak you out
But if I don’t have you by me then I’ll go underground
Nah, but what you've got was in your reaches all along
Plus one day you’ll be reaching for me and I’ll be gone
So to help remind myself I wrote this little song

One day I won’t need your love
One day I won't define myself by the one I’m thinking of
And if one day I won't need it
And one day you won't need it4Embed
