New Friends LyricsIs there anyone here I know
I look around the room
Whatever I let it go
Steve's in Germany, that's it
I try to think of anyone else
No, yeah, that's it
I resolve to make new friends
I liked my old ones
But I fucked up so I'll start again
What's the worst that could happen
Strings frayed like my good days
Tied around my finger
I felt so afraid
I had my mind on her on my own
But when I looked back up
Everybody else was gone
So I resolve to make new friends
Someone tell me to quit my head
And help me forget it
What's the worst that could happen
The end of summer and I'm still in love with her
I said
Forget it
Was it worse that I wasn't sure
The end of summer and I'm still in love with her
I said
Forget it
Forget it
Forget it2Embed
