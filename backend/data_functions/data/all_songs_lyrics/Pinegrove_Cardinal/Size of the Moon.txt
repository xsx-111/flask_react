Size of the Moon LyricsDo you wanna dance?
Fine, but do you remember when
In your living room
When we made some room and moved ourselves around in it?
It's how my heart resumed
I got caught, you got those Caravaggio moves
We had some good ideas but we never left that fucking room
Do you wanna talk?
Fine, I'll talk it out with my dad
It's always nice what he says
He'll have some good advice from something in a book he read
If I did what I wanted then why do I feel so bad?
Would you like a drink
While we wait for everything
To get good again?
We're good at things and so are a lot of our friends
We should forget these setbacks and get back moving again

I dont know what I'm afraid of
But I'm afraid
One day it all will fall away
Maybe I read that
But still, let's see
If nothing else it's an idle curiosity
So would you like that drink?
Fine, yeah, I know, I remember that too
In your living room, right?
When we began to fight but then we both felt confused
Then we were laughing and crying in awe of the size of the moon
Do you want to die?
Fine, you're right
But I wonder what it feels like
To stop feeling so alive
What if we could wake up in five years and things'd be feeling alright?
I wanna visit the future and dance in a field of light

I dont know what I'm afraid of
But I'm afraid
One day it all will fall away
Maybe I read that
But still, let's see
If nothing else it's an idle curiosity3Embed
