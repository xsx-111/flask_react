Visiting LyricsI'm spectral for days on end these days
With thoughts about visiting
So how about my voice rings out for you
And you can tell me what you're doing
The truth is I lost all track of time
And I wound up wandering
Unraveling fragments all inside
But I rise up all aligning
Cause the truth is
I don't know what
But you did it
How long would I wander by your side?
How long would I wander?
Cause I feel like that's what it might feel like
I figured I'd warn you
I am out of my goddamned mind
And out to California
Follow along the dotted line with
With arcs of our blood
Cause the truth is
I don't know what
But I'll find it
After the drugs have worn off
And we're brittle in the light
Will you still be there for me?
Still do things for me?
Soul on the radio
Shaking in car around
City to city
Montclair and elsewhere
Nervous about coming over
It's all true
I like you
You move me
But the truth is
I don't know what
I thought I knew itEmbed
