Then Again Lyrics
I was totally nervous to go to Japan
I tried travel once, I lost my keys
I was leaning in with my shirt tucked in
I was on that train repeating:

How it's so illogical
It's nothing you can see
We repeat
Try it one more time with feeling
It's easy

I'm waking in an unusual town
Every morning in September
And you sleep it off and leave it all
But in the morning you remember
So I split the difference of lonesome and lonely
I lay I atrophy
I was laying in with my lung crushed in
I was on that plane repeating
How leaving's so relieving

How it's so illogical
It's nothing you can see
It's no retreating
Try it one more time with feeling
Help me

It's so illogical
It's nothing you can see
We repeat
Try it one more time with feeling
It's easy1Embed
