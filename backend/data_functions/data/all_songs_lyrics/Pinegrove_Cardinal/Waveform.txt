Waveform LyricsOn a page torn from this book
I drew a waveform with your blood
So I follow it, and so remorse
Courses through my body, of course
In a little while I’ll go
Unless you might want to hang a while
Then I won’t
You're the only one I found so far
So outside I could be around
So come down
Come over
On the cutting board
The lights were shutting down
An avocado cut through your thumb
Coursing out
Already undone
In a little while I’ll go
Unless you might want to hang a while
Then I won’t
You're the only one I found so far
So outside I could be around
You should come down
Over through the fire escape
It’s so late
But I know you aren’t tired yet
I’ll bet you've got a couple things you think I should know
But unless you wanna say it now
I’ll goEmbed
