Cadmium Lyrics
Was walking with my neck out
In some ways I wish I was
Was walking with my neck out
In some ways that I wish that I was
Out on the bevel sound
It sounds like everything else
You'll know it when you hear it
'Cause you know the way my voice felt

Ignore my tone and everything
I sing, I sing for me
Ignore the phone on the bed
It rings, it rings, it rings
Shirt collar wringing me out
My collarbone got all red
Already severing prose
I wrote, I sing instead

I hold you put your neck out
Tell me the ways you wish you were
Keep your confidence sound
Your hook, my eye, my spur
So when I went to hang out
I hung behind your eyes
My eyes still flicker with doubt
Quickly, oh I can't decide
I'm tapped out
Don't it always seem to go that
You could hold it right in your hands
Collapsing and still not know
In your hands
Collapse and still not know (not know)
Say what it is
Say how it is with everybody I know
I got no temper for that
I send you this cadmium red
One for every layer I shed
And I shed one layer for this

Say what it is
It's so impossible
But if I just say what it is
It tends to sublimate away
When I was looking to drop
My life away

More every year
I shine light on edges I tried to unfeel
We both gotta do better than that
Some sorting out
I'll be sitting on the outskirts, if you wanna talk about it
Things in there are getting so loud

Say what it is
It's so impossible
But if I just say what it is
It tends to sublimate away
When I was looking to drop
My life away9Embed
