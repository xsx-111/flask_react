Consolation Prize LyricsI came to you
My conscience clean
Blood on my knees
The moral of the story is
Don't walk away again
I called you out
To see my bow
Our final scene
The moral of the story is
Don't look away again
To find a better conversation
I saw you there
Your friends aware
Without a care
The moral of the story is
Don't lie to me again
To find a better conversation
So I can be your consolation prize
You ran away
To stand your ground
Look what I found
The moral of the story is
Don't walk away again
To find a better conversation
So I can be your consolation prize
To find a better conversation
No, I'll never be your consolation prizeEmbed
