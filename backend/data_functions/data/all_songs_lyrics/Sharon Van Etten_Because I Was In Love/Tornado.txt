Tornado LyricsYou never saw me as a reward
You didn't know he did
And then you tried to win the bet
You tripped and fell upon the sword
That I'd given to you though, you never carried
I'm a tornado, you are the dust
You're all around and you're inside
My eyes get dusty, cloudy
Just like you wanted
You were the child
And I'm the fault
Why do I fawn upon you?
You are the reason I'm a force
And when you knew you were you to feel worse
I'm a tornado, you are the dust
You're all around and you're inside
I cannot make you leave your source
'Cause you make yourself feel like you've got grounding
I'm a tornado, you are the dust
You're all around and you're inside
You are the nature, I'm the roar that comes from you
I'm a tornado, you are the dust
You're all around and you're inside
I'm a tornado, you are the fences that will fall
But still surround me
I'm a tornado
I'm a tornado
I'm a tornadoEmbed
