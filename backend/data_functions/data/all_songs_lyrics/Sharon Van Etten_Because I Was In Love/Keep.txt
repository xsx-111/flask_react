Keep LyricsKeep still, so I can find you at your whim
Breathe slowly, so I can breathe with you
Ooh, ooh
Leave me alone
We all want to feel at home
Find me sleeping
My inner dialogue's a drone
Keep...
Don't cry for me, I can't either
No, I can't weep
Remember these moments
They're all we have
And all I can keep
Caught in a lie, I want
You to keep me to yourself
Keep running deep under my skin I want to shed
Don't keep it in, keep it on the thinnest of all threads
And I want to break you no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
