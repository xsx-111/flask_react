Much More Than That LyricsOoh,ooh
Please don't take me lightly
I mean every word
Whichever way you'd like to place them
One day I'll be a better writer
I'll make every face
That I'll never perfectly phrase
Ooh, that I'll never perfectly phrase
You reached for my hand slowly
I didn't pull away
We did not have to be lips to face
My toe hit your toe lightly
Your toe met my heel right back
And I don't think I need much more than that
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And I don't think I need much more than that
You look at me so slyly
But only when I'm smiling
Every other time your head looks down
I sigh and then I frown
I write this moment down
'Cause I cannot paint pictures with my tongue
Ooh, ooh, ooh
No, I cannot paint pictures with my tongue1Embed
