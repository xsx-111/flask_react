I Fold LyricsLately I've seen
Confidence and grace
Crawl in a ball
And fear I've lost my faith
Broken down
Thought I was fine, fine, fine
Broken down
Caught in a rut
Foot hard to find, to hold
For granted your haven
The basement where I sang
Broken down
Thought I was fine, fine, fine
Broken down
Are you losing touch
Or, can't I just find my face?
Wrinkling up
I know time can't be erased
Broken down
Thought I was fine, fine, fine
Broken down
Broken down I foldEmbed
