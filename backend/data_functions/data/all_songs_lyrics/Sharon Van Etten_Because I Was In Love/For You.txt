For You LyricsI was walking up the street
I was thinking about my dreams that might come true
With you
I was whispering in my sleep
All the secrets that I keep, I told to you
I do, I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
I was running home to you
I was hoping that you knew I'd wait for you
I do, I do
I'd wait for you
I do, I do
I'd wait for you
I do, I do
I'd wait for you
But you knew
You knew, you knew, you knewEmbed
