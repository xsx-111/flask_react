Have You Seen LyricsHave you seen what I once called my heart?
Have you seen my life that's now falling apart?
Oooh, my life that's now falling apart
Have you been to what I once called my home?
States away, how could I not feel alone?
Oooh, how could I not feel alone?
Have you heard a heart flies away like a bird?
Runs from cold, into the arms that will hold
Oooh, into the arms that will hold
Into the arms that will holdEmbed
