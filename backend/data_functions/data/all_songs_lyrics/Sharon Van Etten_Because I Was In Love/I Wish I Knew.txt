I Wish I Knew LyricsI wish I knew what to do with you
But the truth is I ain't got a clue
Do you?
Do you?
I wish I had an idea of what I need
But we, oh we, can't know and that's okay
That's okay
I wish you'd understand
I wish that I could know
The truth is I have no idea
I wish we could just run around
And only worry about right now
I hate to admit it but I don't know shit
And neither do you, do you, do you, do you
And that is good
Enough for me, for you, for now
As long as we can talk about it3Embed
