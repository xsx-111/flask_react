Holding Out LyricsI was floored by your humble outlook on the world
Around you
Ooh, and all you are
I was floored by the way you take me seriously
Even when I'm joking
Damn, damn, damn, damn
I'm not tired and I'm tired
Of not calling out
On the street I was holding out
Holding out
Across the table, I was holding out
Trying to find a lover like that, holding out
Like the wind I was holding out
Staying still, hoping no one else would see me
Hoping calm replacing silent's trying palms
Do I need a reason to hold you now?
'Cause I'd hold you now
Yeah, I would hold you now
One night and all I need is one more day
Holding out for something that feels okay
And the right thing to do is wait
Holding out
Holding out
Holding out for you
I am strange, believed in fairy tales at a young age
Circumstance, now I kick myself in the pants
And then you came to me in a far away way
And I'm bringing you something I want you to have
It's the biggest part of my heart that I still got
Hoping arms
Know I'll be holding out
I'll be holding out
Holding out
I'll be holding out
Holding out
Holding out
Holding out
For youEmbed
