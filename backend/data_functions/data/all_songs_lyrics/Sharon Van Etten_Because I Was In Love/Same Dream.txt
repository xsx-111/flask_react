Same Dream LyricsBet you don't remember how we met
That's okay, it hasn't happened yet
Although we had the same dream
Although we had the same dream
I think I met you when I was sleeping
'Cause I shook myself awake
Although we had the same dream
I know when I go to sleep
We'll have the same dream
We'll have the same dream
Ooh, ooh
Bet you don't remember how we met
That's okay, it hasn't happened yet
Although we had the same dream
I know when I go to sleep
We'll have the same dream
'Cause we can still dreamEmbed
