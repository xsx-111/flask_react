Sunday Morning Lyrics
Yeah

Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life is hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

(Yeah) Fingers trace your every outline (Oh yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, oh, whoa)
And back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Yeah

Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
(Someday, oh, someday, oh)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

You may not know
That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Whoa, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah42Embed
