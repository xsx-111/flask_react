From Out of Nowhere Lyrics
From out of nowhere
I see you come rollin'
I wonder how could it be real
I can't believe what you did
And you showed up here

Rain keeps on falling
And voices keep calling
But nobody knows where to go
You get the feelin' that
Everything's gonna blow

Let me go (Let me go)
Let me fly (Let me fly)
To a place (To a place)
That I love (That I love)
Let me fly away
And start again

From out of nowhere
I see you come rollin'
I know what you got on your mind
I would consider explaining
The plot would be kind
Let me go (Let me go)
Let me fly (Let me fly)
To a place (To a place)
That I love (That I love)
Let me fly away
And start again

Let me go (Let me go)
Let me fly (Let me fly)
To a place (To a place)
That I love (That I love)
Let me fly away
And start again

Let me go (Let me go)
Let me fly (Let me fly)
To a place (To a place)
That I love (That I love)
Let me fly away
And start again3Embed
