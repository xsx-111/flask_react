Help Yourself Lyrics
I thought I could turn things around
And show you something that was new
But all I got was disappointment
I was left without a clue

But you can never change
You just keep on bein' you

You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself

And as the world grows dark beneath the setting sun
I think about you
And all the plans that we'd begun but never finished
Seem to turn and run

But you can never change
You just keep on bein' you

You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself

But you can never change
You just keep on bein' you

You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself

And as the world grows bright beneath the rising sun
I think about you
And all the things we never did
'Cause we forgot we ever wanted to

But you can never change
You just keep on bein' you

You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself (Help yourself)
You got to help yourself4Embed
