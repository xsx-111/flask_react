Songbird Lyrics
My songbird came home
She'd been gone for so long
My songbird came home
Heard a flutter to the little nest where she came from

Just late last night
I heard her sweet voice callin'
That she was home (Oh)
And my blues were gone

My songbird came home
Back to where she belonged
My songbird came home
Just to sing that sweet song, ooh
(Oh)

My songbird came home
Back to where she belonged
My songbird came home
Just to sing that sweet song, ooh

But now, every night (Ooh)
She sings her lovely song to me
My songbird came home (Oh)
Now my troubles are goneEmbed
