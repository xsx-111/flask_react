One More Time Lyrics
Come on (Come on)
Let's go (Let's go)
We gotta give it some rock and roll
Hey baby, we're rollin' on the road again
We gotta give it everything we got
Until the joint is fallin' apart
Just one more time

Come on (Come on)
It's alright (It's alright)
Let's get it on down tonight (Tonight)
Hey baby, flyin' out across the world (The world)
Gonna play those songs again
It's the best thing since I don't know when
Just one more time

Come on, baby, time to rock and roll (Rock and roll)
Get on board, and we'll soon be gone (Soon be gone)
Everybody gonna feel real fine (Feel real fine)
We're gonna do it one more time

One more time
Come on, baby, time to rock and roll (Rock and roll)
Get on board, and we'll soon be gone (Soon be gone)
Everybody gonna feel real fine (Feel real fine)
We're gonna do it one more time

Come on (Come on)
Get gone (Get gone)
We gotta move it on down the line
Hey, baby, don't you worry 'bout a thing tonight (Tonight)
It's just as sweet as it can be
Everybody come along with me
Just one more time

Come on, baby, time to rock and roll (Rock and roll)
Get on board, and we'll soon be gone (Soon be gone)
Everybody gonna feel real fine (Feel real fine)
We're gonna do it one more time (One more time)

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more timeEmbed
