Down Came the Rain Lyrics
You let me go when I was down
You let me fall when I could drown
You knew how much you meant to me
You took me down that slippery slope
You left me there without a hope
You saw just what you wanted to see

Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain
Fallin' down on me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And now the time has come at last
Those days would slide into the past
And nevermore will there be misery
I'm movin' on in my own time
I'm gettin' further down the line
I'm tryin' to see what's goin' on

Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain
Fallin' down on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain
Fallin' down on me

Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain (Down came the rain)
Down came the rain
Fallin' down on me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

(Down came, down came the rain) Down came the rain
(Down came, down came the rain) Oh yeah
(Down came, down came the rain) Down came the rain
(Down came, down came the rain) Down came the rain
(Down came, down came the rain) Down came the rain
(Down came, down came the rain) Oh yeah
(Down came, down came the rain) Down came the rain
(Down came, down came the rain) Down came the rain
(Down came, down came the rain) Down came the rainEmbed
