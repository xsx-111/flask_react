Sci-Fi Woman Lyrics
How the world has changed
Since you came along
How the time has flown
As we travel on

As I look at all
All we ever knew
From the rules of life
To a love that's true

Then I stayed and I wondered how
How come you don't need me now?
My sci-fi woman
Sci-fi girl

So you've gone away
To find yourself somewhere
I could've found you, girl
Yeah, right there in your head

You made just a little feel
Of what I'm supposed to be
Seems like some kind of game
That you're playin' with me
As I try to get through to you
There's nothin' more that I can do
My sci-fi woman
Sci-fi girl

Too late to wonder when it all goes wrong
Too soon to know that this should carry on

Though we said goodbye
Many times before
I never really thought
There would be no more

Then I stayed and I wondered how
How come you don't need me now?
My sci-fi woman
Sci-fi girl

Sci-fi woman
Sci-fi girlEmbed
