All My Love Lyrics
All my love
If I could only tell you now
What I could never tell you then
And wander through the streets of yesterday
All my love (All my love, all my love)

All my love
And I still remember how you smiled
And waved your last goodbye
But somehow, you will always live with me
All my love (All my love, all my love)

I see it all
The way we fall for one another's make-believe, ah
All my love (All my love, all my love)

All my love
I can still recall the chances
Of whatever was to be
Maybe it still means as much to you
As it does to me (All my love, all my love)
I see it all
The way we fall for one another's make-believe, ah
All my love (All my love, all my love)

All my love
I can still go on believing
That I'll see you once again
And you'll be waiting there one sunny day
All my love (All my love)
All my love (All my love)

All my love (All my love)
All my love (All my love)
All my love (All my love)
All my love (All my love)
All my love (All my love)
(All my love)1Embed
