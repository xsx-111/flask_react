Time of Our Life Lyrics
Went down to London Town
To play our music at the football ground
"I can't believe this is goin' down"
I said to my friend Phil
60,000 rockin' out
And singin' loud, I had to shout
And best of all, they seemed so happy just bein' there

Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We had the time of our life

As we played on, it came to me
This could be the best night I've ever seen
The whole of Wembley singin' along
To every little song
60,000 mobile phones
Were shinin' in the dark of night
Wavin' and weavin', and boy, did they shine
When we struck up with "Telephone Line"
(Oh, telephone line)
We had that night
We had the time of our life
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We had the time of our life

Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We had the time of our life

We had the time of our life
Time of our life1Embed
