Long Title: Do I Have to Do This All Over Again? Lyrics
Do I have to do this all over again?
Didn't I do it right the first time?
Do I have to do this all over again?
How many times do I have to make this climb?
Didn't I? Didn't I?

Can I see my way to know what's really real?
They say time can fix things by itself
I know life's more than just some kind of deal
Yeah, but won't you tell me when
Oh, when my soul comes off the shelf?
Didn't I? Didn't I? Oh, didn't I?

Do I have to do this all over again?
Didn't I do it right the first time?
Do I have to do this all over again?
Oh, how many times do I have to make this climb?

Didn't I? Oh, didn't I?
Oh, didn't I? Didn't I?
Oh, didn't I? Oh, didn't I?
Oh, didn't I? Oh, didn't I?
Didn't I? Didn't I?
Didn't I...?Embed
