As We Go Along Lyrics
I can tell by your face
That you're looking to find a place
To settle your mind
And reveal who you are
And you shouldn't be shy
For I'm not gonna try
To hurt you, or heal you
Or steal your star

Open your eyes, get up off your chair
There's so much to do in the sunlight
Give up your secrets and let down your hair
And sit with me here by the firelight

Why think all about
Who's gonna win out?
We'll make up our story
As we go along
There's so little time
For us to try to rhyme
And so many highways
To travel upon
Open your eyes, get up off your chair
There's so much to do in the sunlight
Give up your secrets and let down your hair
And sit with me here by the firelight1Embed
