Can You Dig It? Lyrics
Something doesn't change
There is only one
Always changing inside
What does it become?

Can you dig it?
Do you know?
Would you care to let it show?

Those who know it use it
Those who scorn it die
To sing that you can dig it
Is to make your soul to fly to heaven

Can you dig it?
Do you know?
Would you care to let it show?


Can you dig it?
Do you know?
Would you care to let it show?
There is only feeling
In this world of life and death
I sing the praise of never change
With every single breath

Can you dig it?
Do you know?
Would you care to let it show?
