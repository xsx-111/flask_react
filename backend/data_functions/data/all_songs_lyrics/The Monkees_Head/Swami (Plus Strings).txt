Swami (Plus Strings) LyricsWe were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus, the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs deposing another
And so on, and so on, and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is the central nervous system
Which feeds its impulses directly to the brain, the conscious and subconscious
Is unable to discern between the real, and the vividly imagined experience
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
For to examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception of belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity
For where there is clarity there is no choice
And where there is choice, there is misery
But then why should anyone listen to me?
Why should I speak? Since I know nothing! Heh heh heh!
...The porpoise is laughing good-bye, good-bye...
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye...
Clicks, clacks, riding the backs of giraffes for laughs is alright for a while
The ego sings of castles and kings and things
That go with a life of style
Wanting to feel, to know what is real
Living is a, is a lie
The porpoise is waiting good-bye, good-bye...
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye...
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye...
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye...
"Quick, suck it before the venom reaches my heart!"
"Okay, I will."Embed
