Circle Sky LyricsCircle sky
Telling lies
Here I stand
At demand
'Cause it looks like we've made it once again
Yes, it looks like we've made it once again
Color sound
Is all around
Wing-tip smile
Sees for miles
And it looks like we've made it once again
Yes, it looks like we've made it once again
It's a very extraordinary scene
To those who don't understand
But what you have seen you must believe
If you can, if you can
Hamilton
Smiling down
Telling more
Than before
And it looks like we've made it once again
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the endEmbed
