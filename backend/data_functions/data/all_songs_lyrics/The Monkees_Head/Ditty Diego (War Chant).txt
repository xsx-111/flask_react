Ditty Diego (War Chant) LyricsHey now wait a minute!
Now wait just a minute!
Hey hey we are the Monkees
You know we love to please
A manufactured image
With no philosophies
We hope you like our story
Although there isn't one
That is to say there's many
That way there is more fun
You told us you like action
And games of many kinds
You like to dance, we like to sing
So let's all lose our minds!
We know it doesn't matter
Cause what you came to see
Is what we'd love to give you
And give it one, two, three!
But there may come three, two, one, two
Or jump from nine to five
And when you see the end in sight
The beginning may arrive!
For those who look for meaning
And form as they do facts
We might tell you one thing
But we'd only take it back
Not back like in a box back
Not back like in a race
Not back so we can keep it
But back in time and space!
You say we're manufactured
To that we all agree
So make you choice and we'll rejoice
In never being free!
Hey hey we are the Monkees
We've said it all before
The money's in we're made of tin
We're here to give you more!
The money's in we're made of tin
We're here to give you--
*BANG!!*
*SCREAM!!!*
GIMME A W!
W!
GIMME AN A!
A!
GIMME AN R!!

WHAT DOES THAT SPELL!!??
WAR!!Embed
