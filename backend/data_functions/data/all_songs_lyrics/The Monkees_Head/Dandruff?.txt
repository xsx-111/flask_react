Dandruff? LyricsBy Jack Nicholson & Robert Rafelson
"Supernatural, perhaps..."
"Change one tape, the entire process is regeared. Leisure: the
Inevitable by-product of our civilization. The tragedy of your times, my
Young friends, is
That you may get exactly what you want."
Cop: "Out..."
Mike: "Oh"
Cop: "Out...get outta here."
Micky: "Hi. What's going on?"
Cop: "Move it! Out!"
Peter: "Oh, hello officer, certainly glad to..."
Cop: "Shut up!...Okay, weirdos..."
Director: "Alright, fellas, will you come forward, please?"
Micky: "Who's that?"
Director: "Alright, now, jump up and down a little, huh, fellas? Get
Lost in it...""
Davy: "Jump into this?!? What is this stuff?"
Director: "...there you go...very good. Look, you're supposed to be
Dandruff, fellas."
All: "Dandruff?"
Director: "Will you work at it, please? Jump up and down a little
Bit..."
Playback: "Dandruff, dandruff..."
Director: "Good, that's better, that's good."Embed
