Some Men are like Chocolate LyricsGentle words, had been my weapons
Careful openness and fragile honesty
Had gradually begun to slowly win him over ... -
And somehow had lured him here
Despite my obvious display of defect
My miserable frailty
Of which I never made a secret
I disarmed him with my sincerity
That never waned, despite the laughter
Of public insult, ridicule
Not even when confessing meant
Turning myself into a wretched fool
Some men are like chocolate
But most of them are like shit
And if you don't have the experience
To spot that tiny difference
You're likely to fall for all of it
In secret, on those rare occasions
When no living soul was near
No eyes, no ears, no other people
Were around to see or hear
So there was no danger of some chance intruder
To doubt his manliness and strength ... -
Then suddenly his words grew gentler. and his gestures slightly changed
He did not seem to mind my presence at all
Came even closer of his own accord
Yet still he veiled each subtle revelation
In rough-cut gowns of what we call
The "ACCIDENTAL TOUCH"
Some men can truly be like chocolate
But most of them are more like SHIT
And if you don't have the experience
To spot that tiny difference
You're very likely to fall for all of it
Alas, some men are like chocolate
But most of them are like SHIT
And if you don't have the experience
To spot that subtle difference
You're likely to fall
For only the promise of a kissEmbed
