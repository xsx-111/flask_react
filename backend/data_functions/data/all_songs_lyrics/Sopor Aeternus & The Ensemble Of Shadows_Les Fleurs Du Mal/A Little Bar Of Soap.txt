A Little Bar Of Soap LyricsI wish I was a little bar of soap
I wish I was a little bar of soap
I'd go slippy slippy, slimy over everybody's heinie
I wish I was a little bar of soap
Bar of soap
Hmm- ba - bar of soap
Slippy, slippy, slime
Hmm-ba - bar of soap
Wouldn't that be fine?
Oh-hmm-ba - bar of soap
Slippy, slippy, slime
Hmm-ba - bar of soap
To purify your soul and your behindEmbed
