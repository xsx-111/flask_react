Always within the Hour LyricsHave I, without knowledge, made a subtle pass at you, or have the
poses that are mine to strike then perhaps posed a threat to you?
Have I crossed the thin line now, that guards your un-enchanted barn,
was it my simple friendliness that stirred the peasants, causing this alarm?
Hänsel, call your soldiers back, this witch sticks to her gingerbread.
Girlfriends, wives or fiancées will save your sacred straightness from disgrace.
Such ugliness laid eyes on you in conversation, plain to see.
Your signals, clearly advertising, stressing the obvious to me!
Oh, bite your tongue, is it too much to ask for, can't you just for once, keep it in.
Oh, please don't say it … - spare me your painful arrogance!
Hänsel, call your soldiers back, this witch sticks to her gingerbread.
Girlfriends, wives or fiancées will save your sacred straightness from disgrace.
Say:
Have I, without knowledge, made a subtle pass at you, or have the
poses that are mine to strike then perhaps posed a threat to you?
Have I, out of saddest habit, stared for too long at one spot?
Or has my silence been mistaken for pondering on your private parts?
Hänsel, call your soldiers back, this witch sticks to her gingerbread.
Girlfriends, wives or fiancées will save your sacred straightness from disgraceEmbed
