Here Today, Gone Tomorrow Lyrics
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
I do, I do

But I told you why we just can't make it
I want you still but just can't take it
The time has come we oughta break it
Someone had to pay the price

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Over
It's true, it's true
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Over
It's true, it's true

And I think of times we were together
As time went on it seemed forever
But times have changed
Now things are better
Someone had to pay the price

And I think of times we were together
As time went on it seemed forever
But times have changed
Now things are better
Someone had to pay the price1Embed
