Cretin Hop Lyrics
There's no stopping the cretins from hopping
You got to keep it beating
For all the hopping cretins

Cretin! Cretin!
I'm going to go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop
Doing the Cretin Hop
Cretin! Cretin!

One-two-three-four
Cretins want to hop some more
Four-five-six-seven
All good cretins go to heaven

There's no stopping the cretins from hopping
You got to keep it beating
For all the hopping cretins

Cretin! Cretin!
I'm going to go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop
Doing the Cretin Hop
Cretin! Cretin!
One-two-three-four
Cretins want to hop some more
Four-five-six-seven
All good cretins go to heavenEmbed
