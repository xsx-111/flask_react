I Wanna Be Well Lyrics
Yeah
I wanna be well
I wanna be well
I wanna be
Want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want, I want, I
Yeah
I wanna be well
I wanna be well
I wanna be
Want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want

I want my LSD, Dolly Gee, a DDT, a Wowee
A daddy's broke
Holy smoke
My future's bleak
Ain't it neat?

Yeah
I wanna be well
I wanna be well
I wanna be
Want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want, I want, I
Yeah
I wanna be well
I wanna be well
I wanna be
Want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want
I want my LSD, Dolly Gee, a DDT, a Wowee
A daddy's broke
Holy smoke
My future's bleak
Ain't it neat?

Yeah
I wanna be well
I wanna be well
I wanna be well2Embed
