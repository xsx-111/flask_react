Another Time LyricsWhere have you been to?
Where did you go?
Did you follow the summer out
When the winter pushed its face in the snow?
Or have you come by again
To die again?
Try again another time
Did you follow the Crystal Swan?
Did you see yourself
Deep inside the Velvet Pond?
Or have you come by again
To die again?
Try again another time
When you set to shape the world
Was the shape the shape of you?
Or did you cast enchanting glance
Through the eye that all men use?
Or have you come by again
To die again?
Try again another time
Did you find that the Universe
Doesn't care at all?
Did you find that if you don't care
This whole wrong world will fall?
Or have you come by again
To die again?
Try again another time
Did you ever capture
All those jewels in the sky?
Did you find that the world outside
Is all inside your mind?
Or have you come by again
To die again
Try again another time1Embed
