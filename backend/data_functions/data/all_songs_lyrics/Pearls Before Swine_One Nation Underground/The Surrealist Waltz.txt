The Surrealist Waltz LyricsLederer-Crissinger
She stays with Timothy in black vibrations alley
Love makes statements in the closet mouths of cloth
Please, stay awhile and die with me
Word-witch in the dutch plane with the quiet beggar
Heaven near the womb of silence sense
The gold about hang chains of stoneEmbed
