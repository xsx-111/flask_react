Morning Song LyricsAll along the cold gross canal
The grey-walled dwarf
Leaps high
Dwelling dark victorious
Silent with a cry
On the ledge
The leper walks
Soft-pawed
Cold
Lean and crisp
Telling jokes the old Jew told
Laughing with a lisp
At the door
I stand and sense
Each picture in its frame
Seeking out
In each glance
The hunchback
With my nameEmbed
