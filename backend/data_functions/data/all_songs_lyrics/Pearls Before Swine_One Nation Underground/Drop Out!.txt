Drop Out! LyricsDrop out with me
And just live your life
Behind your eyes
Your own skies
Your own tomorrows
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry
Just be yourself
And no one can step
Inside your mind
From behind
If you just walk out
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry
They made the rules
And they laid it
On us all
Don't you fall
'Cause then they own you
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry
They're using you
To kill all the echoes still
Around
From the sound
Of calendars crumbling
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry
They made the bomb
Would they drop it
On us all?
Great and small
But must we follow
Drop out with me
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry
Drop out with me
And just live your life
Behind your eyes
Your own skies
Your own tomorrows
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurryEmbed
