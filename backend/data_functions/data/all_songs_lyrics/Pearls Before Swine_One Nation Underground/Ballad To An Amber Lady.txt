Ballad To An Amber Lady LyricsCrissinger-Rapp
The amber lady seated at her harpsichord in velvet
Room of eastern wonder
Gazing through the verdant window
Wrapped in arms of silk and sorrow
Rebecca sighs and perishes beneath the harp
Leila, Leila, she loves anon
On high fields of cinder sun
I see you drifting draped in heavy lace
Where is this place where you stand radiant ?
Your hand hides the moon
And you move with crystal grace
Rebecca sighs and perishes beneath the harp
Leila, Leila, she loves anon
On high fields of cinder sun
Mmmm â€¦
Stain-glass showering, diamond morning
Soft smiling in the shining hours
Boughs of henna in your hair
Roses in your silent garden
Rebecca sighs and perishes beneath the harp
Leila, Leila, she loves anon
On high fields of cinder sun1Embed
