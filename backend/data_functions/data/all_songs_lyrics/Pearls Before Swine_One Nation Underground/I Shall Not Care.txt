I Shall Not Care LyricsWhen I am dead
And over me bright April
Shakes out her rain-drenched hair
Though you should lean
Above me broken-hearted
I shall not care
Words that were not said
Songs that were not sung
Tears that were not shed
Deeds that were not done
I was not
I was
I am not
I do not care
Words that were not said
Songs that were not sung
Tears that were not shed
Deeds that were not done
I shall have peace
As leafy trees are peaceful
When rain bends down the bow
And I shall be
More silent and cold-hearted
Than you are nowEmbed
