Regions Of May LyricsThe past is broken like an hourglass
And the scattered sand of circumstance
Was blinding me to you
The rain is whispering to my window pane
And drawing crazy patterns
On the blind
Your face is invading the portals of my eyes
And drawing crazy patterns
On my mind
Who created mist
Created your smile
And who created rainbows
Created you
My mind is all entwined
In fragrant fields of flowers
And the scent puts me outside my mind
The past, the rain
Your face, mist and rainbows
Flowers and the rain are youEmbed
