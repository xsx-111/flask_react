Playmate LyricsAnne Rachel-Dowell
Well, playmate, come out and play with me
And bring your dollies three, climb up my apple tree
Holler down my rain barrel, slide down my cellar door
And we’ll be jolly friends forever more
Well, playmate, I can’t come play with you
My dolly’s got the flu, boo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
I got no rain barrel, I got no cellar door
But we’ll be jolly friends forever moreEmbed
