Away Above Lyrics
Away, above
Find a perfect love
You and me (And me)
We're meant to see it through
You and me (And me)
You and me (And me)

I don't feel bad for you
And that's what makes us free
You can buy into that dream
Waitin' for true love to seem real
Passing over bridges
Faces wanna listen
I hope that we'll go home
I want to be alone
Won't you come meet me at nine?
I'll bring your worst fears if you bring mine
And we can laugh over a night of red wine
Got a radio to pay the dream
Necessary evil
Are we meant to be?
I swear that you know me more than I'll ever know

Away (Away), above (Above)
Find a perfect love
You (And you) and me (And me)
It was meant to see some time through
Yeah, you
And me
Oh, I won't hold back from you
Sometimes I can't even feel, the wheel's broken from pushing still
And the lines of knowing and being undone
Some things you just gotta run away from
But that doesn't change us
Away and above
What you give is good enough
Got me living in the dream

Away (Away), above (Above)
Find a perfect love
You (And you) and me (And me)
We were meant to see some time through
Yeah, you
And me
Oh, I won't hold back from you2Embed
