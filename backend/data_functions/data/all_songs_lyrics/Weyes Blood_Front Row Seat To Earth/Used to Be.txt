Used to Be Lyrics
In spite of being so late to the game
I won't fight fate
It's now too late

Used to be the one that knew me
Saw through me
Used to be the one that knew

And every morning when I rise
Those cold blue eyes aren't here too
The worst came true
The binds that break and shatter off
When you fall down from the top
And your heart stops

Used to be the one that knew me
Saw through me
Used to be the one that knew

And if the dawn don't break me
If I don't become after
No time to go back and find
Who was chasing which disaster
I hold the truth like a tight noose
And sometimes you do
It's getting hard to get along with your new love song so soon
Can it really be true?
The binds that break and shatter off when you fall down from the top
And your heart stops

Used to be the one that knew me
Saw through me
Used to be the one that knew me
You used to be the one that knew me

You used to be the oneEmbed
