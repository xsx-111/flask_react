SIDE THREE-A LyricsPart I

Part II
Yo, Dylan do a lot of shit
So funky, uh huh
Ayy, you feel that? I feel that
Legacy, legacy
I love it so much

L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y

I love you so much, I can't stand it, single-handed dismantle
Grab the microphone and get you lit like a candle
Premeditated, word murdered, it's the microphone hurter
Third-degree bird burner, techniques you never heard of
A word smith dirty in the first person
Y'all should worship the verses, legacy's dispersin'
A rap assassin on the burn laps around you rat cats
And sacrilegious fappin' tackle the Vatican
Why's it called backpackin', ain't that Kanye West fashion?
In permanent inaction, smack a grand dragon with my pants saggin'
Not braggin', strictly sayin' how it is
Paralyze your vision with acrobatic mathematics
Rap's tactics kick the planet off its axis
Divine entities suffer from microphone deficiencies
Religious conspiracies expose false identities
Command and conquer Roman forces
Predominantly spit it, properly trespassed on your property
Like hold your horses, observe the planet's orbit
Digital rhyme enhancement teleporting
Playin' more cats than Eddie Murphy did in Norbit
This is war power, Jenga your Twin Towers suicide sound bombin'
Underground like Tutankhamen
Paint a past, come correct connect guzzle 'til I vomit
Heaven's gate MCs waiting for the comet, we ain't got shit in common
Anatomically atomic, dirty with style progression
Transform my microphone into the Smith & Wesson
Peace to Daddy Kane, ain't no half steppin' (no half steppin')
The dookie world broke your wallet, comatosed the alcoholic
Raised on the mic, then I'll do you like Suge Knight did Vanilla Ice
Peace, this is life, call me righteous
Whoo, call me Christ
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y

The illustrious buster adjuster
Emperor Augustus spreadin' up suckas like they mustard
Flustered, puffin' on a blunt that was dusted
Who you think done it, Gus? All y'all are suspects
Paranoid inseminated visuals like celluloid
Disintegrate the physical frame, lust is humanoid
Automated super boy, reality is stiff like it's rheumatoid
So I move asteroid fields to your home planet
Earth in the center of void make a odd sandwich, God damn it
Can't stand the way my thoughts take advantage of my state of affairs
Unauthorized shares counting ducats
My mind playing musical chairs, kick the bucket
Eyes fixed, no movement, I stare across the clusters
Of galaxies, thought about fatality, morality
Thought about how I was actually below it
Fathoms deeper, hold it, give me ten, let me think it through again
Stolen moments flick cross my peripheral, matter vanishes from the physical
Artificial elements, typically hard to mystify the mystical
Visualize spiritual, plus it's pivotal to the universe
I'll balance out the axis, Galactus, set fire to heaven with a wet matchstick
You can't hack it, rappers just urine on a mattress
Cactus syringe cream stabbed through my skin
It's a fact y'all are whack plus distracted
Check the focus, hocus pocus, money never broke
It's still hangin' in my kitchen cooking Stouffers
Bags fluctuate like it's Oprah's
Dug more holes than the Caddyshack gopher
Oh my, you can't see where I be, it's the L-E-G-A-C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y
L to the E-G, A to the C-Y

L - E - G - A - C - Y
It's the legacy

Your patterns of observation, continue
Part III
No words can say the truth, we're not alone
I've been waiting for this fucking 
I saw the change when you came home
I saw the change, I saw the change in you tonight
If you don't mind, I'll call it 
If you don't mind, I'll call it 
I wasted all my  with you
If you don't mind, I'll call it 
No words can say the truth, we're not alone

If you don't mind, I'll call it 
If you don't mind, I'll call it 
If you don't mind, I'll call it 

Part IV
One, two step, party's in effect
Cross-colored hoodie, got pearls on the neck
Respect, homie that's all we get
Infinite rave, it'll never stop kickin'
Infinite rave, never go to sleep
Infinite drugs, infinite beats
And to all y'all girls lookin' infinite fine tryna intimate grind, I got plenty of time

Okay, once we started it, you better work out (work it out now)
So let me see you shake your body, let me see you bounce (bounce)
Once the party started, then there ain't no gettin' out (get down now)

Infinite rave, infinite rave, infinite rave, infinite rave

Part V
I sent a bomb to a computer expert (mystery)
A catalogue of destruction (evil world)
I sent a bomb to a computer expert (mystery)
A catalogue of destruction (evil world)
I sent a bomb to a computer expert (mystery)
A catalogue of destruction (evil world)
I sent a bomb to a computer expert (mystery)
A catalogue of destruction (evil world)

Part VI
Everything was like, dead calm
And I was, uh, ready for this to happen
I even heard a voice, my own
Inside of me, say "do it, do it, do it"1Embed
