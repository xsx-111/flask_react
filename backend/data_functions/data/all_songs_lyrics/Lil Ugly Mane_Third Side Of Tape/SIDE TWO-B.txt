Part V
Side swipe, I'm infinite
My infantry ready for centuries
Pain and my ecstasy
Intersect mentally covered in arms
So I'm something like centipede
Enter my space and the eye on my scepter
Evaluate studies, your movements, your shadows
Evaporates, pride is disaster, the prodigal master
My people just watchin' my vertebrae currently
Cold
Only dream of dying if I have a dream
Go ahead, pop five in the magazine
Only time I ever matter
When I'm swinging from the scaffolding
Weak thoughts really terrified of ever after
So I still breathe, heart beats, wrong turns
New paths spit gas
Slide out, tell me where the work at
Soon as I mention it, that's when I get it
Glitches in time, I'm dismissive of physics
We live on the back of a serpent that hisses
Then swallowed the sun while you busy with riches and bitches
Switching my style so I'm louder than bombs
Flooded and drowned me, when lighting them off
Renowned worldwide, wish it was gone
Crooked letter E-P-A-R-A-T-E me from the weak
Player, I'm gone
I be, I be hiberatin', gettin' high
Penetratin' somethin' fly
Somethin' fly, fly, fly, fly
I be, I be hiberatin', gettin' high
Penetratin' somethin' fly
Somethin' fly, fly, fly, fly
I be, I be hiberatin', gettin' high
Penetratin' somethin' fly
Somethin' fly, fly, fly, fly
I be, I be hiberatin', gettin' high
Penetratin' somethin' fly
Somethin' fly, fly, fly, fly

I'm space station, I'm cold scab
Steadily makin' my nose numb
Bent thumbs dig back in my sockets
Nothin' worth seein', I'd rather be dumb

Part VI
Go to sleep 
Go to sleep 
Go to sleep

Part XI: SUNDAY DRIVE
Woke up Sunday morning from the sun in the window
Clock only said 10 but I'm fully awake though
What's to get into? I'm thinking to myself
As I'm rolling up fresh that's got that herb off the shelf
They say it's bad for your health but you only live once
That's why I'm smoking a cigarette right after my blunt
Fuck a zero tolerance, I'm a zero who tolerates
Any substance that will enhance your mind state
If you think of repercussions, you'll be always running
And could still die young from a gun or something, but fuck it
It's too nice to be chillin' inside
Plus everybody and they mama in the hood's outside
It's like everybody feelin' that good time vibe
It's like everybody glad just to be alive
I put out my Camel with that thought in my mind
Called the boys, I'm going driving now, who wanna ride?

It's that brand new type of Sunday drive
Tunes up, smoked out and getting live
We celebrating each day that we survive
We livin' for these days now, who wanna ride?
It's that brand new type of Sunday drive
Tunes up, smoked out and getting live
We celebrating each day that we survive
We livin' for these days now, who wanna ride?

Young dude wanna ride
Jump in the whip, just it's lit and we bumping 106.5
I got the blunt to my lips, I'm just glad we alive
Don't trip, I ain't B.I.G., I ain't ready to die
I ain't tryna let poverty happen
So I flipped and stay properly mackin'
The burner in the trunk in my state property jacket
Don't take me from a punk cause it's definitely packin'
But it ain't about that today, everything is a-okay
I ain't even seen no Jakes
Roll down low and had to pump the brakes
Ricky outside, you're ready to slide, make no mistake
If Gus is on your block then he lifted off that indo
If you only got that live I'm just waving from the window
Sorry man, the lac-lac ain't no  way that we can fit you
Don't make it such an issue, damn

I got the see-saw slump with my homies beside me
Ain't that something? Who wanna ride, G?
