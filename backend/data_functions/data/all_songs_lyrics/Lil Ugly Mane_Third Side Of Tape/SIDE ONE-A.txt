Where them kitty cats at?
Where them kitty cats at?

My cute kitties with the big fluffy tails
Oh, I love my kitty cat
Can't seem to find him, though
Big, fat, and white with a spot on his back end, though
Tickles when you smack his nose
Tickles when he lick your nose
Damn, I miss my kitty, so you better help me find him, hoe
My pretty kitty cat used to sleep in my bed
Cuddle up beside me and nuzzle on my head
Pussy like it firm, make biscuits on my chest
I love my motherfuckin' kitty, leave the world in the past
Used to eat up all my tuna and my Friskies, kid
Now I got a full bag, and I wish he did
Tail real bushy, overall real squishy
Boy, I split your wig if I catch you with my pussy
Where them kitty cats at?
Where them
Where them, where them, where them kitty cats at?
Where them kitty cats at?
Where them kitty cats at?
Where them, where them, where them kitty
Where them kitty cats at?
Where them kitty cats at?

Where them cute kitties with the big fluffy tail?
How the litter box seem? Check it, holler if it smells
I miss the jingle in my house from the collar with the bell
I'm bein' tolerant as hell
If you see him, please tell 'cause I got all of his toys I can't very well sell
When you scratch him by his tail, he will raise up his booty
If I had a picture, you would say he was a cutie
I can't believe you left the door open in the backyard
Little kitty leg shit, I'm sure he got mad far
Probably so scared of the weather and them bad cars
Probably get in fights and come back with little cat scars
All I want in life is to snuggle with my muffy
I love my kitty cat, so bitch, don't push me

Where my kitty cats at?
Where my, where my kitty kitty?
Kitty cats at
Where my, where my kitty?
Where my kitty cats at?
Where my kitty cats at?
Where my kitty cats at?
Where, where my kitties?
Where them cute kitties with the big fluffy tails?
