Part III
Baby, I
Baby, I want you
You crawl and you drool, and you want anyone
Now that I
Now that I found you
All I think about is how to get away from you
Won't you think about what you've done?
Bein' born, havin' fun
I just want your life to end
Wow
Punish explode
Punish explode
Oh

Gotta sleep
Why don't you lie around 
You act like a maniac  that you learned
Coming down
Coming down so fast
What should I do with you?

Won't you think about what you've done?
Bein' born, havin' fun
I just want your life to end
Oh
Punish explode
Punish explode
Oh
Punish explode
Punish explode
Oh

Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Hold on
I'll sing myâ€”can I sing my own little song in here, and then y'all leave me alone?
Yeah, yeah
Okay? Alright
Okay
Go ahead

Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica, I made a stop
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Down in the markets you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackee rice, salt fish is nice
And the rum is fine any time of year
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

You play piano too?Embed
