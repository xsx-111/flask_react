Kennedy LyricsLost your love of life?
Too much apple pie
Oh have you lost your love of life?
Too much apple pie
And now Harry's walked away with Johnny's wife
You've got to pick some people up
You've got to let some people go
But if Lee's name does come up
Oh well I really want to know
Because everybody loves a T.V. show
Lost your love of life?
Too much apple pie
Oh have you lost your love of life?
Too much apple pie
And now Harry's walked away with Johnny's wife
You've got to pick some people up
You've got to let some people go
But if Lee's name does come up
Oh well I really want to know
Because everybody loves a T.V. show
Lost your love of life?
Too much apple pie
Oh have you lost your love of life?
Too much apple pie
And now Harry's walked away with Johnny's wife (ahh)Embed
