What Have I Said Now? LyricsAbout what I said just before
You know, your clothes on the floor
I never meant to hurt you
I got carried away
I guess I've had a long day
Look, I'd sooner die than lose you
Over something like that
Oh, please, next time just shout back
And I didn't say that I hate you
I think sometimes you forget
And now look how we're upset
Let's talk about it later
Why can't I ever say what I mean?
Why can't I ever say what I mean?
Oh no I don't know her name
And no, it's not just the same
I just thought she looked quite pretty
What do you want me to do
Smile at nobody but you?
Well if you're going to be that petty
I'm not being unfair
Okay, I am, but who cares
Well, now at least we're talking
And what about all of those friends
And all those letters they send
They can't all be that boring
Why can't I ever say what I mean?
Why can't I ever say what I mean?
Of course I take it all back
I never said that
And I think you know
I said I'm sorry alright?
Look, will this carry on all night?
Because I think I'll go
I take it all back
I never said that
And I think you know
Sorry, alright?
Will this carry on all night?
I think I'll goEmbed
