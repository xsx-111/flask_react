Box Elder LyricsWasn't the question you asked me
It wasn't the answer I gave
That made me feel like I was on a train
Was a distant voice
Made me make the choice
That I had to get right out of this town
I've got a lot of things to do
A lot of places to go
I've got a lot of good things coming my way
And I'm afraid to say that you're not one of them
Last time I was here
You were out on the couch
Pressed into a little electric 2
It was the way that you smiled
Made me know at once
That I had to get right out of this town
I've decide to make a stand
And I'm not gonna take your hand
I'm taking the next bus outta here
I'm gonna head for Box Elder, M.OEmbed
