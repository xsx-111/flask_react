No LyricsWhy can't you pick up the telephone?
Oh I know that you're at home
I'm really past caring how you think
I just want to know about him
And you're so right, they don't miss a thing round here
And how do you think I feel?
Oh you can try but you're not getting out that way
You're just as much to blame
And if it didn't mean a thing
And you've told him to go
And if you're as sorry as you say
Why didn't you just say no?
It's strange that this room's so different now
Oh I didn't come to row
It's just this razor, he's left it on your shelf
I'll throw it out myself
And if it didn't mean a thing
And you've told him to go
And if you're as sorry as you say
Why didn't you just say no?Embed
