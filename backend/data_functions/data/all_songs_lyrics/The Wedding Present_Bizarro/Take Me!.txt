Take Me! LyricsSpent all day trying to decide
About the things that you said last night
Did they mean nothing or were they filled with hidden clues?
And can you really have stayed 'til three?
Orange slices and that Fall LP
I feel so lonely when I get back from seeing you
And when someone brings up your name
I can feel myself begin to change
It's like a panic and a rushing sound in my head
A huge weight pressing on my chest
And now I spend hours trying to look my best
But I still meet you the day before I wash my hair
Oh won't you put that down and take me, I'm yours
When will we have this chance again?
Oh please just put that down and take me, I'm yours
We might never have this chance again
That must have been a knowing look
Oh when you moved to pass your friend his book
And oh that feeling when your hand returns to mine
I think I might as well stay out here
Oh but can you kiss me just once properly
Well of course I mean it, I think about you all the time
Oh won't you put that down and take me, I'm yours
When will we have this chance again?
Oh please just put that down and take me, I'm yours
We might never have romance again
Warm hands and things you say
You get lovelier every day
Warm hands and things you say
You get lovelier every day, oh!Embed
