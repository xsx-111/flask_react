Be Honest LyricsThis is all because you didn't like my mam
Well I'm afraid I can't get born again
Oh its not just me who's changed
And can you tell me what it is you think I said
Are you sure that it's not just in your head
And when was this anyway?
And if we're really really going to be honest
We might as well be brief
And by the way I got your little note
Along with a sudden dryness in my throat
When I saw that it came from you
Oh was it really too hard to tell me to my face
That you don't long for my embrace
The way you used to do?
And if we're really really going to be honest
We might as well be briefEmbed
