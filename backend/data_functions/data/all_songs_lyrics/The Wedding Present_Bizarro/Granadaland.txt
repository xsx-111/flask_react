Granadaland LyricsCan't you come up with something better than that?
Oh I think I'd be more angry
If your answers weren't so daft!
Oh you know I could
But do you really think I would?
When you go up to Granadaland on Sundays
Sally told me that you're practically kissing his feet
Oh, but he hasn't got a car
And so your list of names brought you to me
And a friend in need
Is a pest indeed
When she uses everybody in the way that you do
You know you're breaking my heart
I can't bear the thought of us being apart
You know you're breaking my heart
I can't bear the thought of us being apart
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow if you could spare me the time
Oh no, of course I didn't mean it
I still keep hoping you'll be changing your mind
Okay your choice is clear
But, please, anywhere but here
And stop trying to tell me that you know how I feel
You know you're breaking my heart
I can't bear the thought of us being apart
You know you're breaking my heart
I can't bear the thought of us being apartEmbed
