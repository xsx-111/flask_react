Gone LyricsYou could tell me how he saved the world again
Well I'm sorry but I just think he's dead boring
And it can't be time already for your train
It just seems like we've only started talking
I finished sorting out here yesterday
And I've found some things of yours you left behind
I won't start but I still feel the same way
If you want to come back home then I don't mind
You always went too far
Now you've just gone
You always went too far
Now you've just gone
You always went too far
Now you've just gone
You always went too far
Now you've just goneEmbed
