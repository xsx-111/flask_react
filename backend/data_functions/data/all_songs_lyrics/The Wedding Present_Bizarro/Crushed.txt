Crushed LyricsSomewhere, sometime
I've got to say this somehow
Oh no, it's fine
I couldn't face it just now
Oh, please don't use that voice
I think I've made my choice
I'd change it if I could
Oh, you know I'm crushed inside
Goodness knows I've tried
I think I've had enough
Oh no, I swear
There's no one else I promise
The 'phone? Up there
But please don't leave here like this
Oh, please don't use that voice
I think I've made my choice
I'd change it if I could
Oh, you know I'm crushed inside
Goodness knows I've tried
I think I've had enough
You're late, been where?
Worried sick about you
Alright, take care
I'm sorry that I hurt you
Oh, please don't use that voice
I think I've made my choice
I'd change it if I could
Oh, you know I'm crushed inside
Goodness knows I've tried
I think I've had enoughEmbed
