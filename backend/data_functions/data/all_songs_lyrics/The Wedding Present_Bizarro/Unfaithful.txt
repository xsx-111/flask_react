Unfaithful LyricsAnd what's your game?
Arm in arm by the garage wall
Oh so that's his name?
Oh yes I knew I'd seen his face before
You know I haven't worn a shirt like that since, oh, 1974
I might have known
The light was still on when I passed your flat
So you weren't alone?
Oh what do you mean, 'what am I getting at'?
I just don't believe that anyone can work as much as that
And are you being unfaithful to me?
Are you being unfaithful?
Are you being unfaithful to me?
Are you being unfaithful?
I'm so ashamed
I had my ear pressed up to your bedroom door
Oh you never change
If you want anything you just take it all
I suppose you'd like me to go back home and wait for the usual telephone call (ohh)
And are you being unfaithful to me?
Are you being unfaithful?
Are you being unfaithful to me?
Are you being unfaithful?Embed
