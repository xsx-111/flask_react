Alone With the Moon LyricsSearching for sunlight, there in your room
Trolling for one light, there in the gloom
You dream of a better day, alone with the moon
All things are nothing, there in your tomb
All things are nothing, assured is your doom
You dream of a better day, alone with the moon
The laughing and joking, they all end too soon
Forgotten memories, forgotten tunes
You dream of a better day, alone with the moon
That day, it's coming soon
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moon
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moon
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moon
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moonEmbed
