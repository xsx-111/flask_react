What If...? LyricsNulla sar√† cambiato della luce!
Colori come grigio e marrone
Tutti stampati uno sull'altro
Trovai un vuoto
Una macchia Bianca
Gli altri guardarono
"Che bella giornata! Che bel tempo!"
Ma sentii la rotativa
What if in paradise there are no houris waiting?
What if but all you get are grapes, succulent grapes?
What if it's all just a mistake in the translation?
Nothing will be changed about the light!
Colours like grey and brown
All printed on top of each other
I found a blank white spot
All the others looked up:
"What a beautiful day! What beautiful weather!"
But all I heard was the printing machine
What if in paradise there are no houris waiting?
What if no one there reclines on jeweled cushions face to face?
What if but all you get is wine, beautiful wine?
You don't need to wear that belt
You don't need to learn to fly
It's all just a mistake, a mistake in the translationEmbed
