Back from the Dead Lyrics
Straight out the casket, rising up
Open up your eyes, can't you see me?
What the fuck is this? Madness, pick up my bones
Erase my name from off the tombstones
Alive and kicking, breathing the air
Call out my name, punk, and I'll be there
No question, my suggestions of the action
Caught smack dab in the middle of the blasting
Messing with me, you're messing with the best
Blaow, you're taking two shots to your chest

Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast coming back from the dead
(Back from the dead!)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freaking hole in your head!
Back from the dead
Back from the dead

You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected
Back from the dead just to mess with your head
I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it
If you've got a cold starve it, if you've got a fever feed it
And if you can't beat it, then what a blow
You might be positive and not even know
I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceiling
I give sexual healing, I'll get your girl squealing like a pig
My grave's something you can never dig
I'll rock a mausoleum, backyard or colosseum
Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast coming back from the dead
(Back from the dead!)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, nuff said!

Skip the autopsy cause I never OD'd
I only puff boom kid, I never get ski'd
I don't sniff or shoot up, riff I'll stick my boot up
Your ass quick-fast, Everlast don't jive
Just like Pearl Jam, I'm still Alive
(Look at all these rumors)
Spreading like tumors, gossip and lies
Exaggerated reports of my demise
And if you believed 'em, well then you got gassed
The media deceived 'em just like in the past

Cause I'm, back from the dead
Everlast's comin back from the dead
(Back from the dead!)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freaking hole in your head
Back from the dead
Back from the dead
Like Steven Seagal I'm Hard to Kill
Like GG Allin I'm crazy ill
I'll beat you down with my mic, kick your ass with my Nike
Bust you in the eye if you tell another lie
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Thinkin I'm dead you must be smoking dust
Come see me bust in the flesh it's a must

Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast coming back from the dead
(Back from the dead!)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, nuff said
Back from the dead..
