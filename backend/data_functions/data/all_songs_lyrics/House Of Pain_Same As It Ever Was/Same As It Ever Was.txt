Same As It Ever Was Lyrics
Uh shoot 'em all baby
Just call it in one time for me, real heavy!

Back In Black
Who's The Mack?
Sittin' on the back
Of a Cadillac

Well it's the D, motherfucker
Better pass me the mic
So I can rock on
And drop the styles I write
I like hip-hop
Ya don't stop
And all that
I rock the freak styles
And neat styles
That are crazy phat
It's making me sick
Punk get off my dick!

Cause I'm the same motherfucker
That I ever was
(Same motherfucker!)
But I can't pay attention
Cause I'm on that dust
My head's not swell
Kid I'm not sell
Don't feed me soup
Just give me the funky loop
I'll rock it to the best of my ability
Running mad styles and showing flexibility
Cause I'm the man that's On Point
When I jam a funky joint
I'm on some other Over There
Yo, I just don't care shit
Pass the mic
Then I'm gonna tear shit
Up like a piece of paper
Your girl caught the vapor
When I ran the caper
I ain't rearranged, so don't look strange
I'm the same motherfucker
Ain't a damn thing changed

Cause I'm the same motherfucker
That I ever was
(Same motherfucker!)
But I can't pay attention
Cause I'm on that dust
Cause I'm hard like stone
Don't play me soft
And I rock rhymes frequently
I drop it often
I'm off in space
I remember your face
But don't remember your name
Cause it's all the same
As it ever was
That's what it is, money grip
Don't trip or I'm a bust that lip

Cause I'm the same motherfucker
That I ever was
(Same motherfucker!)
But I can't pay attention
Cause I'm on that dust

Bust it, flip it, skip it
Just like a stone on a river
Ya know I'm gonna' give her
Whole lotta' flavor
Criminal behavior
Used to be how I made it
But that shit's over rated
Now I rock rhymes over funky beats
I fuck fine hookers between satin sheets
They say money changes people
But I won't cause
I'm the same motherfucker that I ever was!
Cause I'm the same motherfucker
That I ever was
(Same motherfucker!)
But I can't pay attention
Cause I'm on that dust

And ya don't quit
Cause I'm on that dust
Soul Assassins are on that dust
My man J. Disco is on that dust
Cypress Hill is on that dust
Funkdoobiest is on that dust2Embed
