A Good Man is Easy to Kill Lyrics
I would be overstating
If I said I knew you well
Or that I knew you at all
When you flew through that windshield
And your life passed reel to reel
Was there a bit part for me?

I made a wish for you
Blew out the sun so it would come true
But the sun froze along with your heart

So give up, give up your love
Give up, give up your love
I promise it's not gonna kill ya
And I need ya, Lord, I need ya

And when they cut out your lung
You said we could all breathe easy
The hole swallowed your heart
When they drilled holes in your skull
And screwed that halo to your head
Did you think you could fly?
I made a prayer for you
Then prayed some more that it'd come true
Don't know about God, but I believe in you

So give up, give up your love
Give up, give up your love
I promise it's not gonna kill ya
And I need ya, Lord, I need ya
And though you haven't got a lot to give up
A good man is easy to kill, well
Stop talking about the weather and say you're getting betterEmbed
