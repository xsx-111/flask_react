Burned by the Sun Lyrics
High above the border town
I can see the golden ground (ah, ah, ah, ah)
If I wasn't looking down
I might have lost you in the miles
Ocean blue and foaming white
Surround the body of my flight (ah, ah, ah, ah)
As I flew out of sight
You were turning in the stiles

And I know what it means to you
And I know what it means to me
And I know how it feels to be
Burned by the sun, the sun
I love the sun

Now I'm sleeping on the sand
Of an unfamiliar land (ah, ah, ah, ah)
And I'm dreaming up a plan
To get you on the breeze
And I'm staring at the speck
Of the map laid on the deck (ah, ah, ah, ah)
It's time to make a trek
On forgiving seas
And I know what it means to you
And I know what it means to me
And I know how it feels to be
Burned by the sun, the sun
I love the sun

And I know what it means to you (I know what it means to you)
And I know what it means to me
And I know we all wanna be
Burned by the sun1Embed
