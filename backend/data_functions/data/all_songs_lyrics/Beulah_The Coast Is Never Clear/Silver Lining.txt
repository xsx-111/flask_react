Silver Lining Lyrics
Punk rock was my first girl
She left me a scar, so I have her still
She's not young, but she's not old yet
We share the same sun, but hers never sets

You want it
A silver lining shining for you
You got it
A dark cloud always waiting for you

Weightless, and tumbling through space
I remember her voice, but not her face
Floating, but she's always near
She wants to stay, but she can't stay here

You want it
A silver lining shining for you
You got it
A dark cloud always waiting for you

Frozen in window displays
Where did you hide all those days we'd waste?
Fading, but I see her still
She'll always be my punk rock girlEmbed
