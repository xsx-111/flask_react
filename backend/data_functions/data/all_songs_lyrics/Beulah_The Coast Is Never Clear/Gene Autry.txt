Gene Autry Lyrics
A man named Gene's got a beautiful voice
He carries me home on his beautiful horse
And where she waits, I will ride, ride, ride
Come on stranger, just sing me a song
And if it's sad, I'll sing along, long, long
I told you I knew every word

When I get to California, gonna write my name in the sand
I'm gonna lay this body down, and watch the waves roll in
And when the city spreads out just like a cut vein

Everybody drowns sad and lonely
Well, everybody drowns sad and lonely
Well, everybody drowns sad and lonely, alright

Sweet, sweet dreams in color and sound
Highways in the faraway to be found
I saw gold mines in the sky, sky, sky
They were clouds just waiting to cry
And with the wind, I'm dancing drift, drift, drift
In the shapes of the place that I miss
When I get to California, gonna write my name in the sand
I'm gonna lay this body down, and watch the waves roll in
I'm gonna rest this weary head on someone who I think will care
But when the stars in the sky start falling, I think you'll understand
That the city spreads out just like a cut vein

Everybody drowns, sad and lonely
Well everybody drowns, sad and lonely
Well everybody drowns, sad and lonely, alright

Yeah, I'm waiting for something to give
Well, I'm waiting, I hope it's not me
Yeah, I'm waiting for something to give
Yeah, I'm waitingEmbed
