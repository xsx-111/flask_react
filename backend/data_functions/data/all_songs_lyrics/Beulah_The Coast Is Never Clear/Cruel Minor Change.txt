Cruel Minor Change Lyrics
My cheeks are red and only swollen from the kisses
There's strangers dancing next to me
They're waiting on the sunrise or the armageddon
It doesn't matter, whichever comes first

Did you see those fireworks
Explode and fall, and fade like tears?
It's where I waited, it's where I waited

And please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
But please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
But we knew you are

My ticket's folded and I hold it like a time bomb
It keeps on ticking, I'm counting down
The last stop on this line was Cooler Guy Station
It's as far as I'll get tonight

Did you see those fireworks
Explode and fall, and fade like tears?
It's where I waited, it's where I waited
And please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
But please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
But we knew you are

A cruel minor change
Well, nothing's happened, it's still the same
We're not space age, we won't be saved
We're just holding on again, waiting for the end, always hoping and

And please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
But please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
But we knew you areEmbed
