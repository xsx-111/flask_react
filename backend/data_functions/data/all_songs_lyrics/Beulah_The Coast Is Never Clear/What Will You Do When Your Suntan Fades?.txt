What Will You Do When Your Suntan Fades? Lyrics
This is gonna hurt, kid
You better hold on tight, you know
All those drugs you take
Cannot help you save your soul
Smile a Sunday smile, kid
You're fragile as a scene, you know
All those things you have
Will not make you come undone

Tell me, tell me you'll be alright when you're in the shade
Tell me, tell me you'll be alright when you start to fade

Who's your only friend, kid?
There's no one else, you know
All those girls you love
Doesn't mean you feel a thing

Tell me, tell me you'll be alright when you're in the shade
Tell me, tell me you'll be alright when you start to fade

Softly sway, or have you lost your way?
Well, I could give you a map
But you know you'd have to stay
You could quit the fight or you can say goodnight
Well, if you think it's a joke
Then why do you always cry?

Tell me, tell me you'll be alright when you're in the shade
Tell me, tell me you'll be alright when you start to fade

Have you heard?
The days are getting shorter
What will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone?
Do you feel afraid?
The days are getting shorter
What will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone?
Do you feel afraid?
The days are getting shorter
What will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone?
Do you feel afraid?
The days are getting shorter
What will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone?
Will you fade away?
Will you fade away?
Will you fade away?
Will you fade away?
Will you fade away?Embed
