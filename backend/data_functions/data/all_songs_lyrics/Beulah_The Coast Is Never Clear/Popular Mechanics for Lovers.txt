Popular Mechanics for Lovers Lyrics
I know he knocks you off your feet
You're so bitter, you think he's sweet
Well, he's wrong for you, I swear
Did you forget to read the script?
There was never a role for him
It was always you and me, just me

Popular Mechanics for Broken Hearts could help me now

I know you never felt romance
And we always lacked suspense
I can edit those parts out
I never made you feel complete
I'm a fault line beneath your feet
I would never bring you down, so down

Popular Mechanics for Broken Hearts could help me now

Just because he loves you too
He wouldn't ever take a bullet for you
Don't believe a word he says
He wouldn't ever cut his heart out for you
I heard he wrote you a song, but so what?
Some guy wrote sixty-nine
And one just ain't enough
And there's no sense in him trying
I know, 'cause I've been
Trying all the time to find
The song that would make you mine
But all I ever find, my love
Are clich√©s that don't rhyme

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Popular Mechanics for Broken Hearts could help me now

Just because he loves you too
He wouldn't ever take a bullet for you
Don't believe a word he says
He wouldn't ever cut his heart out for youEmbed
