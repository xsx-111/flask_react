Hey Brother Lyrics
Hey brother, get yourself together, don't you wait
Can't you see I'm waiting in the shadows to take your place
There is a chance that I'll keep trying
To tell you the truth, but end up lying to you

You said you were late and I planned my escape
Such a happy thing, just another one of my mistakes
So you held your breathe, and you cursed the west
Said you had no choice, you're moving back east where men are men

Your mother never found a reason to hesitate
Now you're waiting for a warmer welcome in colder states

You said you were late and I planned my escape
Such a happy thing, just another one of my mistakes
So you held your breathe, and you cursed the west
Said you had no choice, you're moving back east where men are men

Love's got no border, why don't you feel free
To cross my state line and bring yourself to me?
It's a hell of a struggle, been grounded for years
The words that I use are too old for your ears
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

You said you were late and I planned my escape
Such a happy thing, just another one of my mistakes
So you held your breathe, and you cursed the west
Said you had no choice, you're moving back east where men are menEmbed
