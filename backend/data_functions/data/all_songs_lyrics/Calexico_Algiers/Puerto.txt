Puerto LyricsLupita’s gonna weave a path to the land up north
Gonna find her way through the thick of it all
Looking at the lights dancing in the sky
Hoping for a fallen star
“Me consuelo viendo estrellas
Bailando en el puerto”
Brought them gold from the country to help cure their illness
But they landed with only one purpose, for conquest
Though there’s still this wave of unsettling hunger
That never disappears
Rigo working one, two, three different jobs
And when he comes back home he welds into the night
Builds an air balloon for his pickup truck
Gonna fly up and over the wall
If everything stays
Exactly the same
Then nothing can move
And nothing can change
“Me siento ese pájaro
Que danza sobre el puerto”
Carried ships from the sea up over the mountains
And the warriors fell to their knees by the invisible virus
And still you can feel this wave of unsettling anger
That never disappears
She’s talking on the phone in the heart of town
To her Bachata Mama in the heart of the world
Saying “please come back to Santo Domingo
Why you gotta be so far away?”
If everyone stays
Exactly the same
Then no one can move
And no one can change
“Amo ver la luna
Vacilando en el puerto”
No one foretelling the depth and type of destruction
Nor the sadness trapped on the tongue of Malinche
Quetzalcoatl feathers strewn out over the altar
Blood running down the pyramid steps in the morning
Codices lost to a language that’s been broken
There’s this growing sense of impending anger
That never disappears
“Ninguna entrada
Queda en el puerto”Embed
