Maybe on Monday LyricsWoke up on Monday and wrote you a love song
Wrote you a love song
Well the pen stopped and the paper flew out the window
And the notes rang down the road
I don’t know where they’ll go
Get caught in the trees, I suppose
Ripped apart by the birds
And the winter winds
Whisper goodbye to your love
To your love
Went out walking into the storm
Into the storm
Followed what I thought was your voice
But it was just the riverside
I don’t know where they’ll go
But I cast the letters you wrote
Taken out by the current
Or sink to the bottom
To say a little goodbye to your love
Say a little goodbye to your love
Well the sky's dark and the wind blew the trees down
I watched as the world slipped away
Carved into the bark a final love song
Then I carried the words to the fire
Staring into the glow
Where the branches are burning low
Sparks shooting out like stars
And in the morning
Say a little goodbye to your love
Say a little goodbye to your love
Say a little goodbye to your love
Say a little goodbye to your love
I’ll carry this song with me everyday
‘Til I lie down by your sideEmbed
