Epic LyricsNights we hide between the walls
And voices leading on the ground
Arms reaching out
Hoping for the chance to start
Hearts holding out
Waiting for the bells to bring
My words to all of you
And if they ever hear my voice
Hold me in your thoughts
Laid out, twisted in defense
Hoping for the chance to start
Hearts holding out
Waiting for the bells to send
My love to all my friends
And if I never make it back
To hold you in my arms again
Not letting go this time1Embed
