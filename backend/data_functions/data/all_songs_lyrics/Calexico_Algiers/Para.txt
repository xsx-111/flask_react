Para LyricsI hold your wrist, you bite your lip
The push becomes an embrace
I touch your face, you close your eyes
The embrace becomes a shove
I walk away, you follow too close
The shove takes hold and there’s nowhere to go
Take it down
Take it all the way
Take it down
Take it all the way down below the waterline
I see you now through a glass wall
All that is you stays with you
All that is me stays with me
But we see it all, we feel it all
And there is no place we can’t go
Take it down
Take it all the way
Take it down
Take it all the way down below the waterlineEmbed
