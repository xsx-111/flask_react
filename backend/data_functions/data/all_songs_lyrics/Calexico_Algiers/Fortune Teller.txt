Fortune Teller LyricsI was just standing turning around
That’s when they caught me heading down
Keep on going don’t look away
That’s what they tell me, that’s what they say
You’re a pretty thought I suppose
I’m just trying to hold up as I go
And one day I swear I’ll spread my wings
I’m on my way to finer things
It wasn’t just me playing those games
Still it’s my own fault just the same
I opened up, I let you in
Now these crystal fields are wearing thin
I’m walking with a fortune teller
I can see my own way home
But I don’t like this dark road anymore
And I don’t wanna be alone for long
Don’t wanna be alone for long
I don’t wanna be on this dark road aloneEmbed
