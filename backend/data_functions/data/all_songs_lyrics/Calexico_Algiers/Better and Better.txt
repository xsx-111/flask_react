Better and Better LyricsThere’s a letter she keeps inside
A list of everyone she knows
Behind her closed eyes
That turn her in when it’s time to go
She’s heading north into the haze
Raise the wire and they raise the rent
She’s walking the sun back home
And in the night the moon is gone
Is it better?
Is it better and better?
Is it better than staying home
With nowhere to go?
I’ve seen your face out on the plains
Drifting all alone
Draw my finger in the dirt
And down another blue road
She’s in Kansas and Alabam’
Idaho and the Carolinas
Know I’ve seen her before
Can’t you recognize those hands?
Is it better?
Is it better and better?
Is it better
Than staying back home?
Is it better?
Is it better and better?
Is it better
With nowhere else to go?Embed
