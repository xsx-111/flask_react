The Vanishing Mind LyricsOn the longest day
The vanishing mind
Knows not when the day ends
Who could care for you
Would could understand
In the room sealed shut
You’re not what you were
So much sweeter now
That there’s nothing left to
Remember you
It’s what brought you here
It’s what keeps you here
Who could care for you
Who could understand
Know not when the day ends or begins anymore
In the hallway and waiting again
Here we are, here we sit
The light turning grey
Your smile brings me back
To the longest day
The vanishing mindEmbed
