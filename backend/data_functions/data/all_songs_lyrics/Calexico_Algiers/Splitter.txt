Splitter LyricsThrough the gardens and fields
'Neath the tall green grass
You were walking ‘neath the moon
While covering your tracks
Working your fingers
Down to the skin and stone
One hand on the hammer
One foot by the door
Pushed by the wind
Fed by the need
For moving on
Moving on to nowhere
When division runs deep
And down into the well
All the coins you dove after
Lost all their spell
Covered in moss
Walking for silver and blood
Out in the café
Working in the grove
Guarding the port
Of the future you sold
Holding on, holding on to no one
Holding on, holding on to no one
One eye in the mirror
The other on the screen
Sewn in the pockets
And down into the dream
Caught up in the mortar
Bricks and heavy load
Wait in the shadows
Down the living road
Moving on, moving on to no one
Holding on, holding on to no oneEmbed
