Hush LyricsIn the afternoon of orange blossom days
Hummingbirds rest above where we lay
You say it’s ok, no need to fret
The weight of it all will ease as we find
The balance in each step we make
Swinging back and forth in a palo verde tree
The wind in the needles hushes you asleep
Even with the strain, your heart remains
Don’t doubt why darlin’
In time you will find we’re alright we were born
Like the branch to bend and not to break
Reconcile and resurrect, tombstone rose
Growing up and over the gates to where our children play
The future wraps ‘round like vines
Inside these arms
Darlin’ will you say in our final embrace
Before returning ‘neath the clay
After all that your heart still remainsEmbed
