Charmless Callous Ways Lyrics
I have been in league with cruelty
And charmless callous ways
I've been betrayed into believing
That those who never win should never play

Nothing succeeds quite like success
And to be doomed to second best
I mistook for failure, nothing more and nothing less
But if hate is peace and love is war
There's nothing there I feel's worth fighting for

And anyway that's not my way
Anyway that's not my way
Anyway that's not my way

Disdain to be a grown-up fool
Who plays by adolescent rules
Where to be king is to be cruel
And constancy's an unprized jewel
Now I've abandoned all those crimes
And we'll endure without church bell chimes
I've abandoned all those crimes
And we'll endure without church bell chimesEmbed
