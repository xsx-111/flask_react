Sean Lyrics
There's a Belfast girl I loved and lost
On the rolling hills around my home
Now she stays home nights behind locked doors
Since a plastic bullet stopped him
And he don't come no more

There's a Belfast boy was loved and lost
On the crowded streets of his own hometown
Pepper my heart with a lover's words (Yeah)
And I'll pepper yours with a Gatling gun

Mother my heart is full of lead
And it weighs me down and I just can't cry
Remember me to schoolboy friends
And tell it as it was, please try

So come by my boy and sit you down
There's a tale to hear, a tale to tell this town
Oh, you say the devil will get me some day (Yeah)
You can tell him I'm waiting 'cause these are the things I must say

Mother my heart is full of lead
And life holds few surprises too
Tell that to the little ones
Before they learn to laugh at you
Mother my heart is full of lead
And it weighs me down and I just can't cry
Remember me to schoolboy friends
And tell it as it was, please tryEmbed
