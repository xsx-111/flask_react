This Love (Not for Sale) Lyrics
Do you want to get on in this cowering country now?
Do you want to get on, get on, get on
Or would you be happy just to get by?
The small thoughts of a small town girl
Grew up and wanted to change the world
Will heaven echo back my plea
Or cast it as a curse on me?

Do you want to get on in this beautiful country girl?
Listen hard to what the big folks say
And you'll believe anything
If you believe what they say of this world
From the orchard to foundry
From farms to the city night
Everyone cracks if the price is right
Ideals soon begin to fail
God must know by now
This love is not for sale, hey
This love is not for saleEmbed
