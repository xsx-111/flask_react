Ballad of the Times LyricsNarrow streets breed narrow minds and
Care for king but not for kind
It's a short hop to a long weekend
When every move you apprehend
You'll never find room to find your feet
To walk out of these avenue
Your pockets are lined with promises
When did you promise ever pay for shoes?
Count coal trucks by the line and
Raise your glasses one more time
'Cause Billy has gone off to war
And God knows what he's fighting for
But wartime will make him a man
Work that one out if you can
A hero's grave is six feet deep not
Room enough for all his plans
She can scrub the step but if will never gleam
If he did she'd smash the dream
And they've held the world too long
But dreams are what you wake up from
Father was a fighter too
The only way to jump the queue
Boxing clever, times were tough
But will that ever be enough?
You'd never find room to find his feet
To walk out of these avenues
Their pockets are lined with promises
When did they promise ever pay for shoes?
When did they promise ever pay for shoes?Embed
