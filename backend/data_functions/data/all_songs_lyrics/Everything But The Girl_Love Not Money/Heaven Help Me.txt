Heaven Help Me Lyrics
What I get from you I sometimes steal
When I let belief invade what I should feel
Still I do believe that men are fools
And you don't always escape that rule
But this time there will be no fight
For this time you are in the right
And even I can see
So heaven help me

I only want the world to call my own
And a bright shiny hearth to call my home
But when you give me love I don't deserve
I wonder how I have the nerve
To number you amongst the ones
That I call every name under the sun
Unjust I must be
So heaven help me

And all the things I yearn to possess
When they fall into my hands
I could not want them less

And are you supposed to smile and say
It didn't matter anyway?
And if you are a fool you'd be
To shrug off thoughtless cruelty
If goodness is wrong
In heaven you will never belong
And I'll never fall on my knees
And say heaven help me please
Heaven help me please
Heaven help me please
Heaven help meEmbed
