Trouble and Strife Lyrics
Who would be born into a mans's man's man's world?
But what do children care
For grownups' despair
A house can hold both boy and girl

Every mother's son grows up
And daughters imitate
And the burden of a careworn world
Is his to bearâ€”hers to wait

As the open world of a tomboy girl
Closes on a growing wife
From a childhood clear
Through teenage years
That always seem to be more
Trouble than strife

From the hot dark of night
To the cold light of day
From the cradle to wife to grave
Unless I stand in the way
As the open world of a tomboy girl
Closes in with growing strife
For my own sake I'll comfort take
To know I'd never make a wife
As the open world of a tomboy girl
Closes in with growing strife
For my own sake I'll comfort take
In the knowledge that I'd never make a wife


You hear them talk of women's way
With hatred, and it cuts me like a knife
Poor men, so much to bear
The children and the trouble and strife
The open world of a tomboy girl
Is the best of life
From a childhood clear
You end up here
In trouble and strife
In trouble and strife
Trouble and strife
Trouble and strife, heyEmbed
