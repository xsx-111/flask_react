Kid Lyrics
Kid, what changed your mood?
You've gone all sad
So I feel sad, too
I think I know
Some things you never outgrow
You think it's wrong
I can tell you do
How can I explain
When you don't want me to?

Kid, my only kid
You look so small
You've gone so quiet
I know you know what I'm about
I won't deny it
But you forgive
Though you don't understand
You've turned your head
You've dropped my hand

All my sorrows
All my blues
All my sorrows
Shut the light
Go away
Full of grace
You cover your face
Kid, gracious kid
Your eyes are blue
But you won't cry, I know
Angry tears are too dear
You won't let them flow
Oh
Oh
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
