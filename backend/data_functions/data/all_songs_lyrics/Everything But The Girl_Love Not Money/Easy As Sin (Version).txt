Easy As Sin (Version) Lyrics
Darkness will trip, darkness will fall
Get no sleep on Salisbury Street
Mud on my shoes, sweat on my palms
Get no sleep on Salisbury Street

There is another time it could have been different
I know if it were you'd be there
Over the Pennines and out of the station
And finally up to a room

A voice in my head and the cut won't heal
On Ambridge Walk in Salisbury Street
And what about her, well she nettles my thoughts
Hatred creeps down Salisbury Street (Yeah)

To gloat is as ugly as soaking yourself
In a wave of remorse
I shout on the shingle, soaked to thе skin
By a river that's taken its course

To do good is so tеmpting it hurts
A tale complete from Salisbury Street
To do bad is as easy as sin
A tale complete from Salisbury Street
To do good is so tempting it hurts
A tale complete from Salisbury Street
To do bad is as easy as sin
A tale complete from Salisbury Street (Yeah)
To do good is so tempting it hurts
To do bad is as easy as sin
To do good is so tempting it hurts (Oh)
To do bad is as easy as, as sinEmbed
