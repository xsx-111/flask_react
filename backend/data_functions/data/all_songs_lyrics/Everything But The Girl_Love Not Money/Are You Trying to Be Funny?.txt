Are You Trying to Be Funny? Lyrics
Let him spend all his money on you
Ease the guilt of the things he won't do
For he believes there's no such thing as greed
A yearly payment is all that you need

In poverty may your goodness prevail
While your vaulting ambitions fail
A rich man sticks in heaven's door
But you my love will live happy for evermore

So naturally he sends you no more than this
Lest he ruin your chance of eternal bliss
What d'you mean you need love not money?
You expect to live in a land of milk and honey

Let him send his money to you
Ease the guilt of the things he won't do
A rich man sticks in heaven's door
But you my love will live happy for evermore

So naturally he sends you no more than this
Lest he ruin your chance of eternal bliss
What d'you mean you need love not money?
You expect to live in a land of milk and honey
He can spare just a little to see you right
Even he has a conscience that cries at night
"May the bad things in life come in two's and not three's"
Such a prayer works wonders for keeping the heart at ease

So naturally he sends you no more than this
Lest he ruin your chance of eternal bliss
What d'you mean you need love not money?
You expect to live in a land of milk and honey
Naturally he sends you no more than this
Lest he ruin your chance of eternal bliss
What d'you mean you need love not money?
You expect to live in a land of milk and honey
