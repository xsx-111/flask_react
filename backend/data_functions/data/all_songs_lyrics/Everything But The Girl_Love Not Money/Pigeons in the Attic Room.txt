Pigeons in the Attic Room Lyrics
Well I hate to have to tell you this
But there are pigeons in the attic room
Where you left me spent and gasping that afternoon
And where the floorboards left their splinters
And you left me so soon

Pardon me, I'm drunk again
And when I'm drunk I make no sense
But I crack more jokes and that's my self-defence
You caused me to think
And I thought about what I had home without you
You drove me to drink
And I never had the courtesy to thank youEmbed
