The Power of Prayer Lyrics
In the afternoon 'neath the summer sun
We'd lie by the lake till the evening comes
I run my fingers through your sun-streaked hair
Baby, that's the power of prayer

Summer nights, summer's in the air
I stack the tables with the chairs
It's closing time, then you're standing there
Baby, that's the power of prayer

It's a fixed game without any rules
An empty table on a ship of fools
I'm holding hearts, I'll play the pair
Darling, it's just the power of prayer


It's a fixed game without any rules
An empty table on a ship of fools
I'm holding hearts, I'll play the pair
I'm goin' all in 'cause I don't care
They say that love, love comes and goes
But darling, what what do they know?
I'm reaching for heaven, we'll make it there
Darling, it's just the power of prayer
Baby, it's just the power of prayer
Darling, it's just the power of prayer
Last call, the bouncer shuts the door
"This Magic Moment" drifts across the floor
As Ben E. King's voice fills the air
Baby, that's the power of prayerEmbed
