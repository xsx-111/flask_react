House of a Thousand Guitars LyricsThe blood moon shines across the vale
Bells ring out through churches and jails
I tally my wounds and count the scars
Here in the house of a thousand guitars
The criminal clown has stolen the throne
He steals what he can never own
May the truth ring out from every small-town bar
We'll light up the house of a thousand guitars
Well it's alright, yeah it's alright
Meet me, darlin', come Saturday night
All good souls from near and far
Will meet in the house of a thousand guitars
Here the bitter and the bored
Wake in search of the lost chord
That'll band us together for as long as there's stars
Here in the house of a thousand guitars
Well it's alright, yeah it's alright
Meet me, darlin', come Saturday night
Brother and sister, wherever you are
We'll meet in the house of a thousand guitars
So wake and shake off your troubles, my friend
We'll go where the music never ends
From the stadiums to the small-town bars
We'll light up the house of a thousand guitars
House of a thousand guitars, house of a thousand guitars
Brother and sister, wherever you are
We'll rise together till we find the spark
That'll light up the house of a thousand guitars
Well it's alright, yeah it's alright
Meet me, darlin', come Saturday night
All the souls from near and far
We'll meet at the house of a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitarsEmbed
