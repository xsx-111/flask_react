Last Man Standing Lyrics
Faded pictures in an old scrapbook
Faded pictures that somebody took
When you were hard and young and proud
Backed against the wall, running raw and loud

Snakeskin vest and a sharkskin suit
Cuban heels on your boots
You kick in the band and side-by-side
You take the crowd on their mystery ride

Knights of Columbus and the Fireman's Ball
Friday night at the Union Hall
Black-leather clubs all along Route 9
You count the names of the missing as you count off time

Rock of ages lift me somehow
Somewhere high and hard and loud
Somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd
I'm the last man standing now
I'm the last man standing now

Out of school and out of work
Thrift-store jeans and flannel shirts
The lights go down and you face the crowd
The last man standing now

Lights come up at the Legion Hall
Pool cues go back up on the wall
Pack your guitar and have one last beer
With just the ringing in your ears

Rock of ages lift me somehow
Somewhere high and hard and loud
Somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd
I'm the last man standing now
I'm the last man standing now
I'm the last man standing nowEmbed
