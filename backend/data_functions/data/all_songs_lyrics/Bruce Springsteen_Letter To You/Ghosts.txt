Ghosts Lyrics
I hear the sound of your guitar
Comin' in from the mystic far
Stone and the gravel in your voice
Come in my dreams and I rejoice

It's your ghost
Moving through the night
Spirit filled with light
I need, need you by my side
Your love and I'm

Alive, I can feel the blood shiver in my bones
I'm alive and I'm out here on my own
I'm alive and I'm coming home

Old buckskin jacket you always wore
Hangs on the back of my bedroom door
Boots and the spurs you used to ride
Click down the hall but never arrive

It's just your ghost
Moving through the night
Spirit filled with light
I need, need you by my side
Your love and I'm
Alive, I can feel the blood shiver in my bones
I'm alive and I'm out here on my own
I'm alive and I'm coming home

Old Fender Twin from Johnny's Music downtown
Still set on 10 to burn this house down
Count the band in then kick into overdrive
By the end of the set we leave no one alive

Ghosts runnin' through the night
Our spirits filled with light
I need, need you by my side
Your love and I'm alive

I shoulder your Les Paul and finger the fretboard
I make my vows to those who've come before
I turn up the volume, let the spirits be my guide
Meet you brother and sister on the other side

I'm alive, I can feel the blood shiver in my bones
I'm alive and I'm out here on my own
I'm alive and I'm coming home
Yeah I'm coming home
One, two, one two three fourEmbed
