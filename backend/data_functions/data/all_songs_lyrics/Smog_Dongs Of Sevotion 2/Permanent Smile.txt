Permanent Smile LyricsOh God, can you feel the sun in your back?
Oh God, can you see your shadow, inky black on the sand?
Oh God, can you hear the salt-water drying on your skin?
Oh God, can you feel my heart beating in my tongue?
Oh God, by being quiet, I hope to alleviate your debt
Oh God, by sitting still, I hope to lighten your load
When your shadow covers me from head to toe
Curtonevrae flies, tell me it's mine, my time to go
Seven waves of insects make babies in, in my skin
Seven waves of insects make families in my skin
(It's just like animals) It's just like animals that play
And the flesh...flesh...flesh...rotted off my skull
And then I will have earned my permanent, my permanent smile
Oh God, I never, never asked why
Oh God, I never, never asked whyEmbed
