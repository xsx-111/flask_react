Strayed LyricsWell, it's strange the way
You walk behind
But seem to lead the way
Oh, I know I
Oh, I know I have strayed
I have taken you for a ride
Left you waiting in the car
While I played death games inside
Oh, I know I
Oh, I know I have strayed
I have loved in haste
I've been an alley cat and a bumblebee
To your panther and your wasp
Oh I have loved
While thinking only of the cost
Oh, I know I
Oh, I know I have strayed
I've raised a sick child to your lips
And in asking you to kiss
What I would not kiss
Oh, I know I
Oh, I know I have strayed
Well I never thought I'd be
One of those men
With pin-ups on their wall
For all to see
I thought that was just mechanics
Oh, I know I
Oh, I know I have strayed
I have taken you for a ride
Left you waiting in the car
While I played death games insideEmbed
