Nineteen LyricsSo she washed her cut in the sink
And picked up an ulcer along the way
Down to the bay, where I did stay
I was nineteen
And so were we to be beating twenty
Without her clothes
She looked like a leper in the snow
I left her in the snow without her clothes
My movements were slow
Long, she didn't even know
What she was taking away
We didn't talk much
Oh, it must have shown
She must have known
The next day, she never called me again
The day after that, she gave me a call
She was all drunk
Her words came slow
Oh, I didn't even know what I had
I'm taking awayEmbed
