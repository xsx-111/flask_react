Bloodflow LyricsHold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on, hold on with a grip so tight
It dams my blood, makes my head feel light
Well, hearts will start and hearts will stop
And the blood will flow until we drop
Bloodflow!
Bloodflow
Bloodflow!
Bloodflow
No time for a tête-à-tête
Can I borrow your machete?
In this wonderful world
In this beautiful world
Hold on
Blood will spill and blood will spurt
Enemies keep the mind alert
Bloodflow!
Bloodflow
Bloodflow!
Bloodflow
No time for a tête-à-tête
Can I borrow your machete?
In this wonderful world
Hold on
In this beautiful world
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on, hold on with a grip so tight
It dams my blood makes my head feel light
Bloodflow!
Bloodflow

B-L-double O-D-F-L-O-W bloodflow bloodflow!

Hold on, hold on with a grip so tight
It dams my blood makes my head feel light, hey, hey!
Hold on, hold on with a grip so tight
It dams my blood makes my head feel light, hey, hey!
No time for a tête-à-tête, can I borrow your machete? hey, hey!
No time for a tête-à-tête, can I borrow your machete? hey, hey!
No time for a tête-à-tête, can I borrow your machete? hey, hey!
No time for a tête-à-tête, can I borrow your machete? hey, hey!
