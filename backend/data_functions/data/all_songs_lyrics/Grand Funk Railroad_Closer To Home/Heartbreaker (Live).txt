Heartbreaker (Live) LyricsOnce I had a little girl
Sometimes I think about her
But buddy, you know
She's not really there
When memories do call
I just, I just can't live without her
But tryin' all the time
Is so hard to bear
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
I don't cry no more
I live while I'm flying
But I'll think back
And you can hear me say
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me downEmbed
