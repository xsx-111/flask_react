Get It Together LyricsGot to get it together
Got to get it together
Got to get it together
Got to get it together
Got to get it together
Get together now, baby
Got to get it together
Get it, get it, get it together
Got to get it together
I'll tell you right now, get it together
Got to get it together
Everybody has to get it
Got to get it together
And so on ...Embed
