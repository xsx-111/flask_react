Sahara Lyrics
Lying on my side, knowing of thirst is how I'll die
Chalk on my tongue
Lying on the night, beneath the dunes is where I lie to block the sun
Trying to ignite some sort of passion from inside to overcome
This feeling of desertion can't be worse than never having anyone

So I'll ask one thing
Just one thing of you
Don't ever turn me loose
Even when I turn my back

A lion on his side
Was it the lying or his pride which brought him down?
Once the king of beasts, but now they feast on the thoughts beneath his vacant crown
Trying to decide was it the lying or the pride which brought it down?
To be alone to be dethroned, believe me, I know all about it now

So I'll ask one thing
Just one thing of you
Don't ever turn me loose
Even when I turn my back
I never told you then that I'd be easy to love
Supposedly I'm a man, but I felt like a cub
I wandered into the plains further and farther away
Not ever knowing that I'd never come back the same
As my organs gave way I swear I felt something burst
It's been thirteen days and I'm dying of thirst
For the birds of prey I pray that someone else will get here first
I'm not alone, I'll be alright
Just take these bones and bring them back to life

So I'll ask one thing
Just one thing of you
Don't ever turn me loose
So I'll ask one thing
Just one thing of you
Don't ever turn me loose (So I'll ask)
Don't ever turn me loose (One thing)
Don't ever turn me loose (Just one thing)
Even when I turn my back3Embed
