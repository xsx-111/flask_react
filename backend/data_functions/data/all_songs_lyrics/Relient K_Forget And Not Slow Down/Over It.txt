Over It Lyrics
I'll admit to who I am
The day I come to understand
I haven't got a clue
Been searching for a few years now

If I don't repeat myself
Then I'll change into someone else
Well, I don't quite know who
Been searching for a few years now

Now I'm over it
Yeah, behind me now, I'm just over it
Over it, yeah, I'm finding out I'm just over it
No, I don't know what's over just yet
But I won't go slow
And time can let the mind forget
Don't tell me you don't know
Already

I'll protect your universe
Or make a mess to make it worse
But time will only tell
You and no one else so
I'm over it
Yeah, behind me now, I'm just over it
Over it, yeah, I'm finding out I'm just over it
No, I don't know what's over just yet
But I won't go slow
And time can let the mind forget
Don't tell me you don't know
Already
Don't tell me you let go, oh

You say you made up your mind and you finally decided
But those that helped you choose
Haven't the slightest clue as to
The magnitude of what you're about to lose

I'm guarded and therefore I can endure
A little bit more, just a little bit more
Than some people would
If not misunderstood
It's still an attempt to be egoless while self-assured
If I'm still unsure that I'm pretty sure
That I am pretty good
God, You know I'm good
And I'm over it
Yeah, behind me now, I'm just over it
Over it, yeah, I'm finding out I'm just over it
No, I don't know what's over just yet
But I won't go slow
And time can let the mind forget

Don't tell me you don't know
Already
Don't tell me you let go
Already
Don't tell me you don't know
Already
Don't tell me you don't know
Don't tell me you don't know
Don't tell me you don't knowEmbed
