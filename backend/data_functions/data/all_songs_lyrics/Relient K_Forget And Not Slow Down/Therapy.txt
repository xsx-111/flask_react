Therapy Lyrics
I never thought I'd be
Driving through the country just to drive
With only music and the clothes that I woke up in
I never thought I'd need all this time alone, it goes to show
I had so much yet I had need for nothing but you
But you

This is just therapy
Let's call it what it is
With a death-grip on this life always transitioning
This is just therapy
'Cause you won't take my calls
And that makes God the only one who's left here listening
To me

Letting it all sink in
It's good to feel a sting now and again
I hope it's one less woeful thing there is to fight through
Forgetting it all began
Fresh paper and a nice expensive pen
The past cannot subtract a thing from what I might do for you
Unless that's what I let it do
This is just therapy
Let's call it what it is (Not what we were)
With a death-grip on this life always transitioning
This is just therapy
'Cause you won't take my calls
And that makes God the only one who's left here listening

Loneliness and solitude are two things not to get confused
'Cause I spend my solitude with you
I gather all the questions of the things I just can't get straight
And I answer them the way I guess you'd do

'Cause this is my therapy
'Cause You’re the only one that’s listening to me

This is my therapy
Let's call it what it is, not what we were
With a death-grip on this life that’s in transition
This is my therapy
'Cause you won't hear me out
And that makes God the only one who's left to listen
This is my therapy
Let’s call it what it is (Not what we were)
With a death-grip on this life always transitioning
This is my therapy
'Cause you won’t take my calls
And that makes God the only one who's left here listening
To meEmbed
