If You Believe Me Lyrics
I got a chill and I wanted to say it was you
Be still because what I'm about to say is the truth
Unless we stretch until the point in nearly breaking in two
We'll never find our weakness coming unglued
A cracked sculpture, I wanted to say it was you
Being vultures is why I feel the way I do
I fell in love and I wanted to say it was you
I wanted to say it was you

If you believe me
We could stand the test of time like no one else
If you believe me
It means you have to disbelieve yourself

A sudden wind and I wanted to say it was you
I've never been so confused about who knows the truth
It began when I wanted to say it was you
'Cause I swore you had your hand in this, too

If you believe me
We could stand the test of time like no one else
If you believe me
You know it means you have to disbelieve yourself
If you believe me
'Cause I'm here wondering what could you be thinking
Though I know you're there thinking that I wonder that all the time
I can still invade your thoughts when you're not with me
Yet don't mind me, I'm just a parasite on your mind
Yeah, don't mind me I know you're wondering all the time

If you believe me
We could stand the test of time like no one else
If you believe me
It means you have to disbelieve yourself
If you believe meEmbed
