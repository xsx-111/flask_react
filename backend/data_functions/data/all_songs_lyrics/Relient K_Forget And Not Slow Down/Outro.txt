Outro Lyrics
I swear this to you
I wish that this was not the truth
But it's something that you fell into
Crawling out is hard when you
Are not so sure it's what you wanna do

(I swear this to you) When a nightmare finally does unfold
(I wish that this was not the truth) Perspective is a lovely hand to hold
(But it's something that you fell into) Perspective is a lovely hand to hold

This choice is hard to make when you
Are not convinced it's what you wanna do
When a nightmare finally does unfold
Perspective is a lovely hand to holdEmbed
