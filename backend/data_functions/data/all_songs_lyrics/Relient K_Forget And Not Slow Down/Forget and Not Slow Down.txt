Forget and Not Slow Down Lyrics
How many times
Can I push it aside?
Is it time I befriended all the ghosts of all the things that haunt me most
So they leave me alone
Move on with my life
Be certain the steps of left and right don't fight the direction of upright

I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect the saint from within the wretch
Pour over me and wash my hands of it

It's time to decide
Which is out of my mind
'Cause it'll be me unless I put some thoughts to rest and leave some faults behind
I'll watch the glint in my eye
Shine off the spring in my step
And it could be blinding depending on the amount of You that I reflect

'Cause I could spend my life just trying to sift through
What I could've done better, but what good do what ifs do?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's something I should tell you now
I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect the saint from within the wretch
Pour over me and wash my hands
Pour over me and wash my hands

'Cause I could spend my life just trying to sift through
What I could've done better, but what good do what ifs do?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's something I should tell you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's something I should tell you now

I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for what I can't change now
If I become what I cannot accept
Resurrect the saint within the wretch
I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect the saint from within the wretch
I'd rather forget and not slow down
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now
If I become what I can't accept
Resurrect, resurrect
Pour over me and wash my hands
Pour over me and wash my hands of itEmbed
