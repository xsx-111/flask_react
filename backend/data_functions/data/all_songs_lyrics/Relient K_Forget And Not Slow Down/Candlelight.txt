Candlelight Lyrics
To know her is to love her
I'm going undercover
To catch a glimpse but not get caught
But to see her could be worse
If I don't get my head straight first
On second thought, I guess I'll not

She's almost brighter than the sun
Seems to me to be unfair
When you consider everyone
Who pales when they compare
When they compare

Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way
And they'll begin to chew her
Entire attire until it frays
For she outshines anyone whoever might
Dare to bask in the same candlelight

Oh, please don't seat us in the back
With all the insects and the trash
She is a lady; I'm the tramp
Collecting stares from pairs close by
Then flutters in the butterfly
Ew, just a moth drawn to the lamp
She's like an ancient artifact
Something you're lucky to have found
She'll pinch the nerves in all the necks
When she turns those heads around
Those heads around

Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way
And they'll begin to chew her
Entire attire until it frays
For she outshines anyone whoever might
Dare to bask in the same candlelight
Who may dare to bask in the same candlelight

She's almost brighter than the sun
Seems to me to be unfair
When you consider everyone
Who pales when they compare
When they compare

Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way
And they'll begin to chew her
Entire attire until it frays
For she outshines anyone whoever might
Dare to bask in the same candlelight
In the same candlelightEmbed
