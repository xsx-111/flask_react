This Is The End Lyrics
I can't keep a straight face and say this is not the end
Not if you want it, it's upon us and I wanna say it's sinking in
This may sound crazy but I want to come back home
That's it, I said it now, I'm sailing off to Neverland and then Japan

So think real slow
Don't forget that yes is yes and no is no
About the way you want to go
'Cause I may forget the way to get back home
This is the end if you want it
This is the end

You're not the first thing in my life I've loved and lost
Yeah, I've thought worse things that I might be less inclined to merely just shrug off
I took the fire escape and made it out alive
Yeah, I still burn from time to time but I've a healing hand against my side

So think real slow
Don't forget that yes is yes and no is no
About the way you want to go
'Cause I may forget the way to get back home
This is the end if you want it
This is the end if you want it
This is the endEmbed
