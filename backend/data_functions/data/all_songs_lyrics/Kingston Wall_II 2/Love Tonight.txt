Love Tonight Lyrics
Ooh, love tonight
Ooh, would feel so fine
I got to find someone to love tonight
You know, I've been lately feeling so, so tight
I cannot keep myself together
I see this world behind a flustering haze
I got to find someone who to give this present
I've been saving for all these days

Ooh, love tonight
Ooh, would feel so fine
I got to find someone to love tonight
You know, I've been lately feeling so, so tight
I cannot keep myself together
I see this world behind a flustering haze
I got to find someone who I'll give this present
I've been saving for all these days

Ooh, love tonight
Ooh, would sure unwind
The male in me is giving too much fuzz
It's taking me forwards with all this rush
I cannot keep myself together
I see this world behind a flustering haze
I got to find someone who I'll give this present
I've been saving for all these days

I got to find someone to love tonight
You know, I've been lately feeling so, so tight
I cannot keep myself together
I see this world behind a flustering haze
I got to find someone who I'll give this present
I've been saving for all these daysEmbed
