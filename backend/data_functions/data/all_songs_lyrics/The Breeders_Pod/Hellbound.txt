Hellbound Lyrics
It lives
In folds of red and steamy air
It lives
In misery

Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Oh, oh we're falling
Falling down
Down, d-down, d-down

It lives
Despite the knives internal
It lives
Marry me

Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Oh, oh we're falling
Falling down
Down, d-down, d-down
Down, d-down, d-down
Down, d-down, d-down

It lives
In misery

Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
(Hellbound, hellbound)
Hellbound, hellbound
Hellbound, hellbound
Hellbound, hellbound
Hellbound, hellbound1Embed
