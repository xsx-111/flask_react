Lime House Lyrics
I walk by, I fall down
For warm black tar forms balls
And black tar, baby

I'm in a lime house
I am in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I am in a lime house

Fall, f-f-fall, stay for good
Oh, live and live and live in the dark, baby
Tar baby

I'm in a lime house
I am in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I am in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I am in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I am in a lime house1Embed
