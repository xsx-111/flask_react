Glorious Lyrics
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Ah-ah, hold my breath for three more year
Yeah, three years
On my own on Saturdays, ah-ah

It's glorious
It's glorious

We were tired from the tea, ah-ah
Scrabbled and we slept
Through the window came the rain, ah-ah

It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious

Being tired from the tea, ah-ah
Hold my breath for three more year
Yeah, three years
On my own on Saturdays, ah-ah
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious1Embed
