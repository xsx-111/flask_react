Iris Lyrics
Four hours in the pod, one hour out
It grows and I sleep standing up
When Iris sleeps over
What a book she'll write

Stay for the last time
Oh come on, nobody wants that
Sister, sister
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We tried hour by hour
Hour by hour
Hour by hour

Four hours to daylight, four hours and then
Pour water on me 'til I live again
When Iris sleeps over
It'll be alright

All last night
But come on, nobody wants that
Sister, sister
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We tried hour by hour
Hour by hour
Hour by hour1Embed
