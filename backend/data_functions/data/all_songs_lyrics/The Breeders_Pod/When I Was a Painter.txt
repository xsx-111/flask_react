When I Was a Painter Lyrics
Inside legs of corduroy I've been
Heard stories of bare velveteen
Twenty hours later, I fill the room
With bad sex and bad TV

Go, go, go
Go, go, go

When I was a painter, I painted you well
Too bad I have to die
You brought the essentials, perversion appeal
And many lovers at one time

Go, go, go
Go, go, go
On and on

Inside legs of corduroy I've been
Heard stories of bare velveteen
Twenty hours later, I fill the room
With bad sex and bad TV
Go, go, go
Go, go, go1Embed
