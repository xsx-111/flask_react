Metal Man Lyrics
I don't know how old I was
But it was a '65 pickup
I was lying on the ground
With flat iron bars over my head

One silver drop is all you need
To put a hole in your head at two thousand degrees
That's right man, you be the Metal Man
At two thousand degrees
And that's hot
That's hot

And over my head, the hot wire was sparking
I got something down on my chest
And it began to bubble

I was repairing my three on a tree
When a drip dropped down on me
That's right man, I'm the Metal Man
At two thousand degrees
And that's hot
That's hot
(In the background there is a conversation between a man
And a woman. What they are saying is anyone's guess!)1Embed
