Only in 3's Lyrics
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Back burns are green and off for me and her
He's an ape, he's an ape, he's an angel

Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Only in 3's, oh, yeah
Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh...

Hay for a bed with her on my head
And you are the king
The same king who will burn me

Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Only in 3's, oh, yeah
Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!1Embed
