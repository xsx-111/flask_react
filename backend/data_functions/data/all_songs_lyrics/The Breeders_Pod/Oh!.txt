Oh! Lyrics
Oh! (Oh)
Let's fly (Let's fly)
And get lost in the moss
Oh, oh! (Oh-oh-oh)
Fall in the neon mine

Push me down
Push me down
Push me down

Still rolling in the stones
Run to the log that's rotten
And oh, oh!
Your soft belly bossing lows

Push me down
Push me down
Push me down

Oh!
Run to the log that's rotten
Oh, oh!
Your soft belly bossing lows
Push me down
Push me down
Push me down

Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!
