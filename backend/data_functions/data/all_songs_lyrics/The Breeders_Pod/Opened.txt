Opened Lyrics
Walking on these highways
We leave the land
And float inside the dark, black water

Robin flies again
Robin flies again

She flew low over the highways
And I saw the wind
Blowing back her barbie doll hair

Robin flies again
Robin flies again

And in a kitchen in Kentucky
She thinks she's Peter Pan
And in the bottom of a concrete basement

Robin flies again
Robin flies again1Embed
