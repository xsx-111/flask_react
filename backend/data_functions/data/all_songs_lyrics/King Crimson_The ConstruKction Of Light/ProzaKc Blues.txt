ProzaKc Blues Lyrics
Well I woke up this morning
In a- In a cloud of despair
I ran my hand across my head
And pulled out a pile of worried hair
I went to my physician
Who was buried in his thoughts
He said, "Son, you've been reading too much, uh
Elephant Talk"
Chit-chat

He said, "The thing about depression is
Well, you just can't let it get you down
You have to see the world for what it is:
A circus full of freaks and clowns
And you'll never please everybody
It's a well established fact."
He said, "I recommend a fifth of Jack and a bottle of Prozac"

What can you give a man
Who has everything?
Can you give him back his edge?
Can you make him want to sing?
No, you can only take from him
And there's nothing he can do
I've got the "driving me to drink and eat a bottle of Prozac" blues
Well, I woke up this morning
And I- and I shaved off my head
By the time I realized what I had done
I was already dead
I went to see the gatekeeper
Who was standing by Heaven's door
He said, "I hope you brought a good supply of
You know"
(Oh, don't worry)Embed
