Coda: I Have a Dream LyricsTragedies of Kennedys, refugees, AIDS disease
Photos of Hiroshima, the Holocaust, and Kosovo
Tim McVeigh, Saddam Hussein, the bombing of the World Trade
Hostages in Bosnia, atrocities, South Africa
Abortion and Kevorkian, Vietnam, napalm
Lady Di, and Lennon died a violent crime, Columbine
"I have a dream that one day...," Rodney King, O.J.,
Symbols of our lives and times, "One giant leap for mankind"Embed
