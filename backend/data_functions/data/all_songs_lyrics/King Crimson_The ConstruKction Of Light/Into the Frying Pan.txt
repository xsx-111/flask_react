Into the Frying Pan Lyrics
I was just now thinking about the jaws of life
How they chew you up and spit you right

Back into the frying pan

And how life unwinds round and around
Up and down
You think you're fine but then

You're back in the frying pan
Frying pan

And how life unwinds round and around
And up and down
You think you're fine but then

You're back in the frying pan

And how life unwinds
You think you're fine but then
I was just now thinking about the jaws of life
They chew you up and spit you right
Back into the frying pan
Frying pan
Frying pan
Frying pan
Frying panEmbed
