The ConstruKction of Light Lyrics

Pain, day, sky, beauty, die, black, joy, love
Empty, day, life, die, pain, passion, joy, black
Day, hate, beauty, die, life, joy ache, empty
Day, pain, die, love, passion, joy, black, light

And if God is dead, what am I?
A fleck of dirt on the wing of a fly
Hurtling to earth through a hole in the sky
A hole in the sky
And if Warhol's a genius, what am I?
A speck of lint on the penis of an alien
Buried in gelatin, beneath the sands of Venus

Time, sun, hurt, trust, peace, dark, rage, sad
White, rain, sun, anger, hurt, soft, trust, night
Rage, rain, white, hope, dark, sacred, sun, time
Time, trust, hurt, rage, anger, rain white, light
And if a bird can speak, who once was a dinosaur
And a dog can dream; should it be implausible?
That a man might supervise the construction of light
The construction of light

Pain, day, sky, beauty, black, die, joy, love
Empty, time, sun, hurt, trust, peace, dark, rage
Sad, white, rain, hate, anger, hope, sacred, passion
Life, night, ache, soft, light6Embed
