Hold On Lyrics
Hold on John
John hold on
It's gonna be alright
You're gonna win the fight

Hold on Yoko
Yoko hold on
It's going to be alright
You're going to make the flight

When you're by yourself
And there's no one else
You just have yourself
And you tell yourself
Just to hold on

Hold on world
World hold on
It's going to be alright
You're going to see the light
And when you're one
Really one
Well you get things done
Like they've never been done
So hold on5Embed
