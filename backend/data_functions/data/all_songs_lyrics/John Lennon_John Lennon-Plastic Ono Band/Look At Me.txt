Look At Me Lyrics
Okay?
(Yes, thank you)

Look at me
Who am I supposed to be?
Who am I supposed to be?
Look at me
What am I supposed to be?
What am I supposed to be?
Look at me
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

Here I am
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
Here I am
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
Here I am
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Look at me
Oh, please look at me, my love
Here I am
Oh, my love

Who am I?
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me
Who am I?
Nobody else can see
Just you and me
Who are we?
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love2Embed
