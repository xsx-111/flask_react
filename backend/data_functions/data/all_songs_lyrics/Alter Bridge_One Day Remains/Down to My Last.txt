Down to My Last Lyrics
And to the ones to which we sing
We are honored you let us in
I remember the thoughts of many things
Of the glory that you bring

I was never the right one to dare to dream
It's funny what this life has done to me now
You were always the only
To help me see there was a road I must find
A road that was mine

But I'm down to my last
I'm standing here alone
Looking back, on it all
But I'm down to my last
I'm ready, but I'm wrong
And I'm blind to it all

And to the ones to which we sing
Ones who tried to do us in, oh
I remember your name and I know your face
I can't forgive and can't erase
I was never the right one to bear the weight
Of something fueled by words I'd learn to hate
You were always the only
To help me see that to love is to shine
In your world blind

But I'm down to my last
I'm standing here alone
Looking back, on it all
But I'm down to my last
I'm ready but I'm wrong
And I'm blind to it all


But I'm down to my last
Well I'm ready but I'm wrong
And I'm scared of it all

But I'm down to my last
I'm ready but I'm wrong
And I'm blind to it all
But I'm down to my last
And I'm ready but I'm wrong
And I'm blind to it all1Embed
