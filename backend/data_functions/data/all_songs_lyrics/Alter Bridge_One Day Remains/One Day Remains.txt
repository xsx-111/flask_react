One Day Remains Lyrics
As your will is bent and broken
And every vision has been cast into the wind
As your courage crashes down before your eyes
Don't lay down and die

Cause I see in you
More than you'll ever know
And I ask you, "Why
You question the strength inside?"
And you need to know
How it feels to be alive

When every wound has been re-opened
And in this world of give and take, you must have faith
And the distance to your dreams stretch beyond reach
Don't lay down and die
No

Cause I see in you
More than you'll ever know
And I ask you, "Why
You question the strength inside?"
And you need to know
How it feels to be alive

How it feels
How it feels to be alive
How it feels
How it feels to be alive
How it feels
How it feels to be alive

Cause I see in you
More than you'll ever know
And I ask you, "Why
You question the strength inside?"
And you need to know
How it feels to be aliveEmbed
