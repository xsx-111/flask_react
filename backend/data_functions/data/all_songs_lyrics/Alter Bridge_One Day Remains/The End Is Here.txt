The End Is Here Lyrics
Endless days we search for what we hold inside
So hard to find
Luck turns, will the fallen ever reach within
And rise again?

For the rest of my life
I will find the answers that were always here
I will find the meaning this time
I will fight the end 'til the end is here

Wasted time with words that seem to break our will
They bind us still
Without a care, they tarnish what we hold so dear
What was once so clear

For the rest of my life
I will find the answers that were always here
I will find the meaning this time
I will fight the end 'til the end is hereEmbed
