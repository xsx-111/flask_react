Open Your Eyes Lyrics
Looking back I clearly see
What it is that's killing me
Through the eyes of one I know
I see a vision once let go
I had it all
Constantly it burdens me
Hard to trust and can't believe
Lost the faith and lost the love
When the day is done

Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one
On and on we stand alone
Until our day has come
When they open their eyes
And realize we are one

I love the way I feel today
But how I know the sun will fade
Darker days seem to be
What will always live in me
But still I run
It's hard to walk this path alone
Hard to know which way to go
Will I ever save this day
Will it ever change

Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one
On and on we stand alone
Until our day has come
When they open their eyes
And realize we are one
Still today we carry on
I know our day will come
When they open their eyes
And realize we are one


Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one?
(It's hard to walk this path alone
Hard to know which way to go)
Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one?
(Lost the faith and lost the love
When the day is done)
Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one?1Embed
