In Loving Memory Lyrics
Thanks for all you've done
I've missed you for so long
I can't believe you're gone
You still live in me
I feel you in the wind
You guide me constantly

I never knew what it was to be alone
Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
But now I come home and I miss your face
Smiling down on me
I close my eyes to see

And I know you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel, I can't hold on
I sing tonight cause it comforts me

I carry the things that remind me of you
In loving memory of the one that was so true
You were as kind as you could be
And even though you're gone
You still mean the world to me
I never knew what it was to be alone
Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
But now I come home and it's not the same
It feels empty and alone
I just can't believe you're gone

And I know you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel, I can't hold on
I sing tonight cause it comforts me

I'm glad it sets you free from sorrow
But I'll still love you more tomorrow
And you'll be here with me still
All you did you did with feeling
And you always found a meaning
And you always will
And you always will
And you always will

And I know you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel, I can't hold on
I sing tonight cause it comforts me10Embed
