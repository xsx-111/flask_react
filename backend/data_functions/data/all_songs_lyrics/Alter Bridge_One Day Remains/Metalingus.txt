Metalingus Lyrics
I've been defeated and brought down
Oh, dropped to my knees when hope ran out
Oh, the time has come to change my ways

On this day I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind
Yeah

I'll never long for what might have been
And now regret won't waste my life again
Oh, I won't look back, I'll fight to remain

On this day I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all behind
On this day, it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
Another chance to chase a dream
'Nother chance to feel
Chance to feel alive
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Fear will kill me
All I could be
Lift these sorrows
Let me breathe
Could you set me free?
Could you set me free?

On this day I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all behind
On this day, it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
Another chance to chase a dream
'Nother chance to feel
Chance to feel alive13Embed
