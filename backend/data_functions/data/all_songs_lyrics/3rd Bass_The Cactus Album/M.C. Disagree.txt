M.C. Disagree Lyrics
Whats up Serch, whats up man?
Hello?
I don't know where the fuck my light is man...
My anyame is up on the rise, I don't know where the fuck I am...
I don't know what the fuck's goin on, i'm fucked up
I don't want to fuck, fuck, I came out like everybody dusted
I don't know what if i'm more alone, fucked up
I don't know where the fuck my ride is, i'm gonna break it
I gotta find my ride, I don't know, you know
Mow the lawn...
*tape interference*

Yo yo yo
