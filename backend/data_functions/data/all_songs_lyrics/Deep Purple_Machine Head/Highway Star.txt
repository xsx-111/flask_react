Highway Star Lyrics
Nobody going to take my car
I'm going to race it to the ground
Nobody going to beat my car
It's going to break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything

I love it
And I need it
I bleed it
Yeah, it's a wild hurricane

Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody going to take my girl
I'm going to keep her to the end
Nobody going to have my girl
She stays close on every bend
Ooh, she's a killing machine
She's got everything
Like a moving mouth
Body control and everything
I love her
I need her
I see her
Yeah, she turns me on

Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star


Nobody going to take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody going to steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again
Ooh, I'm in heaven again
I've got everything
Like a moving ground
An open road and everything

I love it
And I need it
I seed it
Eight cylinders, all mine
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star


Nobody going to take my car
I'm going to race it to the ground
Nobody going to beat my car
It's going to break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything

I love it
And I need it
I bleed it
Yeah, it's a mad hurricane

Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star7Embed
