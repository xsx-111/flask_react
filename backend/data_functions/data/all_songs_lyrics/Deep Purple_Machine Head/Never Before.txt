Never Before Lyrics
Somebody, somebody
Come to my side
I'm tired, I'm crying
I'm sick inside
My woman, that woman
Just wasn't right

Help me, now
Please, my friend

I never felt so bad before
Never, never before

So funny, so funny
Just like a show
One name, two people
All in a row
Somebody, somebody
Someone must go

Help me, now
Please, my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never, never before

I was hurt when I was younger
By a woman who was cold
She took my name, she took my body
And she threw away my soul


I can't hide
I can't hide
My misery
I know my sorrow won't set me free
She did it
Just see
She did it to me

Help me, now
Please, my friend

I never felt so bad before
Never, never before
