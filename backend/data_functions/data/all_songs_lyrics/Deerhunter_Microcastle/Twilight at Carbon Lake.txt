Twilight at Carbon Lake Lyrics
Go to the shore and
Pray for the sea
Go towards the mirror and
Pray that you'll see
Someone else
Downtown
Go downtown

Go to the waves of grain
In the center of the state
Go away
Go to a parking lot
Sit on the ground and cry
You'll never know why
Start over

Go to the ocean
On a ship
Wave goodbye to the waves
And the
Frozen shit
That was in your heart
So long
Time slows when it goes away
Go away
Time slows
So long4Embed
