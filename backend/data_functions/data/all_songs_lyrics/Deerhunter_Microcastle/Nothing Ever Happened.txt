Nothing Ever Happened Lyrics
Only way within but there's no way out
You learn to choke, you learn to shout
Focus on the depth that was never there
Eliminate what you can't repair

Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passed and flashed right through me

Sleep through the winter, awake in spring
Adjust your eyes to the state of things
Focus on the depth that was never there
Nothing's easy, nothing's fair

Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passed and flashed right through me

I never saw it coming
Waiting for something from nothing
I never saw it coming
Waiting for something from nothing6Embed
