Microcastle Lyrics
All I've seen
All I've seen

Try to
Describe it
In the time
Of all of it

Try not to
Come to bed
Warm me and
I might slip
I might do
I might

Try to
Describe it all
In your time
End it all

All I do
It may be not it
On and on, it could
Be my beginning
All through time
All through timeEmbed
