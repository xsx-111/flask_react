Agoraphobia Lyrics
Come for me
You cover me
Come for me
Comfort me
Come for me
Cover me
Comfort me
Comfort me

I have a dream no longer to be free
I want only to see four walls made of concrete
6 by 6 enclosed
See me on video oh oh oh
Feed me twice a day
I want to fade away, away

Come for me
You cover me
Come for me
Comfort me
Come for me
Cover me
Comfort me
Comfort me
And after some time I know I would go blind
But seeing only binds the vision to the eye
I'd lose my voice, I know
But I've nothing left to say
(Nothing left to pray)
No echo in this space11Embed
