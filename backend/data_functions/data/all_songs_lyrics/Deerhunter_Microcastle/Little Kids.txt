Little Kids Lyrics
Kids drinking gin on the
The front lawn
The kids see that man walking down
The dirt road
These kids see the sky and they think of him
Dressed in flames
Kids walk behind, slowly stalk
That old man

To get older still
To get older still
To get older still
To get older still

These kids followed him in
Into his shed
Where he turns on the radio
And smokes a cig
These kids come with gasoline
And they strike a match

To get older still
To get older still
To get older still
To get older
To get older still
To get older still
To get older still
To get older stillEmbed
