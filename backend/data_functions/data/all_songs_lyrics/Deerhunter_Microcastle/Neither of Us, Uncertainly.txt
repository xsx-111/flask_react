Neither of Us, Uncertainly Lyrics
So long to the
The days you grow sad of
And you try to find
Not much for you to hold
The more that you hold the
The more you feel alone

And wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
No more

So long to the
The days you come to know
So you had to
To get there on your own

To wait
To grow old
You're waiting
To grow old
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
No more

Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait

Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
