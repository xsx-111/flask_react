Never Stops Lyrics
I had dreams
That frightened me awake
I happened to escape
But my escape
Would never come
Would never come
Would never come
Would never come

I had plans
To go away for days
To try and risk a pace
That haunts my days
That haunts my days
Haunts my days
Haunts my days
Haunt my days
I love
I love
I love
Winter
In my heart
It never stops
It never stops
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
It never stops
It never stops
It never stops
It never stops
It never
I love
I love
I loveEmbed
