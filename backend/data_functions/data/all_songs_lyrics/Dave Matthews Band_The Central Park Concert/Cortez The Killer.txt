Cortez The Killer Lyrics
He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for a new world
A palace in the sun
On the shore lay Montezuma
With his cocoa leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wondered
The secrets of the worlds
Oh, and his subjects gathered round him
Like leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see
And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on
Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones
They carried them to the flat-lands
And they died along the way
They built up with their bare hands
What we still can't build today
And I know sheâ€™s living there
And she loves me to this day
I can still remember when
Or how I lost my way
Cortez, Cortez
He came dancing across the water, Cortez, Cortez

Dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
Dancing across the water
He came dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
Dancing across the water
Dancing across
He came dancing across the waterEmbed
