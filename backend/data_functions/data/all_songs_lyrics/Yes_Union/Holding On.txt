Holding On LyricsSee the searching...
See the people...
Out in the darkness and soul searching
Did you find what we had lost?
All this time I've got to thinking about the promises
How long this energy of Winter?
How many times that we could never love?
How many times is time enough?
All the foolish notions
When we'll die that's all that is
We can never really understand the broken promises
All along we run together (Remember?)
All along we run as one (Remember?)
When you find a perfect union, you've got to follow it
Stop that reasoning (You've got the answer)
You've got to stop that thinking out loud! (You’ve got the answer)
Go where your heart takes you to (You've got the answer!)
You're not that innocent!
You've been around!
You're not that innocent...
Got to be right
Got it coming to you
How many times is time enough? (Time enough...)
Got to be right
Got it coming to you
How many times is time enough? (Time enough...)
Your time is just beginning out of all where we came from
Holding on
This point receiving
There it is, there it is, there it is
Holding on, can you remember
Holding on, was it ever like this?
Holding on, it’s the most important thing
It was the first time that I saw you
It was the first time that I knew
Out of all my disbelieving
Holding on, I was holding you
Holding on...Embed
