Miracle of Life LyricsHold on
Hold on
Hold on
To the miracle of life
Secret lives of oceans been washed away like mud
You don't want my devotion
You'd rather be washed in blood
Can we turn away from this open anger?
Can it all betray?
Can't you feel the danger to the miracle of life
Sing when open hearts are calling
Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)
Far below the deepest treasure
To the miracle of life
Living in times of luster, waiting for the flood
We don't agree with your concepts
You'd rather be washed in blood
Is it any wonder? (In my lifetime)
Cold depth of blue water...
Is it any wonder? (In my lifetime)
Rising tide to slaughter...
Sing when open hearts are calling
Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)
Far below the deepest treasure
Sing when open hearts are calling
Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)
Far beyond your deepest pleasure
To the miracle of life
Pacifica...Indian...Atlantica...Antarctica
Can we turn away from this open anger?
Can it all betray?
Don't you feel the danger to the miracle of life
Sing when open hearts are calling
Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)
Far below the deepest treasure
To the miracle of life
Sing when open hearts are calling
Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)
Far beyond your deepest pleasure
To the miracle of life
To the miracle of life
Pacifica... Atlantica...Indian...Antarctica
Sing
To the miracle of life
Hold on to the miracle of life
Hold on to the miracle of life
Hold on to the miracle of life
Hold on to the miracle of lifeEmbed
