Silent Talking LyricsDoes it matter if you broke this spell
So unreal is the future life along the way
They dare you
To turn around, to turn around
It all comes through this
It all comes through this feel
It doesn't ring, it doesn't ring
It doesn't ring true
It doesn’t ring
It doesn’t doesn’t ring
True
Silent talking in the system, bring me to this beautiful world
Silent talking, always dreaming, sing me to this beautiful world
Silent talking in the system, bring me to this beautiful world
Silent talking, always dreaming, bring me to this beautiful world
Beautiful worldEmbed
