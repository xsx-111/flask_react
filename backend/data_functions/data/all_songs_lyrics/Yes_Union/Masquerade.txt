Masquerade Lyrics(Rabin)
Look around - Got no place to stay
God I hate this town, depending on the day
You look me up, you look me down - Alright, OK
While I got no life, I got no hope;
I'm falling in love
Help me through the fight;
Help me win tonight - I'm calling
What to do I find it hard to know;
The road I walk is not the one I chose
Lift me up and turn me over;
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain;
Tie me up, love in a storm
Have you decided on my fortune?
Facing the future in your eyes
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries
Open doors - They may be closed to me;
The fire's still burning in my heart...
What to do I find it hard to know;
I want to turn my life around...Embed
