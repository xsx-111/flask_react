Lift Me Up LyricsLook around - Got no place to stay
God I hate this town, depending on the day
You look me up, you look me down
Alright, OK
While I got no life, I got no hope
I'm falling in love
Help me through the fight
Help me win tonight - I'm calling
Callin'
What to do I find it hard to know
The road I walk is not the one I chose
Lift me up and turn me over
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain
Tie me up, love in a storm
Have you decided on my fortune?
Facing the future in your eyes
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries
Open doors - They may be closed to me
The fire's still burning in my heart...
While I got no life, I got no hope
I'm falling in love
Help me through the fight
Help me win tonight - I'm calling
Callin'
What to do I find it hard to know
I want to turn my life around...
Lift me up and turn me over
Lead me on into the dawn
Take me to the highest mountain
Tie me up, love in a storm
Have you decided on my fortune?
Facing the future in your eyes
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries
Open doors - They may be closed to me
The fire's still burning in my heart...
Lift me up and turn me over
(Don't turn away)
Lead me on into the dawn
(Lead me on, lead me on)
Take me to the highest mountain
Tie me up, love in a storm
Lift me up
