Without Hope You Cannot Start the Day LyricsHold still now for the moving information close to you
You could never force it in your life this decision
To break it without hope, you cannot start the day
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it, tell me why
Only you call tell it
Only you can say
In between this moving out
To save your soul it came away
And took it out
Oh why? Oh why?
Fire in the wild, burning in the night
Chasing in the wind, shadows always dance in the rain
Ringing into the fire, doesn't matter who
Who can see in the smile
Hope in the rain, open the flame
Coming back in the night
I can see the rhythm of the rain
I can see it shout like thunder

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you need
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love
Must be love, must be love, must be love
Shadows come alight from the vision that flowed
Shake it off, passion is the flame of the fire
Does it matter? Can you give love?
Can you hear it come? Can you see what you like?
What's the matter? Don't you want to risk?
Don't you want to hold me? Hold me, dance in the rain
I feel the love in your eyes, I can see you coming

Sweet suffering, love protection needed, needed
You need, come to me, believe it
Never, by far, your heart is there
Most of all, believe it
Perfection reaction, react

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you need (x5)
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love
Must be love, must be loveEmbed
