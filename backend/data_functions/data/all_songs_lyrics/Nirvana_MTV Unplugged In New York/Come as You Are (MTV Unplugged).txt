Come as You Are (MTV Unplugged) Lyrics
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest, as a friend
As an old enemy, yeah

Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As a known enemy, yeah

Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
When I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun


â€“ria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

When I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
