Are You Receiving Me LyricsIf your circles could be spirals
And your idols weren't machines
If you could pick up all the signals
And flash on where you've been
Maybe you don't feel it at all
It's your own fault, crawl boy crawl
You could quit the miming
Try some different timing
You could get a chance to be free--
Are you receiving me?
It's the pilot's plea
Are you receiving me?
Close to insanity
Are you receiving me?
Recharge your battery
Oooh, Are you receiving me?
If your prayers could all be answered
You were given time to pay
The chances would be so heavy
But you'd find a better way
Maybe you don't feel it at all
It's your own fault, crawl boy crawl
You can quit the miming
Try some different timing
You could get a chance to be free--
Are you receiving me?
It's the pilot's plea
Are you receiving me?
Close to insanity
Are you receiving me?
Recharge your battery
Oooh, Are you receiving me?Embed
