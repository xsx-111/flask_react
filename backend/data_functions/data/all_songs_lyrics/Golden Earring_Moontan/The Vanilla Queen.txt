The Vanilla Queen LyricsFascinating lady
Snowflake in the sun
You make me feel so bourgeois
Oh, you've captured everyone
I hear you've been a dancer
At some famous Paris show
And million dollar lovers
Neatly saw you to your door
Nineteen fifty-seven
Sweetheart of the year
The secret of your beauty
Was your moontan and your fear
And now you run this city
You're still honey to the flies
Attract the in-crowd dandies
Faraway look in their eyes
You're the bright
Nocturnal vanilla queen
Your mask is sterile dignity
Tell me why, nocturnal vanilla queen
You haunt me even in my dreams
It couldn't be avoided
We were bound to meet
I knew you would drag me down
And toss me off my feet
Sweet moments of desire
Sweet moments of relief
You blew down my fences
Oh, you're natural make-believe
You're the bright
Nocturnal vanilla queen
Your mask is sterile dignity
Tell me why, nocturnal vanilla queen
You haunt me even in my dreams

You're the bright
Nocturnal vanilla queen
Your mask is sterile dignity
Tell me why, nocturnal vanilla queen
You haunt me even in my dreams

Well, in simple English I’m…  (awful lazy)
What’s your name, Honey?Embed
