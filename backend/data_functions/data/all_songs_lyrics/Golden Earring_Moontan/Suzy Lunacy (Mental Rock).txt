Suzy Lunacy (Mental Rock) LyricsI won't forget you, Suzy Lunacy
You finally got me where you wanted me
Another case for psychiatry
Signed: Suzy Lunacy
I can't forgive you, Suzy Lunacy
For all the things you took away from me
For undermining my security
Love: Suzy Lunacy
I'm a lookin' for love, and look what I got
Plenty of aggro, and emotional shock
My knickers in a twist, and my head's on the block
That's what you give me with your mental rock
Now I'm wondering, how our thing will end
If you're so stubborn, and refuse to bend
People around us just stand and mock
Trying to do the mental rock
Well I ain't as sweet as my mother says
I've played these games, you lay on heads
Suzy loony, you're the cream of the crop
The expert on mental rockEmbed
