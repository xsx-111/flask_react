Big Tree, Blue Sea LyricsMorning sunshine, praise the earth
Fill your glass with wine and dirt
I don't mind, I'm the big tree
I don't mind, I'm the blue sea
Paper castles, filled with words
Limbo policemen please the herd
I don't mind, I'm the big tree
I don't mind, I'm the blue sea
I'm sun, I'm warm, I'm child of the moon
Even when it's dark, I'll send the dune
Can't you hear there's fishermen laughing
The whale dips down, I hear him crying for me
I'm shade, I'm good, I'm beams in June
Even when it's dark, I'll light your room
Don't you know the clown has feelings
Talking revolution, secret meetings, who's free
Who's free, free
Morning sunshine, praise the earth
Fill your glass with blood and dirt
I don't mind, I'm the big tree
I don't mind, I'm the blue seaEmbed
