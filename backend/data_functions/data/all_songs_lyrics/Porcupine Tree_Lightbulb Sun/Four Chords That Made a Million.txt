Four Chords That Made a Million LyricsSix of one and half a dozen
Black guitars and plastic blues
Hide behind a wall of nothing
Nothing said and nothing new
4 Chords that made a million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million
You belong there on the cover
You are the emperor in new clothes
A man who thinks he owns the future
Will sell your vacuum with his prose
4 Chords that made a million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million
And then a moron with a cheque book
Will take you out to lunch who knows?
He will tell you you're a saviour
And then he'll drop you like a stone
4 Chords that made a million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million
And I have tried and I have died
Trying to get through
But in the end I can't defend you
4 Chords that made a million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million
4 Chords that made a million, million, million2Embed
