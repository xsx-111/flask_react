Where We Would Be LyricsTied - tied to a time
When we knew that the sun would shine
And you were all smiles
And we could just talk for a while...
Of where we would be when the future comes
(Where we would be)
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs
If, if I could find you
(I find you)
And tell you about my life
(And tell you about my life)
Or maybe just write
And remind you of when we would dream...
Of where we would be when the future comes
(Where we would, where we would be)
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs
Strange how you never become
The person you see when you're young
Of where we would be when the future comes
(Where we would, where we would be)
And how you would paint while I wrote my songs
Strange how you never become
The person you see when you're young2Embed
