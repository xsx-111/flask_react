Feel So low LyricsSo see how long I can last
You can pretend that I don't exist for you
And I can laugh about it now
But I hated every minute
I was waiting for your e-mail
And each day that you forgot to call
Just made me feel so low, so low
Just made me feel so low, so low
Christmas 19, 1998
I tried to call, I just couldn't wait
And your message was out of date
So I left my voice on your machine
But you did not, did not respond
Okay, okay, okay, you've won
You make me feel so low, so low
You make me feel so low, so low
You make me feel so low, so low
You make me feel so low, so low
