Hatesong LyricsThis is a hate song just meant for you
I thought that I'd write it down while I still could
I hope when you hear this you'll want to sue
Oh it's a lonely life in my empty bed
And it's a quiet life that leaks from my head
These are the last rites
The line is dead, dead
Dead
Yes, I'm hearing voices too
And I'm more cut up than you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yes, I'm hearing voices too
But I'm more cut up than you
Yeah2Embed
