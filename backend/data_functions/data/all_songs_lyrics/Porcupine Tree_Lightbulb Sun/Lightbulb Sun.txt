Lightbulb Sun LyricsThe sun is a light bulb, a candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now on my little retreat
And I'll only take medicine if it's followed by sweets
A sickly pink liquid that puts me to sleep
My head beats a better way
Tomorrow a better day
And I can watch TV while I'm wrapped up in bed
And mother makes sure that I'm watered and fed
My best friends from school will come over and stare
At me in my bubble of germified air
My head beats a better way
Tomorrow a better day
When I'm asleep the smoke fills me
I feel the heat, my illness leaves me
My head beats a better way
Tomorrow a better day
When I'm asleep the smoke fills me
I feel the heat, my illness leaves me
The sun is a light bulb, a candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now on my little retreat
But after a while the noise from the street
Is making me wish I was back on my feet3Embed
