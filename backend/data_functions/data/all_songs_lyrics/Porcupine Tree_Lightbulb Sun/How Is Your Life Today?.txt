How Is Your Life Today? LyricsThe letters pile up in the hallway
Junk mail and bills from the catalogues
And the neighbours have guessed 'cos I've cancelled the milk
And they don't hear your voice through the walls anymore
How is your life today?
How is your life today?
I was kissed on the cheek by a cold mouth
While the taxi was waiting like a getaway car
And each second seems like a lifetime
And the cat it's been staring at me all this time
How is your life today?
How is your life today?1Embed
