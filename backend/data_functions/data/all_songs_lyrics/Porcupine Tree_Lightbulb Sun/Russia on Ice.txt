Russia on Ice LyricsYou think I deserve this
You said I was stupid
All my thoughts are like coal
But Russia on ice is burning a hole
Can't stop myself drinking
Can't stop being me
If I call will you come and will you save me?
I see the whole thing come down
I burn it to the ground
Well what the hell did you say?
You said you hate me this way
It's just a matter of time
A drop in the ocean
A significant motion
Nothing melts in this cold
But Russia on ice is burning a hole
I see the whole thing come down
I burn it to the ground
Well what the hell did you say?
You said you hate me this way
It's just a matter of time7Embed
