Free World LyricsI thought of you when they closed down the school
And the hospital too
Did they think that you were better?
They were wrong
You had so many friends
They all left you in the end
'Cause they couldn't take the patter (stand)
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united by a struggle (children)
Going down
You've got to walk into the water
With your sister and your daughter
In this free world
If I wore your shades could I share your point of view?
Could I make you feel better?
Paint a picture, write a letter?
Well I know what you're saying
But I see the things you do
And it's much too dangerous
To get closer to you
But I will see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united by the struggle
Going down
With a pocketful of plastic
Like a dollar on elastic
In this free world
(I wouldn't tell you if I didn't care)
I'll see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united by the struggle
And the ghettoes are full of Mercedes Benz
And you'd never hurt a friend
Who wouldn't tell you
It's cold and it's going to get colder
You may not get much older
You're much too scared of living
And to die is a reliable exit
So you push it and you test it
With 'Thunderbird' and 'Rivin'
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united in the struggle
In this free world baby
Got to take it got to grab it
Got to get it up and shag it
In this free world
Going down
You've got to get into the water
Like a lamb goes to the slaughter
In this free world baby
Baby going down
With a pocketful of plastic
Like a dollar on elastic
In this free world
(I wouldn't tell you if I didn't care)Embed
