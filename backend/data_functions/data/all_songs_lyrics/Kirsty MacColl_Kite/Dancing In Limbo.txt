Dancing In Limbo Lyrics(Kirsty MacColl)
He said, 'Baby don't go'
So she sat down again
And they said they'd be friends
Her mother said
She'd told her so
She'd made her own bed
Now she'd have to lie in it, and the
Time goes
Summertime slow
And the world stops turning
And they're dancing in limbo, limbo, limbo
Took my pills today
But I don't feel better
In a funny sort of way
When it's too hot for anything
It's too hot to sleep
Your mind runs down to where
The river runs deep, and the
Time goes
Summertime slow
And the world stops turning
And they're dancing in limbo, limbo, limbo
His dream, peaches and cream
A cheesecake betty from the celluloid screen
So close he holds out his hand
But she sleeps like a woman
When he wakes like a man, and the
Time goes
Summertime slow
And the world stops turning
And they're dancing in limbo, limbo, limboEmbed
