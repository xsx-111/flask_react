Innocence Lyrics(Kirsty MacColl/Pete Glenister)
It wouldn't take a long time
To explain what lies between us
And it wouldn't take a genius
To work out what the scene is
It might just take a pilot
To give you a natural high
But you're sending off those bottletops
For your 'free piece of mind!'
And are you just waving or drowning?
It's so hard to tell when you're so far away
Oh innocence has passed you by
A long long time ago
I was the fly upon your wall
And I saw what you know
Your pornographic priestess left you for another guy
You frighten little children and you always wonder why
Always wonder why
The mercury is rising
And it's not all that surprising
In the land of milk and honey
Where you make 'Big Money'
And it always keeps the rain off
And it always keeps you dry
But back home the people hate you
And you never did know why
But I think I'm going to tell you
Just give me fifty thousand lire for my thoughts
Oh innocence has passed you by
A long long time ago
I was the fly upon your wall
And I saw what you know
The supermarket checkout girl
Once smacked you in the eye
When you eat no one else does
But you always wonder why
Always wonder why
It would take a gunshot
Just to clear your head awhile
And after all this time
How can you stand there
Look at me and smile?
Now are you just waving or drowning?
It's so hard to tell when you're so far away
Oh innocence has passed you by
A long long time ago
I was the fly upon your wall
And I saw what you know
Degeneration suits you, now I'm going home to cry
You won't be seeing me again
But you'll always wonder why
Always wonder whyEmbed
