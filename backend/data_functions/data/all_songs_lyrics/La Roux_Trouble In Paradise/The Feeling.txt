The Feeling Lyrics
Taking the time to make me feel right
Taking the time to make me feel nice
Can't sleep, I’m thinking about you all night
Tossing and turning, it's not right
I won't lead you on

When it's dark and we're alone in my car
And I know, I've got the feeling
When I wake up and there you are
I get the feeling
For you I will raise, raise the bar
I've got the feeling
Yeah the feeling, I get the feeling

There's plenty of time to get me in shape
I promise I'll keep the promises I made
Barely said hello before we say goodbye
While I’m away I swear I’ll try
When you laugh it makes me laugh too
I can't believe I let you get through
Get through, get through

When it's dark and we're alone in my car
And I know, I've got the feeling
When I wake up and there you are
I get the feeling
For you I will raise, raise the bar
I've got the feeling
Yeah the feeling, I get the feeling
On the outside I might seem strong
But really, inside, I'm just alone
I don't believe wherever we go
I'm just a child whenever you show up
On the outside I might seem strong
But really, inside, I'm just alone
I don't believe wherever we go
I'm just a child whenever you show up
Whenever you show up
Whenever you show up
I'm just a child whenever you show upEmbed
