Kiss and Not Tell Lyrics
Ten-thousand stories and two lovers disguised
You've seen the future, now a love that is blind
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
You've dialed that number now, so where's the surprise?
Temptation's callin' you, a secret reply
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

All along I've had feelings I can't help
Makes me want to kiss and not tell

You say in evidence, they won't take you alive
But when the sun goes down you cover your lies
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
You like the elegance but it's weighin' you down
And sometimes you just need a night on the town, oh
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
All along I've had feelings I can't help
Makes me want to kiss and not—
And all I want is to come out of my shell
Makes me want to kiss and not tell


All along I've had feelings I can't help
Makes me want to kiss and not—
And all I want is to come out of my shell
Makes me want to kiss and not tell

All along I've had feelings, feelings I can't help
And all I want is to come out, to come out of my shell
All along I've had feelings, feelings I can't help
(Makes me want to kiss and not—)
And all I want is to come out, to come out of my shell
(Makes me want to kiss, kiss, kiss)
All along I've had feelings, feelings I can't help
(Makes me want to kiss and not—)
(And all I want is to come out, to come out of my shell)
Makes me want to kiss, kiss2Embed
