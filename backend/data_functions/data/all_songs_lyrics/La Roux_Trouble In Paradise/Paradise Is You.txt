Paradise Is You Lyrics
Walkin' along on a sandy beach
Everybody's lovin' on the cigarette trees
And the water here, is crystal clear and bright
The air is rich with the Hawaiian breeze
The grass is alive with sugar weeds
And the hilltops tuck in the bay for the night

The palm trees make it feel like a paradise
Without you here, there's nothin' nice
Cause in your eyes
That's my paradise

When all the roads ahead of me stop lookin' new
My paradise is you, my paradise is you
When everything I know is slippin' out of view
My paradise is you, my paradise is you

You
My heaven is you

The runners run and the teasers tease
But none of these faces can set me free
And the water here is crystal clear and bright
When I compare this pleasure beach
To all the places in your eyes that I have seen
It could be anywhere if you're not by my side
The palm trees make it feel like a paradise
Without you here, there's nothin' nice
Cause in your eyes
That's my paradise

When all the roads ahead of me stop lookin' new
My paradise is you, my paradise is you
When everything I know is slippin' out of view
My paradise is you, my paradise is you
When all the roads ahead of me stop lookin' new
My paradise is you, my paradise is you
When everything I know is slippin' out of view
My paradise is you, my paradise is you

You
My heaven is you
My heaven is you
My heaven is you

All my love is for you
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
All my love is for you
(When all the roads ahead of me stop looking new)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you
(When everything I know is slipping out of view)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you
(When everything I know is slipping out of view)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you
(When everything I know is slipping out of view)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you
(When everything I know is slipping out of view)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you
(When everything I know is slipping out of view)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you
(When everything I know is slipping out of view)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you
(When everything I know is slipping out of view)
Darling, it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
(My paradise is you, my paradise is you)
All my love is for you (my heaven is you)
Darling it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
All my love is for you (my heaven is you)
Darling it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
All my love is for you (my heaven is you)
Darling it's only you who can stop my heart from crying
All my love is for you (my heaven is you)
Darling it's only you who can stop my heart from crying3Embed
