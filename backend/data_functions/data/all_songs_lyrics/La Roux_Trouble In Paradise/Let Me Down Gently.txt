Let Me Down Gently Lyrics
Let me down gently
That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
It still feels hard, hard
Turn me into someone good
That's what I really need
Tell me that I'm someone good
So we're not so far apart, apart

I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

Set me up slowly
That's what you do to me
Oh you set me up slowly
Now I can't come down, down
Let you down gently
That's what I think you need
But when I let you down you're empty
And you try to hide your frowns, frowns
I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it
And I hope it's sinking in
That behind your perfect skin
There's a part of you that's free
And I know that there's a place for me

Let me down gently
That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
It still feels hard, hard
Turn me into someone good
That's what I really need
Tell me that I'm someone good
So we're not so far apart, apart

(Let me down, let me down)
(Let me down, let me down)
(oh won't you please let me down)
(oh won't you please let me down)
I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it
And I hope it's sinking in
That behind your perfect skin
There's a part of you that's free
And I know that there's a place for me

How do you feel in the night
Now the feeling's left behind
As you know there was a time
When your silence left me blind
Now you're callin' from the aisle
I can see, it's denial
A denial left to slide
Now there's nothing left to hide6Embed
