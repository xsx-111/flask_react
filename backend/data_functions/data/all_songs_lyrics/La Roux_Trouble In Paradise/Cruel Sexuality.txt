Cruel Sexuality Lyrics
I've been talkin' to myself
Oh, I think I need your help
All this love is make-believe
Trapped inside a fantasy

And he came runnin' out of the water
In the dead of the night, he could see
As his shadow came before her
She felt what she wanted to see
She whispered "use me"

What you touch you believe
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed

Cruel sexuality
Am I a fool to let you trouble me?
Cruel sexuality

I don't even know myself
Cause I'm becomin' someone else
Where is rationality?
When I'm locked inside a dream
I say "just use me"
When we choose to deceive
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed

Cruel sexuality
Am I a fool to let you trouble me?
Cruel sexuality

Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
