Silent Partner Lyrics
I've been livin' in a lot of shadows
Why won't you let me leave?
And I've been tryna find my way to the shallows
But the water's just too deep
Always somethin' inside of me
Keeps draggin' me down
I'm going deep below the undertow
And it won't let go
All I need is silence

There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence
And he creeps in through the walls at night when
When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad
All I need is silence

All I need is silence
Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence
You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me
I need silence

So tired of breathin' in numbers
Tryin' to stop my racing heart
All I know is that I want it to stop
But I don't know where to start
You're always on my shoulder
Prayin' I won't try anymore
And conversations that begin to shout
Are you happy now?
All I need is silence
All I need is silence
There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence
And he creeps in through the walls at night when
When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad
All I need is silence

All I need is silence
Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence
You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me
I need silence
All I need is silence
Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence
You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me
I need silence

There's a thumping that's-
Si-Silence
All I need is silence

All I need is silence
Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence
You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me
I need silence
There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence
And he creeps in through the walls at night when
When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad
All I need is silence

All I need is silence
Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence
You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me
I need silence

There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence
And he creeps in through the walls at night when
When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad
All I need is silence

Silence
Trying to stop my racing heart
There's a thumpin' that's filled with
Trying to stop my racing heart
There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence
SilenceEmbed
