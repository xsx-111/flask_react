Uptight Downtown Lyrics
The streets are lined with people
People who want to move, move, move
How can all these people
Have so much to prove, prove, prove?

Oh, I can only ask myself
Oh, where are you all going?
And won't you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blowing?

Uptight Downtown
All the blue lights fighting with the crowds
And oh, I know the temperature is rising, is rising
Uptight Downtown
All the blue lights fighting with the crowds
And oh, I know the temperature is rising, is rising

The streets are lined with people
With nothing left to lose, lose, lose
When did all these people
Decide to change their shoes, shoes, shoes?
Oh, I can only ask myself
Oh, where are you all going?
And won't you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blowing?

Uptight Downtown
All the blue lights fighting with the crowds
And oh, I know the temperature is rising, is rising
Uptight Downtown
All the blue lights fighting with the crowds
And oh, I know the temperature is rising, is rising

(Uptight, uptight)
(Uptight, uptight)
(Uptight, uptight)
(Uptight, uptight)
Uptight Downtown
Uptight Downtown
Uptight Downtown
Uptight Downtown

Why are we fighting? I don't understand
Oh, but the temperature's rising tonight
(Why are we fighting? I don't understand)
All the blue lights fighting with the crowds
And oh, I know the temperature is rising, is rising5Embed
