Sexotheque Lyrics
He wants to know
What it feels like to mess around, mess around
She wants to know
What it feels like to settle down, settle down
He's got the money but, oh it's not enough
He wants to pounce, he wants to pounce

Never knowing if he's given you up
Are you're just not good enough?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

He wants to go
Where the red lights shine so bright, shine so bright
He wants to know
Why he feels so cold inside, cold inside
He turns and looks around, he doesn't hear a sound
No one's around, no one's around
Never knowing if he's given you up
Are you're just not good enough?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
She wants to know why he's not home
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque


She wants to know why he's not home
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
(I bet, oh I bet, he's at the Sexotheque
He's at the Sexotheque)11Embed
