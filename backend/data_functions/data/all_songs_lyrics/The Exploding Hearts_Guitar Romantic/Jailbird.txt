Jailbird LyricsGirl, we're caught in the act of sniffing glue
And you just keep getting high now so what can I do?
The jail man took me away
On what would have been our wedding day
I'm all lost out here at the bar
Playing guitar, living out of my car
There's no more glue, but I'll see you
I'm just a jailbird (for your love)
I'm just a jailbird honey
Marking years on the wall
I got some sniffing to do
To get as high as you
We stuck rubber cement into the fair
We rode all the rides, but you wanted to fly
So you jumped off into the air
The neon lights and cotton candy skies
Couldn't bring you down from those highs
Oh now, you're so sad, oh girl
I see you talking to a squirrel
Kissing it's lips, why not mine?
So kiss me please!
I'm just a jailbird (for your love)
I'm just a jailbird honey
Marking years on the wall
I got some sniffing to do
To get as high as you
When the jailor man takes me away
I won't cry, I'll just obey
Oh now, you're so sad, oh girl
I see you on the Tilt-a-Whirl
Kissing his lips, why not mine?
So kiss me please!
I'm just a jailbird (for your love)
I'm just a jailbird honey
Marking years on the wall
I got some sniffing to do
To get as high as youEmbed
