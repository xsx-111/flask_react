Thorns In Roses LyricsThorns in roses, (whoa whoa)
That's how our love is, (and you know that)
It tears me apart, when you go out
With guys that I don't know about
Well I'll be waitin'
For good relations
No hesitations
Don't tell me that you got reservations...
About me and you
Your heart is cruel
What can I say
Love ain't too far away from you girl
I got a heart
Well don't you rip it apart
Oh baby, I got a heart
Don't you rip it apart
I saw the look in your eye, (and ya see that)
Running away again, (oh where ya goin'?)
Followin' new trends, I'll cut your heart out
And send it back to your mom's house
Well I've been waitin'
For good relations
No hesitations
Don't tell me that you got reservations...
About me and you
Your heart is cruel
What can I say?
Love ain't too far away from you girl
I got a heart
Ah don't you rip it apart
Oh baby I got a heart
Don't you rip it apart
I got a heart!
Well don't you rip it apart
Oh baby I got a heart
Don't you rip it apartEmbed
