Rumours In Town LyricsWe've always been more than just good friends, but you know we've never been an item
And when he hurts you girl, come around here to spite him
I don't know anything but i've heard all the rumours in town
There's trouble in paradise, your heart is gonna pay the price
We've always said things we didn't mean but now we say them more and more
So when I say to you I'm getting bored like I was before
I don't know anything but the word is getting around
There's trouble in paradise, your heart is gonna pay the price
There's nothing wrong with us you're just self absorbed
It was in your shadow but they don't know
I don't know everything but i've heard all the rumours in town
There's trouble in paradise, your heart is gonna pay the priceEmbed
