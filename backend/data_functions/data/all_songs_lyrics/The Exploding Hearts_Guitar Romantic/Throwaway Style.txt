Throwaway Style LyricsI know I should wake up in the morning
But I'm in bed till two
Heat fogs up the window, summer's over
No longer, can we rendez-vous
Weeds have grown over our camp site
I know cause I sleep there every night
Without you
I helped you pack your station wagon, saw you..off back to Seattle
You said it'd break his heart if he finds out, but girl he's gonna find out, what love is all about..Oh yeah
Weeds have grown over our camp site
I know cause I sleep their every night
Without you
I know our love is over, unless you come over, make it right, baby come over
I saw your sister at the market, she said you were back in town for awhile
She could tell by my face, I didn't know that
She took my hand and said "Boy I could make you smile."
Weeds have grown over our camp site
I know cause I slept there just last night
Without you
I know our love is over, unless you come over, make it alright, stay the night, oh baby come overEmbed
