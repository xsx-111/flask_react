Boulevard Trash LyricsAin't done chores now for at least a 100 days
Don't do the dishes no more, I just throw them away
On the corner with the radio blastin'
They're throwin' money away
On the boulevard
There's too much trash in the way
I've been missin' from home since the age of 10
100 dollar reward, I think I'll turn myself in!
On the boulevard
They take it hard then they throw it away
On the boulevard
There's too much trash in the way
On the boulevard
They take it hard then they throw it away
On the boulevard
There's too much trash in the way
I woke up in Chico about a week ago
I gotta play for my pay but then it's time to go
On the boulevard
They take it hard then they throw it away
On the boulevard
There's too much trash in the way
You just trash it awayEmbed
