Sleeping Aides And Razorblades LyricsWell I felt so bad when I heard that song
Ya know it's been such a long long time
It's a little offbeat and it ain't in tune ya know it's just like this heart of mine
And it hurt
When you went away
And all I wanted you to do was stay
Going steady ya we had big plans
But your friends said it wouldn't last
It was up to you to prove them wrong
But you couldn't even do that
And if it hurt, when you left
Ya know you're only hurtin' yourself
Ya know the first night you left me babe, it was so hard
And it didn't hurt you told all my friends I'm a retard
And ya say you know what's best for me
Well if you got your way, I'd have a lobotomy
I got new girls and I'm runnin' around
The house doesn't look the same
I hung new posters on my wall and the dog don't remember your name
And if it hurt, when you left
Ya know you're hurtin' yourself
You can try to change your heart, that's true
But ya never ever ever do
Ohhhh baby you never ever do
I'll tell you something, you never ever do
Sleeping aides
And razorblades
Tear stained pictures of younger days
Broken mirrors and a bloody nose
