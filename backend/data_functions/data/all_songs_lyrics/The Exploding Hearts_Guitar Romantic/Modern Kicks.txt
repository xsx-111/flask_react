Modern Kicks LyricsHearts are breaking now, she says I don't care (don't care)
It ain't my business, nose in the air
Hell is breaking loose, she says I don't mind (don't mind)
She's got new things to take up her time
Little white lies with matching suits and ties I put her in a place
I'm all alone and I'm getting stoned, staring off into space
It makes me shiver it makes me shake
You wanna give give give but I don't wanna take
Getting modern kicks
Hearts are breaking now, she says I don't care (don't care)
It ain't my business, nose in the air
Hell is breaking loose, she says I don't mind (don't mind)
She's got new things to take up her time
Little white lies with matching suits and ties I put her in a place
I'm all alone and I'm getting stoned, staring off into space
Well I'm gonna do just what I will
And I'm going away unless she's throwing up or sick
I'm getting modern kicks
Little white lies with matching suits and ties I put her in a place
I'm all alone and I'm getting stoned, staring off in space
It makes me shiver it makes me shake
You wanna give give give but I don't wanna take
Getting modern kicks
Modern kicks... I can't get modern kicksEmbed
