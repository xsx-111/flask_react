Still Crazy LyricsI was sick; I was losing my mind (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Couldn't make it so I told her why (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I got enough, and I'm getting hot
I'm jumped up a rocket high
Oh yeah, but you better relax
Can't tell me what to do (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I ain't a monkey, a monkey in a zoo (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I got enough, and I'm getting hot
I jumped up a rocket high
Oh yeah, but you better relax
Psychotic reaction driving me insane (oh yeah, insane)
Two thousand milligrams running through my veins (oh yeah, in my veins)
Baby, I'm alone in my room (shooting up some glue)
I'm still crazy for you
I was sick; I was losing my mind (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I couldn't make it, so I told her why (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I got enough and I'm getting hot
I jumped up a rocked high
Oh yeah, but you better relax
Psychotic reaction running through my brain (oh yeah, in my brain)
Two thousand milligrams driving me insane (oh yeah, insane)
Baby I'm alone in my room (shooting up some glue)
I'm still crazy for you
Oh, oh, don't get so something
Oh, oh, oh, AHH!
I got enough and I'm getting hot
I jumped up a rocket high
Oh yeah, but you better relax
I don't want something new rockin' in my head. (oh yeah, in my head)
Something (oh yeah, in my bed)
Baby, I'm alone in my room (shooting up some glue)
I'm still crazy for youEmbed
