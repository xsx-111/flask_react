The Plan LyricsThe plan keeps coming up again
And the plan means nothing stays the same
But the plan won't accomplish anything
If it's not implemented
Like it's always been
And it makes me think of everyone
And the cause of this is evident
But the remedy cannot be found
'Cause it's so well hidden

This history lesson
Doesn't make any sense
In any less than
Ten thousand year increments
Of common sense
Common sense
Common sense
Common sense
