Forget Remember When LyricsFor a better tomorrow
Forget remember when
Better not borrow
Memories from them
There's a hole in tomorrow
So forget remember when
History hollow
Carved out by them
Deep enough to fit
All of us in
How much time's wasted on
Words and thoughts I know are wrong
There isn't a choice except to stop
Thinking there isn't a choice
How strange that there's rain
But how could you have knownEmbed
