Virginia Reel Around Fountain LyricsYou told yourself something funny the other day
You said you can't make you laugh
How can that be in your solid state?
How can that be in your solid state?
Don't say no, just say you don't know
How can that be in your solid state?
As you make it unreal
I'm reeling around the fountain
I'm reeling around the fountain
I still confide in you almost every day
Even though you're not around
How can that be in your solid state?
How can that be in your solid state?
Don't say no, just say you don't knowEmbed
