Stop the Show LyricsYou don't tell me anything
It's not a dream, it's not a big lie
You're not going anywhere
You don't care, you think that's fine
You don't owe me anything
The offering is already mine
Your best friend is everywhere
They don't care, they think you're slime
You don't even know
What it means to
Take your own advice and then
Expect me to look surprised
After a while, you know the style and that's enough to know they suck
And when you know to stop the show because they know you know
I know it's sad but don't feel bad, they knew they had it coming
After a while, it hurts to smile and if you laugh, it's just a two-fold miracle1Embed
