Car LyricsYou get the car, I'll get the night off
You'll get the chance to take the world apart
And figure out how it works
Don't let me know what you find out
I need a car, you need a guide, who needs a map?
If I don't die or worse, I'm gonna need a nap
At best I'll be asleep when you get back
I wanna see it
When you find out what comets, stars, and moons are all about
I wanna see their
Faces turn to backs of heads and slowly get smaller
I wanna see it now
I wanna see it now
I want specifics on the general idea
I wanna think what I should know
Want you to do me what to show
I wanna see movies of my dreams
I wanna see movies of my dreams
I wanna see movies of my dreams
I wanna see movies of my dreams
I wanna see it
When you get stoned on a cloudy breezy desert afternoon
I wanna see it
Untame itself and break its owner
I wanna see it now
I wanna see it now6Embed
