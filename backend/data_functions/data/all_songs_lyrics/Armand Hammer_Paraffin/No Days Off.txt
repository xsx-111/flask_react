No Days Off Lyrics
Grapes sour, ask after the vintage
The loud grows louder, feel like the sorcerer's apprentice
Out your depth, this something you can't finish
Signed guest list Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith
Nobody blink they don't know who the fuck that is
Don't come through talking crazy I'm babysitting my ex's kid
She only wanna know what time breakfast is
Then snacks, trust, you don't want none of that
(You don't want none of that, tough guy)
She won't listen to a word you say
Onion powder only thing on they spice rack
But cats act like Quinton on his way
Gladys Knight's good old days (talk about 'em)
They said they still selling that same kilo of cocaine
Way I see it, we all sell pain
She a hoe, she a pro, she got all type of different names
Dance like I'm in leg and waist chains
Stepped on the rage, lust, fear, hate
Whip the mix 'til the base levitate
On the sixth day my father looked and should've been dismayed
Maybe go ahead and come in on Sunday, I'm just saying
No disrespect, I'm just saying
I'm just saying
No days off
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat, you don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat, you don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat, you don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat, you don't work you don't eat

That's problematic in itself, I called out
Thinking about my barriers to wealth, and it's clear
Rising and grinding couldn't help
Wasn't seen, wasn't felt
An honest day's overrated
Broke on payday
They still kicking it, watch and pray
Wait till something changes
But the Marshall's at the door with lock breakers
I've got grips on the stone tendrils of smoking the alcove home
They finna built the next prison in the south pole
This ain't the righteous way to go
Let me get your supervisor on the phone
Late stage capital shooting down the living wage
Caveman figure rational
Castles with eyes in the sky
Claiming both the proud and the wise
Normalize us with the fuckshit
The corporation they must trust
I'll get that for you no rush
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat, you don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat, you don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat
You don't work you don't eat, you don't work you don't eat2Embed
