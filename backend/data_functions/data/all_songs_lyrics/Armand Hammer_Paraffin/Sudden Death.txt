Sudden Death LyricsWhooooooooaaaa (some kind of sudden death)
Whooooooooaaaa (some kind of sudden death)
Whooooooooaaaa (some kind of sudden death)
Whooooooooaaaa

When that car note due, she call you
Jezebel wasn't born with the silver spoon
And you hard thinking about that too
Anansi lured the moon down amongst the dubious dunes
Dark like the womb
Rooms inside wombs
Inside wombs
Inside rooms
Duck-taped Montezuma
Looking for Cuba
Truck jewels, Rick the Ruler
Spanish peculiar off a couple rulers
Lifted the devil's diary
Eloquent no false piety
Piles of raw ivory
Pius V watching the priory
The dead arm never tires, b
Not entirely

Still waters beneath the tower of Babel
All info on a need-to-know
Give never more than he have to
We wasn't there
Figured it was better left unsaid
Mum's the word
Familiarity preferred
Wrong words get you clapped in the head
It's only snitching if you was riding dirty wit' em
Cursory, details murky
The nerve b
Tongue untied what's the deal?
Deemed more worthy
Burly
High alert
Don't ask
Who, what or why it work
Hot-wire reverse
Before fear bring fire first
How to hurt
Dying of secrets
Trauma repeated
Make sure when they show you who you are
You believe 'em
A child don't act this way without a reason
What's a beating worth if they don't understand the meaning
Threats and promise keeping
Shut the fuck up
When you get around adults who speakin'
Weighing heavy
Stress pressure, diabetes
Set free
Don't let the devil get greedy
All seeing eye
Filmed the B-league
Grunts, snarls, and spittle they greet me
Baring teeth
Leave me leakin'1Embed
