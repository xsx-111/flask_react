Black Garlic Lyrics
Pleased to see tree up to his standards
Makavelli grand oil on canvas
Veritable parade of private dancers
Yet the black hole grow like cancer
Packed snow, tracks like panzers
By the end the feds was the Panthers
Count ya dead by the swing of a lantern
Don't even ask you don't wanna know the answer

Abuse of power comes as no surprise
Clappin' at the read out from the other other side of time
He who maneuver through the flowers when the sky rip
Free black mommas' fuck talk cause she a flight risk
Kill 'em in the saga scribe the ??? side-kick
I advise you not to try this
Do not

Of course its a drag
But you go to war with the army you have
Steely Dan, Leadbelly, iron flag
Raw all ran em off like slag
God looked in his glass
The Devil seen, said "I need half"
I laughed, you must be mad! (You mad)
Out ya damn mind
Watch her wise up, she winds up
Move the post, still see the goal line though
Mid 90s flow
Bokeem Woodbine in the liner notes
DJ Vlad big boss at the end of the internet
Whitesplainin' Uncle Tom preachers to disinterested black women
Rootless rap a Caesar in a plane
Lil Wayne acoustic cover of Sign of the Times
All cap, lemon pepperish wing
Exclamation on a rod, I did all inside
The times you denied me
Loungin' between two pillars of ivory in the garden
Don't move, not a problem
Revelation in 1080p
Worldstar number when you see me don't speak
Legalese is designed to overwhelm you
Legalese is designed to overwhelm you
Legalese is designed to overwhelm you
Scrape ya face to this
Smell heaven
Billionaire rapper with remedial economic analysis
Fuck I know I used to rap for pork chop sammiches
Black animus banished to the east
Hammers for the meek
Stay the fuck from police2Embed
