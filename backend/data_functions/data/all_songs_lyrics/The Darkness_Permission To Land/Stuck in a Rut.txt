Stuck in a Rut Lyrics
Well, kiss my ass, kiss my ass goodbye
Propelled by a carriage of aluminium, am I
No more to rot in this sty
I'd turn my back on this shit-hole in the blink of an eye, ow!

Gimme the keys
You ain’t gonna see me for dust
The Barnby Bends ain't gonna get the better of me
Oh, gimme the keys
To any old bucket of rust
Acle Straight gonna take me to where I wanna be

Stuck in a rut
Stuck in a rut for eternity
Stuck in a rut
Stuck in a rut for eternity, yeah

Well, the road is long, and the lights are bright
Just 'cause you've lived here all your life, doesn't make it alright
And the golden mile is paved with shite
Don't mind telling you
I'm sick of walking up and down it, every single fucking night
Just gimme the keys
You ain’t gonna see me for dust
The Barnby Bends ain't gonna get the better of me
Oh, gimme the keys
To any old bucket of rust
Acle Straight gonna take me to where I wanna be, yeah yeah

Stuck in a rut
Stuck in a rut for eternity, ow!
Stuck in a rut
Stuck in a rut for eternity, yeah

Master?
Kill me, Master, kill me
Ooh, thank you, Master
Thank you, Master


Stuck in a rut
Stuck in a rut for eternity, oh
Stuck in a rut
Stuck in a rut for eternity, yeah-owEmbed
