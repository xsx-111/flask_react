Get Your Hands Off My Woman Lyrics
Ooooh ow!

You are drunk and you are surly
In Latino lover mode
We all know what's on your agenda
Yeah, we've broken the code

Oh, I've got no right to lay claim to her frame
She's not my possession
You cunt
Yeah!

Get your hands off of my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off of my woman, motherfucker
Yeah!

Octoped, you've got six hands too many
And you can't keep them to yourself
You're too fat and too old to marry
So they left you on the shelf
Oh, I've got the right to lay claim to her frame
But you soiled my obsession
You cunt
Yeah!

Get your hands off of my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off of my woman, motherfucker
Yeah!
Ow!

Get your hands off of my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off of my woman, motherfucker
Ow!
Get your hands off of my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off of my woman, motherfuckerEmbed
