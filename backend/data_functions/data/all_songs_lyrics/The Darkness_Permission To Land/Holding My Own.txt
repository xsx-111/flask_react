Holding My Own LyricsOoh
On my own

Baby, everything is falling into place
Oh, my life is so exciting, now, I've got my space
Like a splash of water on my face, ooh
Lately, I'm doing what I can to pleasure me
Oh, I'm finding time to focus on my fantasies
I'm satisfied in my own company, ooh

I don't need your permission
To take this matter in my own two hands

'Cause I'm holding my own
Give or take a tear or two, yeah
I'm holding my own
No matter what I put myself through, oo ooo ooh

Lady, all we seem to do is talk about
Ah, we take apart and analyse our ins-and-outs
Honey, I would rather do without, yeah
No-one to answer to
I won't spend another lifetime begging you

'Cause I'm holding my own
Give or take a tear or two, yeah
I'm holding my own
No matter what I put myself through
I'm holding my own
Ooh


There's a spring in my stride
There's a twinkle in my dying eyes

'Cause I'm holding my own
Give or take a tear or two, yeah
I'm holding my own
No matter what I put myself through
Ooow ooo ooooEmbed
