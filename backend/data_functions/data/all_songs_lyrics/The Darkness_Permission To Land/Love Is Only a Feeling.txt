Love Is Only a Feeling Lyrics
Oh, the first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met
And I knew that to you, and into your life, I had to get
Oh, I felt light-headed at the touch of this stranger's hand
An assault my defenses systematically failed to withstand

'Cause you came at a time
When the pursuit of one true love, in which to fall
Was the be-all and end-all

Love is only a feeling (Drifting away)
When I'm in your arms, I start believing (It's here to stay)
But, love is only a feeling, anyway

Oh, the state of elation that this unison of hearts achieved
I had seen, I had touched, I had tasted, and I truly believed

That the light of my life
Would tear a hole right through each cloud that scudded by
(Each cloud that scudded by)
Just to beam on you and I
Love is only a feeling (Drifting away)
When I'm in your arms, I start believing (It's here to stay)
But, love is only a feeling, anyway
Anyway


Love is only a feeling (Drifting away)
And we've got to stop ourselves believing (It's here to stay)
'Cause love is only a feeling, anyway
