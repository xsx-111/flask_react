And a glance beckoned the immediate loss of a cherished one
Ooh, it was the coming of the

(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck)
That dog don't give a fuck
Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck)
That dog don't give a fuck

(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck

That dog don't give a fuck
Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck

(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck)
That dog don't give a fuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck)
That dog don't give a fuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck) Black Shuck
(Black Shuck)
That dog don't give a fuck
Woof!Embed
