Growing on Me Lyrics
Go!

I can't get rid of you
I don't know what to do
I don't even know who is growing on who
Yeah-yeah
'Cause everywhere I go, you're there
I can't get you out of my hair
I can't pretend that I don't care
It's not fair

I'm being punished for all my offences
I want to touch you, but I'm afraid of the consequences
I want to banish you from whence you came
But you're part of me now, and I've only got myself to blame

You're really growing on me (Or am I growing on you?)
You're really growing on me (Or am I growing on you?)
Any fool can see

Sleepin' in an empty bed
I can't get you off my head
And I won't have a life until you're dead
Yeah, you heard what I said
I wanna shake you off, but you just won't go, oh
And you're all over me, but I don't want anyone to know
That you're attached to me, that's how you've grown
Won't you leave me, leave me, leave me alone?

You're really growing on me (Or am I growing on you?)
You're really growing on me (Or am I growing on you?)
Any fool can see


You're really growing on me (Or am I growing on you?)
You're really growing on me (Or am I growing on you?)
OoooohhhEmbed
