Friday Night Lyrics
Hey you, do you remember me?
I used to sit next to you at school
And we indulged in all the extracurricular activities
We weren't particularly cool

Oh, Monday, cycling
Tuesday, gymnastics
Dancing on a Friday night
I got Bridge Club on Wednesday
Archery on Thursday
Dancing on a Friday night

Hey you, could you ever fall for me
Oh, the way I fell for you?
And do you dwell upon the thoughts that I occupy
Or do you give yourself things to do?

Oh, Monday, rowing
Tuesday, badminton
Dancing on a Friday night
I got ping pong on Wednesday
Needlework on Thursday
Dancing on a Friday night
With you, you, rowr
Ow!
Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday
Dancing on a Friday night
Let the music smother me
Whole weekend recovery
Dancing on a Friday night
Oh, see the lady I adore
Dancing on the dancing floor
Dancing on a Friday night
God, the way she moves, moves me
To write bad poetry
Dancing on a Friday night, ooh
Ow!
Ow
Friday nightEmbed
