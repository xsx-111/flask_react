Love on the Rocks with No Ice Lyrics
You can't abide my showing fatigue
When you come home just to relay
All the events that made your heart bleed
And the ones that ruined your day

We're not as close
As everybody thinks
In the eye of the storm
Oh, we keep each other warm

Love on the rocks
You'd do anything for a quiet life
Love on the rocks
Love on the rocks with no ice
Love on the rocks
You'd do anything for a quiet life
Love on the rocks
Love on the rocks with no ice
Huh!


So many issues we should address
'Cause our lives just don't correlate
All the emotions that we suppress
Bite our tongues until it's too late
We're not as close as we always used to be
Oh, you and me
In the eye of the storm
Oh, we keep each other warm

Love on the rocks
You'd do anything for a quiet life
Love on the rocks
Love on the rocks with no ice
Love on the rocks
You'd do anything for a quiet life
Love on the rocks
Love on the rocks with no ice
Ow!


Love on the rocks
You'd do anything for a quiet life
Love on the rocks
Love on the rocks with no ice
Love on the rocks
You'd do anything for a quiet life
Love on the rocks
Love on the rocks with no ice
