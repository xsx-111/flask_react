Fight LyricsWe wake up different, rifle through our dreams
Another placid day, ripples at the seams
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
So tangle minded then so becalmed
It's all so subway grim and then it's gone
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
Oh go ahead and fight
We get so weary, taking fish off hooks
It's not as effortless as it may look
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
Oh fight
We lay down seething, smell our pillows burn
And drift off to the place where you'd think we'd learn
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
Do you think I bow out 'cause I think you're right?
Or 'cause I don't want to fight?
Oh go ahead and fight
I said, "I give"
I said, "I give"
I said, "I give"Embed
