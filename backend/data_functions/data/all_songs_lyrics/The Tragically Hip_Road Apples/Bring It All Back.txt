Bring It All Back LyricsI'd been carving you
To see what form you'd take
You were hiding in ivory
I just wanted to free your shape
Bringing me down
It's too quiet to breathe
Who wants to hear their heart
Beat
It's got to be here
In your spiderweb alphabets
Did I read it all wrong?
Have I just not gotten it yet?
You got what you want
You wanted release
Can you be appeased?
Can you bring it all back to me
Bring it all back to me
Bringing me down
The obvious turns out to be true
And all that I couldn't see
How it was turning me on
Oh I don't want to pare you down
Oh I don't want to wear you down
I don't want any more than what's there
Oh I don't want to pare you down
Well, you got what you want
You wanted release
Can you be appeased?
Can you bring it all back to me
Bring it all back to me
Just bring it all back to me
It's all that I want
It's all that I need
It's all that I want
Just bring it all back to me
Bring it
Give it
