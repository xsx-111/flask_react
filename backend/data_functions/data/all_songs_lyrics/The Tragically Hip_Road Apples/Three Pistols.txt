Three Pistols Lyrics
Well, Tom Thomson came paddling past
I'm pretty sure it was him
And he spoke softly in accordance to the
Growing of the dim
He said, "I'll bring on a brand new renaissance
Because I think I'm ready
When I was shaking all night long
But my hands were steady"

And three pistols came (yeah, sweep them all away)
And three people went on their way
Three pistols strong
And three people spent

Well, he found his little, lonely love
His bride of the northern wood
But she took me to the opera house
Like he said she would
Then she sighed and she fell from the balcony
Shakespeare's bent to touch
She never had any time for me
Because I didn't protest enough
And three pistols came (yeah, sweep them all away)
And three people went on their way
Two pistols strong
And three people spent

Well, little girls come on Remembrance Day
Placing flowers on his grave
She waits in the shadows until after dark
Just to sweep them all away
I say, bring on a brand new renaissance
Because I think I'm ready
Well, I've been shaking all night long
But my hands are steady

And three pistols came (yeah, sweep them all away)
And three people went on their way
Three pistols strong
And three people spent
And three pistols came (yeah, sweep them all away)
And three people went on their way
One pistol strong
And three people spent1Embed
