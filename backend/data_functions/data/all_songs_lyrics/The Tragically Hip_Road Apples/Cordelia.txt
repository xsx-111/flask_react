Cordelia LyricsAngst on the planks, spitting from a bridge
Just to see how far down it really is
Robbing a bank, jumping from a train
Old antiques a man alone can entertain
It takes all your power
To prove that you don't care
I'm not Cordelia
I will not be there
I will not be there
I will not be there
Tin can man, dragging from a car
Just to see how alive you really are
Marrying words, falling in your wake
Just to tell what you can't eliminate
It takes all your power
To prove that you don't care
I'm not Cordelia
I will not be there
Treading the boards, screaming out Macbeth
Just to see how much bad luck you really get
Jump in the ring with your hidden cape
The bull can't decide what it is that he really hates
It takes all your power
To prove that you don't care
I'm not Cordelia
I will not be there
I will not be there
I will not be there
Angst on the planks, spitting from a bridge
Just to see how far down it really is
Robbing a bank, jumping from a train
Old antiques a man alone can entertain
It takes all your power
To prove that you don't care
I'm not Cordelia
I will not be there
I will not be there
I will not be there
Thief lingers on, on his hands and knees
Must be one more thing here I really need
Die in your dreams, falling on your knife
A thief blinded on the job has to steal for life
It takes all your power
To prove that you don't care
I'm not Cordelia
I will not be there
I will not be there
I will not be there
I will not be thereEmbed
