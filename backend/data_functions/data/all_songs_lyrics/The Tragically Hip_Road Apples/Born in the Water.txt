Born in the Water LyricsRolling hills all covered in suede
I'm heat nervous and out of road
Downtown there's a parade
But I don't think I want to go
Smart as trees in Sault Saint Marie
I can speak my mother tongue
Passing laws, just because
And singing songs Of the English unsung
Well, how could you do it?
Well, how could you even try?
When you were born in the water
And you were raised up in the sky?
Front seat stamped by the window
No erasees in this game
Arbitrary as the wind blows
It's another way to lay claim
Ain't no cause for bloodthirsting
In a little town so dry
Where the angels dance on a pinhead
Just to make room for you and I
Well, how could you do it?
Well, how could you even try?
When you were born in the water
And you were raised up in the sky?
Thoroughbred with their great big heads
Think a mile might be too far
Highway horses laugh but of course
When they don't know where the hell they are
Well, smart as trees in Sault Saint Marie
Victorious mother tounge
Passing laws just because
And singing songs of the English unsung
Well, how could you do it?
Well, how could you even try?
When you were born in the water
And you were raised up
Well, how could you do it?
Well, how could you even try?
When you were born in the water
And you were raised up in the sky?Embed
