The Last of the Unplucked Gems LyricsViolins and tambourines
And this is what we think they mean
It's hard to say, it's sad but true
I'm kind of dumb and so are you
When the mystique varies thus
You can send a man to bury us
It's hard to say, it's sad but true
I'm kind of dumb and so are you
The last of the unplucked gems
The last of the unplucked gems
The last of the unplucked gemsEmbed
