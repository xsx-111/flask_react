Atheist Peace Lyrics
Maybe it's too late for intellectual debate
But a residue of confusion remains
Oh, changing with the times
And developmentally tortured minds
Are the average citizen's sources of pain, yeah

Tell me what we're fighting for!
I don't remember anymore
Only temporary reprieve
And the world might cease
If we fail to tame the beast
From the faith that you release
Comes an atheist peace

Woah, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, atheist peace

Political forces rent
Bitter cold winds of discontent
And the modern age emerged triumphantly
But now, it seems we've stalled
And it's time to de-evolve
And relive the dark chapters of history, yeah
Tell me what we're fighting for!
What progress ever came from war?
Only a false sense of increase
And the world won't wait
For the truth upon a plate
But we're ready now to feast
On an atheist peace

Oh, oh-ho, oh-oh, yeah
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ha, atheist peace1Embed
