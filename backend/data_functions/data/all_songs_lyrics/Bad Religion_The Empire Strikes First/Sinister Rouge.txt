Sinister Rouge Lyrics
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

Innocents burned alive on the stake
Tortured and dumped in nameless graves
Centuries waned, authority died
Scattering seeds of ancient lies

Sinister rouge coming back for more
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) To even the score
Sinister rouge coming back for more
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) To even the score

Child molesters and Jesuits
Holding secret conference
Underneath the Pontiff's nose
And only God will ever know

Sinister rouge coming back for more
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) To even the score
Sinister rouge coming back for more
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) To even the score
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

Give us this day, our daily bread
Your legacy, we'll not forget
Lick the wounds, cleanse the land
The modern world rejects your hand

Sinister rouge coming back for more
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) To even the score
Sinister rouge coming back for more
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) To even the score

Sinister rouge, sinister rouge
Sinister rouge, sinister rouge
Sinister rouge, sinister rouge
(Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
The nightmare comes in sinister rougeEmbed
