Boot Stamping on a Human Face Forever Lyrics
"Drop dead, it doesn't matter," she said
"It only hurts when I laugh," she said
Sometimes, it's never a crime
To spend the day in bed
She made certain that the curtains were red
To dream better by the light they would shed
She leaned back, tilted her head
And this is what she said:

"You can't win! Think it over again
I can't win! Look at the trouble I'm in
We can't win! And we're stuck here together
Yeah, I hope it will last forever"

"Don't ever dare to hope," he said
"So I'll never let down too bad
I know thereâ€™s nowhere to go
So I'll just stay here instead"
He knew better than to pull on a thread
They unravel like the thoughts in his head
He looked out, it filled him with dread
And this is what he said"
"You can't win! Think it over again
I can't win! Look at the trouble I'm in
We can't win! And we're stuck here together
Yeah, I hope it will last forever"


With good books and looks on their side
And hearts bursting with national pride
They sang songs that went along for the ride
And the other side complied
They said, "Hey, man, where do you reside?"
And "Could it be Mother Superior lied?"
And "Is it possible too many have died?"
It's only natural to reply:

"You can't win! Think it over again
I can't win! Look at the trouble I'm in
We can't win! And we're stuck here together
Yeah, I hope it will last forever"Embed
