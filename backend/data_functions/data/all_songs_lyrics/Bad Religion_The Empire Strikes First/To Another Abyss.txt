To Another Abyss Lyrics
Not long ago, and yet the image is so vague
I hesitate to label it a memory
There was a show of local color, and I felt astray
'Cause I had nothing to offer but insufficiency

And you know that it's a bitch when you learn to scratch that itch
A blatant fallibility, sooner to some, but eventually
All gets pointed in the same direction while the human masses and their vague conceptions
Obliterate each other with impunity, and you wonder what's in this for me

To another abyss, to no avail
The search is bound to fail
To another abyss, to no avail
So long ago, I set sail
And it chills me to the bone
That I'm so far away from home
To another abyss

So what should I do now? What should I celebrate
Given finite means and a penchant to depreciate?
How can I still avow and depend upon a state
That cares nothing for my happiness, welfare, or fate?
And I know I can't explain the commotion in my brain
Like a terrifying reality, deconstructed but inadequately
All gets pointed in the same direction while the human masses and their vague conceptions
Obliterate each other with impunity and release the weight of history

To another abyss, to no avail
The search is bound to fail
To another abyss, to no avail
So long ago, I set sail
And it chills me to the bone
That I'm so far away from home
To another abyss

So long ago, so long ago
Oh, I set sail
And I'm struggling on the way
And I'm waiting for the day (To another abyss)
And I'm looking for the way back home (To another abyss)
So far away (To another abyss)
So far away (To another abyss)
To another abyss, so far away (To another abyss)
To another abyss (To another abyss)
So far away (To another abyss)Embed
