All There Is Lyrics
This song goes out
To all the hopeless sinners
With grave allegiances
So meaningless and vain
The walking wounded
In a pageant of contenders
Who balance on a rail of pain
For just a pail of rain

And everything is barely mist
Blood relations and bricks
My expression (Whoa-oh)
My confession (Whoa-oh)
Add it up (Whoa-oh)
Extract a lesson (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
More than this, once again
Like a bullet, as a friend
Tell me, can that be all there is?

In my rectory of doubt
I kneel to pray like one devout
As time, the great gray dreamless sleep of
A useless modern God
Erodes away each storied day as
Wretched Adams with hell to pay
Contend upon a rail of pain
For just a little rain
And everything is barely mist
Blood relations and bricks
My expression (Whoa-oh)
My confession (Whoa-oh)
Add it up (Whoa-oh)
Extract a lesson (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
More than this, once again
Like a bullet, as a friend
Tell me, can that be all there is?


There's an endless disposition
And it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
There's space for a paper airplane race
In the eye of a hurricane
And if pigs could fly, then surely so could I
But this pedestrian knows better than to even try
And my divinity is caught between the colors of a butterfly

And everything is barely mist
Blood relations and bricks
My expression (Whoa-oh)
My confession (Whoa-oh)
Add it up (Whoa-oh)
Extract a lesson (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
More than this, once again
Like a bullet, as a friend
Tell me, can that be all there is?
