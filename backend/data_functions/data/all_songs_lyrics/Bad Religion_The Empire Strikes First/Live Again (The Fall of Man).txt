Live Again (The Fall of Man) Lyrics
The road is narrow, the horizon wide
And to say what's waiting on the other side
Is so rewarding and the ultimate prize
But what good is something if you can't have it until you die?

Desperate, tenacious, clinging like a grain of sand
Watching its foundation wash away, wash away
Drunk with the assertions they know they can't defend
Confident that they might live again

Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?
Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?

Temptation? Revelation? You decide
Torture shows its colors often in disguise
Progress and purpose help us realize
We pass along a brighter faith even though it must be blind

Desperate, tenacious clinging like a grain of sand
Watching its foundation wash away, wash away
Drunk with the assertions they know they can't defend
Confident that they might live again
Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?
Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?

Let's go!


Desperate, tenacious clinging like a grain of sand
Watching its foundation wash away, wash away, yeah
Drunk with the assertions they know they can't defend
Confident that they might live again

Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?
Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?
Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?
Live again, live again
Would you give it all up to live again?Embed
