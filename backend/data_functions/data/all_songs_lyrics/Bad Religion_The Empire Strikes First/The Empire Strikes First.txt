The Empire Strikes First Lyrics
We strike first
And we're unrehearsed
Here we go again to stage the greatest show on heaven and earth
Come on, get your money's worth

Don't wanna live (Can't live)
Don't wanna give (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E (Can't live)
Don't wanna live (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E

We're coming on fast
And we're built to last
We stumbled once in 'Nam, now we're glad to finally say those days have passed
Tell me, how long can it last?

Don't wanna live (Can't live)
Don't wanna give (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E (Can't live)
Don't wanna live (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E
We just started out
You don't need to be afraid
Yeah, you deserve two minutes' hate


Well, we spit and we cursed
And our bleeding hearts burst
But even ten million souls marching in February couldn't stop the worst
C-c-c-couldn't reverse

Don't wanna live (Can't live)
Don't wanna give (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E (Can't live)
Don't wanna live (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E

Can't give (Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E)
Don't wanna live (Can't live)
Don't wanna live (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E)
I can't live if living is with you (E-M-P-I-R-E)
Can't give (Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E)
Don't wanna live (Can't live)
Don't wanna live (Can't give)
Don't wanna be (Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E)1Embed
