Beyond Electric Dreams Lyrics
Here we go, now!

No one here can show you where it is, but I can point to a sign
On the roof of the world without apparent design
The frozen definition of a lunatic ambition to rise
The air is thin, the future is dim, dimension hard to find

Up on a mountain
Encased in solar rays
Beyond electric dreams
Of inarticulate passion plays
Coming down a mountain
Eons of a human reign
The conversation of impassive planets
Intercepted by the human being

Ratiocination is a practicable way to derive
An attitude of altitude and probity by which to abide
Or maybe a theophany of flaming creosote in disguise
The air is thin, the future is dim, dimension's undefined

Up on a mountain
Encased in solar rays
Beyond electric dreams
Of inarticulate passion plays
Coming down a mountain
Eons of a human reign
The conversation of impassive planets
Intercepted by a human being
Fear glaring cold in the crystalline geometry of night
Obscuring form and tracing faceless fears of a superhuman immensity
In a patch of sand, or a raptor's guileless, shivering intensity
I'm only a visitor, an atom of atoms
On a jutting, red-spattered synagogue of granite
As it crouches, literally, in space
A frozen, amoral giant gazing heavenward forever

Let's go where the raptor goes
To the mountain in a cosmic glow
We'll have a genuine terrestrial show
On a mountain, on a mountain
Let's scan the horizon clean
For any trace of human schemes
And try to touch upon immortal themes
On a mountain, on a mountain

Up on a mountain
(Let's go where the raptor goes)
Eons of human reign
(To the mountain in a cosmic glow)
A conversation of impassive planets
(We'll have a genuine terrestrial show)
Intercepted by the human being
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
Up on a mountain
(Let's scan the horizon clean)
Encased in solar rays
(For any trace of human schemes)
Beyond the electric dreams
(And try to touch upon immortal themes)
On a mountain, on a mountain
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
Up on a mountain
(Let's go where the raptor goes)
Eons of human reign
(To the mountain in a cosmic glow)
A conversation of impassive planets
(We'll have a genuine terrestrial show)
Intercepted by a human being
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
Up on a mountain
(Let's scan the horizon clean)
Encased in solar rays
(For any trace of human schemes)
Beyond the electric dreams
(And try to touch upon immortal themes)
On a mountain, on a mountain
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
Up on a mountain
(Let's go where the raptor goes)
Eons of human reign
(To the mountain in a cosmic glow)
A conversation of impassive planets
On a mountain...Embed
