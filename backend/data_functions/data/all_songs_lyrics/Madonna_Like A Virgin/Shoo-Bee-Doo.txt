Shoo-Bee-Doo Lyrics
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la
When I look in your eyes
Baby, here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killin' me

When I look in your eyes
Baby, here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killin' me

Well I can't take it anymore (Take it anymore), baby
Why don't you dry your eyes, try and realize?
Love can open any door (Open any door), and maybe
If you trust in me I can make you see

Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, don't say maybe
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la

I can see you've been hurt before
But don't compare them to me (Don't compare them to me)
Cause I can give so much more
You know you're all I see (You know you're all I see)
Well I can make it on my own (Make it on my own), baby
But I'd rather share all the love that's there
I don't want to be alone (Want to be alone), and maybe
You will see the light, baby, spend the night

Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, don't say maybe
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la
Come here, baby


I can't take it anymore (Take it anymore), baby
Why don't you dry your eyes, try and realize?
Love can open any door (Open any door), and maybe
If you trust in me I can make you see

Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, don't say maybe
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la

(Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo ooh la la)
Come to me, baby
Pretty darling, don't say maybe
(Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo ooh la la)
Come to me, baby
Pretty darling, don't say maybe
(Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo ooh la la)
Come to me, baby
Pretty darling, don't say maybe
(Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo ooh la la)
Come to me, baby, ooh-ooh

Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, babyEmbed
