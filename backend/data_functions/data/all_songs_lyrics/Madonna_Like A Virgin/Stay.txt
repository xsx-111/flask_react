Stay Lyrics
You, you make my life much brighter
You're always on my mind
You, you make my load much lighter
True love is hard to find
Sometimes I feel I have to get away
I change my mind when I look in your eyes
And when those clouds come in
And try to darken our days
I'll always want you to stay

Stay darling
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay darling
(You know you've got to stay)
Stay, stay darling

You saw through my lies and deception
Yeah, I was losing my way
You, you gave my life some direction
And now I'm ready to say
I know there's bound to be some hard times ahead
I'd be a fool to believe
But if you go I'd rather think of dying instead
I never want you to leave
Stay darling
Stay, stay darling
(You know you've got to stay)
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay please, stay darling

When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
True love is so hard to find
Don't be afraid
It's going to be all right
Cause I know that I can make you love me
Love me, love, love, love, love me, love me
When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
True love is so hard to find
I'll always want you to stay

Stay darling
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay please, stay darling
And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop, yeah
Then we can scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop, yeah
Then we can scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop, yeah
Then we can scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop
I want you to stay (Scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
Stay darling
Stay, stay darling (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
Stay, stay darling (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
(You know you've got to stay)
Stay, stay please, stay darling (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
(Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
You know you've got to stay (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
I think about you night and day (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
You know you've got to stay (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
I can make you love me (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
Love me, love me, love me (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
Love me, love me, love me (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
Love me, love me, love me (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)
Lo-lo-lo love me, lo-lo-lo (Scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop)Embed
