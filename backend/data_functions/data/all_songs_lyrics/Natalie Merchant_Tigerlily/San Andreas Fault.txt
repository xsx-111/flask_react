San Andreas Fault Lyrics

Go west, paradise is there
You'll have all that you can eat
Of milk & honey over there
You'll be the brightest star the world has ever seen
Sun-baked, slender heroine of film & magazine

So, go west
Paradise is there
You'll have all that you can eat of milk & honey over there
You'll be the brightest light the world has ever seen
The dizzy height of a jet-set life- you could never dream

Your pale blue eyes, strawberry hair
Lips so sweet
Skin so fair
Your future bright
Beyond compare
It's rags to riches
Over there

San Andreas fault moved its fingers through the ground
Earth divided, plates collided, such an awful sound

San Andreas fault moved its fingers through the ground
Terra cotta shattered, and the walls came tumbling down

Oh, promised land (Oh, promised land)
Oh, wicked ground (Wicked ground)
Build a dream
Tear it down
Oh, promised land (Oh, promised land)
What a wicked ground (What a wicked ground)
Build a dream, watch it all fall down
