Beloved Wife Lyrics
You were the love
For certain of my life
You were simply my beloved wife
I don't know for certain
How I'll live my life
Now alone without my beloved wife
My beloved wife

I can't believe
I've lost the very best of me



You were the love
For certain of my life
For fifty years simply me beloved wife
With another love, I'll never lie again
It's you I can't deny
It's you I can't defy
A depth so deep into my grief
Without my beloved soul
I renounce my life
As my right
Now alone without my beloved wife
My beloved wife 
My love is gone, she suffered long
In hours of pain

My love is gone
Now my suffering begins
My love is gone
Would it be wrong if I should
Surrender all the joy in my life
Go with her tonight?


My love is gone
Would it be wrong if I should
Just turn my face away from the light
Go with her tonight?Embed
