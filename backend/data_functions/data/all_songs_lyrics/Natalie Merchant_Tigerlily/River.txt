River Lyrics
Young and strong, Hollywood son
In the early morning light
This star fell down
On Sunset Boulevard

Young and strong beautiful one
That we embraced so close
Is gone
Was torn away

Let the youth of America mourn
Include him in their prayers
Let his image linger on
Repeat it everywhere

With candles, with flowers
He was one of ours
One of ours

Why don't you let him be?
He's gone
We know
Give his mother and his father peace
Your vulture's candor, your casual slander
You murder his memory
He's gone
We know
It's nothing but a tragedy
(Let the youth of America mourn) Lay to rest your soul and body
Lay beside your name
(Let his image linger on) Lay to rest your rage
Your hunger, and amazing grace

With candles, with flowers
You were one of ours
One of ours

I saw cameras expose your life
I heard rumors explode with lies
I saw children in tears
Cry and crowd around the sight
Of where you had collapsed that day
Where your last breath and word
Had been sighed
Where your heart had burst
And where you had died
Where you had died (Let the youth of America mourn)
Where you had died (Include him in their prayers)
I saw how they were lost in grieving (Let his image linger on)
All half-believing you were gone (Repeat it everywhere)
The loss and pain of it (Let the youth of America mourn)
Crime and the shame of it you were gone (Include him in their prayers)
It was such a nightmare raving (Let the youth of America mourn)
"How could we save him from himself?" (Repeat it everywhere)
I saw how they were lost in grieving (Let the youth of America mourn)
All half-believing you were gone (Include him in their prayers)
The loss and pain of it (Let his image linger on)
Crime and the shame of it you were gone (Repeat it everywhere)
It was such a nightmare raving (Let the youth of America mourn)
"How could we save him from himself?" (Include him in their prayers)2Embed
