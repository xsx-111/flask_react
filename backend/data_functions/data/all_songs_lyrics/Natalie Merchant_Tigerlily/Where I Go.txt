Where I Go Lyrics
Climbing under a barbed wire fence by the railroad ties
Climbing over the old stone wall, I am bound for the riverside
Well, i go over to the river to soothe my mind
To ponder over the crazy days of my life
Just sit and watch the river flow

Find a place on the riverbank where the green rushes grow
See the wind in the willow tree, in the branches hanging low
Well, I go to the river to soothe my mind
To ponder over the crazy days of my life
Watch the river flow
Ease my mind and soul
Where i go

Well, I will go to the river from time to time
Wander over these crazy days in my mind
Watch the river flow
Where the willow branches grow
By the cool rolling waters
Moving gracefully and slow
Ooh child, it's love, it's lovely
Let the river take it all away
The mad pace, the hurry, the hurry that
Troubles, the worries, the worries
Just let the river take them all away
Flow away, flow away
Flow awayEmbed
