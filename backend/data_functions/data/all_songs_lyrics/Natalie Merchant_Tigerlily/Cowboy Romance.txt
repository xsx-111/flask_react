Cowboy Romance Lyrics
It's a saturday afternoon romance
Between a cowboy and a fool
A drunken meet up
In a crude saloon
A poor rocky mountain town
He's a scoundrel and
She's no pearl
Together they are two lovers cruel
Got her balanced on his knee
He knows exactly what to say
"you ain't been born
'til you get out of town
And honey, you might come with me”
If you do−
I'll spare the innocent ones
And take you with me
Together we will be drifters free"
Got her tangled in his arms
She's a lusting, trusting fool
"There's no man born that can rule me
And that i've sworn
But stranger if you do
I'll belong to you”
If you do
“Would you spare the innocent ones
And take me with you?
Can't you love the land
And love me too?"
As he grows sober
Sees his love anew
In the morning light so true
And he gets on the move
On the moveEmbed
