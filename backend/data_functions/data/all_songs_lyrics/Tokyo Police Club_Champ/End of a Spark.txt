End of a Spark LyricsSpend all our Sundays in a row
10 feet from Chinatown, like it's dead
But we know
'Cause when he put you to bed
Your great grandfather always said
'Wasting is an art"
Like the nights we spent in backs of cars
A piece of a part
The end of a spark
A piece of a part
The end of a spark
A spark
Under our bed a monster lives
We fight its teeth with superglue and paperclips
Mark the end of an age
The way that your handwriting changed
You should always pretend
Well you just start and I'll say when
A piece of a part
The end of a spark
A piece of a part
The end of a spark
A spark
When he put you to bed
Your great grandfather always said
"Wasting is an art"
Well it's a good thing that I was young then
I am a gear
I am a spool of thread
As long as my teeth still turn
We will always be newly weds
The end of a spark
A flash in the dark
A piece of a part
It's the end of a spark!
A piece of a part
The end of a spark
A spark
A spark..Embed
