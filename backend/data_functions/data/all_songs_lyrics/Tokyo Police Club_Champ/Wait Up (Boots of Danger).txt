Wait Up (Boots of Danger) LyricsI'm on your team
But I never know when you're not
You never wear shoes without your socks
You never tell anything to me
I'm on your side
But only for a while of course
You never use words you can't afford
A house of cards and it's a sign

So wait up
You never get nervous anymore
So wait up
You never get nervous anymore
What did you want me to say?
Hey!
What did you want me to do?
What did you want me to say?

Inside the lines
Gotta catch 'em in a paper cup
You never know when to change your luck
The sum of everything you like
I'm on your side
So introduce me to your friends
With the music and the lights and everything

It's only on the weekends
Only on the television screens
Always with your girlfriends
Always with the conversations
Making up for lost time
Making it with me
