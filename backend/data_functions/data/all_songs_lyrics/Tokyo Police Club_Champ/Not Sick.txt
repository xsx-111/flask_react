Not Sick LyricsGet comfortable
Get unfrustrated
Get healthy
And all the things that you want
I do, I do, I do not
Fuck with the sure shot
Not serious
About the way that you are
Carolina
Happy belated
Always golden
Still the greatest
Not sensible
I want to marry a dancer
A vegetarian
Who can't stand to be wrong
I do, I do, I do not
Fuck with the sure shot
Not serious
Or taken seriously
Carolina
Happy belated
Always golden
Still the greatest
'Cause it's there
On the tip of your tongue
On the back of your hand
In the place we had it last
You need to be careful
Oh, in a single night
In a single dose
It's the best of the best for me
So what do you need?
What do you need?
What do you need?
Is it a call for an emergency?
So what is it like?
For your song on karaoke night?
Carolina
Happy belated
Always golden
Still the greatestEmbed
