Favourite Colour LyricsThe day that your brother started to talk
Was the day that I found you like that
The national child star in a coat and a scarf
Alone in the laundromat
Now we got the keys to the apartment we share
And we stay up as late as we like
Like KC & Jojo, like Sunny & Cher
You're Tina but I'm not Ike
So tell me what's
Tell me what's your favorite color
Tell me your favorite color
Tell me how's
Tell me how's your younger brother
What grade's he in?
Go back to the rooftops
To the homes in the town
Your brother had started to say
Go back to the rooftops and kick the shingles down
Cause the days and the nights are the same
And the weather complains
Oh, the least you could do is try and act surprised
Try and act alright
But you're here for the chase and next year's a ways away
So tell me what's
Tell me what's your favorite color
Tell me your favorite color
Tell me how's
Tell me how's your younger brother
How's your younger brother?
Tell me what's the first
Very first record you owned
Cause I've got no plans if you don't
No plans if you don't
(7, 8)
Tell me what's
Tell me what's your favorite color
Tell me your favorite color
Tell me how's
Tell me how's your younger brother
How's your younger brother?
Tell me what's the first
Very first record you owned
Cause I've got no plans if you don't
No plans if you don't3Embed
