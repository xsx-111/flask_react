Gone Lyrics
Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast
Where I let my hair down (down)
Out on the beach
Out on the beach
Where I let my ship sail (sail)
Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast
Where I let my hair down (ooh)
Out on the beach
Out on the beach
Where I let my ship sail (ooh)

'Cause I don't know what I want
I don't know what to think with both the curtains drawn
I don't know about you
Tell me something that I'm supposed to do

Runners don't run to me
Runners don't say the same old things
Racers don't bother me
Racers don't say the same old things
But you always do
Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast
Where I let my hair down (down)
Out on the beach
Out on the beach
Where I let my ship sail (sail)


Ooh, gone to the coast
Gone to the coast
Where I let my hair down (down)
Out on the beach
Out on the beach
Where I let my ship sail (sail)

'Cause I don't know what I want
I don't know what to think with both the curtains drawn
But I don't know about you
Tell me something that I'm supposed to do (to do)
