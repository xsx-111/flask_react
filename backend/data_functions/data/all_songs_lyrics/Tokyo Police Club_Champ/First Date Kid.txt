First Date Kid Lyrics
Call it off, keep it in, grind it down to medicine
(Oo oo-oo oo-oo oo-oo)
Especially anything, keep it in your first aid kit
(Oo oo-oo oo-oo oo-oo)
Call it off, keep it in, grind it down to medicine
Especially anything, keep it in your first aid kit

‘Cause lately I’ve been a good news guy
(Yeah) Yes, lately I’ve been a good news guy

Call her up, she stays in, grinding down her medicine
Her specialty’s anything, but lately she’s a first date kid
Call her up, she stays in, grinding down her medicine
Her specialty’s anything, but lately she’s a first date kid
Her specialty’s anything, but lately she’s a first date kid (Especially anything, keep it in your first aid kit)

Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo oo, oo-oo

‘Cause lately I’ve been a good news guy
‘Cause lately I’ve been a good news guy (Hey!)
‘Cause lately I’ve been a good news guy
Call it off, keep it in, grind it down to medicineEmbed
