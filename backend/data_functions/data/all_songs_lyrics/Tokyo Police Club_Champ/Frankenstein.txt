Frankenstein LyricsCatch your breath
Take your time
It's a goldmine
But that's my only crime
That's my only crime
I'm the south
The sugarcane
And I have found a way to celebrate
But that's my only crime
Just gimme the keys and gimme your time
So tell me
It's good to be back
A gold star turns black
Tell me
It's good to be back
A gold star turns black
I see Paris
I see France
I see you making that face again
But that's my only crime
If you wanna make waves
So take your time
The nuclear whim with the fuse of a mile
New and improved
Who is late all the time
Oh, but that's my only crime
So tell me
It's good to be back
A gold star turns black
Tell me
It's good to be back
A gold star turns black
So tell me
You're coming with us
Ten outta ten
An A plus
So tell me
It's good to be back
Turns black
Turns black1Embed
