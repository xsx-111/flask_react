Breakneck Speed Lyrics
Breakneck speed tying up your hands
Cause you're landing back on your feet
You know what I mean

Vowel change
I remember when our voices used to sound the same
Now we just translate

Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet, running
Forest fires underneath your bed

But it's good to be back
Good to be back
Good to be back

Staring out, I always skip the words
Cause all the pictures are so bright and loud
Better off than now
Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet, running
Forest fires underneath your bed

Cause it's good to be back
Good to be back

Super fun
At the movies, drunk and young
Double knots that came undone
But the big bad years are gone
Yeah, the big bad years are done

And gone away
I remember when our voices used to sound the exact same
Now we just translate

Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet, running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back
Good to be back4Embed
