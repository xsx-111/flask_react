Bambi LyricsI wanna tell you there's a really good reason
Why I came home wasted in the middle of the night
A tiny kingdom at the bottom of the trees
Where I was always a winner and I was usually right
You can watch it when you get a bit older
But for now in the bad bits, I should cover your eyes
She painted pictures with the tips of her fingers
Sewing buttons to Bambi, tying strings to a kite

Turning into black and white
Underneath the swinging lights
Barely awake but I still got my stripes
Cause you're the killer with a colored kite
I wanna tell you there's a really good reason
Why I came down easy spinning threads to the throne
A tiny kingdom at the bottom of the trees
Where I was always a winner and I was barely alone

Tangled up, tongue tied
Tell me what to do
Tangled up, tongue-tied
Tell me what to do

Turning into black and white1Embed
