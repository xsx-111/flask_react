Once I Was the Keeper LyricsOnce I was the keeper of a secret surprise
But now it’s gone away
Every time you look into the darks of my eyes
I always look away
'Cause in my mind you don’t know where I live
Though one day your hand will be on my door and you’ll give it a twist
And my heart will stop and I'll lay where I stood
And I hope that you dialed the ambulance as fast as you could
Of course you are a winner and triumph of the town
But all nonsense aside
I'll always be the way that you remember me now
The way that you remember me best
'Cause in my mind you don’t know where I live
But one day your hand will be on my door and you will give it a twist
And my heart will stop and I'll lay where I stood
And I hope that you dialed the ambulance as fast as you could
As fast as you shouldEmbed
