Big Difference LyricsThe quiet kid is coming to stay
What did he say?
He says I'm lonely
Says I'm lonely
I'll tell you everything I know
What do you know?
He says I'm hopeless
Says I'm hopeless
And that's why I can't send you Christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and more exclamation marks
The little king is locked away
Swallowed the key
He says it's alright
But I'm not sorry
I'll tell you everything I saw
What did you see?
A hundred and one
He says it's alright
But I know what I've done

And that's why I can't send you Christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and so
Charmed but destroyed
Opens up the window
Bored and overwhelmed
I was overwhelmed
But that's the best part
That's the best part

Cause I've been taking your advice
Like a Speak and Spell
And I could get to know you better
And never know you well
