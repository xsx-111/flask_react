The Last Of The True Believers LyricsOh, he said it was the sound of the winter callin'
From up around the bend
Or it could be the cry of your restless heart
For the love of your long lost friends
Me, I think it's just the summertime and the heat of these Texas winds
They keep on slappin' my face with dust so thick
That the tears won't roll again
Last of the true believers
Have you grown weary all alone?
You could go home again...home again...home
Last of the true believers
You pack your things and go back home
You could go home again...home again...home
Oh he said, "you can't stay away forever
'cause they say love doesn't last that long
And the ghost of the one that you loved the best is bound to be long gone
So you fall for the one you believe in and take pride in the heart you hold
'Cause when the wintertime pounds upon your door...
It's shelter from the cold"
Last of the true believers
Have you grown weary all alone?
You could go home again...home again...home
Last of the true believers
You pack your things and go back home
You could go home again...home again...home
There's a shadow on our wall where I once stood with him in mind
And there is an empty space beside him
Where I do take my rest at night
Oh, I will be the last of the true believers... if truth is his heart to lend
'Cause the wintertime sure looks cold to me... comin' up around the bend
Last of the true believers
Have you grown weary all alone?
You could go home again...home again...home
Last of the true believers
You pack your things and go back home
You could go home again...home again...home
Oh, I could go home again... home again... home
Well, it looks like home again... home again... home
Oh, I could go home again... home again... home
Well, he brings me home again... home again... home..Embed
