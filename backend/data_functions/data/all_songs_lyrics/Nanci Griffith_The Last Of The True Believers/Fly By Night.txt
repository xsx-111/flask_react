Fly By Night LyricsOh, its just another summer mornin', Baby, somewhere in this town
The heat is rising
Oh, I know where you spent last night so you can stop apologizing
You say that you've been out... just lookin' around this town
I don't wanna know just exactly what you've found
Because tonight I'm goin' out on these streets and watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin'
Don't they fly by night
Yeah tonight I'm goin' out on these streets and watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin'
I'll be standin' on the corner watchin' the men folk go by
I don't wanna touch 'em honey, I'll look them in the eye
And say, "Tonight I am out on these streets to watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin"
Oh, I never put a chain upon your heart or tried to make you walk the
Line for me
Only a fool would want a heart that needs a chain to keep it restin'
Here beside of me
You say you wished I cared what you did with your time
But what's your time is yours and tonight is gonna be mine
And I'm goin' out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
Don't they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
I'm comin' out of your pocket and into my own
I'm gonna have a stonger heart when I round the bend for home
Now I'm goin' out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
Don't they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
I'll be standin' on the corner watchin' the men folk go by
I don't wanna touch 'em honey, I'll look them in the eye
And say, "Tonight I am out on these streets to watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin"
Oh, they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight to watch the lonely hearts go flyin'Embed
