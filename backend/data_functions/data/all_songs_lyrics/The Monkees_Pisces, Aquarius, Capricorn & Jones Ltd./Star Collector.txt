Star Collector Lyrics
(Oh) Hello

Think I'll let her keep on goin'
Wherever it is she's goin' to
Give her my autograph and tell her
"It's been nice knowin' you"

Ha, she's a star collector
(Collector of stars)
She only aims to please
Young celebrities
Yes, she's a star collector
(Collector of stars)
How can I love her
When I just don't respect her?

When everything is goin' my way
She wants to be close at hand
She moves to some other doorway
When things don't go the way she planned

Yes, she's a star collector
(Collector of stars)
She only aims to please
Young celebrities
Yes, she's a star collector
(Collector of stars)
Whoa, it won't take much time
Before I get her off my mind
'Cause she's a star collector
(Collector of stars)
Whoa, she only aims to please
Young celebrities
Yes, she's a star collector
(Collector of stars)
Whoa, it won't take much time
Before I get her off my mind

(Goodbye!)
(Goodbye!)
(Good-bye! Goodbye)
(Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
(Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
(Bye-bye, bye-bye)...1Embed
