Salesman LyricsSalesman, where you gonna go sell
(Salesman)
All of your goods today?
Salesman, gonna walk along the street
(Salesman)
See friends along the way
Whoa, salesman, with your wooden cart
(Salesman)
That you push along while you walk
Hey, salesman, got a little dog
(Salesman)
Whose tail wags when you talk
You always wear a smile
Even though you gotta walk ten miles
Short lifespan, good time salesman
Yep, yep, salesman, walk along the street
(Salesman)
Whether it's hot or cold
It's salesman, well, you work real hard
(Salesman)
Till every pot is sold
Salesman as the years go by
(Salesman)
People changin' every day
Hey, Salesman, till the end of time
(Salesman)
You'll be living in the same way
You always wear a smile
You love it fast and you live wild
Short lifespan but ain't life grand?
Copper kettles, different kinds of tin
There goes salesman and he's sailin' high again
You're sailin' so high, you're sailin' so high
(High, high)
You're sailin' so high, high, high, high
(High, high, high)
Oh, Salesman, where you gonna go sell
(Salesman)
All of your goods today?
Yep, salesman, gonna walk along the street
(Salesman)
See friends along the way
Hey, salesman, with your wooden cart
(Salesman)
(Salesman)
That you push along while you walk
Hey, Salesman, with your secret goods
(Salesman)
That you push while you talk
You always wear a smile
Even though you gotta walk a hundred and ten miles
Short lifespan but the whole thing's grand
Salesman, salesman
(Salesman)
Salesman, salesman
(Salesman, salesman, salesman)
Salesman
(Salesman, salesman, salesman, salesman)Embed
