Words Lyrics
Girl, don't you know everytime I see you smilin'?
Hurts so bad 'cause when I see you, I start trying
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying
Falling in love with you girl is just like dying

Oh, don't walk away
Oh, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away
I can still hear you saying those

Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through

Girl don't you know we can work it out with talkin'?
You won't turn around or slow down your walking
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it
You had to get your kicks outta tryin' to steal it

Now I'm standing here
Strange, strange voices in my ears
I feel the tears
But all I can hear are those
Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through

Oh, I'm standing here
Strange, strange voices in my ears
I feel the tears
But all I can hear are those

Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through

Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through
Words that never were true
Just spoken to help nobody but youEmbed
