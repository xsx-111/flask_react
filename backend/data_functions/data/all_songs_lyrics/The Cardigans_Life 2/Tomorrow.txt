Tomorrow Lyrics
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow

Someone's thinking of her
A fifteen hour trip away
Life is so much slower
Than a charter trip delay

Tomorrow, she won't feel half of this
Tomorrow morning is a sugary kiss
Tomorrow, heavenly no sorrow
She will lose gravity
Tomorrow

Someone's thinking of the her
Through the hazy scenery
Life is blue as water
When you're missing somebody

Tomorrow, she won't feel half of this
Tomorrow morning is a sugary kiss
Tomorrow, heavenly no sorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow, she won't feel half of this
Tomorrow morning is a sugary kiss
Tomorrow, he's on his way darlin'
Tomorrow
