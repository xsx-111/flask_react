Sunday Circus Song Lyrics
He's lonely
Sitting by the mirror
Awakened by the horses
In circles
Running in the circus
His red nose
Looking damaged in the mirror
Cause no one has replaced it
He's dressed now
Ready to make fun of

He loves Sundays
And every place
Where his circus stays
He loves Sundays
(Sundays, Sundays)
He loves Sundays
And every place
Where his circus stays
He loves Sundays
(Sundays, Sundays, Sundays)

He's lonely
He's sitting by the mirror
Still broken
Undressed now
Ready for a new town
He loves Sundays
And every place
Where his circus stays
He loves Sundays
(Sundays, Sundays)
He loves Sundays
And every place
Where his circus stays
He loves Sundays
(Sundays, Sundays, Sundays)

They love his show
Their favorite part
That gives them a laugh
They love his show
Their favorite part
Relaxes their hearts

He loves Sundays
And every place
Where his circus stays
He loves Sundays
(Sundays, Sundays)
He loves Sundays
And every place
Where his circus stays
He loves Sundays
(Sundays, Sundays)
He loves Sundays
He loves Sundays
(Sundays, Sundays, Sundays)Embed
