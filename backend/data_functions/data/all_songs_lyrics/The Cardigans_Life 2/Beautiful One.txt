Beautiful One Lyrics
Rise in the morning
Shine 'til the dawning

Smooth dreams in leaves
Raised in a teacup
Sticked down to sleep
Like an envelope
Filled up with words for you
Wrapped up in curls
Sweet as the summer
Cheek soft as a fur
Grace in a slumber
Beautiful wonderboy

Soft beams from an early sun
On my truly beautiful one
Shimmer from a Saturday sun
On my truly beautiful one

Rise in the morning
Shine 'til the dawning
Right up from sleep
Lost in the blankets
Tasting like salt
Roses an' candy bars
Coffee an' oval cigars
Stretched out to breathe
Down from the rooftops
Sticked down to sleep
Like an envelope
Filled up with words for you

Soft beams from an early sun
On my truly beautiful one
Shimmer from a Saturday sun
On my truly beautiful one

Rise in the morning
Beautiful wonderboyEmbed
