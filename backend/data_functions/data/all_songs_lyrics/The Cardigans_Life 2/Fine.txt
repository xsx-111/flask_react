Fine Lyrics
Upon a roof below the moon
Nearby a park-bench in the sun
Upon the stairway to your room

Why don't you wrap your life around
Those certain words
I just found, I just found
Found, I just found

I wear your golden ring inside
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden ring inside
Suits me very fine

A backseat sofa in the dark
Upon a viewpoint in our town
Nearby a fountain in a park

Why don't you wrap your life around
Those certain words
I just found, I just found
Found, I just found
I wear your golden ring inside
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
Suits me very fine

I wear your golden ring inside
I wear your golden heart in mine
I wear your golden ring inside
And life is very fineEmbed
