Pikebubbles Lyrics
My dad, the best dad that I've had
Don't care about nothing
He's not even working
He's not only my dad
The best friend that I've had
Don't think he's a mad dad

His dad is sleeping with boots on
It makes me start wonder
Cause there is no thunder
According to my dad
Don't think he's a mad dad
It's only some tigers he's got in our shed

My dad, the best dad that I've had
Lies under the table
He's wearing his bathrobe
He's listening to love songs

His dad won't go to the woodshed
Thinks bugs will attack him
According to my dad
It's only some tigers he's got in our shed
He's got in our shedEmbed
