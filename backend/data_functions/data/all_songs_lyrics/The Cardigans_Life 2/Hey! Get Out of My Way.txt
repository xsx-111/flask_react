Hey! Get Out of My Way Lyrics
So I say "Hey!
Get out of my way
Hey! hey! hey!
You've always been in my way"

Listen baby
Thoughts have crossed my mind
And it's clear now
You are not my kind
And I have tried boy
Better ways to say
What I feel now
It seems to plan to stay
But I won't waste a day

So I said "Hey!
Get out of my way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You've always been in my way"
And I say "Hey!
(Hello, goodbye)
Get out of my way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You've always been in my way"
Hear now honey
I'll be good to you
If you stay gone
Far out of my view
I'm sick and tired
Of your dramatic ways
And when I think of
All those wasted days
I shake loose of your laces

And say "Hey!
Get out of my way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You've always been in my way"

This is all that I will say
This is all that I will do
I'm not in love with you!

So I say "Hey!
Get out of my way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, you've always been in my way"
And I say "hey!
(Hello, goodbye)
Get out of my way
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And stay out of my way"Embed
