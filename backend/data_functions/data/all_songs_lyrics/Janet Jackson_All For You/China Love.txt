China Love Lyrics
The energy I see, the silence that you speak
The lust within my dreams, and what it says to me
This full heart of mine, you just can't empty

So come and lay with me, China love
How pleasant life will be, China love
As the sun retires, our love will transpire
Make love to me, China love

I see the sunshine, when I look into your eyes
They speak of worlds gone by, we loved another time
My heart was empty till you came to be

(Baby come inside me)
So come and lay with me, China love
How pleasant life will be, China love
As the sun retires, our love will transpire
Make love to me, China love

China love
China love
(Baby come inside me)
So come and lay with me, China love
How pleasant life would be, China love
As the sun retires, our love will transpire
(Baby come inside me)
So come and lay with me, China love
How pleasant life would be, China love
As the sun retires, our love will transpire

Make love to me, China love
Make love to me, China love
Make love to me, China love2Embed
