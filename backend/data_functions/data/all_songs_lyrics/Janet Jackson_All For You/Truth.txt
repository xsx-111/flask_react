Truth Lyrics
How did I get here?
Think I know what I did
Always worked real hard
Maybe I missed something
I'm not into pointing fingers
Showing who's right or wrong
I just wanna keep it real
'Cause maybe I was doin' fine on my own

Listen, I had a career before, now didn't I?
I had lots of friends before, now didn't I?
And I had my fans before, now didn't I?
And I had my family before, now didn't I?
Guess without you
My little life was nothing
But don't sweat it
Let's say we disagree so
Arguing ain't necessary 'cause
We both have our whole lives left to live
We're both consumed with jealousy
But the truth can set you free

Don't act like you don't know the truth
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let it go, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will be bright 'cause
Truth will set you free
Conversation's deep
When you talk to yourself
There's no way to cheat
'Cause you know you can't be no one else
Won't trip out on disappointment
'Cause failure is just not me
Still I gotta do my job
'Cause you know my show can't go on without me

Listen, I had a career before, now didn't I?
Sold out around the world before, now didn't I?
I had a few hits before, now didn't I?
And danced until my feet were sore, now didn't I?
Guess without you
Oh, my little life was nothing
But don't sweat it
Let's say we disagree so
Arguing ain't necessary 'cause
We both have our whole lives left to live
Guess we're consumed with jealousy
Yeah, but the truth can set you free

Don't act like you don't know the truth
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let it go, ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will be bright 'cause
Truth will set you free
It's hard to believe the love between us is over
It's sad to think we couldn't work it out but
How much is enough to pay for this mistake
Hope your love was sincere

Don't act like you don't know the truth
(Don't act like you don't know the truth, baby)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do
('Cause deep down in your heart you do, you know you do)
Let it go, ooh child
(Let it go, ooh child)
Things are gonna get easier
(Things are gonna get easier)
Ooh child things will be bright 'cause
(Oooh)
Truth will set you free

Don't act like you don't know the truth
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let it go, ooh child
(Ooh, yeah)
Things are gonna get easier
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oooh)
