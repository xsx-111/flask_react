Clouds (Interlude) LyricsJanet: "You tell them Carly"
Carly: "See, Janet and me, we have clouds
Yes, we have our clouds"

Carly: "So many, and so many great formations
Who's this song about?"
Janet: "Don't hurt 'em now"
Carly: "Hallucinations!"
Janet: (Laughs)
Carly: "Clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee"
Janet: "You tell 'em, Carly."Embed
