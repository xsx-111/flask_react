Trust a Try Lyrics
Trust - not an easy thing, you say
Never thought the game of love
This way you'd play
By the things you do
Never thought these things
I would go through with you
Pain trickery and deceit
All the wrongs that you put me through
If you don't wanna say
Still love you anyway
Never do believe my past
When I tried telling you my story
Have no reason, still don't trust me
No, I'm not a cheat or liar

She brought love
She brought joy
She brought what she brought
You thought you'd never see again
She cheats and lied
Made you cry, said goodbye
Body's numb, think you're never gonna feel again
Then what you do now?
You take it slow
Here comes Jo, things go smooth
But drama just around the bend
Don't blame me for jealousies or insecurities
Please see 'cause I wouldn't do that to you
Don't smother me with misery (This place is just killing me!)
(Don't smother me with your pain and misery. Baby, please quit)
Accusing me of polygamy (I feel I'm suffocating!)
(Accusing me of all this polygamy. Oh, can't you see if-)
If not the trust then we have what (It's to ??? for me!)
(Not the trust, baby then we have what? Oh, nothin'. 'Gotta-)
Gotta be strong, oh keep holding on
(Be strong for me please and keep holdin' on. Oh, baby)

Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past
She hurt you bad
Let's start anew
Yes that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong
With this love
Hold on
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease
Baby please trust in me
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try
You got burned
You got bruised
You got
Sure, you got a kick outta that
Unhealthy shit
You said that she
Could please your needs
Whatever it'd be
Still she'd cheat
On her back again for the money
Now learn from it
You grow from it
Get over it
I won't take the blame
So don't
'Cause I ain't having it
'Stead of givin' me
The third degree
That's so mean
Don't push me out the door
I wouldn't do that to you

Don't smother me with misery
(Don't smother me with your pain and misery. Baby, please quit)
Accusing me of polygamy
(Accusing me of all this polygamy. Oh, can't you see if-)
If not the trust then we have what
(Not the trust, baby then we have what? Oh, nothin'. 'Gotta-)
Gotta be strong, oh keep holding on
(Be strong for me please and keep holdin' on. Oh, baby)
Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past
She hurt you bad
Lets start anew
Yes that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong
With this love
Hold on
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease
Baby please trust in me
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try

Trust - ain't an easy thing, you say
Never thought the game of love
This way you'd play
By the things you do
Never thought these things
I would go through with you
Pain, trickery and deceit
All the wrongs that you put me through
Even though I must say
Still love you anyway
Never do believe my words
When I try telling you my story
Have no reason, still don't trust me
No, I'm not a cheat or liar

.... with misery
Accusing me
Of polygamy
If not the trust
Then we have what
Gotta be strong
Oh keep holding on

Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past
She hurt you bad
Lets start anew
Yes that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong
With this love
Hold on
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease
Baby please trust in me
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try
Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past
She hurt you bad
Lets start anew
Yes that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong
With this love
Hold on
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease
Baby please trust in me
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try

But you must give trust a try
But you must give trust a try2Embed
