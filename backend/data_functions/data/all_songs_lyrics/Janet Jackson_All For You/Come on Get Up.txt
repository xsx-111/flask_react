Come on Get Up Lyrics
Jimmy, can you turn the backgrounds up a little bit, please?
I love this

Come on, get up
Come on, get up
Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on get up, baby
So we can dance all through the night

I feel so free
Could it be the way you're lovin' with me
Between the sheets, my mind was tellin' me
Now I see the single life's for me

Never thought I'd be
This crazy for you, baby
Gotta spell on me
It's voodoo
Come and get me off
The way your body moves
It drives me, damn, baby
Now what I wanna see
If you shake that ass for me so
Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on, get up, baby
So we can dance all through the night

I feel alive, and this smile
Because you're on my mind
All the time
Sexually you please
Mentally
I like your style

Never thought I'd be
This crazy for you, baby
Gotta spell on me
It's voodoo
The way your body moves
It drives me, damn, baby
Now what I wanna see
If you shake that ass for me so

Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on, get up, baby
So we can dance all through the night
Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on, get up, baby
So we can dance all through the night
Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on, get up, baby
So we can dance all through the night
Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on, get up, baby
So we can dance all through the night
Let me see you shake it all night
Let me see it move it all night
Wanna see you shake it all night
I've got to see you groovin' on all night
Let me see you shake it all night
Let me see it move it all night
See it little babe all night
I have to see it shake it all night

Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on, get up, baby
So we can dance all through the night

I'm hot in here, jeez
I'm vibratingEmbed
