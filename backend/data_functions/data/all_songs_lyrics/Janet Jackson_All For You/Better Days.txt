Better Days Lyrics
I used to sit and wonder
Would I ever be happy?
Life was so bitter sweet
So many disappointments
Too many ups and downs for me
When you live a nightmare, it's hard to dream

But sometimes life just isn't fair
So why complain nobody cares?
And I don't wanna waste nobody's time
So I'm...

(Papaa papaa paaa)
I'm 'bout to change my vibe
(Papaa papaa paaa)
Today the sun's gonna shine
(Papaa papaa paaa)
'Cause I made up my mind
That today will be the start of better days
(Papaa papaa paaa)
Leavin' old shit behind
(Papaa papaa paaa)
And move on with my life
(Papaa papaa paaa)
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days
Afraid of my reflection
Tell me that's not me I see
That's who I wanna be
Stuck somewhere in the middle
On half full or half empty
Waitin' for somebody to come and rescue me

Can't let that petty attitude
Start to jade my point of view
Only thing it does is bring me down
So I'm...

(Papaa papaa paaa)
I'm 'bout to change my vibe
(Papaa papaa paaa)
Today the sun's gonna shine
(Papaa papaa paaa)
'Cause I made up my mind
That today will be the start of better days
(Papaa papaa paaa)
Leavin' old shit behind
(Papaa papaa paaa)
And move on with my life
(Papaa papaa paaa)
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days

Hurt so many times before
I used to cry but no more
Just let it go and life can feel so good
Stop livin' the blues
Can't let that petty attitude
Start to jade my point of view
Only thing it does is bring me down
So I'm...

(Papaa papaa paaa)
I'm 'bout to change my vibe
(Papaa papaa paaa)
Today the sun's gonna shine
(Papaa papaa paaa)
'Cause I made up my mind
(Papaa papaa paaa)
That today will be the start of better days
(Papaa papaa paaa)
Leavin' old shit behind
(Papaa papaa paaa)
And move on with my life
(Papaa papaa paaa)
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days
I'm 'bout to change my vibe
(Better day, yeah)
Today the sun's gonna shine
(Better day)
'Cause I made up my mind
(Better day yeah)
That today will be the start of better days
(Better day, yeah)
Leavin' old shit behind
(Better days, yeah)
And move on with my life
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days
I'm 'bout to change my vibe
(Day yeah)
Today the sun's gonna shine
(Day yeah)
'Cause I made up my mind
(Day yeah)
That today will be the start of better days
(Day yeah)
Leavin' old shit behind
(Day yeah)
And move on with my life
(Day yeah)7Embed
