2wayforyou (Interlude) Lyrics

Terry, it's saying 'message' but I won't do it...
Okay, wait I got another page, hold on, I just paged that one...
Okay, hold on...
Hold on, guys, I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
You ready?
I'm so sorry...
...so I have something to write...
Yes, I know...
Okay, here we go
And If I can ever...
Ready?
You ready?Embed
