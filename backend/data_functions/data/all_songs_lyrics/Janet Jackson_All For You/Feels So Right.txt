Feels So Right Lyrics
Oh how can it be true, God's gift me and you
And I won't take it for granted
My love for you is strong, with his can't go wrong
I can't believe this feeling

I don't know, so confused, what to do, how bout you
Please don't pull away from me
I don't know, so confused, what to do, feeling you
And in the end you ask me

Feels so right loving you
Feels so right touching you

Touch think wish love, accept this love
Accepting you as you are
Believe in this love and we'll rise above
Thick and thin til the end yeah

I don't know, so confused, what to do, how bout you
Please don't pull away from me
I don't know, so confused, what to do, feeling you
And in the end you ask me
Feels so right loving you
Feels so right touching you
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
Feels so right holding you
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
Feels so right kissing

That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe
That I gotta believe

I don't know, so confused, what to do, how bout you
Please don't pull away from me
I don't know, so confused, what to do, feeling you
And in the end you ask me

Feels so right loving you

Feels so right, some things will never change
I don't know, so confused, what to do, feeling you
