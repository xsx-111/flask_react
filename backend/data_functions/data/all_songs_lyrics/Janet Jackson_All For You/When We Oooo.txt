When We Oooo Lyrics
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh

Hello my love
Wish you were here
So many things in my heart
That I'd like to share
A few warm thoughts
A subtle smile
Our conversation through silence
Could last all night

At ease my mind
To see your face
Those sexy eyes could calm
My heart of rage
You speak my name
I touch your-
The chemistry only true love could understand

You've opened my soul to happiness
And shown me new ways of love
Smooth is life's travels with you beside me
I'll never walk alone
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you

You can give you
All you can give
You've taught me love, life
You taught me to live
At rainbow's end
That pot of gold
Can't hold a light to you
'Cause you're my heart and soul

Such passionate love, the love we make
In tune, our bodies are one
When loving's done, the passion's still strong
'Cause spiritually we are one

Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you
When I ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you
Such passionate love, the love we make
In tune, our bodies are one
When loving's done, the passion's still strong
'Cause spiritually we are as one

Can't get enough of you
Babe, when we ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
I can't get enough of you
When I ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you6Embed
