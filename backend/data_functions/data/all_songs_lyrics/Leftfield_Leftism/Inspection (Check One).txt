Inspection (Check One) Lyrics(Callin' di meek and di humble)
Inspection!
Get ever'ting ship-shape an' shine
Check. Check one
Hot shot! Boom shot - all kind of shot
We don't take dat back, hehehehehehehe
Whatcha doin' here?
No, I won't turn ya out
'member, we don't talk foolishness we talk trut'
Long time wit'out dey a' come for it now
You think tink we'd it done, ya tink we do it all
But hear now
Goin' out to all the wretched souls
Come again
Come again
Check one
Check one
Check, check one
When me come a dance, a tuff me tuff
Some a dem a sey me raggamuffin an' ruff
Come a dancehall an' me must mash it up
Like a dem dynamite man it must blow up
Dancehall nice yes it nicest
Dancehall good an' man it nicest
Dancehall nice man it nicest
Dance ah ah ee-ee
Watch this
Some a dem a come, dem a worry an' fret
Pity dem I no see dem no get nuttin' yet
See me now ask ya why ya see me this oh yet
Them a talk 'bout we when we know your about yet
Yes it's a dread man nuff of dem a fret
As and so them talk man them bound to regret
Put all me advice pon ya component set
Check one
Check one
Check, check one
Mum said live a life of love and love di life you live
Why'd ya kill everything you surely might so give?
Why do some of the minds rob and steal?
My God ain't false, my God is real
Check one
Check, check one
Check one
Check, check one
(Callin' di meek and di humble)
When me come a dance, a tuff me tuff
Some a dem a say me raggamuffin an' ruff
Come a dancehall an' me must mash it up
Like a dem dynamite man it must blow up
Check one
Check, check one
Y'know. Y'know

Check, check one

Check, check one
Check one
