Open Up LyricsBurn, burn
Burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn...
Open up
Now open up
You lied, you faked
You cheated, you changed the stakes
Magnet toss that pie in the sky
Unrehearsed, let the bubbles burst
All in all, a three-ring circus
Of unity with parody
Tragedy or comedy
Probably publicity
Open up, make room for me
Now open up, make room for me
Lose myself inside your schemes
Go for the money, honey
Not the screen
Be a movie star, blah blah blah
Go the whole hog
Be bigger than God
Burn Hollywood burn, taking down Tinseltown
Burn Hollywood burn, burn down to the ground
Burn Hollywood burn, burn Hollywood burn
Take down Tinseltown, burn down to the ground
Down, into the ground
Burn, burn, burn
Burn...Embed
