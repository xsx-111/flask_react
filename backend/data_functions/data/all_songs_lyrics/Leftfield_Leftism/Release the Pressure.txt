Release the Pressure LyricsI've got to stand and fight
In this creation
Vanity, I know
Can't guide I alone
I'm searching to find
A love that lasts all time
I've just got to find
Peace and unity
(Release the pressure)
I've got to stand and fight
In this creation
Vanity, I know
Can't guide I alone
I'm searching to find
A love that lasts all time
I've just got to find
Peace and unity
(Bruin-dah!)
Can you feel it?
Release the pressure!
Can you hear it?
Peace and unity
(Release the pressure)
Build's got this to keep your funky dance sway (eh-heh)
Why your laws have left me
Out of the king and out of the rain
Transalt movement is takin' over
Am I inferior?
Wow...
Eh-wahh!Embed
