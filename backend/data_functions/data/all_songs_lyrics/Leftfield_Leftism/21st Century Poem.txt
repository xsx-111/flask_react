21st Century Poem LyricsHow many bridges can they burn, till we turn?
How many lives can they take, till we break?
How many dreams TERRORIZED, till we rise?
How many visions will they burn, till we learn?
How many homes set alight, till we fight?
How many futures must we dream, till we scream?
How many sins must they repeat, till we're beat?
How many?
How many times?Embed
