Original LyricsSonically we're in control
We're the diamond in your soul
Images come thick and fast
From the future, from the past
The film starts, the film ends
Nothing is said in between
Just sudden moments from someone else's story
Will it ever be the same again?
Hours filled with conversation, no attention paid
Too distracting convention, no need for friends
Will it ever be the same again?
Will it ever be the same again?
You're original, with your own path
You're original, got your own way (x2)
Will it ever be the same again? (x2)
I need to hear that again
Because a dream starts, and a dream must end
My mother told me, don't ever change
You're original, in your own way
My mother told me, don't ever change
You're original, got your own path
You're original (x2)
Will it ever be the same again? (x2)
I need to hear that again
Because a dream starts, and a dream must end
You're original (x5)Embed
