Anne LyricsMy name is Anne, I got a plan
I may lack virtue
But I’m penitent
Ah-ooooh
Ah-ooooh
To lose my mind
It’s never easy
A shadow still
There’s weight to me
Ah-ooooh
Ah-ooooh
J,j,jesus Pieces
Rescue me
The more I try
The more it gets too complicated
J,j,jesus pieces
Rescue me
The more I give up
The more it takes
The more it takes
My name is Anne, I’ll take a stand
I’ll hold my head up dig on in
Ah-oooooooh
You can bait me for the hell of it
I’ll take it for the hell of it
See it there, but it’s too far ahead
Go numb from how bad I want it
See it there but it’s too far ahead
And I hear you calling to me right from here
J,j,jesus Pieces
Rescue me
The more I try
The more it gets too complicated
J,j,jesus pieces
Rescue me
The more I give up
The more it takes
The more it takesEmbed
