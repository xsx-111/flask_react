Shove It LyricsBrooklyn we go hard
We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
We broke but we rich at heart
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
It's our time, put the lights on us
War tactics they make me sick
Reel your heart in run away with it
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Got guns for the strength they lack
So if you know another way
You can't look the other way
If you know another way
Tell them so right to their face
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine (4x)
I pay for what's called
Eccentricity and my will to evolve
I hear them all say
That I got heart
But not everything that it takes
Taint my mind but not my soul
Tell you I got fire
I won't sell it for no payroll
Let 'em hold me down
I know if I know another way
I can't look the other way
I know another way
I'll tell them so right to their face
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine (4x)3Embed
