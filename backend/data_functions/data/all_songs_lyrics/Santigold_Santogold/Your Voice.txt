Your Voice Lyrics
I want to hear your voice
And I won't say
That it's bad when you're far
I want to hear your voice
And I won't say
That I cry when you're gone
I wonder why you are so cold
Why you are so cold
When I know you're on fire
I want to hear your voice and I won't say

That maybe we'll never end up
That maybe we'll never end up

Where you've been now
Does it render you so different
'Cause baby I don't know
What I'll do if you don't want to be here no more
Do you stay, I don't know
But I just want to
I want to hear your voice again
So are you coming, are you coming
Come back to me
I want to be
Where you lay down your robe
But maybe we'll never end up
But maybe we'll never end up

And I won't run out in your way
When you head back home
And I'm gonna heed my mind
Just nod my head
I'm'a leave you to what you know

And maybe we'll never end up
And maybe we'll never end up

But maybe we'll never end up
You run, run, run
You run, run, run
You run, run, run
You run, run, run
I want to hear your voice
Come back to me
I want to be
Where you lay down your robe
I say
But maybe we'll never end up1Embed
