Creator LyricsGot no need for the fancy things
All the attention that it brings
Tell me no, I say yes, I was chosen
And I will deliver the explosion
Can't say it's gonna get me far
Do no good to say what you are
I run the streets and I break up houses
River runs deep and the flame devours it
Me, I'm a Creator
Thrill is to make it up
The rules I break got me a place
Up on the radar
Me, I'm a Taker
Know what the stakes are
Can't roll it back, it's understood
Got to play our cards
Sit tight I know what you are
Mad bright but you ain't no star
Polish up til you make it gleam
Your M.O, I know what you mean
Tail ridin' and I know it's true
While they screamin' I love you
Down deep you know there ain't no flow
A soul decay, was D.O.A
I know what you here for now
Words out you're an idea whore though
Now don't you crush on me
I'll see you in your pipe dreams
Whether or not you know it's true
You're who they dictate to
That shit must hurt real bad
Fakin' what you wish you had
Here all the folks come ask about me
Band wagon, know they used to doubt me
Blind side tend to hit real hard you should heed the warning, get a body guard
Steady friction in this bitch
Creepin' in just like an itch
So far I got the last laugh
Still the rich rise up, still I live fast
Wouldn't know it face to face
Got no soul and got no taste
Moving in speed up the pace
I got it locked though, what a waste All the talk is standard fare
Walk the walk if it gets you there
On the grind til the gig is up
Iâ€™m 'a smash 'em down
Put a muzzle on them like "what!"Embed
