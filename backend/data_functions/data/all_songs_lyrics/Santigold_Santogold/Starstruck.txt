Starstruck LyricsDo it again
And I’ll see you tomorrow
I want to get it
You’ve got something to borrow
Can’t make it feel right on my own
That’s when I turn you on again
I buy it but it don’t measure up
What is the missed ingredient
Chorus:
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away (2x)
Under the skin
It’s not so easy to swallow
Don’t reel me in
To find my dreams are so hollow
What is it you got I don’t get
I watch you fumbling again
Look dreamy behind your cigarette
Know it ain’t true now
Chorus
Oooh wee ooh wee oooh
We all find you easy so amuse us
Don’t get too heady you might abuse luck
You’re starstruck
