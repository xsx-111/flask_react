Unstoppable LyricsI got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don’t lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don’t lie
007 Mission and it’s just one day
I marked my position then I ran away
Got these boots made for walking and some pepper spray
My two guns in my pocket cuz it’s brick today
I said hey Mrs. Parker
Can I get your spot
The block too hot
No parking spots
The joker cops they ticket take my cash
The boys on the block
Got eyes for my ass
Chorus
Last stop Franklin smell it makes me sick
Got my street vision on I don’t see shit
And still I stay fresh I spend the top dollar
Cuz on my block the knockoffs are fiyah
Meet me at the J where they got the Domino game locked
Boy cross the street with tight pants on
Move your hipster ass on down to the Beacon
I fly right past him, don’t take my mask off
Chorus
I got the talk
The beats and bass
Give me one I’ll take it
Make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can’t stop me
In this ra-race
