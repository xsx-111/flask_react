L.E.S. Artistes Lyrics

What I'm searchin' for
To tell it straight, I'm tryin' to build a wall
Walkin' by myself
Down avenues that reek of time to kill
If you see me keep goin'
Be a pass by waver
Build me up, bring me down
Just leave me out you name dropper
Stop tryin' to catch my eye
I see you good you forced faker
Just make it easy
You're my enemy you fast talker

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up (Oh, oh)
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe (Oh, oh)
I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up (Oh, oh)
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

What am I here for?
I left my home to disappear is all
I'm here for myself
Not to know you
I don't need no one else
Fit in so good the hope is that you cannot see me later
You don't know me
I am an introvert an excavator
I'm duckin' out for now
A face in dodgy elevators
Creep up and suddenly
I found myself an innovator
I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up (Oh, oh)
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe (Oh, oh)
I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up (Oh, oh)
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

Change, change, change
I want to get up out of my skin
Tell you what
If I can shake it
I'ma make this
Somethin' worth dreamin' of

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up (Oh, oh)
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe (Oh, oh)
I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up (Oh, oh)
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe (Oh, oh)

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up (Oh, oh)
(Change, change, change, I want to get up out of my skin)
(Tell you what, If I can shake it I'ma make this)
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe (Oh, oh)
(Somethin' worth dreamin' of)3Embed
