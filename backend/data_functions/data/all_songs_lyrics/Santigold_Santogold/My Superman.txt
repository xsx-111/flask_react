My Superman LyricsHey Hey Hey (2x)
Well you’re a liar and
Your cues are all wrong
But I can’t count all the ways you woo me
I watch you capture
What I can’t hold
Now make it make some sense to me
You are
You are my  (3x)
Superman
Make it fly
Bless your soul
You get by
Take me along
But all the static here it’s breaking you a-part
You can’t stay the way  you , you , you , you
You are
You are my  (3x)
