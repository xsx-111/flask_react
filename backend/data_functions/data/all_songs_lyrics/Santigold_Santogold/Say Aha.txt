Say Aha LyricsLouder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Say Aha, Aha
Say Aha, aha
At night it’s eating up your head
Backed against the wall
Got you in a tight place
Though you’re not alone at all
Been fighting, trying to place a name on what it’s called
Make you feel like a losing streak cuz you know
But you’re not involved
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Say Aha, Aha
Say Aha, aha
It’s alright, cuz everything they say
Doesn’t make no sense
It’s that time
I’m picking up my ass
Up from off the fence
Gonna blow a hole in this charade
It’s self defense
I’m a army got a whole brigade in my two sense
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Say Aha, Aha
Say Aha, aha
Ooooohhh
Send in your torpedos for all they know
Make a show, shake them up before you blow
Cuz they don’t want no cure
No, you’d better find a way
Their aim’s not pure
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow allow
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow allow
Say Aha, Aha
Say Aha, ahaEmbed
