Lights Out LyricsLights Out
Shoot up the station
TV’s dead, where’s there to run?
Watch everybody come undone
Lights Out
Won’t make it easy, won't make it fun
Won't let them see now, how they have won
Still I’ll go another round
Chorus:
Darlin’
Don’t got to worry you’re locked in tight
Darlin’
Now don’t you worry turn out the lights
(must be worth it ‘cause the more I try the more it gets uneven
I can shake it I keep thinking but it’s with me for a reason)
Wiped Out
No concentration
They got us basking in a storm
I watch it as it loses form
I doubt
They even see me
Guess what I want
A casualty but
I am up front
And I know what it’s about
Chorus
I’m still here shaking my head
The one you can’t account for
I keep just one step ahead
There’s no place to run
