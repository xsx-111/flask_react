Star Sail LyricsHello it's me, it's me
Calling out I can see you
Hello it's me, crying out, crying out
Are you there?
I want to touch you
It's me throwing stones from the stars
On your mixed up world
Been circling round for 20 years
And in that time I've seen all the fires and all the liars
I've been calling home for 20 years
And in that time I heard the screams rebound to me
While, you were making history
I could see the fire
And I'll throw the fire back downEmbed
