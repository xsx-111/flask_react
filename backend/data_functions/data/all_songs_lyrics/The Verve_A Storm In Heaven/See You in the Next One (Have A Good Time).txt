See You in the Next One (Have A Good Time) Lyrics
How hard is it for me to wait for you, my love
See you in the next one have a good time
Could be a lifetime before I see you again, my love
See you in the next one have a good time

Eyes they open wide
Eyes they open wide
I like the way it was
Hate the way it is now

Lack of time and a wasted weekend, my love
You wore your lies like a film star
