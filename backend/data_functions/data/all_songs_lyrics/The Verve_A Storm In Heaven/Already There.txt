Already There Lyrics
Seen it all I'm already there
Save your books and your pills
I don't need them I'm there
You can do anything you want to
All you've got to do is try
I thought the best days had left me
My best years had left me behind
Then I watched them come back (to me)

And all the wild eyes
All the wild eyes know what I mean

If trees cut stars and eyes to heaven
I'll bend them back I'll bend them again
If my skin looks tired and old from living
I'll turn right back and live it again
You better pray when the music stops
And you're left alone in your mind
I'll be hearing music till the day I die
Then I heard it turn off
I swear I heard the screams

They're scared they've lost their dream
They press down on me
You know I thought I was there

Hello, high, are you?
Yes?
Well that explains it
Oh you were walking round like some kind of angel
You were walking round like some kind of angel
Hello, high, are you? Yes?
Well that explains it
Well that explains it1Embed
