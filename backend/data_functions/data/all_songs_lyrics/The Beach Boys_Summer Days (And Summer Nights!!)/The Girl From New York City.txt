The Girl From New York City Lyrics
She come out with her best friend for the summer in L.A
They took a small apartment down on the beach
Where you'll find them there every day
And I said

California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L.A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

We'll turn them on with all the things that will be happening night and day
We'll show them such a groovy time that they'll both be deciding to stay
And let me say

California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L.A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L.A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City1Embed
