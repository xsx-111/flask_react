Surprise, Surprise LyricsThe lower they go, the higher they fly
There's more than one way to play and I say an eye for an eye
It's been going too far, it's been going too far for far too long
I want to sent it on fire, I want to set it on fire, drop the bomb
Surprise, surprise
The government lies
It's okay to kill in the name of democracy
And dictators are swell if they like the smell of American money
It's making me sick, I want no part of it, stop waving that flag
All you idiots bought right into it and who's left holding the bag?
Surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
The government lies
This capsized country's sinking fast
I've got leeches and landlords and lawyers crawling all over my ass
We've been playing along and they've been playing the song that we wanted to hear
But the melody's meaningless, it's wasted on my ears
Surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
The government lies
Oh
Ooh
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it offEmbed
