All the Clocks are Broken LyricsThe stars are quiet onthe face of the deep
All the dogs and angels are turning
Burning in their sleep
You can't see me now, but I'm watching over you (2x)
A broken smile never lies
A busted mirror cannot see you cry
I'm looking through one glass eye (2x)
You can't see me now, but I'm watching over you
All the clocks are broken
Every door is open
Take me to the ocean
And we'll ride on the hurricane
Until we're washed away
Take off the mask and tell me what you find
Behind the curtain everyone's deaf dumb and blind
Everyone becomes the one, the one they most despise
You're looking through one glass eye (2x)
Well, you can't see me now, but I'm watching over you
All the clocks are broken
Every door is open
Take me to the ocean
And we'll ride on the hurricane
Until we're washed awayEmbed
