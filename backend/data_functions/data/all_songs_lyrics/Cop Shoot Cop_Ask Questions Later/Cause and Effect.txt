Cause and Effect Lyrics
My old man, he said to me, he said "Son
There are those that get bought
And those that do the buying"
Well enough, we never did see eye to eye
And I always wished that good ol' boy
Could cound past two

Love it or leave it, black or white
That's the way it is
Fundamental absolute
I wish I could be as clever
Never did buy that bill of goodsEmbed
