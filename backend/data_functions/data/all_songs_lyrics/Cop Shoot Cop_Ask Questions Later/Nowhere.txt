Nowhere LyricsNobody can find you when you're nowhere
Living on the other side of hope
Nobody can hurt you when you don't care
Singing like you're swinging on a rope
Don't worry if you never have been happy
Disappointment is your only friend
It's not like there's nothing to believe in
Every movie's got to have an end
What are you waiting for?
Let's get out of here
When you've got nothing
You've got nothing left to fear
Going nowhere Going nowhere
Going nowhere...
How long can you just go on pretending
To be yourself when you know that you're not?
Every movie's got to have an ending
Even when there's not much of a plot
What are we waiting for?
Let's get out of here
When you've got nothing
You've got nothing left to fear
Yeah, going nowhere, going nowhere
Hey. Going nowhere...
If your lover used to beat you with his failure
If your mother usd to tie you to a rock
Observe your former life preserved in amber
Like someone pulled the power on the clock
What are we waiting for?
Let's get out of here
When you've got nothing
You've got nothing left to fearEmbed
