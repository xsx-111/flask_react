$10 Bill LyricsTen dollar bill in your pocket, ten dollar bill
What you gonna buy with that greenback?
What kind of thrill?
Ten dollar bill in your pocket, ten dollar bill
Tell me where did you get that money?
Who'd you have to kill? (Rock!)
Got a big black gun in my pocket, got a big black gun
It's time to share that cash now, nowhere to run
Got a big black gun in my pocket, got a big black gun
Let's find a Seven-Eleven and have some fun (Rock!)
Ten a.m. the landlord's knocking
Knocking on my door
Can't you see I got no money
I can't give no more
Two p.m. the landlord's bangin'
Trying one more time
You can knock the damn door down
But you ain't gonna get a dime (Rock!)Embed
