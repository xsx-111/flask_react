And All That Could Have Been Lyrics
Breeze still carries the sound
Maybe I'll disappear
Tracks will fade in the snow
You won't find me here

Ice is starting to form
Ending what had begun
I am locked in my head
With what I've done
I know you tried to rescue me
Didn't let anyone get in
Left with a trace of all that was
And all that could have been

Please
Take this
And run far away
Far away from me
I am tainted
The two of us
Were never meant to be
All these pieces
And promises
And left-behinds
If only I could see
In my nothing
You meant everything
Everything to me
Gone, fading
Everything
And all that
Could have been
Could have been

Please
Take this
And run far away
Far as you can see
I am tainted
And happiness
And peace-of-mind
Were never meant for me
All these pieces
And promises
And left-behinds
If only I could see
In my nothing
You meant everything
Everything to me7Embed
