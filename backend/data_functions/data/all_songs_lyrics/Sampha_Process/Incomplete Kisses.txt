Incomplete Kisses Lyrics
Those incomplete kisses
Were weighing you down with every step
In this house we're sinking
But we're far too numb to really care
The TV keeps glitching
The lights dim down and portals appear
And somehow you step out
To say you're not by yourself now

Those incomplete kisses
Those incomplete kisses
Wait too long, you'll miss it
Before long, you're missing
Don't let your heart hide your story
Don't let your mind hide your story
'Cause if you deny others inside
It gets harder to move along
Moving on

Flying high above all your memories
I have a bird's-eye view
A child stood at the cemetery
He looks just like you
Orange, yellow, purple, blue skies
A painting so true
And I hear those cries
Don't you leave me here
Don't you leave me here
Those incomplete kisses
Those incomplete
Wait too long, you'll miss it
Wait too long
Those incomplete kisses
Those incomplete

Those incomplete kisses
Those incomplete kisses
Wait too long, you'll miss it
Before long, you're missing
Don't let your heart hide your story
Don't let your mind hide your story
'Cause if you deny others inside
It gets harder to move along
Moving on

Those incomplete kisses
Were weighing you down with every step
In this house we're sinking
But we're far too numb to really care
The TV keeps glitching
The lights dim down and portals appear7Embed
