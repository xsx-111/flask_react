Reverse Faults Lyrics
There's a fault in my structure
It's always you and never me
I threw the blame and it shattered
And now there's broken glass praying to be healed
You struck a chord and I listened
You damn near broke all the strings
When you get close, I get distant
Instead I'll drive away to a place surreal
And tell me how that feels

Took the brake pads out the car
And I flew
Smashed this window in my heart
And I blamed you
This anger's taking me apart
Explosive truths
Except this time I went too far
And I hurt you
I wish I could take it back right now

Where's that smile when it matters?
Where was I when you called?
I shot the blame and it scattered
Now there's bullet holes spread across the walls
I took the shape of a letter
Slipped myself underneath your door
In this red room we develop
An understanding of all our wrongs
Now can we move along?
Took the brake pads out the car
And I flew
Smashed this window in my heart
And I blamed you
This anger's taking me apart
Explosive truths
Except this time I went too far
And I hurt you
I wish I could take it back right now22Embed
