Under Lyrics
Under, under, under, under, under, under, under, under, under
You, you, you, you, you, ooh
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, under, under, under, under, under, under...
You, you, you, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh

Sophisticated bitter queen
You're the ghost in my machine
As I sit at my piano
And flick through every channel
Channeling those memories
Trying to put and end to these
I don't need you now
I don't need you now
I don't need you now
I don't, I don't

I wonder, sit and watch you wonder
I see you manipulate your lover
Take cover, waves come crashing over us
And I go under
Under, under, under, under...
And yes, I'm under your spell
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder...
Under
You, you, you, you, you...
Waves come crashing over me
I'm somewhere in open sea
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahh
I'm gasping for air
A nemesis, an enemy
You're the crack inside the screen
As I'm singing my soprano
Still flicking through the channels
Signal lost and out of reach
Your eyes become the TV screens
As I sit I watch you walk my way
Static, the static on those screens now
We're together, on this balcony yeah
I'm still swimming in those eyes
You made it rain like you own the sky, oh
You made it rain like you own the sky

I wonder, sit and watch you wonder
I see you manipulate your lover
Take cover, waves come crashing over us
And I go under
Under, under, under, under...
And yes, I'm under your spell
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder...
Under
You, you, you, you, you...
Waves come crashing over me
I'm somewhere in open sea
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahh
I'm gasping for air
I can feel it
Slipping away
Slipping away
Under, under, under, under...
You, you, you, you, you, ooh
Thunder, thunder, thunder...
You, you, you, you, you, you...11Embed
