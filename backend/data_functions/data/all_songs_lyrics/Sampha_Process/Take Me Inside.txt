Take Me Inside Lyrics
Does he still make your blood rush?
These days I'm just not sure how to feel
Does he still make you run wild?
Silence, and your lips were sealed
As if you didn't care
And your love was gone
Her love was lost
Calm before the storm

I don't care if you take me inside
You can be what you want every time
And I know it's hard to find the mind
To say you do

You're free
You're free, you're free, you're free
You're free enough to find your feet
You're also free enough to hide from me
And I seek
I seek, I seek, I seek
I'm seeking something I can't see
I may be reading in too deep
And maybe this is all a dream4Embed
