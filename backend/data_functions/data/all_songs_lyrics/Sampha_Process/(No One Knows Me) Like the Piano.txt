(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano Lyrics
No one knows me like the piano in my mother's home
You would show me I had something some people call a soul
And you dropped out the sky, oh you arrived when I was three years old
No one knows me like the piano in my mother's home

You know I left, I flew the nest
And you know I won't be long
And in my chest you know me best
And you know I'll be back home

An angel by her side, all of the times I knew we couldn't cope
They said that it's her time, no tears in sight, I kept the feelings close
And you took hold of me and never, never, never let me go
'Cause no one knows me like the piano in my mother's home
In my mother's home43Embed
