FUCKMYLIFE666 Lyrics
The ease of your pose
The grace of your silhouette
The way that your shoulders meet your slender neck
Where would we be without all the distance?
You know I'm already just a skeleton

I don't have the heart to match
The one pricked into your finger
Of things made to be destroyed
All moments meant to pass

Don't wanna live without teeth
Don't wanna die without bite
I never wanna say that I regret it
Never wanna say that we grew apart
And never wanna say that the feelings changed

I don't have the heart to match
The one pricked into your finger
Of things made to be destroyed
All moments meant to pass
Chipped nail polish
And a barbed-wire dress
"Is your mother proud of your eyelashes?"
Silicone chest and collagen lips
How would you even recognize me?

I don't have the heart to match
The one pricked into your finger
Of things made to be destroyed
All moments meant to pass

I don't have the heart to match
The one pricked into your finger
No more troubled sleep
There's a brave new world that's raging inside of me

I don't have the heart to match
The one pricked into your finger
This too will soon slip out of reach
This too will soon come to an end9Embed
