Black Me Out Lyrics
I don't ever want to talk that way again
I don't want to know people like that anymore
As if there was an obligation
As if I owed you something

Black me out
I want to piss on the walls of your house
I want to chop those brass rings off
Your fat fucking fingers
As if you were a king-maker
As if, as if, as if
Black me out

I don't want to see the world that way anymore
I don't want to feel that weak and insecure
As if you were my fucking pimp
As if I was your fucking whore

Black me out
I want to piss on the walls of your house
I want to chop those brass rings off
Your fat fucking fingers
As if you were a king-maker
As if, as if, as if
Black me out
All the young graves filled
Don't the best all burn out
So bright and so fast?
Full body high
I'm never coming down
Black me out8Embed
