Osama bin Laden as the Crucified Christ Lyrics
You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang, you're gonna hang
You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang, you're gonna hang

What's the best end you can hope for?
Pity fucks and table scraps
Subterfuge and detachment
A bullet in the head and a bullet in the chest
Na na na na

You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang, you're gonna hang
You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang, you're gonna hang
What's the best thing you can hope for?
A blindfold and a ball gag
Burned-out eyes, grotesque beauty
A nail through the feet and a nail through the hands
Na na na na

You're gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters
Hang like Clara with her skull caved in
Hang like a cross around my neck
You're gonna hang, you're gonna hang
You're gonna hang, you're gonna hang7Embed
