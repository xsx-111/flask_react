Unconditional Love Lyrics
Unraveling, unrolled, a siren in the night
I love the jaundice of your skin
Its perverse plasticity
You make me want to smoke cigarettes
You make me want to drink whiskey

Even if your love was unconditional
Even if your love was unconditional
Even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't be enough to save me
It still wouldn't be enough to save me

My sycophant love song
My authentic desperation
I'm addicted to the feeling
The only kind of steady I believe in
Prison cell exercises
Solitary sport entertainment
What makes you think
You're going to die any different?

Even if your love was unconditional
Even if your love was unconditional
Even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't be enough to save me
It still wouldn't be enough to save me
Even if your love was unconditional
Even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't save me
It still wouldn't save me

Don't worry young suicides
The vultures will pick your bones dry
Half digested and eternal
Somewhere lost in the ephemeral
Welcome to the future
An always ice-cold nightmare
Burnt coffee and Percocets
This night too will end

Even if your love was unconditional
Even if your love was unconditional
Even if your love was unconditional
It still wouldn't be enough to save me
It still wouldn't be enough to save meEmbed
