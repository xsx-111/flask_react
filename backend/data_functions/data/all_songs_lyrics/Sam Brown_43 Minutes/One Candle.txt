One Candle LyricsWarm
At home
On this big old smelly sofa
That makes me feel like I'm five again
It's
The end
Of the day
The hearth is ablaze
And I'm resting my weary brain
It's funny
There's a fire full of flames
And above it
In the centre
Of the mantelpiece
Is
One candle
Dancing in the mirror
One candle
Holds my gaze
There's a fire full of flames
But one candle
Holds my gaze
It smiles
This room
And it's musty and it's rosy
And it's possible that I'll doze off quite soon
And so
To bed
Up the wooden hill we go
And say goodnight until tomorrow...Embed
