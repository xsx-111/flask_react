You Are the World LyricsTo write down words is not enough
Still I can try to put across
The width and the depth of this ordinary thing
It's called a name and that is love
Though it's hard to believe it's an ordinary thing
It's what our lives are made up of
And therefore it must be
You are the mountain... and the stream
You are my world... you are my dream
You are the heart that's holding my heartbeat
You are my dream
You are the world, you are... to me
We must all live day out day in
We all must sleep, we all must breathe
And all we can seek is a way of life
That is as much as we can hope to be
Inspiration is here for all to know and see
And it is this you give to me
All that I can be
You are the mountain... and the stream
You are my world... you are my dream
You are the heart that's holding my heartbeat
You are my dream
You are the world, you are...
