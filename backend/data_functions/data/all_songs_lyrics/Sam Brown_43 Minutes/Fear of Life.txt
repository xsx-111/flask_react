Fear of Life LyricsSee the shadows, how they move across the room
And up above, always one step ahead of you...
But see the light
Do you see any light? or do you just see spite?
In the distance, if I look I see the sun
Obliterating all the shadows, everyone
But it's a long climb
Through a sea of lies... into a stream of light
There is a sun for me
It's from within
For all to see
How does it feel to be lost in life?
If I try
Then maybe I
Can find it here
Before I die
How does it feel to be lost in fear of life?
You're too scared to even try
It's called fear of life
I know it can be hard to always speak the truth
More to myself than to you
And so I try to find the easy road
But it only goes to nowhere â€“ and I have learned
That there is some prize that you and I can earn
If only bit by bit, it's worthwhile
From the sky down to the ground
I am all I know...
So I must know me well
There is a sun for me
It's from within
For all to see
How does it feel to be lost in life?
If I try
Then maybe I
Can find it here
Before I die
How does it feel to be lost in fear of life?
You're too scared to even try
It's called fear of lifeEmbed
