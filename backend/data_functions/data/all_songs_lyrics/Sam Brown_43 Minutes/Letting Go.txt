Letting Go LyricsYou came down to see me
In your long white dress that angels wear
I could see you and I could feel you
I know you were there
And I was driving a big car on my own in the dark
And we were together, but it didn't last
But you were real in the dream
I know you were there to tell me you were alright
You were real in the dream
It's hard you know, this letting go...
It was all in a dream
I knew you were leaving, you went into yourself
And we all knew a sorrow like we'd never felt
And there was pushing and shoving us, we tried to hold on
But you slipped through our fingers and then you where gone
But you were real in the dream
I know you were there to tell me you were alright
You were real in the dream
It's hard you know, this letting go
It was all in a dream
And what you left behind
Has deep roots in my heart and in my mind
The voice of love and life
In my heart and in my mindEmbed
