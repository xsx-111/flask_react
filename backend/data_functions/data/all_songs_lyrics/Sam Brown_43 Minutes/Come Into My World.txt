Come Into My World LyricsHello... come into my world...
I've been sitting here on my own
For quite a while now
Contemplating things, things that happened
Yesterday, and the day before
And the day before
Hello... come into my world...
You're welcome here, it's an open door
But you're the only one
'cos I feel you are a part of me
And it's warm in here, here by the fire
And I was about to put some music on
Hello... come into my world...
When I'm alone
I go walking round inside my brain
And sit amongst the memories
When I'm alone
I can pick up all the bits of broken love
And try to make the pieces fit
And all my sadness lives
Deep in the bottom of my heart
It sleeps most times
But sometimes
I can hear it beat its wings
When I'm alone
Hello... come into my world...Embed
