Your Time Is Your Own LyricsWe were in a bar you and I
The room was dull and brown just like the sky
The clock went tick tock with its hands on my hands
Conversation was a farce
We were off in cuckoo land
Everybody knows
When you're wasting your time
It's your own
Does it matter though
It always has been that way
Any wind that blows
Can change the face of things
As we know them
Everybody knows
Your time is your own
Your time is your own
The other day I slept for twenty-one hours
The bedroom was light and filled with fragrant flowers
My subconscious needed to be left alone
I took the time to take my time
And make myself at home
Everybody knows
When you're wasting your time
It's your own
Does it matter though
It always has been that way
Any wind that blows
Can change the face of things
As we know them
Everybody knows
Your time is your own
Your time is your ownEmbed
