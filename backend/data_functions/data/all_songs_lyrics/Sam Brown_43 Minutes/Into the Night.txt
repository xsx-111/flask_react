Into the Night LyricsInto the night
With no fear of the dark
This soul made of light
Is safe in my heart
This child I hold dear
It sleeps in my bones
And will be born of no fear
'Cos fear has no home here
I've been scared of joy
And I've been scared of life
I've been scared of spiders
'Til I saw I'm alive
I've seen myself fumble
And I've seen myself fall
I've seen my arms open
And I've seen me stand tallEmbed
