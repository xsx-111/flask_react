Sleep Like a Baby LyricsSleep like a baby
Sleep like a child in my arms
Sleep like a baby in my arms
I want you to feel peace in mind
I want you to dream of the happiest times of your life
Turn away your darker side, just for tonight
Sleep like a baby
Sleep like a child in my arms
Sleep like a baby in my arms...
Won't you let me take you back, to when you were young
I'll make you feel sheltered, I'll make you feel warm
Won't you let me take you back...
Sleep...
Sleep...
S l e e p ...
Sleep like a baby...
Lay your head down here on my pillow
Lay down here by my side
Turn away your darker side...
Just for tonight...Embed
