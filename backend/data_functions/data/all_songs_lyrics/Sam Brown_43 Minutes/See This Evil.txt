See This Evil LyricsSee this evil in my eye
I refuse to deny it
It must be something you don't like
But I refuse to deny it
It's only ever counterproductive
When you're nice a pie all of the time
Then you end up killing someone dead
Become sugar sweet as ice cream
Trying to hide it
I refuse to deny it
See this evil in my eye
I refuse to deny it
It must be something you don't like
But I refuse to deny it
Good intentions do not create honesty
Forethought, calculation and acceptance of ability to sleaze
I'm more at home with these
With a handful of humility
And love thrown if for the balance please
I refuse to deny it
See this evil in my eye
I refuse to deny it
It must be something you don't like
But I refuse to deny itEmbed
