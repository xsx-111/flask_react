Man With Golden Helmet LyricsMan with Golden Helmet
Drinks water from the faucet
Man with Golden Helmet
Drinks water from the faucet
Stares across the hall
At the pictures on the wall
Of hieroglyphic scrawl
And no ones cares at all
That he is waiting
Man with Golden Helmet
Drinks water from the faucet
Man with Golden Helmet
Drinks water from the faucet
Walks on down the street
Leather boots, leather coat
Gloves of shining leather
Sidewalks and gutters and freezing weather
Empty streets full of no one
Man with Golden Helmet
Drinks water from the faucet
Man with Golden Helmet
Drinks water from the faucet
Plays with tiny children
On his way home from work
He doesn't wear a smirk
He can't revive it
Having different kinds of fun
With fourteen ancient nuns
Under circling sun
And his wonderful collection of guns
He's the top man in the language departmentEmbed
