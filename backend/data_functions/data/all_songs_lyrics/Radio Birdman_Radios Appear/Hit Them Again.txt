Hit Them Again LyricsManipulations flashing out my hands
I can't show you all my plans
Until I activate you, you can't see
That's all right, all right by me
It's all right It's all right
Let's hit and run again tonite
40 strikes come over every day
Death from the skies blowing us away
Fire melts helmet and skull within
We gotta go behind the lines and hit 'em again
It's all right, it's all right
Let's hit and run again tonite
Now if you run babe you ain't got a chance
That Laser eye will freeze you with one glance
Burnin' wind howlin' at my door
Like Hamburg babe circa '44
It's all right, it's all right
Let's hit and run again toniteEmbed
