New Race LyricsThere's gonna be a new race
Kids are gonna start it up
We're all gonna mutate
Kids are saying yeah hup
Yeah hup
Really gonna punch you out
We're sick of waking up late
Gotta get some control
The kids are gonna mutate
From an endless roll
Scared of circular time
It keeps faking us out
Kids are gonna eject
Cos now it's time to punch outEmbed
