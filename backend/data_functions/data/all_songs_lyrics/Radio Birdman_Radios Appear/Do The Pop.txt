Do The Pop LyricsCome on baby it's time to move
You been saying there's nothing to do
Don't be afraid of bustin' out of your cage
Gonna cruise around gonna burn up the stage
Do the Pop
Come on baby I said squeeze the weez
On your feet or on your knees
So messed up I'm gonna do some dives
Gonna do the Pop gonna burn alive
We saw the Stooges and the MC5
Drove themselves insane alive
Nova, blow-torch, A-bomb eyes
The Pop's the way, the truth and the lightEmbed
