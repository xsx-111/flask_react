Descent Into The Maelstrom LyricsTook a ride on the ocean
Started swimming out
Lost sight of land
Time ran out
Arms getting heavy
Exhaustion's setting in
Waves getting bigger
Life's getting thin
My brain was screaming
My mind said no
My mouth was bleeding
Said you gotta go
Hit the high side
Monster / wave
Buried at sea
In an early grave
Free fall dive
Thousand foot pit
Cliffs of water turning
Adrenachrome hit
Death-like animals
The death of slaves
The death of humans
Getting sucked away
Ship trucks and planes
A million screaming heads
Agonised moaning
From the island of the dead
I'm going down
Into the maelstrom
Going down
Gonna drown
Alive alive alive
I'm aliveEmbed
