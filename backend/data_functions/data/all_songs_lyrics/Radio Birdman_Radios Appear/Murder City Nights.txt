Murder City Nights LyricsMoving to the sound of the midnite masses
Fighting up terminal seventies stasis
Cruising down Woodward gotta find me some action
Looking for a lover with a power reaction
Murder city nights, oh yeah
Murder city nights, oh yeah
Murder city nights, all right
Hanging on the edge of my self control
Looking in the mirror for the highway patrol
My brain is wired down to my hand
Gotta keep movin' cos I know I'm a man
Murder city nights, oh yeah
Murder city nights, oh yeah
Murder city nights, all rightEmbed
