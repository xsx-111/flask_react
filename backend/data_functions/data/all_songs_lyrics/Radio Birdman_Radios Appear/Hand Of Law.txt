Hand Of Law LyricsFear and terror, watch out boy
The sun is getting low
After sundown we'll be ready
And who could ask for more
On the third day of the seventh month
Is when we'll ride the highway
Night descends, daylight ends
And like the light we'll fly
Hand of law is coming down
Hand of law is coming down
Hand of law is on us now
Hand of law is on us now
Black killers, Earl Flinns
Demons from the sea
Midnight train, self insane
Man of mystery
Gonna all burn now, do you hear
In a nuclear flame
You're gonna never be the same
Coz you're gonna be rearranged
All the mirrors sucking people through
Down to an unknown world
All the fears that you ever knew
Are alive in that world
It's coming from the nor nor west
The endless eye warns
A hole in the sky mirrors
And the light that never never warms
Hand of law is on us nowEmbed
