Non-Stop Girls LyricsSeven Four, taking me away
I'll never make it back to the USA
50 Million horsepower J-84
Slammed my head through a one-way door
Oh no I can't use non-stop girls
Oh no I just can't use you
Cos all my love is gone
To another world
Oh no I can't use non-stop girls
Non-stop girls
Flashing in our lives
Non-stop girls
Burning in our minds
Non-stop girls
You just can't be beat
Bleeding heart
In a window seatEmbed
