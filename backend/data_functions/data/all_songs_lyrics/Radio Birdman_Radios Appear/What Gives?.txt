What Gives? LyricsMy heart rips open 'cause you're my all
Staring at my blank white wall
The old clock is getting heavy-handed
Waiting for a plane that never landed
What gives
What you gonna do
Feel my hand across your lips
Got a P38 with a loaded clip
I'll do anything that I could
I'd go running out in the frozen woods
For you
So What gives, what gives, what gives
What you gonna doEmbed
