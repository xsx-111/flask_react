The Post LyricsEyed it, dried it, untied it
Chilled it, spilled it, refilled it
Pasted, traced it, erased it
She's my post to lean on
And I just cut her down
So I'm out to land on something
Hopefully a girl will come to me and the ground
Eyed it, dried it, untied it
Chilled it, spilled it, refilled it
Pasted, traced it, erased it
She's my post to lean on
And I just cut her down
So I'm out to land on something
Hopefully  a girl will come to me and the ground
She's my post to lean on
And I just cut her down
So I'm out to land on something
Hopefully a girl will come to me and the groundEmbed
