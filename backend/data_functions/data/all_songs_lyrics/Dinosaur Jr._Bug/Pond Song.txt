Pond Song LyricsPonders yet you're undecided
I sprinkle looks to let you know
Pain is a wave, come on let's ride it
Jump on now or we'll have to row
Now, while your eyes run back
The memories attack
I'll give it my last crack
The dreams keep me awake
Feelings seem hard to shake
Same way I always flake
Dripping off, you come to meet me
Break off a piece to let you know
And they bubble all around you
Yeah this is love, but it won't show
And while your eyes run back
The memories attack
I'll give it one last crack
The dreams keep me awake
Feelings seem hard to shake
Same way I always flake
Need a way to keep it simple
All the times I bailed, you float
Girl, you reach in then you wrinkle
I turned it down, right down your throatEmbed
