They Always Come LyricsI’ve been drying for it
Plugged in again
Now it won’t bend
You’ve been frying for it
A mound of smack
Won’t fill the crack
They always come in two's
All the space they always use
All the steps I’ve taken to hide me
Not sure now what’s left inside me
So I’ve taken to napping
All the things I left unspoken
The one that fits still got me joking
Hope it don’t mean I’ll stop napping
I’ve been drying for it
Plugged in again
Now it won’t bend
You’ve been frying for it
A mound of smack
Won’t fill the crack
They always come in two's
All the space they always use
All the steps I’ve taken to hide me
Not sure now what’s left inside me
So I’ve taken to napping
All the things I left unspoken
The one that slips still got me joking
Hope it don’t mean I’ll stop napping
Can’t face them there
The ones you left
You can trace me
The sky broke down
Better end you sound
Gotta save meEmbed
