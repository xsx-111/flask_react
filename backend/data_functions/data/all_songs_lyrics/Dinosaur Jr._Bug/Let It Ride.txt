Let It Ride LyricsI'll be by your side
Thought you knew, thought I'd try
What's there to decide?
Put everything into it
Time to throw it on the heap
All the times I almost spilled it
Now it's something gotta keep
Found a way, heard all the things I've tried to say
Hate to see it washed away, dragged down among the drain
But if it stays, all the things about to pay
All doubts I've stashed away, kept down until you say
Letting it all slide
Stood too long, far too gone
Can't you let it ride?
Put everything into it
Time to throw it on the heap
All the times I all most spilled it
Now it's something gotta keep
Found a way, heard all the things I've tried to say
Hate to see it washed away, dragged down among the drain
If I don't move, there won't be a thing to prove
And all I'm bound to lose my thing for hanging out
But if it stays, all the things about to pay
All the doubts I've stashed away kept down until you say
I'll be by your side
Stood too long, far too gone
Can't you let it ride?
What's there to decide?
Thought you knew, thought I'd try
Letting it all slideEmbed
