No Bones Lyrics
Hey babe
Thought maybe
Can't feel right today
Wish it didn't faze me
Can't handle you their way

Will I surround you, entombed and warm
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form
The vast expanses will leach you dry
You'll shiver all summer

Hey babe, can't do it
Can't put you there again
Can't feel
Can't go through it
If there only was a when

Will I surround you, Entombed and warm
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form
The vast expanses, the need to grind
They'll summonEmbed
