Yeah We Know Lyrics
Driving hard through your friend
Got to find a way to mend
The less we see, the more it grows
Festering out of control

Piled high
You get that face, I wonder why we ever got it together
What's to say
Just no clue, we just know what we do
Hoping it comes together

It's the norm, float again
It's the stuff you said you send
Take it in
Wait to see
If itâ€™s enough, just 'cause it's free

Push too far
Feel the skin begin to scar
Can't really put it together
Now it's a drag
With no hope of coming back
How can you ever get it together?

Bottled up, stored away
Always ready to give way
Push it farther, yeah we know
Clinging, hoping it won't show

Piled high
You get that face, I wonder why we ever got it together
Push too far
Feel the skin begin to scar
Can't really pull it together
About to crack
With no hope of coming back
How can you ever get it together
What's to say
Just no clue, we just know what we do
Hope it comes togetherEmbed
