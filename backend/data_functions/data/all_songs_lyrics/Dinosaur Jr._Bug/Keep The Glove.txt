Keep The Glove LyricsHey babe, where'd you go
Just left it sitting in the road
You can drape it all over your room
Sit back and let it shower you
Left it, hoping you'd see it, and wanted to stay
Wish someone told me there's a better way
The past will blow away
Don't mind if I have to borrow
Long as I come away
Something you'll dig tomorrow
It's all I could think of
Found this thing out back
Hope it makes it up for all I lack
They've all got a shot with you
Chance I had, I kinda blew
It's all there in that bag
Didn't turn out like I hoped, yeah
Guess it's a drag
The past will blow away
Don't mind if I have to borrow
Long as I come away
Something you'll dig tommorow
It's all I could think of
If you won't take my hand
Keep the glove
Then keep the glove
Keep the glove
Keep the glove
Keep the glove
Keep the gloveEmbed
