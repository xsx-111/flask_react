Freak Scene LyricsSeen enough to eye you
But I've seen too much to try you
It's always weirdness while you
Dig it much too much to fry you
The weirdness flows between us
Anyone can tell to see us
Freak scene just can't believe us
Why can't it just be cool and free us?

Seen enough to eye you
But I've seen too much to try you
It's always weirdness while you
Dig it much too much to fry you
The weirdness flows between us
Anyone can tell to see us
Freak scene just can't believe us
Why can't it just be cool and free us?
So fucked I can't believe it
If there's a way I wish we'd see it
How it could work just can't conceive it
Oh what a mess it's just to leave it
Sometimes I don't thrill you
Sometimes I think I'll kill you
Just don't let me fuck up will you
Cause when I need a friend it's still you
What a mess3Embed
