Budge LyricsGrab a ride
See who wins for most fried
Try to picture me with you
Let's talk weed
You can crush as I speed
Hope we can feel enough for two
Yeah I gave you a crutch
Not sure what to touch
Gave you my last nudge
Why won't you just budge
Grab a ride
See who wins for most fried
Try to picture me with you
We can gaze
Penetrate the space glade
Tons of rubble to sift through
Yeah I need a crutch
Not sure what to touch
Gave you my last nudge
Why won't you just budge
Grab a ride
See who wins for most fried
Try to picture me with you
We can gaze
Penetrate the space glade
Tons of rubble to sift through
Let's talk weed
You can crush as I speed
Hope we can feel enough for two
