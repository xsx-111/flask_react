Safe Sex LyricsNo one ever said I was a gullible girl
I don't believe everything that I'm told
I've been around and I know the ropes
And I won't get fooled again
I don't believe in no fairy tales
I don't believe in the man in the moon
And no pot of gold or anything else
Is waiting at the rainbow's end
I got no illusions now, I guess I lost them long ago
You're not gonna get me with this, cause I already know
Baby there's no such thing
Baby it just ain't true
And there's no such thing as safe sex
When it comes to loving you
There's always the danger of losing control
And of breaking my heart and exposing my soul
There's just no protection from that look in your eyes
Or the touch of your hands when I break down and cry
There's always the risk of surrendering more
Than I ever intended to do
And there's no such thing as safe sex
When it comes to loving you
I don't believe in the boogeyman
I don't believe in no pie in the sky
You can wish upon a star until the stars are gone
That doesn't mean it's really so
There's no such thing as a Santa Claus
There's no such thing as getting money for nothing
No yellow brick road is gonna take you there
Wherever you've been trying to go
We'll never be as young as this
No matter how we try, we grow
You're not such an innocent boy
And I already know
Baby there's no such thing
Baby it just ain't true
And there's no such thing as safe sex
When it comes to loving you
There's always the danger of giving too much
Love is often a drug
Love is often a crutch
There's no guarantee I can handle it all
The higher the climb
The longer the fall
There's always the danger of losing control
And of breaking my heart and exposing my soul
There's just no protection from that look in your eyes
Or the touch of your hands when I break down and cry
There's always the risk of surrendering more
Than I ever intended to do
And there's no such thing as safe sex
When it comes to loving youEmbed
