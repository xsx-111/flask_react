Twentieth Century Fox Lyrics(Foxy, foxy, fo-fo-fo-foxy)
Well, he's fashionably lean
And he's fashionably late
He'll never wreck a scene
He'll never break a date
But he's no drag, just watch the way he walks
He's a twentieth century fox
He's a twentieth century fox
No tears, no fears
No ruined years, no clocks
He's a twentieth century fox, oh baby
He's the king of cool (King of cool)
And he's the devil who waits (Devil who waits)
Since his mind left school (Left it at school)
It never hesitates (Don't hesitate)
He won't waste time on elementary talk
'Cause he's a twentieth century fox
He's a twentieth century fox
Got the world locked up
Inside a plastic box (He's got it all locked up in a box)
He's a twentieth century fox, oh baby
(Foxy)
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when the boys come a-foxin' around
Well, he's fashionably lean (Lean, lean)
And he's fashionably late (He's always late)
He'll never make a scene (Don't make a scene)
He'll never break the date (Won't break the date)
But he's no drag, just watch the way he walks (Foxy)
He's a twentieth century fox
He's a twentieth century fox
No tears, no fears
No ruined years, no clocks
He's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah
He's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah
He's a twentieth century fox
He's a twentieth century fox
