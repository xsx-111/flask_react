My Little Red Book LyricsWell, I just got out my little red book
The minute that you said goodbye
(Whoo!)
Well, I just got out my little red book
The minute that you said goodbye
I thumbed right through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry
Then I went from A to Z
I took out every pretty boy in town
They danced with me and as I held them
All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, oh no
There ain't no boy in my little red book
Who could ever replace your charms
(What are those secondhand charms?)
And each boy in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of
Oh won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
Where can love be? I need you so much
All I did was talk and talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, oh no
Oh won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
It's haunting me, I need you so much
All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, oh no
Oh noEmbed
