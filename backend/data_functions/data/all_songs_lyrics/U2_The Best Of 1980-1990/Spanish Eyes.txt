Spanish Eyes Lyrics
Wey, hey, hey, mmm baby hang on
Wey, hey, hey, mmm baby hang on
Hang to your heartbeat, tight as a drum
Hang on to your love, see it shines like a song
Wey, hey, hey, mmm baby hang on
Our love shines like rain
In those spanish eyes

Wey, hey, hey, here she comes
Comes in colours, now she's gonna turn the daylight on
Cause I love the way you talk to me
And I love the way you walk on me
And I need you more than you need me (yeah)
Our love shines like rain in those spanish eyes

I'll cross the world for green and gold
But, it's those spanish eyes that get me home
Home again

Wey, hey, hey, sugar hang on
Wey, hey, hey, you know that the night is as young
I'm dazzled by a light that shines in your eyes
I'm used to standing in the shadows and waiting for the night
Forever in fever, forever in heat
You re-invented me, now don't put me back on the street
Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
Cause I love the way you talk to me
And I mean the things you mean to me
And I need youEmbed
