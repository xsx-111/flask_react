Hallelujah (Here She Comes) LyricsI see you're dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until
Hallelujah here she comes
I see you're dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back
Hallelujah here she comes
Born and raised
On the wrong side of town
You get so high
That you can't come down
Yeah
I see the road is rough
You know I'm not giving up
Hallelujah here she comes
I know where the lady goes
I know she got a ring on her toes
Hallelujah here she comes
Born and raised
On the wrong side of town
You get so high
That you can't come down
I'm going higher, higher, higher
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
I'm gonna be there
When that light's gonna shine
I'm gonna be there
When her heart is next to mine
I'm gonna be
Here she comes
Yeah here she comes
I see you're dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until
Hallelujah here she comes
I see you're dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back
Hallelujah here she comes
Born and raised
In the wrong side of town
You get so high
You can't come down
I'm gonna be there
High on, high on, high on love
Gonna get high on, high on, high on love
Gonna get high on, high on, high on love
Gonna get high on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
I'm gonna be there
When that light's gonna shine
I'm gonna be there
When her heart is next to mine
I'm gonna be there
Be there
When Hallelujah...here she comes
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Oh Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Oh Here she comes...
Here she comes...
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on loveEmbed
