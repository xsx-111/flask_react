The Three Sunrises LyricsSpirit of the rising sun lift me up
Hold me there and never let me fall
Love me till I die, my heart won't wait
Soon I will be loved...
In this love song, love
Love song, love song
Hey, hey, love won't find
Find its own way home
In this a love song, love
Love, love song
Sun shine, sun shine on me
Sun shine, sun shine on me
In this love song, love
Love song, love song
Hey, hey, love won't find
Find its own way home
In this love song, love song
Love song, love song
Sun shine on me
Bring it through to my heart
I would give you everything
I will give you my desire
Sun shine, sun shine on me
Sun shine, sun shine on me1Embed
