Dancing Barefoot LyricsShe is benediction
She is addicted to he
She is the root connection
And she is connecting with me
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me?
I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
It makes me come up like some heroine
She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He who is chosen by she
Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me?
I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Strange, strange music drags me in
It makes me come up like some heroine
She is recreation
She, intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she
Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Till I lose my sense of gravity
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music drives me on
Makes me come up like some heroine
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for you
Oh God, I feel for youEmbed
