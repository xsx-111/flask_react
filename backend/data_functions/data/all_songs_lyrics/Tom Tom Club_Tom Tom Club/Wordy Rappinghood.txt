Wordy Rappinghood Lyrics
What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words

Words in papers, words in books
Words on TV, words for crooks
Words of comfort, words of peace
Words to make the fighting cease
Words to tell you what to do
Words are working hard for you
Eat your words but don't go hungry
Words have always nearly hung me

A ram sam sam, a ram sam sam
Guli guli guli guli guli ram sam sam
Hi kye yay, yippie yi kye yay
Awoo awoo ayee kie chi'
What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words

Words of nuance, words of skill
And words of romance are a thrill
Words are stupid, words are fun
Words can put you on the run
Mots pressés, mots sensés
Mots qui disent la vérité
Mots maudits, mots mentis
Mots qui manquent le fruit d'esprit
A ram sam sam, a ram sam sam
Guli guli guli guli guli ram sam sam
Hi kye yay, yippie yi kye yay
Awoo awoo ayee kie chi'
What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words

It's a rap race, with a fast pace
Concrete words, abstract words
Crazy words and lying words
Hazy words and dying words
Words of faith and tell me straight
Rare words and swear words
Good words and bad words

A ram sam sam, a ram sam sam
Guli guli guli guli guli ram sam sam
Hi kye yay, yippie yi kye yay
Awoo awoo ayee kie chi'
What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words
Words can make you pay and pay
Four-letter words I cannot say
Panty, toilet, dirty devil
Words are trouble, words are subtle
Words of anger, words of hate
Words over here, words out there
In the air and everywhere
Words of wisdom, words of strife
Words that write the book I like
Words won't find no right solution
To the planet earth's pollution
Say the right word, make a million
Words are like a certain person
Who can't say what they mean
Don't mean what they say
With a rap, rap here and a rap, rap there
Here a rap, there a rap
Everywhere a rap, rap
Rap it up for the common good
Let us enlist the neighborhood
It's okay, I've overstood
This is a wordy rappinghood, okay, bye

A ram sam sam, a ram sam sam
Guli guli guli guli guli ram sam sam
Hi kye yay, yippie yi kye yay
Awoo awoo ayee kie chi'
What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words
What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words
What are words worth?
What are words worth?
