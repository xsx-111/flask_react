On, On, On, On... LyricsI'm living proof, I love you
I know the truth, so do you
On and on we will come
There are scores of us
On and on, here we come
There are more of us
Come to my room, I need you
You're living proof, make your move
On and on we will come
There are scores of us
On and on, here we come
There are more of us
You are the youth, we're with you
We're living proof what we can do
On and on we will come
There are scores of us
On and on we will come
There are scores of us
On and on, here we come
There are more of us
On and on ...Embed
