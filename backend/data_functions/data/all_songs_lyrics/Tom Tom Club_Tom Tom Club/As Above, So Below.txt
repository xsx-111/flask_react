As Above, So Below LyricsHold the symbol to your forehead
Close your eyes
Call the spirit of the symbol
Come to me
Call the symbols of the golden age
One by one
Call the water, fire, air and earth
Come to me
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so below
Behold the door appears before you
Walk on through
Observe the doorway now behind you
Look ahead
Call the spirit of the symbol
Come to me
Allow the deity to guide you
Follow me
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so below
A web of thought; of tangled vision
Humanity
Tear away the veil before me
Set me free
Tales to picture that you give to me
Memory
Tear away the minds that bind me
Liberty
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so below
Thank the spirit of the symbol
Once you see
Raise your finger to your lips now
Sign of silence
Find the doorway of the symbol
Pass on through
Find the doorway of the symbol
Pass on through...
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so below
As above, so belowEmbed
