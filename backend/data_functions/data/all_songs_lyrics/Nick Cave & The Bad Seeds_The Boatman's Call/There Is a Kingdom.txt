There Is a Kingdom Lyrics
Just like a bird that sings up the sun
In a dawn so very dark
Such is my faith for you
Such is my faith
And all the world’s darkness can’t swallow up
A single spark
Such is my love for you
Such is my love

There is a kingdom, there is a king
And he lives without, and he lives within
There is a kingdom, there is a king
And he lives without, and he lives within

The starry heavens above me
The moral law within
So the world appears
So the world appears
This day so sweet
It will never come again
So the world appears
Through this mist of tears
There is a kingdom, there is a king
And he lives without, and he lives within
There is a kingdom, there is a king
And he lives without, and he lives within


The starry heavens above me
The moral law within
So the world appears
Through this mist of tears

There is a kingdom, there is a king
And he lives without, and he lives within
There is a kingdom, there is a king
There is a king, and he is everything2Embed
