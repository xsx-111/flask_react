Evil Will Prevail LyricsWith loving hands and their arms stretched so wide
They can't seem to take a breath
Knowing evil will prevail
And a million people seems like a lot
And a million people can't be wrong
With loving smiles and their mouths are stretched so wide
They can't even take a breath
Knowing evil will prevail
And the magic bullet is the glowing mothership
And the mother zaps you dead
With loving hands
Knowing evil will prevail
Knowing evil will prevail
Knowing that evil will prevail
Knowing evil will prevail
Knowing that evil will always winEmbed
