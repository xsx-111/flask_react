This Here Giraffe LyricsI saw this bird fly off his head
Without him ever looking up
This here giraffe was never caught complaining
He wouldn't take skin off your back
And you hear yourself thinking
And you hear yourself thinking
This here giraffe laughed
This here giraffe laughed
This here giraffe laughed
I saw this man stick out his neck
With his binoculars intact
He couldn't tell the right side of his brain
Had just lost all interest in his left
And you feel yourself shrinking
And you feel yourself shrinking
This here giraffe laughed
This here giraffe laughed
This here giraffe laughed
And you hear yourself
And you feel yourself
This here giraffe laughed
This here giraffe laughed
This here giraffe laughed
This here giraffe laughedEmbed
