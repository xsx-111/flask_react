Bad Days (Aurally Excited version) Lyrics
You're sorta stuck where you are
But in your dreams you can buy expensive cars
Or live on Mars and have it your way

And you hate your boss at your job
But in your dreams you can blow his head off
In your dreams, show no mercy

And all your bad days will end
And all your bad days will end
You have to sleep late when you can
And all your bad days will end

And all your bad days will end
And all your bad days will end
You have to sleep late when you can
And all your bad days will end1Embed
