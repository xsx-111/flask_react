Brainville Lyrics
I've heard about a place
Where they enlarge your space
Take pity on the small ones
Don't cost ya very much
They seem to know their stuff
Take pity on the small ones

And I wanna go to Brainville, let's get in
And overcome my inexperience
I wanna go to Brainville, let's get in
And be the first one on the block that does

They say it's the one thing everyone should have
I know it must look bad
Don't know I need the help
They'd take me, I can tell
Four fingers and a toenail

And I wanna go to Brainville, let's get in
And overcome my inexperience
And I wanna go to Brainville, let's get in
And be the first one on the block that does
