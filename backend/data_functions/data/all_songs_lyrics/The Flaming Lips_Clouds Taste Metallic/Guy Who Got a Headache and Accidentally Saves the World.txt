Guy Who Got a Headache and Accidentally Saves the World Lyrics
Magnified up close in a pickle jar
Is the last hope the world has
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Thinking that his head surely would explode
His thoughts go deeper than ever
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Something never dreamed in all the science books
The biggest light switch gets turned on
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah

And he's on the way to a real first
In all the universe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He saves the day and the world knows
The sonic boom explodes
Woo!

Hesitant to tell the real reason
The Nobel Peace Prize is given
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
It's hard to celebrate with a headache
(Oh yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
And he's on the way to a real first
In all the universe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go!
He saves the day and the world knows
So watch his head explode
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The boy wonder saves the planet but destroys his ever-enlarging brain in the process
Goodbye, everybody!
Have a happy life!
Looks like brighterâ€‹ days are ahead for the whole planet
There you goEmbed
