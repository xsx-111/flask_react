They Punctured My Yolk Lyrics
They never called me
Up to the tower
We gave it to them
They had the power
And power is the thing
That made you take off from me

We trained hard for the mission
All floating over
Though we're in zero gravity
It pulled us closer

We were once off to the planets
Inside our space suits
Now I'm left here on the landing
The rocket flame burst
And it's leaving without me
And you go off to the sky

Good-bye. Good-bye
Look as the clouds burst
They're growing taller
As your ship leaves in the distance
My world gets smaller
And it takes you worlds away
A million light years from me
Oh, Oh, Oh1Embed
