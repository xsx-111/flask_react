Christmas at the Zoo LyricsThere wasn't any snow on Christmas eve
And I knew what I should do
I thought I'd free the animals all locked up at the zoo
I opened up the fence where the peacocks were
The llamas were unleashed
The snakes and seals could all get out
But they refused to leave
All of the animals agreed
They're not happy at the zoo
But they preferred to save themselves
They seemed to think they could
The elephants, orangutans
All the birds and kangaroos all said
"Thanks but no thanks man"
To be concerned is good
It started to snow on Christmas Eve
In the middle of the night
Walking through the state park zoo
And everything is whiteEmbed
