Placebo Headwound Lyrics
Where does outer space end
It's sort of hard to imagine
Is it real? Is it nothing, nothing?
Cause it's not so clear anymore to me

Why do birds always fly south
When sometimes its warm in yer headwound
Is that nothing? Nothing?
Cause it's not so clear anymore to me

And if God hears all my questions
Well how come there's never an answer?
Is it nothing, nothing?1Embed
