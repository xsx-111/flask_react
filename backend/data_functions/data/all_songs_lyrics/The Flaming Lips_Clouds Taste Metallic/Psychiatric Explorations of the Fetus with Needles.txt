Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus with Needles Lyrics
Cat killing dogs, pigs eating rats
Every mouth will eat you up the king bug laughs
Belly of the heart Belly full of bats
The chromosomes seem not to want the fetus

They beat you up
They make you leave
Sticking needles in your knees
Knowing God will be pleased
Should make it easy

Snakes eating frogs, toads eating gnats
When the spaceship beams you up boy, get drunk fast
Rubber bullet barn, titty sucking calf-
Goats and roosters Bees and bugs Amoebas!!

They blow you up, make it breathe
Make it feel like a disease
And though it's hard to believe it makes it easyEmbed
