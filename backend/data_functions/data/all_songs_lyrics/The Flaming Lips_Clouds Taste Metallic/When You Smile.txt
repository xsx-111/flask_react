When You Smile LyricsIt's like I never had to see it in your eyes or feel it
I could tell when you smile
It's like I didn't need to say anything or do much
I could tell when you smile
All of the subatomic pieces come together
And unfold themselves in a second
Every single molecule is right
When all of the subatomic pieces come together
And unfold themselves in a secondEmbed
