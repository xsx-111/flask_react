Lightning Strikes the Postman LyricsI got your letter, it had turned to sand
Lightning strikes the postman in his hand
I hope that you remember the things you had to say
It's just a supernatural delay
I got your package, it was all a mess
Lightning strikes the postman in his chest
I hope that you remember the things you had to say
It's just a supernatural delay
I sent you a postcard and I hope you're fine
But lightning strikes the postman all the time
I couldn't really think of anything to say
It's just a supernatural delay
And it's hard to read the writing through the flamesEmbed
