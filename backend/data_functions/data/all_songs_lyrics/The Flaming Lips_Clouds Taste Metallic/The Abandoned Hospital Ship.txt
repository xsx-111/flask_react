The Abandoned Hospital Ship LyricsWell, it took some time
Cause it's a lot
God, it's a bunch
It's such a big, old, black golden buzz
And yeah, it took some help
With lots of machines
The experts could tell
With their equipment pushed to the max
And sure it seems easy now
But I tell you what
We were perplexed
Finding the needle in the needle's disguise
And now that it's conceived
The station has all settled down
And I'm sort of relieved
And I'm getting over it now
