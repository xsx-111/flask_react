Hive Lyrics
Coming like a nightmare word like I’m gonna go for it
Fuckin’ around what ya got to show for it?
Let it be known that I’m in the zone
And whatever I need I just pick up the phone
‘Cause I’m true with it and you’re new with it
I just swing the thing and then I’m through with it
I don’t need friends to act like foes
‘Cause I’m Nick Hexum the one who knows
About things…
‘Cause it takes two and we swings better than you
Then it’s time for the dub so we roll out the club
And you know just what I do
I’m hitting in the freak mode
Puttin’ on a load
Sippin’ on a guinny then lo and behold
On a vision from bottom to top
And I just can’t stop
311 show them the air is rarified
But you don’t give a damn ‘cause the groove is hellafied
Grew up punk, listening to funk
I’m a hyper type of fella that does not touch junk

You’re the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack
That’s what you get when you’re steady talkin’ shit
Not goin’ for self that shit is on the shelf
It’s '95 and we go for the hive
Listen up this you’re gonna bump to this
And if I’m feelin’ mean I’m gonna clutch my fist
Now when I say mean, I mean I’m gonna rock it
You’re gonna find out kid I’m bout to shock it
When I’m on I’m gone I hear the beat that spawns
The way we freak it and we kick up a storm
The day we turn to pop the show will stop
So feel the beat and get lost now
Back to part two the hard way we play
Sublime on time to all the fans I’m SA
And if you don’t know I say check the show
Do what you got to on the dance floor
Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that
Get the hell back and watch us rock the set
We cast the mold bust it cold explode
Mega trend-setters known around the globe
Friends takin’ you where you never been
We done what we wanted craftin’ poems
You can rock there is a glow around you
Lose control holmes just like we do
Hard to obtain brotha’ what’s my name
Mad to find unlike ya mamma and your masquerade
I drive a mach-1 no dashboard Jesus
I hear voices say "that’s Doug Martinez"
You’re all up in my mix like fuckin’ Betty Crocker
You think you’re playing me but actually you’re a jocker
You bad mouth me bitch man you're givin' me juice
It ain't nothin’ but a party everybody get loose
Notice what I don’t do when stress steps to me
Whatever your complaint, so sue me
I say fuck the naysayers and keep goin
Gotta do what I gotta do to get the people glowin’
So let everybody gather the more the better
I represent the traveler him he’s a shredder
At ease with yourself and don’t try to please me
I’m just here today then quickly I’m out
On the town one light I’m a glow worm
For several hours wiggle jiggle like I’m a huge sperm
Can’t appreciate a brothers love of funky music
You think I’m a silly rabbit ‘cause my style has tricks
Of the way I feel now I just got to rock
The music be poppin through me like electric shocks
I think and blink and I wink but that shit's not tiny
‘Cause in a blink of an eyelash you will not find me

You’re the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack
That’s what you get when you’re steady talkin’ shit
Not goin’ for self that shit is on the shelf
‘Cause it’s '95 and we go for the hive1Embed
