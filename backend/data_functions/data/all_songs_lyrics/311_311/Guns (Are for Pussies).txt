Guns (Are for Pussies) Lyrics
Here comes the thunder down under, we’re natural wonders
Night falls when we leave all you feel is the hunger
Surprises people of all shapes and sizes
Dig on the decade and realize it’s all funky
No matter this rude boy still got that swagger
My ears have heard all these crews but we’re badder
Interracial, special, positive beings
I am I be a cool awakening
It’s gettin hectic the metrics the body electric
Everybody in worn out blue jeans or tacky dresses
This is the city we’ve reached we’ve come to
Go unrecognized on the corner or make moves
All the lights are red all the poets dead
A familiar nightmare appears in my head
Times are changin’ myself I’m rearrangin’
Dream eight-thousand-five-twelve blazin’

Born to act out, born to act out
Paranoid with a gat
Born to act out, born to act out
Think you know where it’s at
Born to act out, born to act out
But you’re lookin’ like a sissie
Born to act out, born to act out
Guns are for pussies
Born to act out, born to act out
Paranoid with a gat
Born to act out, born to act out
Think you know where it’s at
Born to act out, born to act out
But you’re lookin’ like a sissie
Born to act out, born to act out
Guns are for pussies
I’m not from philly but some say I’m blunt
That’s just the way I am and I’m not going to front
And yes I took a trip to find out about the ways of big
City seedy bars and drugs that make you feel shitty
Pretty older women in skirts conversation frisky
Stinking cigarettes and plenty of bourbon whiskey
Sad classic music on the jukebox of doom
Hollywood boulevard, barfly frolic room
Tomb of lost souls some beyond salvage
Some just having fun opening steam valvage
I was one becoming the other hell bent to discover
Had to pull up the reigns or else smother
Take it brother all the way and then you’re scared, don’t want to be unprepared
You’re getting paranoid and then guns are shared
You guys think that you’re hard
But you’re in fear of being harmed
I fear no man and I’m unarmed

Born to act out, born to act out
Paranoid with a gat
Born to act out, born to act out
Think you know where it’s at
Born to act out, born to act out
But you’re lookin’ like a sissie
Born to act out, born to act out
Guns are for pussies
Born to act out, born to act out
Paranoid with a gat
Born to act out, born to act out
Think you know where it’s at
Born to act out, born to act out
But you’re lookin’ like a sissie
Born to act out, born to act out
Guns are for pussies
