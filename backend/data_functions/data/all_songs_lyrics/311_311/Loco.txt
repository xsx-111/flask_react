Loco Lyrics
Hey you got to step outside to see what’s going on
Hey you can’t run and hide when the ‘psybin trip is on
Not like this have you seen such green
A spot like this becomes serene
I’m glad your here, I have no fear, woah

Trip the ‘shrooms fantastic
And shit gets drastic elbow pull and kick
Trip the ‘shrooms fantastic
And shit gets drastic, check it out

Right now my brain is fragile
But you seem so agile
We’ll make it in tea and we’ll see what there is to see

Trip the ‘shrooms fantastic
And shit gets drastic elbow pull and kick
Trip the ‘shrooms fantastic
And shit gets drastic, check it out

Make an instrumental add a little vocal
Take to the stage and make the people go loco
Make an instrumental add a little vocal
Take to the stage and make the people go loco
Boom boom you got the spinning of the room
Quite right you got the breaking of the light
Boom boom you got the spinning of the room
Quite right you got the breaking of the light
Ad the sun and the moon and the spinning of the room
It does to my sight what the prism does to light
You’re quicker than me ridiculous see
You come follow me get lobotomy
You’re quicker than me ridiculous see
You come follow me get lobotomy

Trip the ‘shrooms fantastic
And shit gets drastic elbow pull and kick
Trip the ‘shrooms fantastic
And shit gets drastic, check it out

Make an instrumental add a little vocal
Take to the stage and make the people go loco
Make an instrumental add a little vocal
Take to the stage and make the people go loco
Make an instrumental add a little vocal
Take to the stage and make the people go loco
Make an instrumental add a little vocal
Take to the stage and make the people go loco1Embed
