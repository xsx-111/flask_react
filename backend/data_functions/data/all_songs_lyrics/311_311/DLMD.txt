DLMD Lyrics
Don’t let me down, don’t let me down again
Don’t let me down, don’t let me down again
Don’t let me down, don’t let me down again
Don’t let me down, don’t let me down again

Swelled up eye’s oh my the girl got beat
And the stupid motherfucker who made you so
That punk is a coward let that be told
I hear voices in the night that are electric
He kicks the shit out of her because he’s heartless
She won’t leave she has low self esteem
He’s got gravitational pull
Sucks her body till her heart and her limbs grow cold

Hang in there, use your head
How can I love you after you’re dead
Hang on in there, keep trying
How can I love you after dying

Here’s what you got to tell him
I’m thinking of a picture that’s keeping me in stitch
You’re causing me a mental glitch, ‘cause jealousy is such a bitch
I hereby emancipate myself from that
You can consider yourself free to flirt and chat
With whoever you want, it should have always been that way
The way that you flaunt the way that you play
My mind is blank slate I’m pretending you’re erased
You cannot let me down when I cannot see your face
Hang in there use your head
How can I love you after you’re dead
Hang on in there keep trying
How can I love you after dying

Ode to a beat up girl, I know you’re out there
Stronger than you think, stand up if you care
Get up off the ground, don’t let me down
Get up off the ground, don’t let me down

Hang in there, use your head
How can I love you after you’re dead
Hang on in there, keep trying
How can I love you after dying

And you, I’m a let you pass without kicking your ass
Because I’m above it you hurt someone I love
It takes two to make a thing go right and that’s trite
But one just to sneak and weasel through the night
If you hurt her again I’ll fuck you up
If you hurt her again I’ll fuck you up, fuck you up
If you hurt her again I’ll fuck you up
If you hurt her again I’ll fuck you up, fuck you up1Embed
