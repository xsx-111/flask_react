Purpose Lyrics
I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I’ll never see you again, then again, who knows?
Make me quiver, hands will shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
But it’s slow going, something’s showing, yeah, yeah

They say love is a stream that will find its own course
Making due is a thing, a thing I will do no more
Whenever you come back I’ll be waiting
Trifling the slack, no head gating
This is all pure fiction, you know that’s right
Just pure fiction, that’s alright

I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I’ll never see you again, then again, who knows?
Make me quiver, hands will shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
But it’s slow going, something’s showing, yeah, yeahEmbed
