Sweet Lyrics
Take a chance on something star you gotta
All the live long day
If I had to name one thing would data
Be hard pressed to say
You can say that I’m gushy, at least you know what I think
I know that I’m lucky, I know you’re on the brink
You got it good, good, good you got it good, so good
You make up ridiculous words which mean exactly nothing
I know just what you mean and that’s the funny thing
It’s understood, it’s understood

Buddy, buddy, buddy, I know why you wander
Through the sweetness on the ground, the sweetness of the flowers
You make your way on a cloudy day, you’ve got to move
The world you prove is too sweet, yeah

We parted much too soon, I know, but that’s how it goes
There’s someone better out there for you and me
Can’t wait to get on the road and feel the shows
And be like phenomenon 1 and 2 and 3
I don’t mean to brag and I don’t mean to boast
But I am the guy could that give you the most
It’s good, good, good, it’s understood
Buddy, buddy, buddy, I know why you wander
Through the sweetness on the ground, the sweetness of the flowers
You make your way on a cloudy day, you’ve got to move
The world you prove is too sweet, yeah1Embed
