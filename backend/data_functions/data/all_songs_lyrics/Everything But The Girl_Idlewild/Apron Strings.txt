Apron Strings Lyrics
Apron strings hanging empty
Crazy things my body tells me
I want someone to tie to my lonely apron strings

Apron strings waiting for you
Pretty things that I could call you
I want someone to tie to my lonely apron strings

Your baby looks just like you when you were young
And he looks at me with eyes that shine
And I wish that he were mine
Then I go home to my

Apron strings, cold and lonely
For time brings thoughts that only
Will be quiet when someone clings to my apron strings

And I'll be perfect in my own way
When you cry I will be there
I'll sing to you and comb your hair
All your troubles I will share
For apron strings can be used for other things
Than what they're meant for
And you'd be happy wrapped in my apron strings
You'd be happy wrapped in my apron stringsEmbed
