Love Is Here Where I Live LyricsMy three guardian angels say
Each time you smile that way
Dangers lies that way
No-one will believe me
For that sort of thing's beneath me
But I keep repeating three words
It won't last, it won't last
I've been here before it will pass
Don't say I'm mercenary
That's unnecessary
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here here where I live
Desire is a child that clings
And I know the trouble it brings
I remind myself each minute
My home is here and my love is in it
But that's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here where I live
So I keep repeating three words
It won't last, it won't last
I've been here before it does pass
Reason is unkind
But still I'll know next time
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I liveEmbed
