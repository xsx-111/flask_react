Living on Honeycomb Lyrics
Outside the fair still rages
Young men the wrath of ages in their heads
Fight for the comfort of their beds
And inside here we lie alone
Living on honeycomb
You've guessed, truly we are blessed

My love is like the raging seas
The wind that knocks the birds out of the trees
I'm at home, living on honeycomb

Where would I be without you?
Giving my love just the same
To a man who couldn't even spell my name
Or hoping for a wintry smile
From every hard-faced passerby
Or the man who runs the crooked coconut shy

My love is like the raging seas
The wind that knocks the birds out of the trees
I'm at home, living on honeycomb
You always were the best my friend
On the ruthless rifle range
And I'm glad to see you haven't changed
But the big wheel frightened me you see
Made me dizzy now my head is spinning
Take me back home to my bed

My love is like the raging seas
The wind that knocks the birds out of the trees
I'm at home, living on honeycomb

Living on honeycomb
Living on honeycomb
Living on honeycomb
I'm at home
Living on honeycomb
Living on honeycomb
Living on honeycombEmbed
