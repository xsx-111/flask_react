Hang Out the Flags Lyrics
Born on a stage
Undersize and underage
But when she sang good
Mama said she could
Sing the world away
She made the shopgirls cry
They said, "That woman's life
Is tragic and pathetic
And just like mine"

Can you sleep without the light?
Well hang out the flags tonight

It was Judy Garland who
Did all your suffering for you
Slept alone so you could
Stay home and feel blue
But she cried, "Look at me
I'm sad and you're happy
Yes, I'm great
And you're second rate
But I wish that I could be
Sleeping without the light
Hanging out the flags tonight"

Don't tamper with the clock, my dear
Romance has been dead for years

Can you sleep without the light?
Oh, hang out the flags tonight
Can you sleep without the light?
Oh, hang out the flags tonight

What went wrong with my life?
What went wrong with my life?Embed
