Lonesome for a Place I Know Lyrics
So here we are in Italy
With a sun hat and a dictionary
The air is warm, the sky is bright
Your arms are brown, you're sleeping well at night
So why does England call?
The hedgerows and town halls
After all, there'll soon be nothing left at all

If we were born outside of place and time
To make our choice, well this would be mine
To live and die under a sun that shines
But something pulls, something I can't define
Tells me England calls, whatever she's done wrong
Always calls, "This is where you belong"

I'm lonesome for a place I know
Yes, I'm lonesome for a place I know

Oh but Florence you tempt me here to stay
Amidst your hills to while my years away
But your roots in soil lie, mine in paving stone
And I hate what it's become, but in my bones
I'm lonesome for a place I know
Yes, I'm lonesome for a place I know
Why does England call?
I'm lonesome for a place I know
Why does England call?
I'm lonesome for a place I know
Yes, I'm lonesome for a place I know
Why does England call?
I'm lonesome for a place I knowEmbed
