How About Me? Lyrics
It's over, all over
And soon somebody else
Will tell the world about you
But how about me?
It's over, all over
And soon somebody else
Will make a fuss about you
But how about me?
You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten
And maybe a baby
Will climb upon your knee
And put his arms about you
But how about me?

You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten
And maybe a baby
Will climb upon your knee
And put his arms about you
But how about me?Embed
