Blue Moon Rose Lyrics
I have a friend and she comes from the high plains
Wise as the hills and fresh as the rains
Took me an atlas to find her town
And to realise that the world is round

I have a friend and she taught me daring
Threw back the windows and let the air in
She taught me how to be easy too
And I had lots of unlearning to do

For all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
Oh for all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose

I have a friend and we talk about books
She comes around and she drinks while I cook
She seems at home in this tiny place
But with her she brings wide open space

And all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
Oh for all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
(For all she knows)
I have a friend and she comes from the high plains
(Bless my blue moon rose)
Wise as the hills and fresh as the rains
(Oh for all she knows)
She seems at home in this tiny place
(Bless my blue moon rose)
But with her she brings wide open space

For all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
Oh for all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
Oh for all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
Oh for all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
Bless my blue moon rose

I have a friend, we talk about books
She comes around and she drinks while I cook
I have a friend, she taught me daring
Threw back the windows and let the air inEmbed
