I Always Was Your Girl Lyrics
I know you're down again
And you see nothing but rain
You put your friends through hell
And that's why we get along so well

You see, I always was your girl
It always will be you and me against the world

We know the years can give
Romance to the street where we once lived
You wondered why no one called
Between you and me, we scared them all

You see, I always was your girl
It always has been you and me against the world


Maybe we're wrong and the world is right
But don't tell me that tonight
Self-assured and abusing guests
That's the way I like you best
You see, I always was your girl
It always will be you and me against the world
You see, I always was your girl
It always will be you and me against the worldEmbed
