Home From Home Lyrics
Oh, I wish you could be here to see the flowers
They only smell so sweet since you’ve been gone
And on the day you left they bloom for hours
To compensate me for what you had done

Oh, but I don’t wish misfortune on your head
For I’m as much to blame on when all is said

So wherever you may be
And in whichever land you roam
I hope there'll always be
A place you can call home from home

And I wish you could be here to see the baby
She's growing and she's walking now so tall
And I’m a working woman now and maybe
A child don’t need a daddy much at all

And yes I’ve got a front door and a bed
Oh, but a home's more than a roof above your head
So wherever you may be
And in whichever land you roam
I hope there'll always be
A place you can call home from home
And whoever you love
And how many good friends you know
I hope you'll always have
A place you can call home from home
A home from homeEmbed
