Another Day, Another Dollar Lyrics
I went up to the Hollywood hills
The sun was shining and the sky was blue
I thought this is no place for me
You can dream what you like
This is not my history

This is the place where stars have died
This is the place where madmen reside
There's a drunk shouting 'bout who must die
What the hell do I know about this life?

Oh, get me on the next plane home
London, all is forgiven
Two weeks shaking hands with fools
Well what a way to earn a living

I went out to see Marilyn's grave
Stuck in a wall and they didn't even know her name
There's just a stone in the vault of the sky
Lay me down below mountains when I die

Now, get me on the next plane home
London, all is forgiven
This place don't shine, never did
And it's no place to earn a living
When the top dogs send for me
I won't cry, though they show me their teeth
My ground I'll stand
I got my plane ticket in my other hand

So the next day I flew home
And no one had noticed I had been gone
Tinseltown you lost your bet
But taught me something I won't forget

And now I'm home
London, I'll never bother
With a place who's motto is
Another day, another dollar

Another day, another dollar
The colonels lead and the President follows
Another day, another dollar
The colonels lead and the President follows
Another day, another dollar
Another day, another dollarEmbed
