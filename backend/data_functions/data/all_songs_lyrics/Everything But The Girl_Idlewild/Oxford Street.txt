Oxford Street Lyrics
When I was ten, I thought my brother was God
He'd lie in bed and turn out the light with a fishing rod
I learned the names of all his football team
And I still remembered them when I was nineteen, yeah

Strange the things deal that I remember still
Shouts from the playground when I was home and ill
My sister taught me all that she learned there
When we grew up, we said, we'd share a flat somewhere

When I was seventeen, London meant Oxford Street

Where I grow up, there were no factories
There was a school and shops and some fields and trees
And rows of houses one by one appeared
I was born in one and lived there for eighteen years

Then when I was nineteen, I thought the Humbler would be
The gateway from my little world into the real world
But there is no real world
We live side by side and sometimes collide
When I was seventeen, London meant Oxford Street
It was a little world, I grew up in a little world
There is no real world
We live side by side and sometimes collide, yeahEmbed
