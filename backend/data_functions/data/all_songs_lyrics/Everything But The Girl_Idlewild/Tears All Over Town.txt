Tears All Over Town Lyrics
Tears all over town
Tears all over town
Tears all over town

Don't be unkind, for once be untrue
Can't pretend I care for her, only you
Just be on time, spare me your shame
For once don't mention her name
Now I cannot claim angel's wings (No no)
But mention her name and I'll wreck everything

I saw things not meant for my eyes
I was happy once and then twice
I said things I shouldn't have said
I told tales of days in your bed
In love and war there is nothing sacred

Just don't pretend, wherever you go
There are things that only I know
Because I'm sure, when she's there
That you tell a few of the secrets of yours
That I had kept for you
But I saw things not meant for my eyes
I was happy once and then twice
I said things I shouldn't have said
I told tales of days in your bed
In love and war there is nothing sacred

Tears all over town
Tears all over town
Tears all over town
Tears all over town
I saw things not meant for my eyes
I said things I shouldn't have saidEmbed
