Dyed in the Grain LyricsYou can get far too used to sharing your time
But I'm way past caring about mine
You can accustom yourself to being on your own
But you shouldn't get used to being to alone
For this is no guessing game
I love you to my shame
A love dyed in the grain
Dyed in the grain
But if lovin were easy
We wouldn't be here
Still slamming doors and ending in tears
As if were so low to be to content
We'd rather be cruel although it's not meant
This is no guessing game
I love you to my shame
A love dyed in the grain
Dyed in the grain
On a dark winter's night
I heard this couple up outside
And i was a fool i took revenge just to cover my pride
When love comes by it sweeps you up
It's hard to keep your head above water
And what is love if it's not there to take the mistakes
This is no guessing game
I love you to my shame
A love dyed in the grain
Dyed in the grain
Love you to my shame
Love dyed in the grain
Love dyed in the grain
Dyed in the grainEmbed
