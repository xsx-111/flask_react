These Early Days Lyrics
You're only two and the whole wide world revolves around you
And nothing's happened yet that you might ever wish to forget
It doesn't stay that way
If I could I'd make it stay that way
And this you will recall in after years
Though you may weary of this vale of tears

These days remember
Always remember

You're only two and I've no wish to worry you
So pay no mind to those who say the world is unkind
That's just something they've read
And if I could I'd strike them dead
And this you will recall in after years
Though you may weary of this vale of tears

These days remember
Always remember (Yeah)

And honey there's no rush
The world will wait for you to grow up
And this you will recall in after years
Though you may weary of this vale of tears
These early days
Remember always

I hope you never change
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James
Don't ever change
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James
These early days
I hope you never change
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James
Remember always
Don't ever change
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James
These early days
Remember always
I hope you never change
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James
These early days
Don't ever change
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James
Remember alwaysEmbed
