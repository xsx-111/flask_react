Druganaut LyricsHello Mr. Holy Hands
Blood in the sky
Said, are you freedom man
Oh, are you freedom man
Oh, we're young and fast
Lighting up the sky
Lighting up the sky
Sweet, sweet druganaut
Oh, rocket, rocket launch
Hello Mr. Holy Hands
Blood in the sky
Said, are you freedom man
Oh, are you freedom man
Oh, we're young and fast
Lighting up the sky
Lighting up the skyEmbed
