Faulty Times LyricsI was seventeen
In nineteen thirty-three
Splitting out of my seams
Can't you see what I've seen?
I'll be one one four
By the third world war
Faulty times
Faulty times
Let's smoke some kill
And get outta this place
Lived a life of crime
Since about grade nine
So whose side you on?
Whose side you on?
But ain't it a loss
A dental floss?
Faulty times
Faulty times
Let's smoke some kill
And get outta this place
'Cause nobody likes your
Fucked up plans
Of shooting up some foreign land
That's spread it's weight
In spite of all your laws
That's spread it's weight
In spite of all your laws
I was seventeen
In nineteen thirty-three
Splitting out of my seams
Can't you see what I've seen?
I'll be one one four
By the third world war
Faulty times
Faulty times
Let's smoke some kill
And get outta this place
'Cause nobody likes your
Fucked up plans
Of shooting up some foreign land
That's spread it's weight
In spite of all your laws
That's spread it's weight
In spite of all your lawsEmbed
