Modern Music LyricsA-one, two, three
Another pop explosion
A-one, two, three
Another hit recording
A-four, five six
Seven eight, nine ten
Four, five six
Seven eight, nine ten
A horse was maimed
Running Wild on freeway
A man was killed standing still in his doorway
That song was playing
We all said 'no way!'
That song was playing
We all said 'no way!'
A-one, two, three
Another pop explosion
A-one, two, three
Another hit recording
A-four, five six
Seven eight, nine ten
Four, five six
Seven eight, nine ten
A horse was maimed
Running Wild on freeway
A man was killed standing still in his doorway
That song was playing
We all said 'no way!'
That song was playing
We all said 'no way!'
Oh we can't stand
All (of) your modern music
Oh we feel afflictedEmbed
