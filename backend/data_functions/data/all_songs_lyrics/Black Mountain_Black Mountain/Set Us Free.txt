Set Us Free LyricsThere are killers
In this town
Killer, killers
With all their killer plans
A war is on the horizon
Won't you let us be
The war machine keeps on rolling
Evil minds and hearts of stone
Have you done more
Than you can swallow?
Lord, won't you set us free?
There are killers
In this town
Killer, killers
With all their killer plans
A war is on the horizon
Lord, won't you let us be
And set us free
And overthrow your war machine
And let us be
And set us free
And set us free
And let us beEmbed
