No Satisfaction LyricsO, muse
I'm embarassed
Of what happened
Let's light up your down
And get things happening
We can't get no satisfaction
We can't get no satisfaction
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Miss contractions
Let's light up your down
And get things happening
We can't get no satisfaction
'Cause everybody likes to
Claim things
And everybody likes to
Shame things
And everybody likes to
Clang bells around
O, muse
I'm embarassed
Of what happened
Let's light up your down
And get things happening
We can't get no satisfaction
We can't get no satisfaction
'Cause everybody likes to
Claim things
And everybody likes to
Shame things
Hang around
They like to clang around
'Cause everybody likes to
Claim things
And everybody likes to
Shame things
And everybody likes to
Clang bells aroundEmbed
