Summer Rain Lyrics
Whispering our goodbyes waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him saying: "Nothing will change
Come dance with me, baby, in the summer rain"
I remember the rain on his skin
And his kisses hotter than the Santa Ana winds
Whispering our goodbyes waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I remember laughing 'til we almost cried
There at the station that night
I remember looking in his eyes

Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh, my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain, oh, summer

I can hear the whistle, military train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him singing: "Oh, love is strange
Come dance with me, baby in the summer rain"
I remember the rain pouring down
And we poured our hearts out
As the train pulled out
I can see my baby waving from the train
It was the last time that I saw him in the summer rain
Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Ooh, summer
Every time I see the lightning
Every time I hear the thunder
Every time I close the window
When this happens in the summer
Oh, the night is so inviting
I can feel that you were so close
I can feel you when the wind blows
Blows right through my heart

Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh, my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Every night and every day now
Though I know you've gone away
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I sayEmbed
