Valentine Lyrics
I made a rule about you
I made a plan for getting my feet back on the ground
Bury my face in the clouds for hours on end
But time only flies when you're around

It was cold and dark the last time I saw you
Your hair was long and falling in your eyes
You said my hands were warm and that I was special to you

Valentine
You know that I'm fighting this love in vain
The sun's been shining for a week
But it still feels like rain
Valentine
I know you're not mine
You're somebody else's flame
But when those hearts and flowers fade
Oh my darlin', look my way (yeah...)

You say that it's complicated
But baby you're wrong
There's nothing more obvious to me
That we're on a trip together
33,000 light years long
And I'm hurting so bad 'cause you don't see
The night you walked me home, I gave you a picture of Eden's trees falling to the ground
And now I feel, I feel like you're a perfect stranger
Without you

Valentine
You know that I'm fighting this love in vain
The sun's been shining for a week
But it still feels like rain
Valentine
I know you're not mine
And I don't know why you stay
But when those hearts and flowers fade
Oh my darlin', look my way (yeah...)


Valentine
I know you're not mine
And I don't know why you stay
But when those hearts and flowers fade
Oh my darlin', look my way (yeah....)
And I don't know why you stay
But when those hearts and flowers fade
Oh my darlin', look my way (yeah...)Embed
