Whatever It Takes Lyrics
I've seen the rain fall down
And wash away a town
I've seen strong hearts easily broken
Why do some things survive
While others live and die
How can a man let his love go unspoken

I couldn't stand to see us end up that way
Just another tragedy
And every night I promise another day

Whatever it takes
I will be there
By your side Baby anywhere
When you're lost and alone
I'll bring you home
I will come thru for you
Whatever it takes
Whatever you need
Whatever comes down between you and me
When the road gets rough
You've gotta trust
I will come thru for you
Whatever it takes
I've opened every door
I always wanted more
I didn't have much to believe in
I searched the world for you
I found what's really true
It's your love that gives me a reason

Baby it's only you who can free my heart
I can't do it on my own
You carry the light of day baby
Thru the dark

Whatever it takes
I will be there
By your side Baby anywhere
When you're lost and alone
I'll bring you home
I will come thru for you
Whatever it takes

Baby I'm bound to you to release my heart
I can't do it on my own
We'll find the light of day baby
Thru the dark
Whatever it takes
I will be there
By your side Baby anywhere
When you're lost and alone
I'll bring you home
I will come thru for you
Whatever it takes
Whatever you need
Whatever comes down between you and me
When the road gets rough
You've gotta trust
I will come thru for you
Whatever it takes
La La La La La
Whatever it takesEmbed
