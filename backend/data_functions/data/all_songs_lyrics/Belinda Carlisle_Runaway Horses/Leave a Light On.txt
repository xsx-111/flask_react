Leave a Light On Lyrics
Take my hand
Tell me what you are feeling
Understand, this is just the beginning
Although I have to go
It makes me feel like crying
I don't know when I'll see you again

Darling, leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling, leave a light on for me
'Cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe

I can't explain, I don't know
Just how far I have to go
But darling I'll keep the key
Just leave a light on for me

Yes, I know what I'm asking is crazy
You could go, just get tired of waiting
But if I lose your love
Torn out by my desire
That would be the one regret of my life
Darling, leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling, leave a light on for me
'Cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe

I can't explain, I don't know
Just how far I have to go
But darling I'll keep the key
Just leave a light on for me

Just like a spark lights up the dark
Baby, that's your heart
Baby, that's your heart
Baby, that's your heart

Darling, leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling, leave a light on for me
'Cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe
Darling, leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
I'll be all the love that you need
Darling, leave a light on for meEmbed
