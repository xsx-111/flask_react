Deep Deep Ocean Lyrics
I heard you call my name
Why do you sit in silence
When there's a whole world waiting
Between these islands?
I lay my love down to make you this bridge
But when the tide runs out
I'm still at the water's edge

There's a deep, deep ocean
I want to find out what you hide inside of that
Deep, deep ocean
What's it take for you to be satisfied
If you keep holding back emotion
One of us might drown in this deep, deep ocean

You walk alone at night
So secretive and quiet
I hear the roar of your heartbeat
So why do you deny it?
Hold me and show me my love can't be wrong
And I'll be swept away
By the storm beneath your calm
There's a deep deep ocean
I want to find out what you hide inside of that
Deep deep ocean
What's it take for you to be satisfied
If you keep holding back emotion
One of us might drown in this deep, deep ocean
This deep, deep ocean

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna be
When you gonna break and open up to me?

If you keep holding back emotion
One of us might drown in this deep, deep ocean
Deep, deep ocean
I wanna find out what you hide inside of that
Deep, deep ocean
I wanna find out how to turn the tide
There's so much more emotion
So baby take me drown in this deep, deep ocean
Deep, deep ocean
I wanna find out what you hide inside of that
Deep, deep ocean
I wanna find out how to turn the tide
There's so much more emotion
So baby take me drown in this deep, deep ocean
Deep, deep oceanEmbed
