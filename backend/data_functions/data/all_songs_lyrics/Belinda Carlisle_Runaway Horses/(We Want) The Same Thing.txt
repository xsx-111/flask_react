(We Want) The Same Thing Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

We dream the same thing
We want the same thing, oh
We dream the same thing
We want the same thing, oh

Here is my case
We've got no time to waste
'Cause we want the same thing
We're fighting a war
But we don't know what for
'Cause we want the same thing
(Want, want the same thing)

I know we're different now
Different as night and day
But still I want you
I just want you to stay
I wanna take this chance
I wanna be with you
'Cause what you're looking for
I am looking for too, ooh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
And all that we need is to see it together, oh, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
For now, for love, forever, amen

I look in your eyes
And I know deep inside
That we want the same thing
So let's break the chains
That just make us insane
'Cause we want the same thing

Hey, what's the problem here?
Can we negotiate?
I want to kiss your lips
Before it's too late

We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
And all that we need is to see it together, oh, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
For now, for love, forever, amen
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
Want the same thing
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
And all that we need is to see it together, oh, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
For now, for love, forever, amen
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, oh
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, ohEmbed
