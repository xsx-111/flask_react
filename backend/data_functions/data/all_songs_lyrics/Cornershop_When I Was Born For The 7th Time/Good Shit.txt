Good Shit LyricsHey sey owh wo
Hey hey hey
Yeh yeey yehhh
Hey oh wo wo wo wo
Heey ya yey owwhh
Feeling good behind the wheel
I talke my doctor into Confidence
2 foots racing on the man-made blues
I feel the magic of the minimum dose, checking
Out the ani-mal heads
In the animal kingdom
Taking axe unto the turbulent sea
Making it retreat
To the chorus now
To the bonus beats half
The beats of Manhattan
From the middle of the heart
I want you each and all to switch yr tiny mind on
I want you each and all to switch yr tiny mind
I want you each and all to switch yr tiny mind on
I want you each and all — God damn the pusherman
Arrrrh good shit: it's the truth, it's the truth
I'm on fireya
The flames a getting higher baybee
The flames a getting higher
I got it knee-depth down
To the good foot
Direct the traffic
On the disco floor
Free the constitution
And it won't be long
And I'm not waiting
A Ne wYork minute more
One by one
We're gonna take you lovers on
One by one
We're gonna take you lovers on
Eastern claps on the one, then on the third
And I'm thinking
What mighty God we serve
Good shit
Heavy metal from the back of a stage
Tuesdays on a Tuesday government rate
An all day sucker praising the plastic
Leg spins and the waiting
I don't give up on a good thing
I want you each and all to switch yr tiny mind on
I want you each and all to switch yr tiny mind
I want you each and all to switch yr tiny mind on
I want you each and all — God damn the pusherman
On the tail of the Lion of Judah
The flames are getting higher baybee
The flames are getting higher break it down
The flames are getting higher
The flames are getting higher baybee
The flames are getting higher
Arrh good shit
Walking intastate
With the worst attorney, Lord help me
Make your own mothers day
If feel the loneliness of headlamps
That come and pass me by
Make your own, mothers say
And that's the double root
It's the truth, it's the truthEmbed
