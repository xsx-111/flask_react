Funky Days Are Back Again LyricsWell, it seems like the funky days, they're back again
Funky funky days they're back again
And we're
In vogue again
Before the Gurkhas get called up again
Seems like the funky days are back again
And the party's got a double ee at the end again
We'll be armed in dungaree cords again
Happy days are here again my friend
Been a long journey, long long times
Many roads we couldn't climb
But once again, the name of the game is funky and it's funky again
Seems like those funky days are back again
Funky with a "y" and it's back again and back again
We'll be wearing dungaree cords again walking down that road
With a smile on our faces
Holing only embraces
Embraces to hold us cause we're getting funky again
And we're
Funky again
Seems like those funky days
Are back again
My friends we'll be wearing dungaree cords again, walking down that road
When we say party we mean it to end on the double ee
Funky roads are back again
Funky drinks are back again
Zip-zap guns are back again
Big shoes are back again
The middle eight is back again
Funky feet back again
Tax in the post is back again
Worker strikes are back again and we'll be
And we'll
Be doing the airplane wheel — dancing
Swinging like an airplane wheel — moving
Funky days are back again mar friends
Funky days are back again
Ben, you just show them how funky it can get when funky days are back in vogue again."Embed
