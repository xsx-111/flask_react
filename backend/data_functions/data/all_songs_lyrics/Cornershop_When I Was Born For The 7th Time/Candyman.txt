Candyman LyricsWell I’m the Candyman, and the Candyman is back
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
The Candyman
I’ll do my share
The Candyman
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
No, I’m the Candyman, and the Candyman is back
No, I’m the Candyman, and the Candyman is back
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet Sun
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet Sun
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet Sun
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet Sun
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
No, I’m the Candyman, and the Candyman is back

Sons and daughters of the Dharmahood, people get down
Free candy for the masses with the stereo sound
Like the Vedas and the Gitas and the breakbeat too
On the neda, on the theta Cornershop with the ?
Slapping hands with my brothers as we rise to the sun
Liaison france feel the rhythm of the rhymers you stoned
C’est mon appel, baby doll, for your pleasure tonight
Here’s to Tjinder with the sweets, we be like salt on ice, check it
Here’s to Tjinder with the sweets, we be like salt on ice, check it
And the Candyman is back
You know the Candyman is back
Justin Evan with the rhyme, the Candyman is back, so check it
Oh
I’ll do my share, the Candyman
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
No, I’m the Candyman, and the Candyman is back
Mark it clean, keep it clean now
No, I’m the Candyman, and the Candyman is back
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet Sun
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet Sun
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet Sun
Mono into your stereo soul from the backbone of the planet SunEmbed
