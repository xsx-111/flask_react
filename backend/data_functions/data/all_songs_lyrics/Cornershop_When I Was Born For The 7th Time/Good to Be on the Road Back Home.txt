Good to Be on the Road Back Home LyricsAnd by the time that she gets home
She'll realise that I am gone
I'll be sitting in a back bar drinkin'
Drinking to my friends
And drinking to my foes
For both keep a young heart moving
It's good to be on the trail
From where my heart set sail
Puttin anchor down
For friends and good beer
So I'll have another one
Then I'll be moving on
It's good to be on the road back home again. Again
And by the time that he arrives
He will read, I have lied
He'll go drinking to his friends and to his foes
But drinking in the devil
That tears one apart, leaving
Memories of what should have been and wasn't
Son petit business
In Tokyo town
Italy for the apples
To where my heart is now
Now it's giddy up or whoa
And I'm afraid it's good to be back on the road home."
It's good to be on the road back home again. Again
I swear I meant to leave Chattanooga, but"
But I had another one
And I realised where I'd gone
And I realised what I'd done
I need to be on the first bus back
Into her arms
It's good to be on the road back home
Too many nights
In dirty London town
Italy for the apples
To where my heart is now
For I've lost myself, searchin'
For what I ain't
It's good to be on the road back home again
Leave Chattanooga
Walk in to New York City
Aeroplane down to Nippon ground
Meets some friends in Tokyo-town
Across to West Maluva
Slowboat to West Malay
Leave my foes to their woes
Sometimes "that's how it goes"
It's good to be on the road back home again1Embed
