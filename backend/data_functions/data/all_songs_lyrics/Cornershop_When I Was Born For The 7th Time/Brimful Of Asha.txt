Brimful Of Asha Lyrics
Mai Keha Sadi Asha Jhinah Sadian Sukh Sabelian Nu Din Raat Nu Aoondian Hain, Kimarh Karke

There's dancing, behind movie scenes
Behind the movie scenes - Sadi Rani
She's the one that keeps the dream alive
From the morning, past the evening
Till the end of the light

Brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty-five

And dancing, behind movie scenes
Behind those movie screens - Asha Bhosle
She's the one that keeps the dream alive
From the morning, past the evening
Till the end of the light

Brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty-five
And singing, illuminate the main streets and the cinema aisles
We don't care about no government warning
About that promotion of the simple life
And the dams they're building

Brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Brimful of Asha on the forty-five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty-five

Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Mine's on the forty-five
