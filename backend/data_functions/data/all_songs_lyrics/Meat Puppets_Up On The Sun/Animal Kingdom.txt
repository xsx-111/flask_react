Animal Kingdom Lyrics
Down in the valley
There's an animal kingdom
You can't even see it
'Til the sun goes down

Up in the mountains
There's beautiful rings
On fingers that dance
To invisible sound

Up in my head
There's an animal kingdom
I am the king
Of the animals there

Up in the mountains
I'm a beautiful singer
To birds that dance
On invisible air1Embed
