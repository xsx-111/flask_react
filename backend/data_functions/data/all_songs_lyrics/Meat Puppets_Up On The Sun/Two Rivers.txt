Two Rivers Lyrics
Two rivers rolling by
Two waters, side by side
Never touching, they remain
Two rivers with many names

When they meet the waters change
Two waters, one name
River flows with many names
Water leading water's aim

Finding ways to change again
Finding yet another name
Water leading, water's aim

Two rivers side by side
Two waters side by side
Two rivers rolling by
Two waters side by side
Two rivers rolling byEmbed
