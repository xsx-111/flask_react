Creator Lyrics
Everybody's got some kind of belief about creator
Some say openly, I don't know
Some build elevators
To take the chosen few
Who can afford the scenic view
To the top of some big tower looking out on fields of blue
Walking clouds on caves of emptiness
That fall around their minds
To flirt openly with vapor and the trail it leaves behind

Fences fly and sidewalks cry
Concerning our creator
Turning loose the butterfly
That ate the alligator
Picking up its open-ended holographic roots
It moved out to the tower to look down on me and you
Walking caves of empty water in the boring morning rain
Making love to open windows and the vapor trails' refrainEmbed
