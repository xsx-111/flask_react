Up on the Sun Lyrics
A long time ago
I turned to myself and said
You, you are my daughter

I saw that the image
I saw it was real
So you are my daughter
Then maybe we've got something to talk about

Who told you so
That gold burns slow
Like coal camper's candles
All lost in the snow

Now you are my daughter
Then maybe we've got something to talk about

Lay down, you're on
The warmth that I'm weaving
Is for you alone
Up on the sun
Where it never rains or snows
There's an ocean
With a wind that never blows
And if you see it closer
Then the finer points will show
Not too much more
Too much more4Embed
