Swimming Ground Lyrics
The sun is up and beating down
It's hot enough to melt the ground
A little water would do us good
The clouds would help us if they could

They'd send showers of pouring rain
Get everything wet again
We could go and float around
In our favorite swimming ground

Best place I ever found
Wasn't close to any town
Was a little swimming ground
Everything just floating around

We're out to lunch and out of town
Pretty close to falling down
A little water would do us good
The clouds would help us if they could

They'd send showers of pouring rain
Get everything wet again
We could go and float around
In our favorite swimming ground
Best place I ever found
Wasn't close to any town
Was a little swimming ground
Everything just floating around
Best place I ever found
Wasn't close to any town
Was a little swimming ground
Everything just floating around

The sun is up and beating down
It's hot enough to melt the ground
A little water would do us good
The clouds would help us if they could

They'd send showers of pouring rain
Get everything wet again
We could go and float around
In our favorite swimming ground

Best place I ever found
Wasn't close to any town
Was a little swimming ground
Everything just floating around
Best place I ever found
Wasn't close to any town
Was a little swimming ground
Everything just floating aroundEmbed
