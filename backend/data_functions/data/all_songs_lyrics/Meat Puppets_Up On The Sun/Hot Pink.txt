Hot Pink Lyrics
Hot pink volcano in the heart of the tornado
Is shaking the lemonade tree
Hot pink forest is backed by a furnace
That boils the lemonade free

And they all went down
Tomorrow is a number

Hot pink apple, a sweet golden dimple
Has stuck its claim in me
Hot pink rubber, it comes in every color
And every style that you pleaseEmbed
