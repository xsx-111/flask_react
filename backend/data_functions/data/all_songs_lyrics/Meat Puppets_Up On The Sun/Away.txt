Away Lyrics
Away

Been on the road a dozen times now
Within the leeway, behind the sand house
The fascinatin' book of strings
Picks the leaves that drift down in between

Suns to lift up in between
They told some stories like you've never seen
They just let everything drift down in between
Suns to lift up in between


Mine to lift up and to follow
In the steps of fluids hollow
Without time we pick up all the streams
To find the leaves that drift down in between
