Poor Judge LyricsFalling for you was always falling up
Leather books and surplus government chairs
I rose like smoke, or the steam from your cup
A wave of heat where the lighter flares
You might have found some other reason
To burn me like a tissue screen
My heart is a poor judge
And it harbors an old grudge
Falling for you was a walk off a cliff
A dream of a car with the brake lines cut
The only way you can stop it is if
You turn around, keep the windows shut
You might have found some other reason
To leave me in that dark ravine
My heart is a poor judge
And it harbors an old grudge
And I can see your light on
Calling me back to make the same mistake again
And I'll say no, when you ask me, no, when you ask me, no when you ask again
'Cause I won't let it past me, won't let it past me, won't let it  past til I see that I'm last and then...
Falling for you was a last ditch plan
You sized me up with your thumb on the scale
I came up short, but you do what you can
The hammer's nothing without the nail
You might have had some other reason
To lead me to the guillotine
But your heart is a poor judge
And it harbors an old grudge
And I can see your light on
Calling me back to make the same mistake againEmbed
