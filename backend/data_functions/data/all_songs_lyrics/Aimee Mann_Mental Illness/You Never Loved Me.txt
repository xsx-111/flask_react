You Never Loved Me Lyrics
Boy, when you go, you go
Three thousand miles just so I'll know
You never loved me
You never loved me

Then when you're gone, you're gone
I know the tumbleweed lexicon:
You never loved me
You never loved me

Three thousand miles to sit in a room
With a vanishing groom
'Til it undoes me
A helium cell like a hermit crab shell
Was a blank, you could tell
It never was me
'Cause you will never love me
You never loved me

Boy, when you're through, you're through
Nobody argues the point like you
You never loved me
You never loved me
And hey, when you're right, you're right
We'll stipulate that I lost the fight
You never loved me
You never loved me

Three thousand miles to sit in a room
With a vanishing groom
'Til it undoes me
A helium cell like a hermit crab shell
Was a blank, you could tell
It never was me
'Cause you will never love me
You never loved meEmbed
