Rollercoasters Lyrics
Rollercoasters and ferris wheels
You like how it feels
'Round and 'round 'til you lose yourself in the air
All those complicated deals
Your desperate appeals
Calling out to a god you know isn't there

So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees
And all you can do is say
"Please, please, baby, please
Please, please, baby, please"

You were conjuring that year
A ghost engineer
Building gods who could put the clock in reverse
Breathing thinner atmosphere
So thin you could hear
Angels telling you "boy, you're making it worse"

So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees
And all you can do is say
"Please, please, baby, please
Please, please, baby, please"
Please give me height
Spirals or spite
Falling or flight, the boosters ignite

So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees
So high
And all you can do is say
"Please, please, baby, please
Please, please, baby, please"

Rollercoasters and ferris wheels
You like how it feelsEmbed
