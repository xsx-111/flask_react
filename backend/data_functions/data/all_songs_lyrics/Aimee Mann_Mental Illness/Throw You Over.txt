Throw You Over LyricsI'm probably going to throw you over
I'm probably going to throw you over
'Cause your heart is like a wheel
It'll turn and crush you under its heel
Oh baby I know how you feel
'Cause I'm probably going to throw you over
I'm probably going to hold you hostage
I'm probably going to hold you hostage
'Cause you'll rarely see me well
So you'll just believe each story I tell
Hope springs as eternal as hell
'Cause I'm probably going to hold you hostage
Oh, say, can you see by
The light of my dreams
The delusions and the plotting and schemes...
And if you could tell by
The rocket's red glare
You could see yourself that nobody's there
'Cause I'm probably going to hold you hostage
I'm probably going to pull you under
I'm probably going to pull you under
'Cause a love is not a kiss
And a win is not this shoddy near-miss
How sad that you drove me to this
'Cause i'm probably going to pull you under
Oh, say, can you see by
The light of my dreams
The delusions and the plotting and schemes...
And if you could tell by
The rocket's red glare
You could see yourself that nobody's there
'Cause I'm probably going to pull you under1Embed
