Stuck In the Past Lyrics
Stuck in the past
Like drawing rings around Saturn
A shadow was cast
But now it follows a pattern

I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
But you could
I had hopes, but the hopes all fell
Leveled with the smell
Of new wood

Stuck in the past
A planet only on paper
Guess I'm the last
A living memory, a vapor

I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
Like you could
I had hopes, but that's just because
Hoping was a well
Where you stood
I had all this time while Houston dozed
Where I almost had a line composed
But the moment passed, the hatches closed

Stuck in the past
Where I'll be pulling that lever
It happens so fast
And then it happens forever

I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
Like you could

Stuck in the past
Just drawing rings around Saturn2Embed
