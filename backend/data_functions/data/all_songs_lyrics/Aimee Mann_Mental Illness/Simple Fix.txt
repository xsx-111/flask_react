Simple Fix LyricsHere we go again, around and round
Here we go again, around and round
We're babies passing for adults
Who've loaded up their catapults
And can't believe the end results
So here we go again
Here we go again, it's obvious
Here we go again, the two of us
We've just become our worst mistakes
The rattles of two rattlesnakes
The antidote that no one takes
So here we go again
But let's call a spade a spade
I’m going nowhere
I’m stuck in this hole, afraid to make a move
So once more around the track, another lap
And I think I can get it back, to where we prove:
There's a simple fix for all this
It's a simple fix for all this
Here we go again, back to the well
Here we go although we both can tell
We're just campaigning for the win
The prizes of adrenaline
We act it out, so it stays in
So here we go again
But let's call a spade a spade
I’m going nowhere
I’m stuck in this hole, afraid to make a move
So once more around the track, another lap
And I think I can get it back, to where we prove:
There's a simple fix for all this
It's a simple fix for all thisEmbed
