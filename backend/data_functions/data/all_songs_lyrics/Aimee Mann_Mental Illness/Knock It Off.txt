Knock It Off LyricsSeattle finally couldn't hold her
It made no difference what you told her
You say you're sorry but now what is that?
You oughta knock it off
You had your chances but now they're gone
Oh baby knock it off
You can't just stand there on her front lawn
An overdose is almost clearer
A diagnosis is a mirror
You can't unsee it when you look like that
You oughta knock it off
You had your chances but now they're gone
Oh baby knock it off
You can't just stand there on her front lawn
C'mon get in the car, it's over
You're just building up more regret
You don't get any four-leaf clover yet
You can't look sideways or behind you
I'm sure she knows just where to find you
She made her choices and now that is that
You oughta knock it off
You had your chances but now they're gone
Oh baby knock it off
You can't just stand thereEmbed
