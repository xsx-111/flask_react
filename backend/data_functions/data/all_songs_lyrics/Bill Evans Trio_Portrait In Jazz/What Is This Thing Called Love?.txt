What Is This Thing Called Love? LyricsWhat is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love
Just who can solve its mystery?
And why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there, one wonderful day
But you took my heart and you threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lord up in heaven above
Just what is this thing called love?Embed
