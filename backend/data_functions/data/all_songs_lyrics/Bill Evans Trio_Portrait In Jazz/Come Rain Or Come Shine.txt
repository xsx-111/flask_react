Come Rain Or Come Shine LyricsI'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
We'll be happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be fine?
The days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be fine?
The days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shineEmbed
