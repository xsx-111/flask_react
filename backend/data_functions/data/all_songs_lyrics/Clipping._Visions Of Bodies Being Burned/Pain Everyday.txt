Pain Everyday Lyrics
Death wasn't really the worst part
Time spent floating above is
Body done, that's when the hurt start
They call it passing, that's not it, they lying
Fuck them altars and headstones
Who they think all them flowers for?
Can't smell nothing, you just bones
They cry a little less every hour, so that must be real nice
Cross in the earth marks
End when everything began
Death scars looking like birthmarks
Take for granted they free standing

Y'all should grab one right by the dream space
Makе one scream until she pray
Makе one run until he dead
Make one break until they leave
The body hurts, see the body gone
So who body make up for all the wrongs done to bodies?
They keep singin' they songs while your body rot
Well, fuck it, come on, they gotta pay

Chase the dreamer, chase the dreamer, fuck it up
Shake the dreamer, shake the dreamer, wake it up and that will
Make the dreamer hate the dreamer, cut it up
Break the dream, awake the demon, run it up then you can
Get into the head where they tried to make sense of senses, start their sixth
Let 'em know the dead levitating just ahead and they best not slip
True, because you bled out doesn't mean you ever left and that's that shit
Everyone is scared and they telling all their secrets, don't that sound like
Snitch behavior, snitch behavior? Zip it up
Kiss the fear and simply savor, lick it up
That tastes like wishes made by twisted prayers, rip it up
Split the vision, mince the savior, get the guts
Then you will grab one right by the dream space
Make one scream until she pray
Make one run until he dead
Make one break until they leave
The body hurts, see the body gone
So who body make up for all the wrongs done to bodies?
They keep singin' they songs while your body rot
Well, fuck it, come on, they gotta pay

All the living sweat in the afterlife
But ain't nothing after life but the pain from the way you died
And something reminiscent of hunger
But if you had a stomach only satiated by making somebody run
See that to the edge of the screen in the video?
Hear that hissing away in the back of the track?
Be that, you could live in the glitch, the digital
They fear that, they should fear that, they gon' fear that
You are here forever, here forever, fuck it up
Miss the moment, end is never gonna come
You stuck so make the most, you make the omens, get the gun
Watch the mortals blow they brains out, that was fun

That's why you grab one right by the dream space
Make one scream until she pray
Make one run until he dead
Make one break until they leave
The body hurts, see the body gone
So who body make up for all the wrongs done to bodies?
They keep singin' they songs while your body rot
Well, fuck it, come on, they gotta pay3Embed
