Enlacing Lyrics
Get your ass down to the floor

You're so gone
Ten toes down but nothing to stand on
Get a handle on yourself, hands are clammy, hands are cold
Gotta hand it to the host, the music choice is perfect
And the lights are like the last light you liked on the horizon
And the life you like was laughable, it's done and you're expiring
(Hahaha) Why you say that? Wide awake and why did they laugh?
While the way the blinds can play that, tattoo stripes across the face that—
Wait, how you looking at your face when your face is on your face?
This is somеthing you should face, you should— fuck, this song slap, though
All their faces facing wrong looking at what got you lost
Can't thеy see they seeing backwards? Ugh, somebody turn this shit up
Everything's frozen, the world is fast and now look at them go
All of the cataracts floating outside of your vision are inching in, what do they know?
They are just dust, they are just birds, they are just dragons, they are just nerves
Up to the end, are they getting closer? Are they spilling words?
Is their shattered mirror picture clearer than yours?

And it feel like
Get your ass down to the floor
You'll never know, you'll never know, you ain't so special when everything glows
And it's so gone over you, it's so gone over you
You so gone, it's all gone and it's long overdue
You got nothing to prove, you are nothing, you know
All that you have to do is try to get your ass down to the floor
Pick up the pieces
Pick up the cues like a human
See, what you need is—
Fuck are you doing?
Riding 'round euphoria with hammers out the window
Whistle Crip and crack a rainbow, make it rain dance for your people
Put a pound of joy up in a pill then crush it down to powder
Let it sit under your tongue and check back in about a hour
It's that lover love and lost, it's that lost that lovin' feelin'
It's that base jump from the window while you dancing on the ceiling
It's that (Whoop), geeked up, it's that sky, it's deeper
Than that pool you swim in, you inside the speaker
It's your song, sling that tightrope, walk the skin inside your teeth
Call that floss and bleeding diamonds, fine if you could only reach
Ones up in the sky is smiling, they so fine and they so far
And you so small and so you find that you've been wishing on a star
Do you feel that?

And it feel like
Get your ass down to the floor
You'll never know, you'll never know, you ain't so special when everything glows
And it's so gone over you, it's so gone over you
You so gone, it's all gone and it's long overdue
You got nothing to prove, you are nothing, you know
All that you have to do is try to get your ass down to the floor
Things you seen since last you saw yourself would turn a man to dust
The things you dreamed in lieu of all the hells were just imagination 'cause
You couldn't bear to see the limit of yourself for what it was
The good you wear on sleeves just isn't much
Your body is a drug you love, you crush
Make the most of magic, map the math of it
Master mouthpiece and extract the past from it
Plummet, plumb it, plum pit, fruit
Summit, some shit, sunk ship, loot
Loop, feedback, look, see that
Bloody sack, you used to be that
The mind is a façade
The blind idiot god
Will guide to your demise
So fine, let it be gone

Get your ass down to the floor
You'll never know, you'll never know, you ain't so special when everything glows
And it's so gone over you, it's so gone over you
You so gone, it's all gone and it's long overdue
You got nothing to prove, you are nothing, you know
All that you have to do is try to get your ass down to the floor10Embed
