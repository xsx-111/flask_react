Make Them Dead Lyrics
Fear, hate, anger, murder and illness

Starve in the fashion
March into action
Charge for the passion
Carve every last one
Hope in the morning
Cope with the mourning
Soap for the pouring
Rope for the scoring, make them

(Dead)
Walk forward with eyes closed, don't them say they believers?
(Dead)
Ain't they brought they bibles? Do they dare deceive? (Make them)
(Dead)
Step up to the cliff so they can count the blessed
(Dead)
Only the wicked men fall to they death, so (Make them)

Eye for an eye is no eye here
Blind eye defy with no idea
Time fine feline and bitch try deal
But they can't not remind of why time feels
Not in they favor, so they tongues
Wag too much and them love they guns
God, them say savior so make fun
When them end comes out of the thing they fund
Run, run, ruler and run, run, thief
Run, run, run under some belief
Who's your god? Why did he bequeath
Hate when what you sow you shall reap?
Reaper the name and ripper too
Come from tradition just like you
Found fathers found in same-same crew
So no need, no judge, know just what to do
(Dead)
Walk forward with eyes closed, don't them say they believers?
(Dead)
Ain't they brought they bibles? Do they dare deceive? (Make them)
(Dead)
Step up to the cliff so they can count the blessed
(Dead)
Only the wicked men fall to they death, so (Make them)

Free in the future
Seethe in a stupor
Grieve for the chooser
Leave with a suture
Hands for the contrite
Bans for the gun rights
Scan, can they run right?
Stand in the sunlight, make them

(Dead)
Walk forward with eyes closed, don't them say they believers?
(Dead)
Ain't they brought they bibles? Do they dare deceive? (Make them)
(Dead)
Step up to the cliff so they can count the blessed
(Dead)
Only the wicked men fall to they deathEmbed
