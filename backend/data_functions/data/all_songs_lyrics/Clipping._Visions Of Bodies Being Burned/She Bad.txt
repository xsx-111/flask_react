She Bad Lyrics
It's 200 years of rust on a gate
It wind up like a toy when the wind plays, kid shit
She was blowing before the wind, tell them, Blowsy
Tell them, blood moon, tell them, low fog
Tell them, dirt road with the rust mailbox at the turn off
Turn of the century, turn vogue of late, she feel fly
She cry out like a whisper in time
They heard she got that spiderweb (Spiderweb), that snake eye drippin'
Got that dust skin (Dust skin), the fork tongue lickin' for the scent
Shе said, "Come on" (Come on), in the hеad, though
Remember that wood shed somewhere in the memory that's way past dead, though?
Like the leaves are brown and the sky is grey and the dreams are shit and the mama ran away
Papa drank the gut black, you smoke the Backwoods and now the woods call you back
The woods whisper off in wind in the underbrush under skin, the Earth crawling all the touch
Back to the mouse, back to the snake
Back to the, back to the root, back to the day
Back to the back to the fire, back to the way the wood burned
Back when they told you she couldn't stay
And the left looks right when the leaves break sun and the fall camo
On moss so soft that you can't tell steps from breath, but they say she don't walk, she float (She float)
She float, folklore is a bitch
But the Sun will be dipping soon below the ridge
And the boards on the bridge are unstable at best
And it sways dangerously, a regular test
For the village kids, but that's they though
And this night light ain't the same, so
You got jokes? Oh, this a game? Okay
Go 'cross, wait, let the tapes roll
She bad, though, she bad, though
Come and get your picture, trick, she bad, though
Can't see the forest through the trees
Everybody come to get them some, but don't nobody leave
Don't nobody leave, do not move no leaf
She bad, though, blow before the breeze
And before the ice freeze it all over, come and see
Everybody come to get them some, but don't nobody leave

You ride squad (Squad) to the coven
(You got jokes?) Got all the phones running
But no bars up on the hillside long forgotten by the future
And the jokes flow real easy and the whiskey is a booster
It's 200 years of rust on the gate
It's an unrelenting crunch underfoot, the leaves deep
The autumn left elm skeletons still alive, skin and bone
Lumino for the new approaching blood remarking, "How beautiful"
And the old cabin maintains a dilapidated charm, they call it rustic
Clothesline hanging across the yard, probably shouldn't trust it
Though the sheets are worn, are they worn enough? That math doesn't add up
And she laughed like the wind 'cause that's shit they don't ever think of
Kid shit, dinner talk, let 'em walk
Let 'em enjoy mountain air
It's her breath, it's a gift
Let 'em get more comfortable
Start a fire, have a smoke
Take a drink, take a flick
What you see in the static when your eyes adjust
In the blink of an eye and your mind is dust
And you make it outside 'fore your eyes combust
Fire ain't give up no lie, just left a powder the same color as
200 years of rust on the gate
It bends heavy, the hinge weak
Maybe someone find the tape
One day they all hear the wind speak

She bad, though, she bad, though
Come and get your picture, trick, she bad, though
Can't see the forest through the trees
Everybody come to get them some, but don't nobody leave
Don't nobody leave, do not move no leaf
She bad, though, blow before the breeze
And before the ice freeze it all over, come and see
Everybody come to get them some, but don't nobody leaveEmbed
