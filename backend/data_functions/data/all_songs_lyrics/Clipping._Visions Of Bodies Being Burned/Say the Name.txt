Say the Name Lyrics
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned

The hook gon' be what it is, thе hand's off
The retribution for what you took from the man, got
Blood on thе rust, God bless the red
Earth, the dead man walks the tongue bridge
Abridged the time-space, the boot, the concrete
The project undone, they juking
Made you look, you can't see it, the mob built the walls
The streets, it bleed sweet syrup, the bees love it
They coming on a swarm
And they raining on your college-ass disco
Get your collar turnt up in your freshest attire
Get your bitch womb ready 'cause this baby gon' be fire
It's not a dream, it's a memory
Mammary glands heavy
And the sky blacked out already, stop screaming
The flames ain't shit to a demon, say the name
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned

The hook gon' be the last thing she remember
The fast lane in December, often drift when she drive
College girl, looking for the love
Learnt about it in a book, but she always kept the gloves on
So when the skin touch, shit, head-rush
Red blush, lipstick, she just crush a lot
Every pun pales in comparison
A joke to a jester, she inundated with dick
Thick, and becoming conservative in her fucking
And nervous that she would rush in, but murder wasn't discussed
And the further she learned to trust him, the merger of love and lust
And she serving it all up just 'cause he hold her when he would bust
'Til nine months later with a stomach full of Devil baby
She startin' to think it's time to pump the brakes
But that train left the station with the Great Migration
Bloody tracks left right by the drain, say the name
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Can you say it again? Can you say it again?
Can you look into the mirror and then say it again?
Can you say it again? Can you say it again?
Can you say the name? Say the name, say it

The hook gon' be the coldest pimp-slap
Coat rack for man's skin, let it air-dry
Swiss-cheesed a brother, already half-dead
Brain leaking out a hole in his forehead
Lobotomies like pills, get 'em for cheap
The party line, "Crack kills," they trying to see
But this one more a hairline fracture
Leave the face painted, a mask for the hereafter
After the smoke clears and the highs come down
And the halogen hallucinations don't make a sound
Just a bunch of scared junkies not making the call
And a "Guernica" in blood on the wall, say the name
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
