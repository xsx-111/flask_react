Eaten Alive Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you step a foot up in the swamp with your gators on (Tsk)
That's redundant when one takes a foot (Take that)
And I ain't never slicked up in your city uninvited (Uh)
Wish a motherfucker would
Stay put, this shot is heavy, your frame light (Light)
You're more than six degrees and can't explain the life (Huh)

When the fuck the swamp turn into real estate? (Uh)
Spirits in the weeping willows heavyweight (Yeah)
Spirits out the bathtub for the every day
Heavy mists got vision cloudy anyway
Any way they go, they never get away (Run)
Shotgun in the shed and he can't wait to play (Ha)
Fucked up a Dollar General for Gatorade
It's gators waiting in the water, chillin', fuck it, he can wait
Grab a motherfucker and then fade away
Wrestle with the scales until the break of day (Uh)
Bullet through bottle like it's breakaway
Shattered glass amassing on the grasses where the babies play
Bleeding feet could bring the beast out any day
Bleeding hearts come teachin', thinkin' they could save
They may should save their favors for a rainy day
It's way too many dead around for fake-ass prayers to make a way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you step a foot up in the swamp with your gators on (Tsk)
That's redundant when one takes a foot (Take that)
And I ain't never slicked up in your city uninvited (Uh)
Wish a motherfucker would
Stay put, this shot is heavy, your frame light (Uh)
You're more than six degrees and can't explain the life

When the fuck the swamp turn into fashion week?
Used to be pull up here flashy wouldn't last a week
Used to stand out by just standing 'til he atrophied
Stitches tattooed on his lips so he don't have to speak (Shh)
Hood commando, flip a gram up to a half a ki' (Uh)
Pop a band up out the bando, 'bout a half a week
Pimpin' partners lock it down, they feel like Master P (Uh)
And you ain't in the trap house 'less you got a master key
The rims are 30" here because the grass is deep
Gold on his molars 'cause he only got 'bout half his teeth
You passing through to spread your gospel, you gon' have to leave
Wrapped up in a casket are the only ones the pastor sees
Most cues ain't verbal, why you wasting time with flattery?
All kings are bastards 'round here, that just happens naturally
Bathwater babies creep up out the bayou magically
And leave your brains behind the outhouse in the grass for cats to eat (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you step a foot up in the swamp with your gators on
That's redundant when one takes a foot (Take that)
And I ain't never slicked up in your city uninvited (Uh)
Wish a motherfucker would
Stay put, this shot is heavy (Heavy), your frame light (Uh)
You're more than six degrees and can't explain the life

You never lived, you never leave, it's curtains
The fog over the swamp should make you nervous (Ah)
Take the chorus
They weighed the water, child
Highest to the demon speaking English via crocodile
Cock a smile sideways, church for Sunday
Sometimes that shit you didn't know more dangerous than gunplayEmbed
