The Look of Love (Live) LyricsThe look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile
Can't disguise
The look of love
It's saying so much more than
Just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well, it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got that look of love
It's on your face
The look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you soEmbed
