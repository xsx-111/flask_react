I Love Being Here With You (Live) LyricsI love the East, I love the West
North and South, they're both the best
But I only want go there as a guest
Cause I love being here with you
I love the sea, I love the shore
I love the rocks and what is more
You and they never be a bore
Cause I love being here with you
Singing in the shower
Laughing by the hour
Life is such a breezy game
I love all kinds of weather
As long as we're together
Oh I love to hear you say my name
I love good wine, fine cuisine
Candle light I love the scene
Cause baby if you know just what I mean
I love being here with you
I love Ella singing, Basie's band is swinging
Cause that's something else you know
They know how to play it, they know how to say it
They just wind it up and let it go
Cary Grant through
Two time beggars but his charm just takes me away
But don't get me wrong how do you say
I love being here with youEmbed
