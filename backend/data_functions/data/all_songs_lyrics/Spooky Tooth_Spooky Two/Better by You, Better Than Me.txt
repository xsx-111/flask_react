Better by You, Better Than Me LyricsYou can find a way to be my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her what I'm like within
I can't find the words, my mind is dim
It's better by you, better than me
Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak the thoughts I've held so long inside
Tell her now I've got to go
Fight in the streets and die for sure
Tell her the world's not much for living for
It's better by you, better than me
It's better by you, better than me
You can tell her what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you better than me
Guess I'll have to change my way of living
Only really know the way I feel
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
She finds my blood upon her window sill
It's better by you, better than me
It's better by you better than me
You can tell her what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you, better than me
It's better by you, better than me
You can say what I can see
You can tell her what I want it to be
It's better by you, better than me
It's better by you, you know better than me
Yeah you can say what I only can seeEmbed
