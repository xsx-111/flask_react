Lost in My Dream LyricsIt was a strange dream
It took my heart from me
And though it did seem
To end my misery
I could still see where
My life was headin' for
A voice cried beware
Your fate's behind the door
And now I'm still lost
In my dream of fear
It's the end for me
Somewhere in the frost
On the seam of my mind
Waits my destiny
Don't think I've gone there today
It was a strange dream
The dark eye stead to me
They had a deep clean
Reflecting fantasy
Then out of nowhere
There came a voice to me
It said this nightmare
Will be reality
And now I'm still lost
In my dream of fear
It's the end for me
Somewhere in the frost
On the seam of my mind
Waits my destiny
Don't think of gone love again
Gotta' find a way home somehow
Lost in infinite sleep somewhereEmbed
