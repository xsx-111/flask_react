Hangman Hang My Shell on a Tree LyricsSomeone said he who knows he knows, knows nothing, yeah
He who knows he knows nothing, really knows
But I have searched and I never could find
A way to make my true self unwind
And while I sit here waiting to die
I can see where I am and can tell you why
The time's right ahead, can't you see
'Cause my life's running out, out on me
I've forgotten how it was, let me be
So hangman hang my shell on a tree
It's all so easy, like the time when I first learned, yeah
It's all the same, since the day the world first turned, yeah
But I never tried to listen or wait
And now it's so clear but for me it's too late
And so I sit here trying not to cry
I only wanted peace but now I must die
The time's right ahead, can't you see
'Cause my life's running out, out on me
I've forgotten how it was, let me be
So hangman hang my shell on a tree
The time's right ahead, can't you see
'Cause my life's running out, out on me
I've forgotten how it was, let me be
So hangman hang my shell on a tree
The time's right ahead, can't you see
'Cause my life's running out, out on me
I've forgotten how it was, let me be
So hangman hang my shell on a tree
The time's right ahead, can't you see
'Cause my life's running out, out on me
I've forgotten how it was, let me be
So hangman hang my shell on a tree
