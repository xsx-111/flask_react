That Was Only Yesterday LyricsGuess I'll have to get out of this town
No sense in my waiting around
Only thing left for me here is pain
She's gone for sure now why pretend
Left last night with a friend
Leaving not a word that would explain
That was only yesterday
But will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow
That was only yesterday
Will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow
I think I better find somewhere
A place where I won't care
I need some time to hide my shame
Was only just one day ago
Found what I'd been searching for
Had left town on a late night train
And that was only yesterday
But will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow
That was only yesterday
Will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow
That was only yesterday
Will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrowEmbed
