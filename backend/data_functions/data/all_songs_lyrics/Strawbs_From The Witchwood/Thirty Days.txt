Thirty Days LyricsI have people to free, they're depending on me
So I can't afford to die
Get them safely back, then I won't stay too long
I'll be leaving soon for London
So I'll look this war straight in the eye
Only thirty days so I can't afford to die
When I think of the dead, that go round in my head
No I can't afford to die
So the thing to do is pretend that they weren't there
With my baby at home waiting
I can give myself a little sigh
Only thirty days so I can't afford to die
God ain't taking my hand, not to no promised land
So I can't afford to die
So I'll cease my command before another bomb
If I see my home a free man
I'll remember why I never cried
Only thirty days so I can't afford to dieEmbed
