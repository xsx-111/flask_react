Flight LyricsI wish I were a bird
Then I could fly
I'd see the crowded people
As they go by
I'd soar into the air
And fly as high as I could see
Drifting through the clouds
With no-one to bother me
Just looking for a star
I wonder if you are here
I feel the loss of time
As days go by
And see the lonely people
Who wonder why
Just searching for a reason
To reveal a secret sin
Trying to find an answer
To release the good within
Just looking for a star
I wonder if you are here
I'll rise the early bird at dawn
To sing my ever-loving song
I'd come and sit beside you a friend
Then you'll see me flying againEmbed
