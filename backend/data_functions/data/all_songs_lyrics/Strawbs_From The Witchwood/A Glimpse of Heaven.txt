A Glimpse of Heaven LyricsThe hillside was a patchwork quilt
Neatly stitched with tidy hedge
And crumbling gray stone wall
The trees were bare but spring was near
To conjure up its endless strings
Of green magic handkerchiefs
Could you only see what I've seen
You would surely know what I mean
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven
A string of diamonds formed a stream
That tumbled down the daunting cliff
To sparkle bright on the beach
New born lambs that sweetly played
Speckled eggs all newly laid
But for you I would have stayed
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heavenEmbed
