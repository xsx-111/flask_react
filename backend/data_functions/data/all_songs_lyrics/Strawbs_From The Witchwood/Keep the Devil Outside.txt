Keep the Devil Outside LyricsAs for the help you called for
Nobody seemed to answer
The difference in man is no more
Than being a priest or dancer
See men of power in recess
They really don't know what they're after
They drink to the things that they see best
And drown in the tears of their laughter
If you see fit to fight
Whether you're black or white
How many hope to keep the devil outside?
How many hope to keep the devil outside?
You've been given your name and your number
Right from when you were a baby
I look at the earth and I wonder
What have they done to her lately?
If you see fit to fight
Whether you're black or white
How many hope to keep the devil outside?
How many hope to keep the devil outside?
Love dies hard
You will never hear me say
That the world will not see again today
See a better day
If you see fit to hide
Mistakes of the men that died
How many hope to keep the devil outside?
How many hope to keep the devil outside?
If you see fit to fight
Whether you're black or white
How many hope to keep the devil outside?
How many hope to keep the devil outside?Embed
