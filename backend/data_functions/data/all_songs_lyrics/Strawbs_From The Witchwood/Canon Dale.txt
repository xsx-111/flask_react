Canon Dale LyricsDyfan's tale
Of the holy Canon Dale
Setting sail
Homeward for his lonely cell
In your holy ground I found
Peace to dwell
The beginning of a world
Love entwined
Throughout all the world combined
In your holy ground I found
Days and day
He would go his chosen way
Keeping trace
Of the things you do and say
In your holy ground I foundEmbed
