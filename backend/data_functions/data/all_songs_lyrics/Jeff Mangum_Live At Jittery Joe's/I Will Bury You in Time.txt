I Will Bury You in Time Lyrics
I will bury you in time
When the sea begins to slide
Into this hole where I am smiling on your shoulder
You have buried my beliefs
Where all you sisters sleep
That their scent the purity will make
When the youth is over
Frozen in some lost October

And I am breathing into you
It makes your features move
And they shimmer like balloons that fly above the ocean
All the world is waiting here
You can hear the children cheer
But they'll need you when you're near
The brink of complete implosion
Crown your king when your life is broken
Everything you are I'm tearing through
Everything you want I'm wanting too
I gave you more than I thought I could ever do
And I will never break you

And if I was the king of all the kids
You'd you hear me singing in my spit
But all you would hear is the shit inside my burnt emotions
I will bury you in time
When the sea begins to slide
Into this hole where you and I will sing our songs unbroken
As the water starts its choking
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee5Embed
