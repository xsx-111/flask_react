Gardenhead / Leave Me Alone Lyrics
There are beads that wrap
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park
Like a hole in your head
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time
We ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name

Leave me alone
For you know this isn't the first time
In fact this is twice in a row
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
And filled up our garden with snow
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside
Will love you as long as you're something to own
Will love you as long as you're something to own
Follow me through
A city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you3Embed
