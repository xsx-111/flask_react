Drown With Me Lyrics
So you have been of use
And you have been abused
You know you look pale today
Your lipstick has gone astray
You sold out and lost your looks
You gave away all your books
(You should drown with me)
Your coil has been wound up tight
Unwind it with me tonight
(You should drown with me)

Tire tracks fresh on the ground
Where she will be found
Held under the water
Resting there in a stream
View from the cold water
Buried in green
Orange filter sky

You're drowning in family there
When will you come up for air?
(You should drown with me)
Don't feel you let 'em down
Cause they have already drowned
(You should drown with me)
Tire tracks fresh on the ground
Where she will be found
Held under the water
Resting there in a stream
View from the cold water
Buried in green
Orange filter sky

(You should drown with me)
(You should drown with me)Embed
