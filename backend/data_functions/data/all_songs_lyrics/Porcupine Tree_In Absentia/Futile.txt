Futile Lyrics
You were the one that made her cry
You were the one that told her lies
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult nor a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time

Burnout tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile

You were the one collecting space
You were the one just saving face
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult nor a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnout tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile
Burnout tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile
Burnout tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
