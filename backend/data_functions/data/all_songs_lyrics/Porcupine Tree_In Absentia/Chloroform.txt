Chloroform Lyrics
Little retrograde, wonder where you are
Another motorcade, under radar

A boy in borrowed clothes, knows he is a girl
Shards of light come down, stillness in the air

Big sleeper, your deeper, too deep for me yeah
Speak clearer, can't hear you, I'm going under

On the mountain side, hold me in your gaze
But it's over now, cos I got kids to raise

Big sleeper, your deeper, too deep for me yeah
Speak clearer, can't hear you, I'm going underEmbed
