Strip the Soul LyricsThis is my home, this is my own, We don't like no strangers
Raise the kids good, beat the kids good, and tie them up
Spread it wide, my wife, my life, push the camera deeper
I can use, I abuse, my muse, I made them all

This machine is there to please
Strip the soul, fill the hole
A fire to feed, a belt to bleed
Strip the soul, kill them all
They are not gone, they are not gone, they are only sleeping
In graves, in ways, in clay, underneath the floor
Building walls, overalls, getting bored, I got faulty wiring
Brick it up now, brick it up now, but keep the bones

Do you want a western home in the rubble?1Embed
