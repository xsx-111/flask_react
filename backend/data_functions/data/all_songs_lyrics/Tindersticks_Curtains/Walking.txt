Walking LyricsWake up, it's all right
You don't have the words, it's okay
I make it worse, if I make it better
I can chase it away
It could be all motion, running and flapping
Faster and faster, breathing hard
Just for a moment we are on a breeze
Hold on, hold on tight
You've gone astray again
Wake up, it's all right
I don't need to know where you've been
Went for a walk in the half light
You went astray again
Wake up, it's all right
You don't have the words, that's okay
I make it worse, but I can make it better
We can chase it awayEmbed
