Rented Rooms LyricsThere's the same hotel, and we can go there now
We can go there now if you want to
Through the doors of that rented room
Yeah, we stumbled through
It was only ours
It seemed such a short while
We had no time to cry
Or sit and wonder why
We had so many things stored and saved
We had to get through
We tried the cinema
Within half an hour
We had to go find someplace else
More. . . y'know
We tried a drinking bar
It gets so very hot
And when the cab ride ahead seems too long
We go fuck in the bathroom
We can't afford the time to sit and cry
Or to wonder why
We've got so many things stored and saved
We had to get through
Through the doors of that rented room
Yeah, we stumbled through
We had so many things stored and saved
We had to get through
We can't afford the time to sit and cry
Or to wonder why
We've got so many things stored and saved
We have to get through
We haven't got the time for telling lies
Or to even try
There's only days in between
There are just tomorrows
Through the doors of that rented room
Yeah, we stumbled through
It was only ours, it seemed such a short while
In those pillows are the feathers that hold all our dreams
They're split at the seams
Now they just seem to float on a breeze
I could have wrapped that pillow around my head
Face down on the bed
I could have drowned in all those so-called dreams
We haven't got the time for telling lies
Or to even try
There's only days in between
There are just tomorrowsEmbed
