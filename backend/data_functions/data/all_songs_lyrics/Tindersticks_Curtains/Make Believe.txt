Make Believe LyricsMake believe that it's OK
Make believe it doesn't matter
And you make it through this day
And you make it through this night
If you believe that it's OK
When you're down and there's no way out
And your whole world is turning grey
And there doesn't seem like there's enough
So make believe that it's ok
So make believe that nothing matters
And you'll make it through this day
And you'll make it through this night
If you believe that it's OK
When you're down and there's no way out
You've got a night that won't go away
And there doesn't seem like there's enough
So make believe
Make believe that nothing matters
And you make it through it through this day
And you make it through this night
If you believe
Believe
Believe
That it's okayEmbed
