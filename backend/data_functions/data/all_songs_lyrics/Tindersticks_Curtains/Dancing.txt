Dancing LyricsI understand everything
I understand
Everything
Take me in your arms
You knew how I feel
Before I knew I was up to my neck
The first time we danced
So is that what brought you home tonight?
So is that what brought you home?
Was it the dancing?
Take me in your arms
You knew how I feel
Running home
I couldn't wait to be inside you then
You were all around me then
So is that what brought you home tonight?
Do you know what brought you home tonight?
Was it the dancing?
Before I knew I was up to my neck
The last toe leaving ground
The first time we dancedEmbed
