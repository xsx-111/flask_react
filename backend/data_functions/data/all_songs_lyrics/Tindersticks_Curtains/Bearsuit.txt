Bearsuit LyricsI'm laying on my back
She climbs over me
Pricks out her nails
Runs them over my proud belly
I'm a tired, hungry bear
Spoiled and sleepy
Her finger's on my zip-pull
She pulls it down slowly
I'm not ready
Turn over, settle down again
Throw her off
But she's back again
I've been out all night
Get in at dawn
And I've still got honey
Dripping from my claws
I'm a tired, hungry bear
Spoiled and sleepy
Her finger's on my zip-pull
She pulls it down slowly
I'm not ready
Turn over, settle down again
Throw her off
But she's back againEmbed
