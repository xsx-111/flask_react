Bathtime LyricsThere's a city filth that lingers
All over my neck and hands
Deep into the weave of the clothes I wear
And every step brings another
Every yard adds some more
Till I'm on the other side leaning on your door
Are the taps running, darling?
Is the air thick with steam?
Can I find some place to cry these tears of shame?
And every step brings another
Every yard adds some more
Till I'm on the other side leaning on your door
There's a smell so sweet it's sickly
It follows me into the room
Hangs in the air like rotting perfume
I never bathed in it, darling
Got down on my hands and knees
Got in so far, I became, well, a part of it all
I've been wading through it
Don't you know it's up to my neck
And it won't be long before it's over my head
And it's the thought of you in my mind that keeps me here
Thought I knew these streets, I knew how they turn
I could always find my way home
There's something there, I can't leave it alone
The trains they run all night
We could leave everything behind
Just bring that dress you wore when we first met
I know it's faded, darling
I know it's tattered and worn
In that dress, I could never love you more
I've been wading through it
Don't you know it's up to my neck
And it won't be long before it's over my head
Then I can suck it into my lungs and breathe it inEmbed
