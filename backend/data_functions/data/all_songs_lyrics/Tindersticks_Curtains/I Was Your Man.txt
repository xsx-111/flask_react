I Was Your Man LyricsSo, you wish I was your man, and I'd understand?
So, you wish I was your man, and I'd understand?
Not a surface thing, we could meet down inside
Not a surface thing, we could meet way down inside
You've got a smile that never reaches your eyes?
You want to try to do something right?
So, take me home tonight
Turn out the light
You're just alone in the dark
So, you wish I was your man, in my consciousness you ran
In my eyes you swam -- nothing is too much trouble for you
So, you wish I was your man, and I'd understand
So, you wish I was your man, and I'd understand you
You've got a smile that never reaches your eyes?
You want to try to do something right?
So, take me home tonight
Turn out the light
You're just alone in the darkEmbed
