(Tonight) Are You Trying to Fall in Love Again LyricsMy my, it doesn't matter what you say
From the start, I hang off every word you say
Oh, tonight, are you trying to fall in love again?
Does it make it all right?
Are you trying to fall in love again?
Now, I'm a hard man gone soft
The lines were so clear then
How did I ever get by?
There was a time I hang off every word you say
Every breath you blew, I was running to inhale
Oh, tonight, are you trying to fall in love again?
Does it make it all right?
Are you trying to fall in love again?
My my, there will be other days
It comes and goes, you know it never stays
Oh, tonight, are you trying to fall in love again?
Oh, tonight, are you trying to fall in love again?
Does it make it all right?
Are you trying to fall in love again?
Does it make it all right?
You're trying to fall in love againEmbed
