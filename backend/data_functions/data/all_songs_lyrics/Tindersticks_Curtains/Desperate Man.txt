Desperate Man LyricsShe knows what happens when I'm without her
How this ring itches on my finger
Does she let me go to help me remember?
Remember how I came in
I was desperate then
Remember what I am without her
Another desperate man
How far I go when I'm without her
How fast and how long that slide
I'll always take that ride
It itches on my finger
Helps me remember
Remember how I came in
I was desperate then
Remember what I am without her
Another desperate man, yeah
She knows what happens when I'm without her
She sees the problem
She understands the irony
When I'm slumped there in that seat
Slobbering of how much I love her
Hey, bartender
Let me tell you about when I walked in
I was desperate then
If I could find my way back to loving her
I'm a desperate man, yeah
I'm a desperate man, yeahEmbed
