Shadow LyricsShadow you'll bring me down
But every day I love you more
Shadow you'll bring me down
But every day I love you more
Than the day before
Chorus:
Body of a woman, mind of a child -
Shadow you shouldn't drive me wild
You're only 14 years old...
Shadow you seem to touch
All the things that I just don't know
Shadow means so much
I never thought I had so far to go
I need you so
Chorus
Hair so dark, it's black as coal
Like I looked into your soul
Touch that makes you lose control
Shadow - she's gonna stay, won't go away
Chorus
Shadow you'll bring me down
But every day I love you more
Shadow you seem to touch
Yet every day I need you more...Embed
