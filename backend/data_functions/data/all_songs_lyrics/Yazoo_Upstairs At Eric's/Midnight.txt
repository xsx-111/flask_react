Midnight LyricsMidnight it's raining outside, yeah
He must be soaking wet
Everyone is sleeping tight
God knows I tried my best
But darling you know it looks bad
Just lost the best thing that I ever had
Well, still I don't know why I did him wrong, yeah
It's too late now he's gone to say
Said baby oh no, can't leave me now
Said to think about it please
'Cause I love you and I need you
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong, yeah
Before I did you wrong, I should have thought about it
Before I did you wrong
Heartache, heartache, yeah
When I saw his face I could see how bad I'd let him down
Cheating when he was working hard
I just had to mess around
I knew from the start he ain't got much money
I should have stayed content with all that good sweet honey
He's a good strong man and I, I love him so
So how on earth can I let him go
Said whoa
Said baby oh no, can't leave me now
Said to think about it please
'Cause I love you and I need you
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong, yeah
Before I did you wrong, I should have thought about it
Before I did you wrong
And now it's midnight it's raining outside, yeah
And I'm soaking wet
Still looking for that man of mine
And I ain't found him yet
Well all of this rain can wash away my tears
But nothing can replace all of those wasted years
In all of this I tell you I have learnt playing with fire gets you burnt
And I'm still burning
Said baby oh no, can't leave me now
Said to think about it please
'Cause I love you and I need you
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong, yeah
Before I did you wrong, I should have thought about it
Before I did you wrong
You say you'll lose your pride
Well don't you know dear, don't you know
I'll lose so much more if you go now
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't you know?Embed
