Winter Kills LyricsGreen in your love on bright days
You grew sun blind, you thought me unkind
To remind you how winter kills
Lost in daydreams you drove too fast and got nowhere
You rode on half fare when you got too scared
How winter kills
Tear at me searching for weaker seams
Pain in your eyes makes me cruel, makes me spiteful
Tears are delightful welcome your nightfall
How winter kills
I'll tear at you searching for weaker seams
How winter, how winter, how  winter kills
How winter, how winter, how  winter kills
How winter, how winter, how  winter kills
