The Stranger in Our Town LyricsThere's a stranger in our town
He's got a burning eye
He wants to get off on you...
The last time that he was here
He had a roving eye
He smiled as he got off on you...
Don't face me with that sad face
Because, you lost that glorious grace
You will always be coming back to this place
There's a stranger, in our town
There's a stranger, pullin' you around
There's a stranger, in our town
There's a stranger
And he's gonna break your heart
And then get off on you...
There's a stranger in our town
Pulls out a punk's spinal cord
Piss and blood on the sidewalk of hearts...
This stranger in our town
Lives in tunnels beneath hell
Lives in tunnels way down below your heart...
Push it in and push it out
You already know what it's all about
And you'll be begging as usual without any doubt
There's a stranger, in our town
There's a stranger, followin' you around
There's a stranger whose in our town (who's)
There's a stranger
And he's gonna break your heart
And then get off on you...
(solos: 1st - Kid Congo, 2nd - Mustang Dave)
So, I walk smile like he smiles
I walk just like he walks
My right hand to my face like this...
This stranger in our town
He once was in another town
With insects on his face like this...
With names that are just like names
And pictures from the rear of trains
What you want will always be the same
There's a stranger, in our town
There's a stranger, pullin' you around
There's a stranger, in our town
There's a stranger
And he's gonna break your heart
And then get off on you...
Stranger in our town
Stranger he got a burning eye
He got insects on his face like this
But, he is such a strange strange stranger
He is such a strange strange stranger...1Embed
