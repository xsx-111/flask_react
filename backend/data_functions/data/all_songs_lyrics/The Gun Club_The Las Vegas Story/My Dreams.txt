My Dreams LyricsWhat I say
You cannot hear it
So, you intrude upon my dreams
And hate my appearance
Who gave you the right
To give out the rights?
And to intrude upon My Dreams
And sell out my eyes
You can't take My Dreams
You can't take My Dreams
You can't take and steal from this body...
I never get a chance
In the airport
Sick in bathroom with Your Dreams
And a flight to nowhere
In Victoria, Gare du' Nord (du)
And Tompkin's Square
You're standing on My Dreams
And you don't care
You can't take My Dreams
You can't take My Dreams
You can't take and steal from this body...
A heartbeat
Tears my insides apart
And tears apart My Dreams
In the whirling dark
I never got to go
I cannot make it
I never get to have Dreams
And I will not take it
You can't take My Dreams
You can't take My Dreams
You can't take and steal from this body...
They were supposed to be MY DREAMS...Embed
