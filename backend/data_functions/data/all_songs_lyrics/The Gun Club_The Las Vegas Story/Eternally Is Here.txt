Eternally Is Here LyricsWell, this is what I've never told you
Yes, we are animals too
And it'll be a life of "getting back"
For a night of "getting off"
But, I couldn't wait
Now, eternally is here…
"I never promised you anything
For promising me everything," she said
"I stood silent and true
While you fell to pieces."
But, I couldn't wait
And, eternally is here…
And it's a long way down… without a sound…
You've known I've always wanted you
And since today is the end of the world
You're heart and no more art (your?)
Will hold me tonight!
But, I couldn't wait
Now, eternally is here...
And it's a long way down... without a sound...
(solo: Jeffreylee)
This is what she always said:
"I will give to you of love and blood
For all the forever and never
And yet, still again and again..."
But, I couldn't wait
Now, eternally is here...
And it's a long way down...
Without a sound in this world...Embed
