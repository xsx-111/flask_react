Secret Fires LyricsTouch me through your screen door
I want to remember you
They that are behind me
Are there against the moon
Remember when we used to ride
Underneath the power lines
In the inferno valley
When your father was alive
We worked for days and years
Through the dust and the heat
I came around to see you
On highway-burning feet
I spent my days at the mill
I came home and cared for you
In the year that we lived in secret fires
I took my razor blade
I laid Ruben in the shade
And I heard the radio moan
I took my place in the hills
Jagged with the secret fires
I called you through the valley
Down among the wires
With dust upon my eyes
Came the first day of the year
I saw the house where no one lived
On a black land and under a red sky
You washed my hair and body
Beside the firelight
So, touch me through your screen door
I want to remember you
We struggled
The year we lived in secret fire
