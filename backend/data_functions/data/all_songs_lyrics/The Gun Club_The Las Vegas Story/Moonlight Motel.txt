Moonlight Motel LyricsI'm a thousand miles below
I'm in a hole waiting for you
With filthy streets and trucks, outside
I dress, then I undress, and look, outside
I'm in a hole and waiting here for you...
Between the lights downtown
In the back of a cab
You are looking for kicks, to make your kicks
And just like the trick, that goes like this
And just like the prick that you are...
I'm a thousand miles below
Pulling ribbons from my hair
Low rates and color T.V
Money on the bed, left there for me and
One of these days I'll kill you while you sleep...
Between the lights downtown
In the back of a taxi
You are getting misty-eyed
Beneath the adult world sign
Just like little children, in one screaming line
I'm in a hole and waiting here for you...
I'm a thousand miles below
Why do you leave me here?
I was strong enough to admit that I was weak
You take and give a lot, but you don't give to me
One of these days I'll kill youEmbed
