Give Up The Sun LyricsMy hotel is blue
Beautiful ocean blue
Paint melting off the walls
And I can hardly breathe
Young men nod against the palms
Turn blue and fail to breathe
But, I came here to see
So
Give up the Sun, Give up the Sun
One hundred thousand times
I live just to hear you say
(I live just for once to? I live just to want to?)
Give up the sun, give up the sun...
Down along the beachline
Gulls pick at bones and glass
Old Jew remembers Broadway
Among the tires and glass
I try to remember Broadway
I had a friend up there at last
And she can't help me now
So
Give up the Sun, Give up the Sun
One hundred thousand times
I just want to hear you say
Give up the sun, give up the sun...
(solo: Jeffreylee)
Out there, the sea makes love
Waves pinwheel to the bay
Oh, don't you leave me here
There's ghosts and rooms of pain
There's a storm out on the sea tonight
And bodies filled with pain
Palm wind across the sea tonight
Black with whirling pain
Alone against the docks tonight
Nobody knows my name
And I can't go back again
So
Give up the Sun, Give up the Sun...Embed
