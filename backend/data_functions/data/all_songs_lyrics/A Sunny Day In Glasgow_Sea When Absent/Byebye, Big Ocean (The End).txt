Byebye, Big Ocean (The End) LyricsI had this dream about you, an endless dream about you
And in this dream about you, we saw our loss amount to(?)
And when we saw the true dew, we saw our losses see-through(?)
Have you ever thought how young we'd be
If we never ever went to school
If we never learned how not to be
If we never- no no nothing ever dies
Have you ever thought how young we'd be
If we never- no no nothing ever dies
Sing me to bed(?)
You'll see the bright escape(?)
You'll see the light escape(?)
Sing me to bed(?)
You'll see the bright escape(?)
You'll see the light escape(?)
And everyone will say the wind fall after(?)
????????????
???????????? I do(?)
????????????
???????????? Bye bye(?)
Have you ever thought how young we'd be
If we never ever went to school
Nobody has to wait to say goodbye
Have you ever movie(?)
I myself been waiting(?)
Couldn't stall(?)
I am still holding on(?)
Holding on (x3)
We can never let go (x2)
We can still not let go (x2)
I had this dream about you, an endless dream about you
And in this dream about you, we saw our loss amount to
And when we saw the true dew, we saw our losses see-through
Have you ever thought how young we'd be
If we never ever went to school
If we never learned how not to be
If we never- no no nothing ever dies
Baby
In litany(?)
Oh see the light this way(?)
Goodbye bye bye byeEmbed
