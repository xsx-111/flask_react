In Love With Useless (The Timeless Geometry in the Tradition of Passing) LyricsYou know where everybody else has drawn the line
You know where everybody else has drawn the line
Antipsychotics sink to the bottom
Think of it, death as something
Antipsychotics sink to the bottom
Dreams that were buried coming up
And you never know how something sits inside
Inside, inside
Move to the beat, sink to the street
It's in your blood
Move to the beat, sink to the street
Don't stop, sometimes I feel so happy
I'm in love with useless
Don't stop, sometimes I feel so happy
I'm in love with useless
Slow disdain echoes on my way
It's how, how we're living
Isolation, isolation, isolation
Don't stop, sometimes I feel so happy
I'm in love with useless
Don't stop, sometimes I feel so happy
I'm in love with useless
Antipsychotics sink to the bottom
Think of it, death as something
Antipsychotics sink to the bottom
Dreams that were buried coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Like geometry, this is killing me
I stent my roman hands
And let them go
I stent my roman hands
And let them go
Don't stop, sometimes I feel so happy
I'm in love with useless
Don't stop, sometimes I feel so happy
I'm in love with useless
I have a long historyEmbed
