Chains LyricsI remember their faces
I remember their stares
I remember how wasted
You were in there....
When I know you want it
And I know you care
I know you feel it
And I know it's there
You were speaking to no one
I called your name
You were looking for something
Without any chains
I was talking to someone
You pulled me aside
You were telling me something
That I couldn't buyEmbed
