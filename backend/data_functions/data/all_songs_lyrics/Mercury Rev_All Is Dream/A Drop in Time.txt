A Drop in Time LyricsA year is just a drop in time
It cannot touch the female form in my bed
She is just a friend of mine
In the dark she knows
The touch of my hand
Let the music play like you want it to
Let the sun shine light in your hair
Let the moonlight play
At your feet like a babe
And softly linger there
Her words profane, her mouth divine
I tried to sympathize with both sides
But I was caught, like a fleeting thought
Stuck inside Leonard Cohen's mind
We met on a beach in Greece
And parted on a rusty Spanish stair
Two birds in the distance fly
They land and they settle down
Somewhere
A year is just a drop in time
It cannot touch her female form
In my head
She was just a friend of mine
In the dark she knew
The touch of my handEmbed
