Spiders and Flies LyricsPlans and schemes, thoughts and dreams
Who cares what they mean
When they work they're amazing things
When they don't I hear you scream
Spiders and flies live and die
Six legs to stand on and two wings to fly
I can't remember and I can't decide
What was the season and the color of your eyes
Pharaohs and kings, favourite queens
Buried with their precious rings
When they lived they loved complete
But in their tombs I hear them scream
Spiders and flies, live and die
Six legs to stand on and two wings to fly
I can't remember and I can't decide
What was the season and the color of your eyes
Psalms and spells, magic blast
Who cares what they cast
I dreamed I'd always love you complete
I never thought I'd hear you scream
Spiders and flies, live and die
Eight legs to stand on and two wings to fly
It makes you wonder, why can't I
What was the reason for the colour of your eyes
Spiders and flies, live and die.....Embed
