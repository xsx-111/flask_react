Nite and Fog Lyrics
If God moves across the water
Then the girl moves in other ways
And I'm losing sight of either
Nite and fog are my days

I wanted only to be gentle
But I gave her jealousy and rage
Who knows exactly what I'm after
Nite and fog are my days

Wisemen want faith
Fools want gold
Sailors want water
But you want it all

I tried to guide my love by starlight
And soon my life became a maze
Osiris and Orion were your favorites
Nite and fog are my days

Vampires want darkness
Monsters want souls
Spiders want corners
But you want it all
She turns half nude to find me naked
But I can see she wants me in other ways
In the dark I've driven her to madness
Nite and fog are my days

I hope you see your ship come in
May it find you and never lose it's way
But I would make a poor captain
Nite and fog are my days

Vampires want darkness
Monsters want souls
Spiders want corners
But you want it all

But you want it all
But you want it all
But you want it allEmbed
