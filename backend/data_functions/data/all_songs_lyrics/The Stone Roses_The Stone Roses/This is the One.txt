This is the One LyricsA girl consumed by fire…
We all know her desire
From the plans that she has made
I have her on a promise
Immerse me in your splendor
All the plans that I have made
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
She’s waited for
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh this is the one
This is the one
She’s waited for
I’d like to leave the country
For a month of Sundays
Burn the town where I was born
If only she’d believe me
Belona, belladonna
Burn me out or bring me home
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
She’s waited for
And this is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one
I’ve waited for
Oh, this is the one
This is the one
This is the one
I’ve waited for
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one
I’ve waited for
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one
I’ve waited for
It may go right
But it might go wrong
This is the one
This is the one
She’s waited for
And this is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
I've waited for
And this is the one
Oh, this is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one
I’ve waited for3Embed
