I Wanna Be Adored Lyrics
I don't have to sell my soul
He's already in me
I don't need to sell my soul
He's already in me

I wanna be adored
I wanna be adored

I don't have to sell my soul
He's already in me
I don't need to sell my soul
He's already in me

I wanna be adored
I wanna be adored


Adored
I wanna be adored
You adore me
You adore me
You adore me, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna be adored
I wanna
I wanna, I wanna be adored
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna be adored
I wanna, I wanna, I gotta be adored

(I wanna, I wanna, I wanna)
