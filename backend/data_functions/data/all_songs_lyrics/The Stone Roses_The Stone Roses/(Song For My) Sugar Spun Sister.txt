(Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister Lyrics
Her hair, soft drifted snow
Death white, I'd like to know
Why she hates all that she does
But she gives it all that she's got

Until the sky turns green
The grass is several shades of blue
Every member of Parliament trips on glue
Until the sky turns green
And the grass is several shades of blue
Every member of Parliament trips on glue

It takes all these things and all that time
Till my sugar spun sister's happy with this love of mine
It'll take all these things and, oh, much more

I've paid for fifteen or more
But my guts can't take many more
My hands are stuck to my jeans (Stuck to my jeans)
And she knows, she knows what this must mean

She wakes up with the sun
She asked me, "What is all the fuss?"
As she gave me more than she thought she should
She wakes up with the sun
I think, "What have I done?"
As I gave her more than I thought I would
Oh, it takes all these things and all that time
Till my sugar spun sister's happy with this love of mine

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the candy floss girl
The sticky fingered boy
Oh, that sister of mine, yeah7Embed
