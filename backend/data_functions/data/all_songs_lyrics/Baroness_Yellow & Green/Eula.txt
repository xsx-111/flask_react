Eula LyricsSettle down
This won't last long
I've been out
And I want back in
So why not completely fade away?
When my bones begin to break
And my head begins to shake
It's my own blood
When my house becomes a cage
And my neighbors turn away
It's my own blood
Settle down
This won't last long
I've been out
And I want back in
So why not completely fade away?
Where the butcher's hand is home
Laughs the blade above the throne
It's my own blood
Oh, this apple makes me sick
Cries the pig upon his stick
It's my own blood
And I can't forget the taste
Can't forget the taste of my own tongue
And I can't forget the taste
Can't forget the taste of my own tongue
And if I had a heart
I'd waste it on you
But it's all together far too long
Since I took you down
Settle down
This won't last long
I've been out
And I want back in
So why not completely fade away?
When we've licked all of the lips
And the salt stained fingertips
It's my own blood
When our lambs and lions made
Debts no righteous man can pay
It's my own blood
And I can't forget the taste
Can't forget the taste of my own tongue
And I can't forget the taste
Can't forget the taste of my own tongue3Embed
