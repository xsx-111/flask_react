March to the Sea Lyrics
There was an anchor
There was a silver-sweet refrain
You tucked your fingers
In between my troubled bones
And what you did next was second to none
You really let us down
You tied yourself up and jumped in the sea
Never to come home

Valium
You left me all alone
Tell me when I will be whole again

There was a whisper
Once there were heralds and parades
You sang your secrets
Through the tolling of the tide
The fugitive rooms, the amateur tombs
The silence and the cries
The quickening beat, your march to the sea
Never to return

Sweet morphine, you've taken all of me
Let me know, when you will let me go
Heroin
Where did you take my friend?
Tell me why
Those ropes are hanging high

Valium
You left me all alone2Embed
