Take My Bones Away Lyrics
You lead the way, I'll follow
You lead the way, I'll follow

What was the plan here? I can't seem to stop!
Pissing and spitting from bottom to top
Picking up viscera, tendons and broken remains

Did you find another way
Was it my turn, or yours, to say
"Did you find another way?"

Take my bones away
I'll find them every day

I took your advice and the requisite pills
And forbidden pies from a white windowsill
Swallowing caveats, Baphomet's breath and migraines

Did I tell you "don't come home"?
Why was your mouth beginning to foam?
Did I tell you "don't come home"?
Take my bones away
I'll find them every day

Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away1Embed
