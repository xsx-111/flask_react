The Line Between LyricsI turned my head up and the sky was empty
I wasn't looking for paradise
And when I asked for comfort from the land of plenty
I came to realize...
You have taken this for granted
Please don't take it all away
Feel the light of day, feel it fade away
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone
I thrust my hands in 'til the nerves went cold
I tasted silver and I tasted gold
And when the bandage lifted, our scars were newborn
We still felt everything
I have taken this for granted
Please don't take it all away
Feel the light of day, feel it fade away
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone
Feel the light of day, feel it fade away
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow I'll be gone1Embed
