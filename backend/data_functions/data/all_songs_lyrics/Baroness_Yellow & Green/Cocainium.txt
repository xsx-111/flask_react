Cocainium LyricsSeven branches on my window
Waiting for the sun to come around
Take this on an empty stomach
Waiting for the spring to come around
Save yourself
By the way
Never ride alone
Take me down easy
I can’t stand the sight or the smell
It’s getting harder and harder and harder and harder to tell
Tell me when the blood stops flowing
Let it rest, it’s run into the ground
Just in case the dogs are feeding
Shut the door so they won’t hear the sound
Save yourself
By the way
Never ride alone
Show me no quarter
I can’t stand the sight or the smell
It’s getting harder and harder and harder and harder to tell
Put me to pasture
I can’t stand the sight or the smell
It’s getting harder and harder and harder and harder to tellEmbed
