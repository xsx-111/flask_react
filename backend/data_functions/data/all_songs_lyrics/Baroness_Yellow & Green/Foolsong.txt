Foolsong Lyrics
That fool who digs his own grave
I'm still trying to find my way out
If it's the long way, I'll sleep
In this bed I have made

The kids have fallen on blades
It's too late to figure out
It's too late for babies to bend
For their beds

It's too late to ignore
The storm up ahead
It's too dark to see
My way out
Now all I can do about
Anything wrong
Is dig
Further down
Further down

And when we finally awake
We'll burn our bodies on stakes
A tower of ashes and sawdust will lay
Where our castles
Were madeEmbed
