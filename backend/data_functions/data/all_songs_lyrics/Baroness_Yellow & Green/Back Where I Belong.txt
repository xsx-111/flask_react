Back Where I Belong LyricsTell me now
Who's in charge here?
I thought help was on the way
It took so many years to get out of here
Now I'm back where I belong
Now I'm back where I belong
Next to you
Stuck to you
Here's the rub....
There's no difference
Between poison and the cure
When the one tastes so great it's a crying shame
That I'm back where I belong
Now I'm back where I belong
Next to you
Stuck with you
Say goodnight to your mother
Say a prayer for your father
Wake me when the thunderclouds are rolling in
Take me to a hazy sunday morning
I heard your eyes and I touched your tongue
When we were kids we never felt so young
Take me to a hazy Sunday morning
I heard your eyes and I touched your tongue
When we were kids we never felt so young
Take me to a hazy Sunday morningEmbed
