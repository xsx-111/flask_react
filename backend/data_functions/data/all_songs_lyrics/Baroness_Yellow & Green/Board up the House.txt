Board up the House LyricsTake me away from the ocean, already gone away
I'm already gone
Take me up North to the bluegrass, horse meat and pharmacies
I'm already gone
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
We wanted the best for our sweet little September castaway
I'm already gone
She's floating in acetone, covered in bruises and common colds
I'm already gone
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up
Hide your boys and hide your girls and hide your1Embed
