Little Things Lyrics
Cry your eyes out
A lesson left unlearned
I wish I was airborne
Then I could watch it turn

They've taken everything
Hung us out to dry
They've taken everything
Now you're...

Playing enemy
This is thought control

You're a greasy little thing
You'll scream before you sing
And you make a lot of noise
You lied about everything
You greasy little thing

I got with the program
I tried to fall in line
I wish I was drowning
Then I could watch you burn
They've taken everything
Hung us out to dry
They've taken every thing
Now you're....

You're a sneaky little thing
You'll scream before you sing
And you make a lot of noise
You lied about everything
You sneaky little thing

When the tide rolls in
When the trapdoor starts to swing
When the swans have sung
I'll be myself againEmbed
