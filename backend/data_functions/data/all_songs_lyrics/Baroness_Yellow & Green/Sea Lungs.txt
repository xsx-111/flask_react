Sea Lungs LyricsI can’t breathe
Nor can I see the sun
It’s so cold in here
Where did I go so wrong?
All these days
I’ve sail’d cross these wicked seas
And I have petitioned the deep
For water to keep me clean
When my ship comes in
I’ll find a way to breathe again
Breathe in deep
Let the sea fill your lungs
Its better to brace for death
Than die for a promised land
Why so sad?
Your tears are no match for mine
I am eternal sea
And you are a drowning man
When my ship comes in
I’ll find a way to breathe again
When my ship comes in
I’ll find a way to breathe again
When my ship comes in
I’ll find a way to breathe againEmbed
