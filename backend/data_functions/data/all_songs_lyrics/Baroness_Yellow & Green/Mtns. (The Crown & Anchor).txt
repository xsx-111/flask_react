Mtns. (The Crown & Anchor) Lyrics
You're never awake
Though you don't seem to sleep at all
Those stolen flowers inside your guts
Will take you away

Steady the hand that lays the child to bed
Barbitals and decay
The crown and the anchor

You'll curse at the sky
Three words for which the boys have no names
How many beasts in the night
To take you away
What quivers and shakes
What fills your stomach and clogs your veins
Whose claws do scratch at your wooden limbs
And tear you away

Steady the hand that lays the dogs to rest
Barbitals and decay
The crown and anchor
We will never sleep
We will never wake
We will drift away
We will never sleep
We will never wake
We will drift away1Embed
