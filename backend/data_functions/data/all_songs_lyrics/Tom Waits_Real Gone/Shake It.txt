Shake It LyricsStrip Poker Motel
Got a small blue tail
Hot ice, cold cash
I never been no good at staying out of jail
Wheel spin, roulette
Who's giving, don't get
Ripped shirt, black eye
Tuxedo, bow tie
Dark sound, straight road
Get lost, get loaded
Enlisted men, off-duty
Stolen clouds, dark beauty
Cold gun, wild rose
Night clerk, door closed
Lie down, baby
Your love is a faucet
Called China, cell phone
Chun King, not home
You know I feel like a
Preacher waving a gun around
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it baby
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it now
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it baby
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it now
Outside, it's damp
Put a towel on that lamp
You look hot in this light
I can love you all night
Shoes off, hair down
Got a pink nightgown
Mike Tyson KO'ed
On the wild, blue road
Small town, straight road
That rooster done crowed
Flat tire, homemade cross
You know I feel like a
Preacher waving a gun around
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it baby
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it now
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it baby
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it nowEmbed
