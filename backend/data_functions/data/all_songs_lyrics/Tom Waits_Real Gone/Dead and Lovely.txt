Dead and Lovely LyricsShe was a middle-class girl
She was in over her head
She thought she could stand up in the deep end
He had a bulletproof smile
He had money to burn
She thought she had the moon in her pocket
But now she's dead
She's so dead forever
Dead and lovely now
I've always been told to remember this
Don't let a fool kiss you, never marry for love
He was hard to impress
He knew everyone's secrets
He wore her on his arm just like jewelry
He never gave, but he got
He kept her on a leash
He's not the kind of wheel you fall asleep at
But now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now
Come closer, look deeper
You're falling fast
Just like a plane on the stormy sea
She made up someone to be
She made up somewhere to be from
This is one business in the world
Where there's no problem at all
Everything that is left, they will only plow under
Soon everyone you knew will be gone
And now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now
But now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now
I've always been told to remember this
Don't let a kiss fool you, never marry for love
Everything has its price
Everything has its place
What's more romantic than dying in the moonlight?
Now they're all watching the sea
What's lost can never be broken
Her roots were sweet, but they were so shallow
And now she's dead
Forever dead
Forever dead and lovely now
And now she's dead
Forever dead
And she's so dead and lovely now4Embed
