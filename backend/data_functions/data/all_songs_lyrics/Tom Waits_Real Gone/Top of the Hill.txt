Top of the Hill LyricsI'm gonna get me on the ride up
I'm gonna get me
Can I have a little more on my voice?
I'm gonna get me on the ride up
On the top of the hill
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
New corn yellow and slaughterhouse red
The birds keep singing, baby, after you're dead
I'm gonna miss you plenty, big old world
With your abalone earrings and your mother of pearl
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I need your moon to be the sky against
Don't get your trouser button stuck on the fence
Diego red and bedlam money are fine
Why don't you come up here and see me sometime?
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
There's very little leeway
I seen a mattress on the freeway
The moon rises over Dog Street
Jefferson said everything's reet
Have all the lights burned out on heaven again?
I'll never roll the number 7 again
I'm made of bread and I'm on an ocean of wine
I hear all the birdies on the phone just fine
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill, hey!
Black joke and the bean soup
The big sky and the Ford Coupe
Old maid and the dry bones
Red Rover and the Skinny Bones Jones
Forty-seven mules to pull this train
We're getting married in the pouring rain
You need your differential and plenty of oil
You load the wagon till the end of the world
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill, hey
If I had it all to do all over again
I'd try to rise above the laws of man
Why don't ya gimme another sip of your cup
Turn a Rolls Royce into a chicken coop, uh huh
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill1Embed
