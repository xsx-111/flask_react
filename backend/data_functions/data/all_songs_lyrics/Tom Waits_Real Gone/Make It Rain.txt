Make It Rain LyricsShe took all my money and my best friend
You know the story, here it comes again
I have no pride, I have no shame
You gotta make it rain
Make it rain
Since you're gone, deep inside it hurts
I'm just another sad guest on this dark Earth
I wanna believe in the mercy of the world again
Make it rain
Make it rain
Night's too quiet, stretched out alone
I need the whip of thunder and the wind's dark moan
I'm not Able, I'm just Cain
Open up the heavens
Make it rain
I'm close to heaven, crushed at the gate
They sharpen their knives on my mistakes
What she done, you can't give it a name
You gotta just make it rain
Make it rain, yeah
Without her love, without your kiss
Hell can't burn me more than this
I'm burning with all this pain
Put out the fire
Make it rain
I'm born to trouble, born to fate
Inside a promise I can't escape
It's the same old world, but nothing looks the same
Make it rain
Make it rain
Gotta make it rain
Make it rain
You've got to make it rain
Got to make it rain
You've got to
I stand alone here
I'll stand alone here
Singing, "Make it rain"
Make it rain
Make it rainEmbed
