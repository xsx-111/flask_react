Day After Tomorrow Lyrics
I got your letter today
And I miss you all so much here
I can't wait to see you all
And I'm counting the days here

I still believe that there's gold
At the end of the world
And I'll come home to Illinois
On the day after tomorrow

It is so hard and it's cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border

What I miss, you won't believe
Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow

I close my eyes every night
And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys
About what it means to be a soldier
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel
About all the blood that's been spilled
Will God on his throne get me back home
On the day after tomorrow?

You can't deny, the other side
Don't want to die anymore than we do
What I'm trying to say is, don't they pray
To the same God that we do?

Tell me how does God choose
Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel? Who throws the dice
On the day after tomorrow?

I am not fighting for justice
I am not fighting for freedom
I am fighting for my life
And another day in the world here

I just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come home
On the day after tomorrow
And the summer, it too will fade
And with it brings the winter's frost, dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have lost here

I'll be twenty-one today
I been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
And my plane, it will touch down
On the day after tomorrowEmbed
