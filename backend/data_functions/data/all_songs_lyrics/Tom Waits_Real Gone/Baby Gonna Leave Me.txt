Baby Gonna Leave Me LyricsWell I stood on the corner till my feet got wet
I stood by the faucet 'till the sink filled up
I stood by the window until the moon came up
My baby bought a ticket long as my clothesline
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
My baby went and left me in a '49 Ford
Going down the highway in a 49 sword
My baby ripped my heart out with every turn of the moon
Somebody told me there's never been a rose without a thorn
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
And I missed another ? of the doctors
And if I was a tree, I'd be a cut-down tree
And if I was a bed, I'd be an unmade bed
I'll get my 32/20 and it'll have to do
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Gone like the wind in the meadow and the rain on the hill
You even left your lipstick and your powder and your blush
Baby gonna leave me on a Greyhound bus
The stars are melting all across the sky
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na naEmbed
