Green Grass LyricsLay your head where my heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me
Come closer, don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by
Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle "Didn't He Ramble"
Now there's a bubble of me
And it's floating in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say
"It smells like rain today"
God took the stars and he tossed 'em
Can't tell the birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say goodbye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls, mark my words
We'll catch mockingbirds
Lay your head where, my heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me2Embed
