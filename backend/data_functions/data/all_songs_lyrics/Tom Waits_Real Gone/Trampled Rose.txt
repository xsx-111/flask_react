Trampled Rose LyricsLong way going to get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren
Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday
Found it in the street
At first, I did not see lying at my feet, a trampled rose
Passing the hat in church
It never stops going round
You never pay just once to get the job done
What I done to me, I done to you
So what happened to the trampled rose?
In the muddy street, with the fireworks and leaves
A blind man with a cup I asked
If he would sing "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine"
I know this rose like I know my name
The one I gave my love, it was the same
Now I find it in the street, a trampled roseEmbed
