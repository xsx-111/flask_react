I Just Needed You to Know LyricsI remember I would drive 95 in the middle of the night just to see you
And I would say "for goodness sake can this car go faster?"
I'd curse things in between that slowed me down
You were home talking to me on the phone
Saying "patience makes this last, dear"
And you were cool as you could be but inside you were aching for me
When I pulled into your little town you were standing on the sidewalk waiting in your nightgown
Do you remember lying in the grass?
We were there so long I swear I saw it grow
And that was when I knew our love would last
'Cause we could wait it out the winter and the snow
And I just needed you to know
We packed everything we had and a blanket in a bag for the weekend
And you'd say "the perfect getaway is just what we've needed"
But oh man when we got there not a hotel in town had a room to spare
Do you remember driving home that night?
We sang our favorite songs along the radio
And it was heaven being by your side
We made the most we had of every chance we had alone
And now I just needed you to know
This life is ours for worse or better yeah
And these dreams we'll dream along together yeah
'Cause this world is ours to share forever yeah
And everything I do will because of you
Everything
It is so clear to me that this was meant to be
Do you remember watching fireworks?
As we looked into the sky I made my plans
I did my best to put my love in words
When I knelt down at your feet and took your hand
Do you remember how it felt that night?
Knowing then and there was where we'd start to grow
You see I just needed you to knowEmbed
