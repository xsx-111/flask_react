My Favorite Dream LyricsYou are the cool wind that frees my bones
And I'm so reckless when you call to me
But when you're gone and I feel so alone
I want to curse the spell you have on me
I love and hate the way you make me feel
I never know when you're about to leave me
And there she goes at the speed of sound
Oh there she goes to pull me back around
I can still remember that cold evening when we first met
You had your mark on me you know you did
And every note and word you sang to me
Have never made their way out of my head
When you're away they keep me hanging on
But in our world you're only there, here until you're gone
There she goes at the speed of sound
Yeah, there she goes
And there she goes at the speed of sound
Yeah, there she goes
Was she a dream?
All I really know is that your hold on me is way to strong to be
Just a part of my imagination
And like this wind that I will never see
Why you refuse to let me know which where you're coming from
And there she goes
There she goes
There she goes at the speed of sound
Oh, there she goes
And there she goes
I want to curse the spell you have on me
(At the speed of sound)
You get me far so far from reality
(To pull me back around)
You make me feel like this was all just a dream
And there she goes
I still remember when you first saw me
(At the speed of sound)
You had the mark, oh the mark of your melody
(Oh, there she goes)
I love and hate the way you're making me
(To pull me back around)
You make me feel like this was just another dream
She was a dreamEmbed
