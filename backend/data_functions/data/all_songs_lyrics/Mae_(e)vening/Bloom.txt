Bloom LyricsLying on my back the clouds are smiling
A current flies through the moonlit sky with sweet reprise
Hands open I've lost my grip
The stars are shining down on me as if to say, "your day is over"
Riding on my wave these sails are open
I've been rolling on a wind that's never been mine
And all that night I'm floating
With the other ships
I remember when we came together we were just a beacon for the lonely
Yeah, when I've lost my way I walked around it
Yeah, when I've found my faith I still may doubt it
Yeah, this midnight air is cold and barren
Yeah, but the bloom of hope it keeps repairing
We watched the sun set fire to the sky that day
We warmed up to so many things we never could have made
And it comes to this
When we were young the world had lent itself to us but now we owe it
All we lost it
Yeah, we've lost our way and walked around it
Yeah, we've found our faith and then unwound it
Yeah, this midnight air is cold and barren
Yeah, but the bloom of hope, it keeps repairing
I'll search for you and find you
These questions are just answers on the other side of clarity
I'll reach for you and know you
I swear this time I'll pour myself out for you until there's nothing left
Yeah, we lost our way but found it
Yeah, we will live to see it out
Oh, hearts may break to make more room
Yeah, but love will find a way to bloom
Love will find a way to bloom
Love will find a way to bloomEmbed
