Sleep Well LyricsI begin to dream with barely open eyes tonight
A quiet melody it sings to me asleep I fall
With whispered songs of hope
That come toward my ears and stick inside my head
And hold at bay the fear
The droplets on the pain reverberate the same thing
Sleep well
Sleep well tonight
Oh won't you sleep well
Won't you sleep well tonight
All that I believe and all I know that we can do
It begins again with day it begins again with me and you
So let's quiet and be still and steal these peaceful hours all away
And we'll claim the stars as ours
I know just where they'll be and what they'll say they will sing
Sleep well
Sleep well tonight
Won't you sleep well
Won't you sleep well tonight
Sleep well
Sleep well tonight
Oh won't you sleep well
Won't you sleep well tonightEmbed
