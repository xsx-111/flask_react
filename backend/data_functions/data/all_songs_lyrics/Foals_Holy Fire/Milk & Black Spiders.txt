Milk & Black Spiders Lyrics
Oh, I know you're still with me
You my compass and my sea
And I know you're still with me
You my compass and my sea

Oh, I hope you can hear me
All those million miles away, you'd stay
'Cause I'd love you dearly
All those billion miles away

'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need

Green broken glass ocean
You break me, slow motion (Oh, oh)
No map and no message
It's the deepest green I know (Oh, oh)
But I know you're still with me
You're my compass and my sea (Oh, oh)
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need

'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need

'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thin' I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need8Embed
