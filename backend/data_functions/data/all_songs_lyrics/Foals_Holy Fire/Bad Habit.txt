Bad Habit Lyrics
I know
You've fallen again
The way I fell before
'Cause I'm a bad loser
When you get your way
And I know that Iâ€™m chained
I'm chained again
You've lost your way
To the bed that I once made

'Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
And I hope that I change
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

'Cause if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?

Still small
Small voice of calm
It's the blame into my arms
'Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
Oh, Mary, mercy!
Would you pray for me?
Would you pray for me?

'Cause if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?
And if I could
Make the days ok
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forget me now?

'Cause I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
And I know what's at stake
Wash the stains away...

'Cause if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?
And if I could
Take the pain away
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forgive me now?
I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
Wash the stains away

And I feel quite okay10Embed
