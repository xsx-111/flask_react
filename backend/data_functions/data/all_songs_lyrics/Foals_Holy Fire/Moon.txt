Moon Lyrics
Now I see you, trouble, it's coming up ahead
Black dogs running through the fields, they're dripping red
The world is quiet, there is nothing left unsaid
A million image, million caption, million dead

And all the birds fall out of the sky in two by twos
And my teeth fall out my head into the snow
I am you now and you are me instead
Then I see you with blood on your weddin' dress
And all of the old walk down and I'm feeling unsure
When I see you in my own place, when I'm not home


It is perfect, it is beautiful and still
And it is silent, it is white and it is good
And all 'bout the fallin' round with daisy chains in our hair
It is coming now my friend, and it's the end10Embed
