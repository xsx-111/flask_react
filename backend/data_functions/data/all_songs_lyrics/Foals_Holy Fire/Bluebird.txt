Bluebird Lyrics
I know I've made this journey before
And still it's not what I hoped for
I wait in the stone, way after dark
'cause you left your keys in the lock of my heart
The closer we get, the further apart
Then, what's left of me is left with you
You pull me around, sweet leash i'm on
With your milk in my veins, sand in my shoes
And I know now I would be there for youEmbed
