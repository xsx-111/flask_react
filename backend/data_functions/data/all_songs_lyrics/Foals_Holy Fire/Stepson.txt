Stepson LyricsStep by aching step, son
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming now for you
Step by aching step, son
Then I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming now for you
Oh, I'm coming now for you
But I'm fallin', deeper now I go
An' I'm fallin', down the cracks beneath the road
And I'm fallin', deeper down I go
And I'm fallin', deeper now I know
And I'm fallin', deeper down the shore
And I'm fallin' past the rocks way down below
As the rocks lay down below
As the rocks lay down below
Step by aching step, son
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming now for you
Step by aching step, son
And I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming now for you
Oh, I'm coming now for you
Coming now for you
Coming now for you
Coming now for you
Coming now for you (I know)
(Once grown, I'm older)
Coming now for you
(Now where's my )
Coming now for you
Coming now for you
(Replace my love)
Coming now for you
(Look down and)
Coming now for you4Embed
