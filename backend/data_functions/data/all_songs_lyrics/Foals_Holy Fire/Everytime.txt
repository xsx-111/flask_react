Everytime Lyrics
Come right this way, right this way
Follow, I promise you'll be okay
Come this way
Be that way, be that way
I want you, I need you to be okay
What do they know?

Now I'm fallin' down
Oh, you're fallin' down
I know I'm trapped
Oh you're trapped

Every time I see you
I want to sail away
With every time I see you
I want to sail away

Through the night
That sounds great
I know it'll be okay
Just come this way
Your feet on the dash
We break, we crash
See you go flying out into the night
Forever is past
Do they bother down?
Do they bother now?
Oh, you're trapped
Oh, you're trapped

With everytime I see you
I want to sail away
With everytime I see you
I want to sail away
'Cause the lights only bridge the gap
Through their holiday
With everytime I see you
I want to celebrate
Just sail away

With everytime, now
With everytime, now
Anytime now, anytime now
Everytime, now

With every time I see you
I want to sail away
With every time I see you
I want to sail away
'Cause the lights only bridge the gap
Through their holday
With every time I see you
I want to celebrate
Just sail away
Just sail away
Just sail away
Just sail away4Embed
