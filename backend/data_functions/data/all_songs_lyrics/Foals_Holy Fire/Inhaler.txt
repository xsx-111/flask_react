Inhaler Lyrics
Sticks and stones
Don't break my bones
They're make-believe
It's lock 'n' load
It’s a dead end road
For you and me
And I'm rusted gold
I’m stripped and sold
I'm make believe
And I'm up for rent
My head is spent
I guarantee

So can you not go away?
If just for one day?
Oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-ooh
Impossible, possible
How d'you feel now?
How d'you feel now in a war?
War sends out for you
And throw your fortune away
And I can't get enough space
Space
Space
Get enough space
I’m pale and coy
A momma’s boy
I'm make believe
I shimmy-shake
I wake 'n' bake
I’m over me
My lungs defeat
I cannot breathe
Don’t follow me
And you push and shove
I've had enough
You best believe

So can you not go away?
If just for one day?
Oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-ooh
Impossible, possible
How d'you feel now?
How d'you feel now in a war?
War sends out for you
Throw your fortune away
And I can’t get enough space
Space
I can't get enough space
Space
Can't get enough space
Can't get enough
