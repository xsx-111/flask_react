Out of the Woods Lyrics
It's times like these when I'm on my way out of the woods
Never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good
It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I'll never be afraid again, now I'm out of here for good

And it was just a dream
The most beautiful place I've seen
The white caps and the pines
Red carnations in the sea
It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good

Now I've finally found
All my friends are in the clouds
Alone now, in my head now
All alone now, in my head, woah
Woah, woah, oh

It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good

Now I've finally found
All my friends are in the clouds
Alone now, in my head now
All alone now, in your head, woah
And I've waited just so long
To sing you this final song
Time keeps ticking, time keeps pushing, time keeps rolling along, woah
Woah, woah, oh3Embed
