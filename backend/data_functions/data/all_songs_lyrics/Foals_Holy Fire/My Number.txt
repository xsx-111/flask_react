My Number Lyrics
You don’t have my number
We don’t need each other now
We don’t need the city
The creed or the culture now

Cause I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel the streets are not pulling me down

So people of the city
I don’t need your counsel now
And I don’t need your good advice
Cause you don’t have my lover’s touch

You don’t have my number
We don’t need each other now
The creed or the culture
We can move beyond it now

Now the wolf is knocking at my door
Bang-bang, it asks for more
Stand here, we stand tall
We can move beyond these walls
And I don’t need your counsel
And I don’t need these city streets
And I don’t need that good advice
Cause we can move beyond it now

You don’t have my number
We don’t need each other now
The creed or the culture
You don’t have my lover’s touch

Cause I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel the streets are not far from here

Can you even hear me?
Do you even know my name?
Can you see the ocean there?
You don't have my lover's touch
You don't have my number
You don't have my number
I wonder, can you hear me?
And are you even listening now?
'Cause you don’t have my number
And we don’t need each other now
And you can’t steal my thunder
Cause you don’t have my lover’s touch

You don’t have my number
And I don’t need no one now
And I don’t need these city streets
The creed or the culture now
Now
