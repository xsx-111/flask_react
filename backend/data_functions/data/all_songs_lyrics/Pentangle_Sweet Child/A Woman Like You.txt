A Woman Like You LyricsI don't believe I have seen
A woman like you anywhere
And I must admit that I can't see
Me making you into a dream
But if I had a magic wand to wave
I'd send a dove to catch your love
And I'd send a blackbird to steal your heart
But a broken heart won't cure
My endless search, little girl
I'm going to fix a magic spell
To weave on you, little girl
L for the long grass to catch you in
O for the orange to sweeten sin
V for this very moment
E for thee
I'd rather wait and die
A thousand times, little girl
Than take a woman into
The heart of my soul
And if I catch you sleeping all unawares
I'd carry you off to my secrеt lair
There I'll bind your heart
To my vеry soul
I don't believe I have seen
A woman like you anywhere
And I must admit that I can't see
Me making you into a dream
And if I had a magic wand to wave
I'd send a dove to catch your love
And I'd send a blackbird to steal your heartEmbed
