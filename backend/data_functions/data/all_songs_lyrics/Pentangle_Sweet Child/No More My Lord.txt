No More My Lord LyricsNo more, no more
No more, no more
Well, I'll never turn back no more
Jesus, He's the one
He's the one I'm lookin' for
And I'll never turn back no more
Tell me where, tell me where
Tell me where He can be found
And I'll never turn back no more
Down on my knees, down on my knees
Try and love if you please
Well, I'll never turn back no more
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
No more, no more
No more, no more
Well, I'll never turn back no moreEmbed
