Sovay LyricsSovay, Sovay, all on a day
She dressed herself in man's array
With a brace of pistols all at her side
To meet her true love
To meet her true love
Away she rides
As she was galloping on the plain
She met her true love and bid him stand
"Stand and deliver, young man" she said
"And if you do not
And if you do not
I'll shoot you dead"
He delivered up his golden store
And still she craved for one thing more
"That diamond ring that I see you wear
Oh, hand it over
Hand it over
And your life I'll spare"
"From my diamond ring I would not part
For it's a token from my sweetheart
Shoot and be damned, you rogue" said he
"And you'll be hanged then
And you'll be hanged then
For murdering me"
Next morning in the garden green
Young Sovay and her true love were seen
He spied his watch hanging from her clothes
Which made him blush lads
Which made him blush lads
Like any rose
"Why do you blush, you silly young thing?
I thought to have that diamond ring
'Twas I who robbed you all on that plain
So here's your gold, love
Here's your gold
And your watch and chain"
"I only did it for to know
If you would be a man or no
If you had given me that ring" she said
"I'd have pulled the trigger
Pulled the trigger
And shot you dead"Embed
