Watch the Stars LyricsWatch the stars, see how they run
Watch the stars, see how they run
You know the stars run down
At the setting of the sun
Watch the stars, see how they run
Watch the wind, see how it blows
Watch the wind, see how it blows
You know the wind shall blow
When the sun goes down
Watch the wind, see how it blows
Watch the moon, see how it glows
Watch the moon, see how it glows
You know the moon's gonna glow
When when the sun goes down
Watch the moon, see how it glows
Watch the stars, see how they run
Watch the stars, see how they run
You know the stars run down
At the setting of the sun
Watch the stars, see how they run
See how they run
See how they runEmbed
