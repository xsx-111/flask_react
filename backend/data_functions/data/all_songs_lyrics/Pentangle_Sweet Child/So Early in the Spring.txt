So Early in the Spring Lyrics(Uh, now we have the star end of the show
Coming up, uh, Jacqui's gonna sing us a song
Called "So Early in the Spring")
So early, early in the spring
I shipped on board to serve my king
I left my dearest dear behind
She often swore her heart was mine
And all the time I sailed the seas
I could not find a moment's ease
For thinking of my dearest dear
But never a word of her could I hear
At last I sailed into Glasgow town
I searched thе streets both up and down
Inquiring for my dearest dear
But nеver a word of her could I hear
I went straightaway to her father's hall
And gladly for my love did call
My daughter is married, she's a rich man's wife
She's wed to another much better for life
Oh, curse your gold and your silver, too
And curse the girl that won't prove true
Who all her former vows did break
And went with another for riches sake
If the girl is married that I adore
I'm sure I'll stay on land no more
I'll sail the seas 'til the day I die
I'll break through waves rolling mountain highEmbed
