Market Song Lyrics(Ladies and gentlemen, the Pentangle)
As I walk on to market
Each day I can hear them cry
"Sweet apples, sweet oranges
Sweet apples, sweet oranges"
"Fresh, freshly sent
For you out today
Come and buy them
Sweet apples, sweet oranges"
All alone I walk with no one
Beside me, would sooner buy
Sweet apples, sweet oranges
Sweet apples, sweet oranges
Walking through the stalls
I am amazed by them all
"Come and buy them
Sweet apples, sweet oranges"
Like a child my mind was a-wander
Far from here across thе sea
In the sweet apples, sweet orangеs
Sweet apples, sweet oranges
I hear, I hear the cries of the beggars
What will buy
"And sweet apples, sweet oranges
Come and buy them"
Through the forest I could see them
A-hanging there so ripe and red
Sweet apples, sweet oranges
Sweet apples, sweet oranges
Get up, get off, my man
You know they're better downed, belongs to you
"You gotta buy them
Sweet apples, sweet oranges
Sweet apples, sweet oranges"Embed
