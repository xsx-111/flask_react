Turn Your Money Green Lyrics(Uh, and then we move on to, traditional song
This one's called, uh
Huh
Ah, ha-ha-ha
There's been, ah, there's been a little bit of changing around, ha
It will be sung by John and Jacqui there, I think
Is that right?  I thought)
Stick with me, baby, I'll turn your money green
Stick with me, baby, I'll turn your money green
Show you more money than Rockefeller's ever seen
When I was in Missouri they would not let me be
When I was in Missouri they would not let me be
Wouldn't rest contented 'til I came to Tennessee
Stick with me, baby, I'll turn your money green
Stick with me, baby, I'll turn your money green
Show you more money than Rockefeller's ever seen
If the river was whiskey, baby, and I was a duck
If the river was whiskey, baby, and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom, I never would come up
Baby, it's alright, baby, any old way you do
Baby, it's alright, but stay away you do
Someday you may want me, baby, then I won't love you
Stick with me, baby, I'll turn your money green
Stick with me, baby, I'll turn your money green
Show you more money than Rockefeller's ever seenEmbed
