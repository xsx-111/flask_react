The Time Has Come LyricsOh, my babe
Doncha know?
The time has come
For me to go
Tomorrow comes
Like yesterday
The autumn fades
Our love away
So don't you think
Of me no more
I'm going to
Some foreign shore
And when I'm there
Maybe I'll find
Another young man
Pleasin' to my mind
Oh, my babe
Doncha know?
The time has come
For me to goEmbed
