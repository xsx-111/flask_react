Bruton Town - Live at the Royal Festival Hall 1968 with Intro Lyrics
(Um, I think this time we have a traditional song
So, um, about right? I got it right
It's called Bruton Town
In Bruton Town there lived a farmer
He had two sons and a daughter
Uh, the daughter falls in love with a servant in the house
And the brothers get together and they don't dig him very much
They don't really like this sort, with the servant and all that
So they take the servant out into the woods and they, on the pretext of hunting, and they do him in
Ah, he, that, that's about the end of the story)
One, two, three

In Bruton town there lived a farmer
Who had two sons and a daughter dear
By day and night they were contriving
To fill their parents' hearts with fear

He told his secrets to no other
But to her brother this he said
"I think our servant courts our sister
I think they have a mind to wed
I'll put an end to all their courtship
I'll send him silent to his grave"
They asked him to go a-hunting
Without any fear or strife
And these two bold and wicked villains
They took away this young man's life

And in the ditch there was no water
Where only bush and briars grew
They could not hide the blood of slaughter
So in the ditch his body they threw


When they returned home from hunting
She asked for her servant-man
"I ask because I see you whisper
So brothers tell me if you can"

"Oh, sister, you do offend me
Because you examine me
We've left him where we've been a-hunting
No more of him we could not see"
As she lay dreaming on her pillow
She thought she saw her heart's delight
By her bedside as she lay weeping
He was dressed in his bloody coat

"Don't weep for me, my dearest jewel
Don't weep for me nor care nor pine
For your two brothers killed me cruelly
In such a place you may me find"


As she rose early the next morning
With a heavy sigh and bitter groan
The only love that she admired
Lay in the ditch where he was thrown

Three days and nights she did sit by him
And her poor heart was filled with woe
'Til cruel hunger crept upon her
And home she was obliged to goEmbed
