I Loved a Lass LyricsOh, I loved a lass, and I loved her so well
That I hated all others for her that spoke ill
But this she rewarded me well for my love
She's a-gone to be wed to another
When I saw her, my love, to who the church go
With a bride and bride maidens she made a fine show
I followed her around with a heart full of woe
She's a-gone to be wed to another
When I saw my love sit down to dine
I sat down besidе her to pour out the wine
I drank to thе lassie that should have been mine
She's a-gone to be wed to another
And the men in the forest they ask it of me
Saying "How many strawberries grow in the salt sea?"
I answered them back with a tear in my eye
"How many ships sail in the forest?"Embed
