Moon Dog LyricsHe's a beggar on a street corner
To most passersby that's all he is
Playing a black pawnbroker
Moon Dog is
But to me he's somethin' special
As he sits alone a-playin' his drum
If I play he's right here with me
Moon Dog is
All you people who did see him
Won't you tell me what I missed
By never seein' this son of rhythm
'Cause that's what Moon Dog is?Embed
