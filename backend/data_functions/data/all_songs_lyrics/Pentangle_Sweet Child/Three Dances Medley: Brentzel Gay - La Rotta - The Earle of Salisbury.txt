Three Dances Medley: Brentzel Gay / La Rotta / The Earle of Salisbury Lyrics(Now, we're gonna have a set by Terry and John
Terry is playing his glockenspiel)
(I'd like first to play, um, two short dance tunes
First one is called "Brentzel Gay" and a lively French dance
Ah, written by a composer called Claude Gervaise
The second one is, uh, an Italian dance, ah, called "La Rotta")
Brentzel Gay

La Rotta

(We'll end this brief set with a tune called "The Earle of Salisbury"
