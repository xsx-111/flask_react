Sweet Child LyricsYou've been workin' so hard all day
Won't you take your rest?
You've been drivin' my blues away
Now, it is my turn
Come fly beneath my wings
Sweet child, it may not be for long
Well, I may be a-drinkin' hard
Like a fish that swims
And I could be ridin' high
Like a floatin' cloud
And if the rain does fall
Sweet child, I would not let you drown
Well, I would not care to see
Unstrippin' your eyes
I would not care to know
Where your heart does lie
I've tried to trust my heart
But my eyes are failin' me
Sweet child, come to me now
Let me take your hand
Well, I do not know you well
Yet, I've tried so hard
Through four and twenty years
Sweet child, I still don't understand
Well, I've heard there are brave men
Who could save our souls
With kind and gentle hearts
And love is their gold
I'd really want to know
Sweet child, who could shoot them down?
And I've a-thought about a man
Who does end his life
Who sheds his tears upon
Every mortal soul
And I wonder does he yearn
Sweet child, for death to come for him
And I once did see a child
She did sit and cry
Where has the pretty flower
In the darkness gone?
In the summer you shall see
Sweet child, I guess it won't be long
Won't you lay yourself down and rest?
Let your mind relax
Won't you cuddle into the night?
I will guide your path
Well, I may not be here long
'Cause I got a feelin' to be goneEmbed
