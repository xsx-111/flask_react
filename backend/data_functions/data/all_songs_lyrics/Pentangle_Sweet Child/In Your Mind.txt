In Your Mind LyricsSunlight through the morning cloud (In your mind)
I can see
Sparrows wake and shake from sleep (In your mind)
Beneath the sun
Often I do walk alive (In your mind)
Beneath the sun
There is not a sign of woe (In your mind)
All is quiet
Over there you could be mad (In your mind)
Like a fool
Searching for the true and why (In your mind)
Your are lost
With no one to take your hand (In your mind)
You are afraid
Time to rest and reason with (In your mind)
In your mindEmbed
