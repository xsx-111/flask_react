Strong Lyrics
Excuse me for a while
While I’m wide eyed and I’m so damn caught in the middle
I've excused you for a while
While I’m wide eyed and I’m so down caught in the middle

And if a lion, a lion, roars would you not listen?
If a child, a child cries would you not forgive them?

Yeah and man seems so strong
Yeah man speak so long
Man never been so wrong
Yeah and man seem so strong
Yeah man speak so long
Man never been so wrong

Excuse me for a while
Turn a blind eye with a stare caught right in the middle
Have you wondered for a while?
I have a feeling deep down you’re caught in the middle

And if a lion, a lion, roars would you not listen?
If a child, a child cries would you not forgive them?
Yeah and man seems so strong
Yeah man speak so long
Man never been so wrong
Yeah and man seem so strong
Yeah man speak so long
Man never been so wrong

Excuse me for a while
While I’m wide eyed and I’m so damn caught in the middle
Have you wondered for a while?
I have a feeling deep down you’re caught in the middle

Yeah and man seems so strong
Yeah man speak so long
Man never been so wrong
Yeah and man seem so strong
Yeah man speak so long
Man never been so wrong
