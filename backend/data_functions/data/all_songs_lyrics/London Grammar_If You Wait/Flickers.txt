Flickers Lyrics
The path is long, it’s cold and wet
Desire your paths will lead you quicker here than the rest
And you can hope for a life that is calm
But come in time, you’re gonna pick up one
That feels a little hard
The wind lays heavy, It weighs in stone
My instinct tells me I should walk this path alone
And you can hope for a life that is calm
But come in time, you’re gonna
Pick up one that feels a little hard

And everytime I go to bed
An image of you flickers in my head
And everytime I fall asleep
An image of you flows in my dream

Footsteps have traced this land before
My skin is hurting, I cannot feel my feet anymore
And you can hope for a life that is calm
But come in time, you’re gonna
Pick up one that feels a little hard

And every time I go to bed
An image of you flickers in my head
And every time I fall asleep
An image of you flows in my dream
And every time I go to bed
An image of you flickers in my head
And every time I fall asleep
An image of you flows in my dream

It flickers, it flickers in my head
It flickers, it flickers in my head
It flickers, it flickers in my head
It flickers, it flickers in my head
It flickers, it flickers in my head
(Yeah it flickers)
It flickers, It flickers in my head
It flickers, it flickers in my head
(Flickers in my head, It flickers)
It flickers in my head. It flickers
It flickers in my head. It flickers
It flickers in my head
It flickers, it flickers in my head
It flickers, it flickers in my head
In my head now
Can't get rid of it in my head no
In my head now
In my head now oh oh oh
In my head
In my head now
In my head
In my head now
In my head
Head, Head, Head
In my head, flickers in my head
You’ll flicker in my head Flicker in my head
You’ll flicker in my head3Embed
