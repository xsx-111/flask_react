Help Lyrics
Here we won't find treason heart
Help
Quiet, he sleeps with anything but love
Help, help
We need him to stay between us
And do you really understand?

Help
Can you help?
Help, help

Perfectly align to future's hour
Evidence he couldn't stay between us
Help, help
Black paint on a white canvas arm
Imprints of the words you chose to say

Help
Can you help?
Darling, can you help?
Darling, can you, can you help?
Help, help
Darling, can you help?
Can you?Embed
