Interlude (Live) Lyrics
Grey stairs beneath the moon
Tonight I’ll be dreaming of you
People and rhythm instead
And there you’ll be
There you’ll be inside my head

Hmmm, I will dream of you
Hmmm, you dream of me too
Hmmm, your hands, they’re on my face
Hmmm, there would be no better place

Some miracle man must have shot me while I wake
I never ran fast enough for my mistakes
Would you really want me in the light of day
That very same man shot flaws right through my face

Hmmm, I will dream of you
Hmmm, you dream of me too
Hmmm, your arms go around my waist
Hmmm, there would be no better place

Could you have your arms around my
Could you have your arms around my
In and out, in and out, no no no
In and out, in and out, no no no ooh
Oh oh3Embed
