Wasting My Young Years Lyrics
You crossed this line
Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight?
I've walked these miles, but I've walked them straight lined
You'll never know what it's like to be
Fine

And I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if, maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years

Don't you know that it's only fear?
And I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
I've heard it takes some time to get it right

I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if, maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
I don't know what you want
Don't leave me hanging on
I don't know what you want
Don't leave me hanging on22Embed
