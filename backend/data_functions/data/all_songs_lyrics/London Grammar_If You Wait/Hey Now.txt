Hey Now Lyrics:
Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, I can feel my instincts here for you
Hey now, by my bed for you
Hey now, hey now
:
Oh, you know it is frightening
Oh, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now
:
Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, leave it to the wayside like you do
For you, imagination calling mirrors for you
Hey now, hey now
:
Oh, you know it is frightening
Oh, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now, hey now, now
Hey now, now, hey now, now20Embed
