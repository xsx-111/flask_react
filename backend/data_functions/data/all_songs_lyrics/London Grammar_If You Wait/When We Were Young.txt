When We Were Young Lyrics
I know there's a voice that's buzzing in your head
I know there's a heartbeat tripping in your step
Tripping in your step
Glad I got my eardrums hurting and I can
Hurting and I can
See this working out exactly how I plan
Everything is moving fully like a mess
I know that my voice is buzzing in your head
Buzzing in your head

You know I want this, honey
And it is better than money
And when I'm feeling weak
Think back to times when we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

I can feel your hands, they're pulling at my dress
Living in a lie, only memories are left
I know there's a heartbeat tripping in your step
I know there's a voice that's buzzing in your head
Buzzing in your head

I know there's a voice that's buzzing in your head
When we were young
I know there's a heartbeat tripping in your step
Tripping in your step
When we were young
Glad I got my eardrums hurting and I can
When we were youngEmbed
