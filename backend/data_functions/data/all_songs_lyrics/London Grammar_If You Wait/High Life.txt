High Life Lyrics
Give up the high life, if that's okay
Take it or leave it for me
Follow you, I might
The darkest way
Only to leave it once again
And I, I know
I, I know

Give up your high life, if that's okay
Take it or leave it for me
Give up your high life, if that's okay
Take it or leave it for me

Put out the bright light to drive away
All that is honest and all that is brave
And follow you, I might
My darkest day
Only to leave it once again
And I, I know
And I, I know

Give up your high life, if that's okay
Take it or leave it for me
Give up your high life, if that's okay
Take it or leave it for me
We are, yeah we are, we own everything
We are, yeah we are, we owe nothing
We are, yeah we are, we own everything
We are, yeah we are, we owe nothing
We are, yeah we are, we own everything
We are, yeah we are, we owe nothing
We are, yeah we are, we own everything
We are, yeah we are, we owe nothing

Give up your high life, if that's okay
Take it or leave it for me
Give up your high life, if that's okay
Take it or leave it for me5Embed
