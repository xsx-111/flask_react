Maybe Lyrics
Live young for me as well
You did always take the weather
Be the one to carry on
Like you always do

Photographs, oh you look so well
And from here I can tell
You'll take a step away from what was so near

And where are you now?
Without a sound, are you there?
And face in the crowd
Feet over harsh ground
Are you there somewhere?

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe darling
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe darling

Quiet company is for you
Is for you to keep
Photographs, oh you look so well
And from here I can tell
You'll take a step away from what was so near

And where are you now?
Without a sound, are you there?
And face in the crowd
Feet over harsh ground
Are you there somewhere?

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe darling
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe darling

And where are you now?
Without a sound, are you there?
And face in the crowd
Feet over harsh ground
Are you there somewhere?

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe darling
Are you there somewhere?
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe darling
Are you there somewhere?1Embed
