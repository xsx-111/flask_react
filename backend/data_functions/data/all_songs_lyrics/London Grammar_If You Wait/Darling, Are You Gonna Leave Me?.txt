Darling, Are You Gonna Leave Me? Lyrics
I’m still holding onto your waistband
Turn away and kick out the red sand
Summer’s gone and now I'm bleeding
I can tell now you're thinking of leaving

Oh darling are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
Oh darling are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
Oh darling, are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
Oh darling are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
If you can...
If you love
If you love

Black rose, dusty roads and a fire
Burns in the distances higher
Hot stones, birth marks of the wild
Stretches to the distant horizon
Oh darling are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
Oh darling are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
(Ooh)
Oh darling are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
Oh darling are you gonna leave me?
I'll watch you if you can
If you can...
If you can
If you can...
Ooh, ohh

I’m still holding onto your waistband
Turn away and kick out the red sand
Summer’s gone and now I'm bleeding
I can tell now you're thinking of leaving3Embed
