Winter Lyrics
The summer was out of sight
We couldn't sleep at night
Shadows were closing in
Back in the dark again
Basement we didn't own
Cut off the telephone
Ceiling was falling down
Winter was underground

There are worlds
We can find
A hidden place
Is in our mind

Place where the water falls
Nobody ever calls
Sky is forever clear
Road never made it here
Forests are deep and green
Like nothing we've ever seen
Heavens revolving sin
Seasons change everything
There are worlds
We can find
A hidden place
Is in our mind

There are worlds
We can find
A hidden place
Is in our mind

There are worlds
We can find
A hidden place
Is in our mindEmbed
