Take the Long Way Around LyricsSunshine every beat when I'm around you
Feels like maybe I've been here before
Through the cold days of learning
To the soul days of yearning
Take the long way around
Take the long way around
You know when you need it
Heart begins to clear
Tell me when you've seen it
She goes any way the lights are going
She knows there's no meaning to defend
Pull the subway to the station
For that golden lights sensation
Take the long way around
Take the long way around
You know when you need it
Heart begins to clear
Tell me when you've seen it
Sometimes you underline destinations
Sometimes you try to find inspiration
Take the long way around
Take the long way around
Take the long way aroundEmbed
