Mount Everest Lyrics(Gerard Love)
In the highest mountain
In the only fountain
In the Russian river
With you
Heard a million singing
For a new bell ringing
Set a world in motion
With you
There's a new generation
They've been sleeping all day
Long ago when tomorrow is
So the flow don't freeze up on this
Hope you know that tomorrow is
Still above you
Everybody's chasing
Everybody's facing
Everyone's in motion
With you
If you're chasing the morning
If you're sleeping all day
Long ago when tomorrow is
So the flow don't freeze up on this
Hope you know that tomorrow is
Still above youEmbed
