Your Love Is the Place Where I Come From Lyrics(Raymond McGinley)
Your sadness don't lie
Your feelings can't hide
You always know why
But your reasons are sly
You never deny
What you feel inside
I
I disappear when you're not here
In my life
I can't slip away when I see your face
I lose my confusion
Your Love Is The Place Where I Come From
When I'm on my own I'm lost in space
My freedom's a delusion
Your Love Is The Place Where I Come From
My sadness don't lie
My feelings can't hide
I just can't deny
What I feel inside
