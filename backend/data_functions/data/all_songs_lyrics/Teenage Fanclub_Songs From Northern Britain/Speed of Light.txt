Speed of Light Lyrics
Drive an easy road
If you're looking for direction
Don't forget to set your ceiling low
Take an easy load
All you need is information
Everything is there to know

Only you and me add up
Only you and me add up
The speed of light and stars have planned it
Take it over, understand it
The speed of light and stars have planned it
Take it over, understand it

Need a changing face
When the wind's around you blowing
Don't forget to let your feelings go
Waste in space
If you're looking for persuasion
Everything you need can grow

Only you and me add up
Only you and me add up
The speed of light and stars have planned it
Take it over, understand it
The speed of light and stars have planned it
Take it over, understand it1Embed
