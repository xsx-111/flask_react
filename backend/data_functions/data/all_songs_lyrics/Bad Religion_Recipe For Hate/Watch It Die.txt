Watch It Die Lyrics
I was born on Planet Earth
The rotating ball where man comes first
It's been around for a long, long time
But now it's time to watch it die

I saw a man on my big blue screen
He ruled the world economy
He said the rich would never concede
But some day soon, he'll be put to sleep

I've seen the light of the forest green
And adaptations of the deep blue sea
And who knows who is the fittest?
They will all soon be put to rest

On a plunging flight (On a plunging flight)
And we're sitting in the pilot's seat
In the midst of life
People on a dark horizon
Praying somebody will save their lives

I was born on Planet Earth
At a drastic time full of plastic mirth
And everyday I've seen increasing signs
And you would too, if you'd open your eyes
You had a chance, you did not try
So now it's time to watch it die
Now it's time to watch it die!Embed
