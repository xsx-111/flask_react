Man with a Mission Lyrics
Rescue me when I get too deep
Talk to me, there's nothing to tell
Everyone is a hypocrite
Look to me, I'll save your soul

Now somebody out there must be reading my mail
'Cause everybody knows

Follow me when you give up
Work for me, it will serve you well
Everyone is a hypocrite
Come to me, I'll save your soul

Now somebody out there must be tapping my phone
'Cause everybody knows

I'm a man with a mission
I'm gonna fly you away
High above the noise and competition
I'm a man with a mission
Oh, Lord!

Now somebody out there must be reading my mail
'Cause everybody knows

I'm a man with a mission
Passing through your town today
I condemn you to fiery perdition
And I'm a man with a missionEmbed
