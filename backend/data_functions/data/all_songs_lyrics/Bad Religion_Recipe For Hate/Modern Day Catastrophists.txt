Modern Day Catastrophists Lyrics
Take those potatoes out of your ears
Listen to the warnings, verify all your fears
There's a world outside that's ready to blow
And we're all to blame when it finally explodes

You gotta listen up
Gotta listen to what they're sayin' to you
Gotta listen up
And think about what they're telling you

Temperature is rising above the odorous rain
Well maybe it's a light of what we throw away
If we don't reuse what's around and free
Our kids can't throw away their comic book fee

You gotta listen up
Gotta think about what I'm tellin' you
Gotta listen up
And think about what I'm sayin' to you

They're the modern day catastrophists
They've got practical solutions
They're the self-appointed righteous pragmatists
And they know fifty ways to save the world
What makes you think you can cure our disease?
Maybe it's just a biology
Maybe it's time to make room for another species
Delete the 21st century

You gotta listen up
Gotta think about what they're sayin' to you
Gotta listen up
And think about what they're tellin' you

They're the modern day catastrophists
They know all the right equations
They're the self-appointed righteous pragmatists
And you too can be one of the few to save the world

But you gotta listen up
And think about what they're tellin' you
Gotta listen up
And do exactly what they tell you to

They're the modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophistsEmbed
