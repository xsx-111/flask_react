Kerosene Lyrics
Everywhere I look, I see exclusive huddled, uninviting
Shelter is a privilege of the sane and competent

Kerosene keeps me warm
I'm alone to watch it burn
Kerosene

Exposure is a pitiful and pointless way of dying
Before it gets me, I'll build a funeral pyre

Kerosene keeps me warm
I'm alone to watch it burn
Kerosene

I'm a man and my dignity won't waive
Tonight, the buildings rage


Kerosene keeps me warm
I'm alone to watch it burn
Kerosene
Kerosene keeps me warm
I'm alone to watch it burn
Kerosene
Kerosene keeps me warm
Feels so good to watch it burn
Kerosene
Kerosene keeps me warm
Feels so good to watch it burn
Kerosene
Kerosene keeps me warm
Feels so good to watch it burn
Kerosene...1Embed
