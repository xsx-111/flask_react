Recipe for Hate Lyrics
Can't you feel it, can't you see
The promise of prosperity?
It's overwhelming you and me
It afflicts us like a disease
Ubiquitous, compelling too
We cling to you like crazy glue
And inject such a potent seed
It's best for all humanity

The spread of culture
The sword of progress
The vector of suffrage
A warm and septic breeze
The pomp and elation
The duty and vocation
The blood of the hybrid
It's just a recipe

Re-living our ancestry
The frightful lack of harmony
Our forefathers who led the way
Their victims are still here today
Now it's time to erase
The story of our bogus fate
Our history, as it's portrayed
Is just a recipe for hate
A recipe for hate
The spread of culture
The sword of progress
The vector of suffrage
A warm and septic breeze
The pomp and elation
The duty and vocation
The blood of the hybrid
Is just a recipe
