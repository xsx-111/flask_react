American Jesus Lyrics
I don't need to be a global citizen
'Cause I'm blessed by nationality
I'm a member of a growing populace
We enforce our popularity
There are things that seem to pull us under, and
There are things that drag us down
But there's a power and a vital presence
That's lurking all around

We've got the American Jesus
See him on the interstate
We've got the American Jesus
He helped build the president's estate

I feel sorry for the earth's population
'Cause so few live in the U.S.A
At least the foreigners can copy our morality
They can visit, but they cannot stay
Only precious few can garner the prosperity
It makes us walk with renewed confidence
We've got a place to go when we die
And the architect resides right here
We've got the American Jesus (Ah)
Bolstering national faith (Ah-ah-ah)
We've got the American Jesus (Ah-ah-ah)
Overwhelming millions every day (Ah-ah)

He's the farmers' barren fields (In God!)
The force the army wields (We trust!)
Expressions on the faces of the starving millions
(Because he's one of us)
The power of the man (Break down!)
The fuel that drives the Klan (Cave in!)
He's the motive and the conscience of the murderer
(We can redeem your sin)
He's the preacher on T.V. (Strong heart!)
The false sincerity (Clear mind!)
The form letter that's written by the big computers
(And infinitely kind)
The nuclear bombs (You lose!)
The kids with no moms (We win!)
And I'm fearful that he's inside me
(He is our champion) Yeah!

We've got the American Jesus
(We've got the American Jesus)
See him on the interstate
(We've got the American Jesus)
We've got the American Jesus
(We've got the American Jesus)
Exercising his authority
We've got the American Jesus
(We've got the American Jesus)
Bolstering national faith
(We've got the American Jesus)
We've got the American Jesus
(We've got the American Jesus)
Overwhelming millions every day
(Ah-ah-ah) Yeah!
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)
(One nation under God)7Embed
