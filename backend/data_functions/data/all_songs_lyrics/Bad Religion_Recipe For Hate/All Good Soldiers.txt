All Good Soldiers Lyrics
All good soldiers crack like boulders
The sun climbs up to a razor
Violins, new boots, and numbers on a chain
All good soldiers

All good (Soldiers)
Fall in line when they march and shout
All good (Soldiers)
Are a spectacle, marching and singing
We'll go anywhere the president says
Because the president believes in God
Like all good soldiers should

All good soldiers wait like warheads
When the fighting starts who will be
Accountable, a cannibal, a cannonball
All good soldiers, all good soldiers

All good (Soldiers)
Fall in line when they march and shout
All good (Soldiers)
Are a spectacle, marching and singing
We'll go anywhere the president says
Because the president believes in God
Like all good soldiers should
It's 6 a.m., I can see my breath
And the clay dirt is laughing at a weakling boy
Today is the day that I'll write my friends
It's something I've been trying to remember
I had a dream of a wall
That was twenty-one stories tall

All!

All good (Soldiers)
Fall in line when they march and shout
All good (Soldiers)
Are a spectacle, marching and singing
We'll go anywhere the president says
Because the president believes in God
Like all good soldiers shouldEmbed
