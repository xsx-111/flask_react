Stealth Lyrics
(Turn the lights off!) Hi! Welcome to Stealth! This is a strong narcotics stronghold. This weekend, I will spend over 800 million dollars on drugs. First, I will continue pushing a narcotics for all low income people not now covered, and soon after that, we can get rid of each and everyone of them. And I'm doing what I think is right, and they will certainly deserve it. Goodnight! *audience cheers and claps*Embed
