Teeth Lyrics
When the breeze takes a key
Out of your palm
And you're tired of playing
Playing the fool
Grab the lid back and cover
Everything you can

In an hour's time
Just when you get a look at
Your direction
That's when you realize

Somebody with dead feet
Shouldn't walk out on a limb
But I can see you're just a stupid full of words
And you couldn't reach out your hand
The city's ripe, jealousy and spite
Never really make you strong
You gotta get the proper button
On the information coming along

Where's your tact? The grab is on
About a thousand speed of light
I want a sister lost in me
Then you got it again and againEmbed
