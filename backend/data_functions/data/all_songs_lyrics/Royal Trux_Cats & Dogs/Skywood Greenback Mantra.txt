Skywood Greenback Mantra Lyrics
If you wanna stare hard at the inside of your head for the rest of your life
Well, baby, that's just fine with me
Going on those plate glass turns
Crawling around on all fours
Well, I think you know the score


If you wanna stare hard at the inside of your head for the rest of your life
Well, baby, that's just fine with me
Going on those plate glass turns
Crawling around on all fours
Well, I think you know the score

Sister's got it going on
Sister's got it going onEmbed
