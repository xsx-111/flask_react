Tight Pants Lyrics
She woke up in the morning
Something smelled good
He is of strength
She never told her dad
The last thing she said was
"Man, you're crazy"
She told him that it wouldn't work
He knew it and it really hurt

She woke up in the morning
Something smelled good
He is of strength
She never told her dad
The last thing she said was
"Man, you're crazy"Embed
