The Spectre Lyrics
My faith is in the spectre and there it shall remain
The specter is a surgeon, an anatomic guide
He haunts the lenses of my eyes
And the chemicals in my brain

Once there was a rich man who drank from the spectre's cup
He always held his head so high but he never would look up
The spectre was above his head hanging like a sword
The lesson now it must be said, the spectre is its own rewardEmbed
