Turn Of The Century Lyrics
If you hand me my cape
And my dog-headed cane
Don't mind the rain
We gotta go downtown
Bulletin board says it starts today
Clear space and an open way

So get me my coat and we'll go down
I know you're just a kid
Doesn't matter what you did up to now
Give me my coat, we'll go down

I say it's gonna be
Like a big live TV
But don't believe the things you don't see
Don't believe me
I know there won't be anyone asking why we're there
We don't need no tickets
Everyone will just let us
Stare
'Cause they've made their choices just like me
And there're things they won't have to see
We can just sit and breathe
With the trees
I say their thoughts are flashing and quick
But they move so slow 'cause their minds are so thick
And if we want we can punch into their heads
Feel the wheels moving and know they go on
Perpetually
So bring me my coat and we'll go down
Go sit in the square
Where the prisons used to be
Just sit around
Get our balance in this new gravity

Won't have to be some useless kick
Don't enjoy choices so bleak
Twist it all upside down
Give me my coat, little sister
And I'll bring the car around
Give me my coat, little sister
And I'll bring the car around
