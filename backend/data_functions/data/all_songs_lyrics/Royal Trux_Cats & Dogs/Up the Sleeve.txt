Up the Sleeve Lyrics
Jesus came knocking on my borrowed door
Something patched together
That he'll want some money for
The investigation where they keep the ice
I realized he was nodding out
So I took myself some twice

At the end of the day when I get back
I realize it's time to leave
It's not in the moon or in his face
I guess it must be up his sleeve

On the next day you know I saw his wife
Tied to the cab of the truck, you know
And begging for her life
Well, the truck flipped over when it hit a wall
She got out and she bought herself some great
At the brand new shopping mall

At the end of the day when I get back
I realize it's time to leave
It's not in the moon or in his face
I guess it must be up his sleeveEmbed
