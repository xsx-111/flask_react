Hot and Cold Skulls Lyrics
You got our blessings and we touched your face
But there was something in the way you pulled the team
A self-involvement to the first degree
Like hearing drumming coming from undersea

You got a hundred friends and you mess around
You do this and say that and move all over town
And it's so right it's what you gotta do
And it looks so right in the magic mirror that you never wanna step into

All you get are hot and cold skulls
Or you get nothing at all
All you get are hot and cold skulls
Or you get nothing at allEmbed
