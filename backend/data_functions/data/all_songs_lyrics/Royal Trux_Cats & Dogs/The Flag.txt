The Flag Lyrics
You hold the devil
Hold him tight
No one can park the car
A second time
One thousand hours like superman
The agony returns
You noted with bells and telescope
The engine starts to burn

Burns yours devils
Bails and crash
Crash into the sea
Jose Cutthroat's gone to shore
By night like night they breed

You know I hear them singing a cutthroat song
Dancing in the relic ball
When then tried to rob my crap
I had to kill them all
Every night they'd try again
C'mon, get an undertaker
And bury them

You know I hear them singing a cutthroat song
Dancing in the relic ball
When then tried to rob my crap
I had to kill them all
Every night they'd try again
C'mon, get an undertaker
And bury them
Oh yeahEmbed
