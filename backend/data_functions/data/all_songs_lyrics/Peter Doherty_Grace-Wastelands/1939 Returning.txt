1939 Returning LyricsCaptured clandestine
Crawled into the lights
He knew he was in for a shoeing
Just wasn't to be his night
Dragged out of the frozen Rhine
For the Motherland and the Third Reich
A toeing's as good as a shoeing
When it's not to be your night, your night
Tread carefully, so carefully upon the drifting ice
Caught behind enemy lines in 1939
For Germany he sacrificed his life
Caught behind enemy lines there in 1939
Kids knee deep in rubble
London urchins grey with dust
Packed off far west in evacuations
To farmers' wives, green and pleasant lives
Far from the doodlebugs
Nanna doll, she still remembers
Leaving town in worn out shoes
Now she's back out west in sheltered accommodations
Homes for the old where pills aren't the only blues
Tread carefully, so carefully upon the drifting ice
Staring blank into the TV guide in 2009
How it's hurting me, I've only seen her twice
Since you went west for the second time since 1939, 39, 39Embed
