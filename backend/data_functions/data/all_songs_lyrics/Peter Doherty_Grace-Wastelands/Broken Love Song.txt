Broken Love Song LyricsTake a broken love song
Keep it by your side
Never be lonely
Find a place to hide
By the Westway
Inside the Scrubs
How long must we wait
For them killing us?
Killing us
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
Still
Through my cell window
Hear the loft-boy sing
"Come on, you R's"
Carried on the wind
Every morning I'll be singing
Like a caged bird you might say
John, Paul, George and Ringo
Help pass the hours away
Free as a bird will I be
Another dawn creeps up on me
On me
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
Letters from faceless haters
Who'd love to see me swinging in my cell
Why, I never saw a man
Who looked with such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Prisoners call the sky
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
They are the loneliest
Still
Take a broken love song
Keep it by your sideEmbed
