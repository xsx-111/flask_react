Palace of Bone LyricsWe've been a long time together now
Time together on the Snakey Road
There ain't no time together
Like time spent together on the Snakey Road
Winding on through the hills forever
Winding on at Snakey Road
Winding on forever
Winding on at Snakey Road
What's that they're telling you?
That's your future, I'm telling you
You gotta pick a pocket or two
We've been a long time together
Time together on the Snakey Road
There ain't no time together
Like time spent together on the Snakey Road
Winding on through the hills together
Winding on at Snakey Road
Winding on forever
Winding on at Snakey Road
What's that they're selling you?
Lotions, some potions, selling you
They're gonna pick a pocket or two
In the clearing, I'm going to build me a palace of bone
With wide open walls and an ebony throne
And all the broken children from every broken homes
Can come and live in the palace of bone
I'm going to build me a palace of bone
With wide open walls and an ebony throne
Well, there ain't no blackened heart
There's no innocent soul
Can come and dance in the palace of bone
Been a time together
Time together on the Snakey RoadEmbed
