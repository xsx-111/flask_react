Salome LyricsIn the cold, the coldest of nights
A fire alights to warm my bones
I've had enough of the dreadful cold
And from the flames appears Salome
I stand before her amazed
As she dances and demands
The head of John the Baptist on a plate
In the morning
Shaken and disturbed
From under soft white furs
See the dust in the morning bright
Sets the room alight
By the telly appears Salome
I stand before her amazed
As she dances and demands
The head of Isadora Duncan on a plate
Oh, Salome
Oh, Salome
In the cold, coldest of nights
A fire alights to warm my bones
I've had enough of the dreadful cold
From the flames appears Salome
I stand before her amazed
As she dances and demands
The head of any bastard on a plateEmbed
