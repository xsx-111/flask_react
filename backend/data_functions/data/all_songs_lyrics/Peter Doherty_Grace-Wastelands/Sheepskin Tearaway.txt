Sheepskin Tearaway LyricsShe opened her heart  to a tearaway
Sheepskin Tearaway
He was covered in  scars and full of heroin
Everyone said from the start
Not one single thing could ever be okay
She didn't listen anyway

She just opened her heart
Threw her cares away
The night they held on so tight in the dark
He brushed her hair away
And she heard him say "All my life I've been fighting
And making the best of a really, very bad lot
Very bad lot, I got a very bad lot indeed"
All your fighting got you nowhere
If nowhere's here, with you on my skin
And you could fight forever
But if you kill them all
You'd never win
So give me your surrender
There are other ways to kill the pain
But things will never mend you
It's like trying to dry your eyes in the pouring rain
She opened her heart to a tearaway, Sheepskin Tearaway
All covered in scars and full of heroin
Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
Sheepskin TearawayEmbed
