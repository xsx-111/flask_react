Sweet By And By Lyrics2,3,4
Was it so long ago
When we first hit the road
I remember
Those earliest shows
When we used to go
Pa pa ra pa pa
Pa pa ra ra ra ra ra ta ta
Was it so long ago
When you said you loved me so
And with kisses untold
Your love would unfold
Oh my where did you go
Oh I don't know
You didn't say goodbye
Where did you go?
Oh you lie
And you left me wandering, wondering
Your love's just a lie
Left me wondering if you've found some other guy
Well all I do is hang my head and cry
Sometimes I moan, sometimes I moan
Where did you go
Oh I don't know
You didn't say goodbye
Where did you go
I don't know, I was left wondering
If love's just a lie
Everywhere I go people say
"Who's that funny guy?
All he does is hang his head and cry
Sometimes he moans, sometimes he moans"
"Oh, Oh why?"
When we used to go
Pa pa ra pa pa...Embed
