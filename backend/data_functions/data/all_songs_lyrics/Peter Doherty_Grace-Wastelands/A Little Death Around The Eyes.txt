A Little Death Around The Eyes LyricsA little death around the eyes
Your boyfriend's name was Dave
I was bold and brave
And now you're mine
You cook and clean and sew
When I tell you to, when I ask you to
If I ask you to
But I don't want you to..
You don't need tellin' twice with me
You don't need tellin' twice
You know who wears the trousers
No one wears the trousers
In a nutshell
To break free
Ya well, you'll never have break free of me
Your boyfriend's name was Dave
I was bold and brave
And now you're mine
You cook and clean and sew
When I tell you to
Dance and screw when I want you to
In a hotel room you take your medicine
On all fours, that's your medicine
Feeling better son?
Filling in the cracks
In a nutshell
Feeling any better now?
Wish upon a star..
Some vague idea of the man you used to be
Oh the man you used to me
(Filling in the cracks)
Fee-fi-fo-fum
I smell the blood of an englishman
Be he alive or be he dead
(Filling in the cracks)
Wish upon a star
A little death around the eyes...Embed
