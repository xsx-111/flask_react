New Love Grows On Trees LyricsAre you still talking to
All of those dead film stars
Like you used to
And are you still thinking of
All of those pretty rhymes
And perfect crimes
Like you used to love
And if you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Should I kill you like you asked me to
If you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Would I kill you I know you told me to
But I really don't want to
I remember every single thing you said to me
You played the man and I was Calvary
And you said, ah you said
New love grows on trees
New love grows on trees
New love grows
New love grows on trees
If you please and if you don't please
That makes perfect nonsense to me
The price of being free these days
It's ridiculous
Are you still shaking out
All of the dead wood from your bed love
Like you used to
Well times don't change and you're still thinking up
All of those pretty rhymes for love to bind
Oh no, you really don't have to
If you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Should I kill you
If you're still
Shall I kill you, I really don't want to
But I really don't want to
I remember every single thing you said to me
You played the man and I was Calvary
And you said, ah you said
New love grows on trees
New love grows on trees
New love grows on
New love grows on treesEmbed
