The Lines You Amend LyricsSaid you'd found a way to end it peacefully
I remember finding shoes near the lake under a tree
And I'm sittin' on the shore
I thought I saw your charm float by
It doesn't matter now
Cause all you wanted to do was die, yeah
If only you'd stuck around
I never would have made a sound
But now you're on the ocean floor
And I've opened a brand new door
Brand new door
Swimming out to sea
Trying to find something else
While I'm skipping stones
And I'm listening to the shells
And I won't forget you
If someone else comes along
I found the words you wrote
But I would not dare to quote
My friends, the lines you amend
Like "What's so bad about dying anyway"
Swimming out to sea
Trying to find something else
While I'm skipping stones
And I'm listening to the shells
And I won't forget you
If someone else comes along
You'll always come to mind
Whenever I hear that song, yeah
The one about photographs
Sung by Ringo Starr
Especially in the chorus part
You always said, "Now don't you start"
Don't you start, yeah yeah
Don't you start
Don't you startEmbed
