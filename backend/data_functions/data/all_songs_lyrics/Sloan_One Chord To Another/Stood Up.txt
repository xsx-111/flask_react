Stood Up Lyrics
I gotta meet my friends
You go ahead, I said I'd wait here
I thought I was supposed to meet them
I guess I was mistaken
This is a waste of time
They made it clear that they're not coming
I'm glad I didn't hold my breath
I'm already so blue

I couldn't take a hint
And it slapped me in the face

Stood up in my time
It helps to put me in my place

Given they won't show
Then what should be my recourse
Should I draw a line?
Do you suppose they'd come and meet me?
Even if they did
It's not for certain I would know them
Keep in mind I've yet to meet them
For all I know it's you
I couldn't take a hint
And it smacked me in the face

La, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la-la
(Stood up, stood up, stood up, stood up, woo!)

Stood up and recognised
That I have yet to find my place
That I have yet to find my place
That I have yet to find my place, yepEmbed
