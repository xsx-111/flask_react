The Good In Everyone LyricsFirst off, here's what you do to me
You get rough, attack my self-esteem
It's not much, but it's the best I've got
And I thought you saw the good in everyone
Ooh, the good in everyone
You see the good in everyone
You see the good in everyone
I close my eyes, I can't give it up
I close my mind, I can't get enough
I'm in no shape, I gotta turn it off
Just let it play The Good In Everyone
Ooh, the good in everyone
You see the good in everyone
You see the good in everyone
You see the good in everyone
Ooh, the good in everyoneEmbed
