Same Old Flame Lyrics
Drank it all to the last taste
And woke up with a fresh face
Another date in the U.K
And everybody surrounds us
We're living high on a tour bus
It's not that bad, the best we've had
I ate Italian in Germany
I spent my money on magazines
That talked to me and my friends
But the phone wouldn't reach her
I burned it down to the filter
Another day to wait, she'll see my face

Are you gonna tell me soon
What the hell I'm supposed to do
To make it feel alright?
I've got more to say than you
But I'm not sure what that proves
Stamping out the same old flame
It's not my fault, I'm not to blame
Dancing 'round the same old flame
Ah-ha, ah-ha

Had some trouble when I was south
You had to come down and bail me out
And that's the damage between us
When the storm blew me out of town
And when my feet finally hit the ground
I was miles away with no one around
And are you gonna tell me soon
What the hell I'm supposed to do
To make it feel alright?
I've got more to say than you
But I'm not sure what that proves
Stamping out the same old flame
It's not my fault, I'm not to blame
Dancing 'round the same old flame
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha-ah

It's a major cause of damage between us
It's a major cause of
Damage between us (damage between us)
Damage between us
Damage between us
Damage between us

Cigarettes that burn too fast
But the same old flame just lasts
I've got more to say to you
But I'm afraid to follow through
Are you gonna tell me soon
What the hell I'm supposed to do
To make it feel alright?Embed
