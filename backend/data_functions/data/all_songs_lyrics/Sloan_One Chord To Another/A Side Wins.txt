A Side Wins LyricsWhere is my camera
This picture denies all my ties
To this side of the road
And maybe in Florida
I'd hold up myself for the keys
To the cramp in your style
I raise my glass to the cut and dry
To the amplified
I raise my glass to the B-side
I, I live through everything
'Cause I'm overdressed
Yeah overdressed when I'm put to a test
If news
Of every inch of you, were sold by Friday
In my way, I'd spread your wealth
And drink up to your health
I raise my glass to the cut and dry
To the amplified
I raise my glass to the B-sideEmbed
