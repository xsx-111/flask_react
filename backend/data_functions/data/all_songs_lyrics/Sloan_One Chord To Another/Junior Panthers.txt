Junior Panthers LyricsYou touched my hand
I'm not a fan
You held a dance in your basement
The mirror ball
The horse's stall
There was no arrangement
You're so thin
Where've you been
I never got the chance to tell you
Yes or no
I let it go too long
Alright
Ooooh...
Out and about with the Junior Panthers
And now I'm riding on the back
Looking over your shoulder
So you'll know I'm there
I forgot to signal right
Now I'm running the red light
What about your sister, I often miss her
But I see her more than you
Now I see you
I don't see you at all
In the mirror ball
Ooooh...Embed
