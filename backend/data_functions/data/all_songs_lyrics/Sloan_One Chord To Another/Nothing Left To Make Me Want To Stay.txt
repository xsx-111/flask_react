Nothing Left To Make Me Want To Stay LyricsThere are those who live their life
As if there is no other
So they burn their bridges but they couldn't
Care any less
Comes a time that catches up
They pay no matter, pack their bags
And take off to another place to start
From scratch
They never get attached
Growing up was wall-to-wall excitement
But I don't recall another who could
Understand at all
And I didn't try to find what I just had to fall
Fall out
It's alright, I've had it up to here with everyone
And so I'll say
That there's nothing left to make me want to stay
There are those who live their life
Afraid of consequences
So they learn to sit on fences
And they can't step on toes
My heart goes out to those
They're right under my nose
Growing up was pretty dull
I often times exaggerate
The ones I hate that I
Could never save
And I realize of course
That there will come a day
That I will say
That there's nothing left to make me want to stay
But I can never go away
That there's nothing left to make me want to stay
And I will never go away
And there's nothing left to make me want to stayEmbed
