G Turns To D LyricsThese songs are all about you
And I'm tellin' everyone I'm doin' fine without you
I hurt you but I helped you
You may think I've a lot of nerve
But I deserve some credit
Or at least an edit
Take out the part that breaks my heart
And makes me sound uncaring
If you eliminate the swearing
Then I could show my mother
That you can go from one chord to another
G will turn to D
You'll turn to me
And you'll say
You have done me wrong
I wrote these songs about it
She's aware it's all been done before
It's another song in this key
Yeah but this one's about me
That all the validity she needs
Her criticism's brutal
But I don't really mind
Yeah, she's put it out on vinyl
But it's pretty hard to find, but you'll hear
G will turn to D
You'll turn to me
And you'll say
You have done me wrong
I wrote these songs about it
I wish I'd never taught her how to play
I knew she'd get me I should have known
Now her hands are on the fretboard
In an unfamiliar way
And it's tellin' me
She's aware it's all been done before
It's another song in this key
Yeah but this one's about me
I may not wanna hear the words to
G when put with D
But if you take what you're shown
Learn on your own
Then everything you do
Belongs to you
But know that you are on your own
On your ownEmbed
