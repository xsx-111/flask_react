The Blast Lyrics
Let me, let me practice.. hehehe, ehehe
Talib.. T'Kwi, Kweli - I can't say it!
That's wack..
Yeah.. yeah..
Yeah.. yeah..
Yeah.. yeah..

Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions?
I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek
And he from the Natti (Natti)
We make the sky crack, feel the fly track
Get your hands up like a hijack
Fists in the air for (Kweli)
Keep 'em there like
Natural mystic or smoke when the spliffs lit
It's a revolutionary (Party) word
They ask me what I'm writin' for
I'm writin' to show you what we fightin' for
Say "Tah-leeb" or "Talib" (Talib)
If it's hard, try spellin' it phonetically
If not, then just Let It Be like Nina Simone
You probably (Probably) don't listen, B
Even when we suffer losses, I count the victories
Sometimes it's far and between I'm sad to say
It got my brain crowded like sunset on a Saturday
I know my son wept 'cause his dad's away
"Stop cryin', be strong for your momma" is what I had to say
To my little man named Amani ('Mani)
Start the party, my crew hot, feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double-barrel shottie (Shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
Who make you rock your body (Body)
Start the party, my crew hot, feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double-barrel shottie (Shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli

I remember when it all started
Back in the day when me and moms first parted
Hi-Tek from the beginnin', I stayed advanced
A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game, nigga, never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle, concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused, while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high, I stay lower
Stackin' my chips to get a foreclosure
This shit ain't over
Goin' for the gusto, keep getting that provo
It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flo-Jo
Bet you ain't even know I had flow, though

Yo, make you rock your body (Body)
Start the party, my crew hot, feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double-barrel shottie (Shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
Say my name, say my name (Kweli), like Destiny's Child
Shine bright like my girl heavenly smile
Or a suit on Steve Harvey (Harvey)
We tighter than them jeans that huggin' black hips 70's style
Like Chaka Khan, ain't nobody (Body)
Set the stage ablaze like my crew, we burn it down like sage and
Smokin', clubs is where we party (Party)
Holla at spit kickin' niggas
Pharoahe Monch, De La Soul, Common Sense
And my man Biz Markie (Markie)

Start the party, my crew hot, feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double-barrel shottie (Shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
Who make you rock your body (Body)
Start the party, my crew hot, feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double-barrel shottie (Shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
You got to ...
Keep on dancin'
Ya gotta keep on dancin', oh oh ohhhhhh, yeah yeahhhhhhh
Keep on dancin'
Ya gotta keep on dancin', oh oh ohhhhhh, yeah yeahhhhhhh
Keep on dancin'
Ya gotta keep on dancin', oh oh ohhhhhh, yeah yeahhhhhhh
Keep on dancin'
Ya gotta keep on dancin', oh oh ohhhhhh, yeah yeahhhhhhh
Yeah, this is Gil Scott-Heron and I'm from Harlem
Everybody knows where that is so that's where I'm from
Talib Kweli and DJ Hi-Tek, Reflection Eternal
The new album is called the Train of Thought
I'm urging everybody to get a ticket and get on the train
'cause that's what you need to be doing
So check that out, peace14Embed
