I Think You Know Lyrics
The visitors were never seen
They missed my monologue between
But I think you know
The letters came, the letters went
The last reply was never sent
But I think you know

I can't explain what's in my brain that tells me where to go
But I think you know
I think you know

For I would draw a diagram
To signify the things I am
But I think you know
And in the end it all boils down
A useless bit of running 'round
'Cause I think you know

And love I send to you my friend but never tell you so
But I think you know
I think you know
