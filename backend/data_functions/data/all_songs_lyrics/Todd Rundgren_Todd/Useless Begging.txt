Useless Begging Lyrics
Is that you?
Look who's on the skids this time
Bitchin' 'bout her place in line
And all you really want is attention
But you're like every other girl uptown
Who wants to ride her face around
And wave about that power you have to put me down
And so I'll tell ya

To see you like this is nearly tragic
It's like Ruby says our dreams have magic
But I know useless begging won't help me
(Useless begging won't help me)

Yes it's you
You leave me nothing left to say
'Cause I thought that we'd return one day
Together to a great sphere of knowledge
But that would never do for you
'Cause you thought you knew a thing or two
But you don't even know what is and isn't true
And so I'll tell ya
I was a fool that's why I got burned
But in all that time there's one thing I learned
And that is useless begging won't help me
(Useless begging won't help me)


To see you like this is nearly tragic
It's like Ruby says our dreams have magic
But I know useless begging won't help me
(Useless begging won't help me, won't help me)Embed
