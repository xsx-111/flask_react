No. 1 Lowest Common Denominator Lyrics
I wanna see your number 1 lowest common denominator, yeah
You're so hot (so hot)
You're so hot (so hot)
You're so hot (so hot)
You're so hot (what you got)
On the outside I'm a good boy
Let me inside 'cause I'm full of joy
I don't wanna shock you but I'm an electric eel, yeah
How's that make your denominator feel?

Think I'll surprise her
I can always depend on my great equalizer, yeah
I wanna grind (and grind)
And grind (and grind)
And grind (and grind)
And grind (lose your mind)
I kissed you once but will I kiss you again?
Be certain with sex and you'll always have friends
Your glands wanna freak, your hands wanna speak
And your mind slips away at the peak

Time stops, the light goes on
A thundering head and no body
Washed up and woke up on the beach
Seaside breakfast, a tender egg on white sand
Legs long and tan without a break, even to the neck
Suddenly, simultaneously, an eclipse and a snowfall
Flakes melt instantly on the shoulders like wet silver
Burning little holes all the way to the marrow
Puckered flesh like avocado sags into a green pool
All the birds leave turquoise ruts across the velveeta sky
It's time to scream

I wanna be your number 1 lowest common denominator
(Number 1 lowest common denominator)
(Number 1 lowest common denominator)
(Number 1 lowest common denominator)Embed
