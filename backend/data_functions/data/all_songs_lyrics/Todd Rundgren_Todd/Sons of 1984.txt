Sons of 1984 Lyrics
Open your eyes and see
The world I couldn't change for you
Reach out your hand and take
The world that will belong to you
We were on our way to a better day
And the spirit was in us all
But as time went by we fell by the wayside
Maybe you'll be the last to fall

You are the only ones
There is nobody left but you
You are the chosen ones
There is nobody else to choose
Back when I was young, my hope was strong
But the time blew it all to hell
If I thought I knew what was good for you
I would have gone and done it for myself

Worlds of tomorrow
Life without sorrow
Take it because it's yours
Sons of 1984
Worlds of tomorrow
Life without sorrow
Take it because it's yours
Sons of 1984

I can still see the great panorama of hate
Being cleansed by our loving hands
But the brothers broke stride, the sisters cried
So you have to start all over again

Worlds of tomorrow
Life without sorrow
Take it because it's yours
Sons of 1984
Worlds of tomorrow
Life without sorrow
Take it because it's yours
Sons of 1984
Worlds of tomorrow
Life without sorrow
Take it because it's yours
Sons of 1984
Worlds of tomorrow
Life without sorrow
Take it because it's yours
