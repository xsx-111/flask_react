Heavy Metal Kids Lyrics
It's like a normal Times Square day on 42nd Street
I feel like trashing some windows and crunching some feet
I watch society crumble and I just laugh (hee hee)
They soon will see what it's like to be the other half
But I'm trying, said I'm trying to forget
And it ain't happened yet, no it ain't happened yet

I musta woke up this morning with a bug up my ass
I think I'll just haul off and belt the next jerk that I pass
My old man says I'm just a stoned little punk
But he keeps himself a pistol and he's always drunk
But I'm trying, said I'm trying to forget
Said I'm trying to forget and it ain't happened yet

I know something's gonna give pretty soon
I know that something's gonna give, gonna give, gonna give, gonna give
I wanna live
I wanna mess this whole world around
I wanna live
I wanna mess this whole world, mess this whole world around
Go on and poison all the water, use up all the air
Blow your stupid heads off, see if I could care
Put me down but don't blame me for what you did
'Cause inside everyone is a heavy metal kid

I was a sweet little kid once now I'm a full grown crank
And when I die I'll probably come back as a Sherman tank
I know that I could make this world so peaceful and calm
If I could only get my hands on a hydrogen bomb
But I'm trying, said I'm trying to forget
Said I'm trying to forget and it ain't happened yet

I know something's gonna give pretty soon
I know that something's gonna give, gonna give, gonna give, gonna give
I wanna live
I wanna mess this whole world around
I wanna live
I wanna mess this whole world, mess this whole world around

Go on and poison all the water, use up all the air
Blow your stupid heads off, see if I could care
Put me down but don't blame me for what you did
'Cause inside everyone is a heavy metal kid
