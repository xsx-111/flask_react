The Last Ride Lyrics
It's the last ride
Our little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take you home
And we can't cry
'Cause we've seen it coming
No use running, take it slower

It's a dangerous drive
I'm afraid to arrive
But I strive to survive
More a fool than alive
I thought I knew just everything
I had it made and I could coast
But I turned away love when I needed it most

It's the last ride
My little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take me home
And I can't cry
'Cause I've seen it coming
No use running, take it slower

And the road rolls around
And turns through the town
The depression drips down
And glazes the ground
Horizons east and skylines west
(The burnt out wreck of a poor man's life)
The moon, the sun, and all the rest
(The loving son, the faithful wife)
The father, son, and holy ghost
They all turned away love when they needed it most

It's the last ride
Their little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take them home
And they can't cry
'Cause they've seen it coming

It's time to take you home
