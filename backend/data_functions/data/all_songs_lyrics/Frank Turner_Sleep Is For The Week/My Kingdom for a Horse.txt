My Kingdom for a Horse LyricsWould you pick your clothes up, put your clothes on
Pack your things and go?
I’m tired of sinking this low
Awkward semi-naked coffee conversations fade
Quicker than mistakes that were made
Mornings when I’m coming down, being driven round the bend
Make for days when I’m losing my friends
For all the little things that I have done and cannot make amends
Don’t you ever kind of wish that the world would just stop?
That the band would pack up and the curtain would drop?
I’ve been stuck inside the same old nights, the same old days off
And I need you now because I can’t get out of this
Clean your mirrors, roll your notes out
Put your cards away
That’s a game that I don’t want to play anymore
My head is sore, my throat is raw, and what’s more
I’m fifty pounds down to feel empty and poor
Remembering the things that I believed when I was sober and sure
And I’m trying to speak straight
But I’m drunk and I’m lonely and you won’t believe me
And I’m trying to see straight
But I’ve been up for days and it scares you away
And I’m trying to keep straight
But I’d trade it all for just five minutes more
Of your wandering hands with their simple demands that are
All the things I ever wanted, better than the powder and pills
All the things I ever needed, the only thing that doesn’t seem to kill
That still makes me smile
So if I tell you all the little things that I think that I need
Will you tell me how to tell the world from the woods from the trees?
Because I’ve been stuck inside my comforting familiar disease
And I need you now because I can’t get out
And all over Europe the lights are going out
And I’m pulling down the curtain, but every time I reach out
You’re goneEmbed
