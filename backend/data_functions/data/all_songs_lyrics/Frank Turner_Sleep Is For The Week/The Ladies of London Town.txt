The Ladies of London Town Lyrics
There’s so many beautiful girls in here tonight
I can hardly stand it
Where do they go during the day?
Who the hell do they go home with at the end of the night?
I don’t understand it
They never go home with me

You dance as if you’re hours away from death
You’re wearing too much make-up and showing too much flesh
And you smile a smile to take away my breath
Cause tonight, and only tonight, you know you’re the best

The ladies of London town
Go flowing through these streets like water
Running little streams down to the river
They wash the dirty ground, they sweep me off my feet
But like an English summer, they’ll soon be gone forever

I’ve seen you trawling Camden at 4 A.M
Outside of the clubnight
Deciding whose house will hold a free-for-all
I’ve followed you back to mansions and I’ve met all your friends
Under the streetlights
But I can never recall what you’re called


You dance, you sweat
Your glance is met
And you hold my gaze a bit
And pretend you never did
And I’m left standing on my own

Tonight, only tonight, you know you're the best
Tonight, only tonight

The ladies of London town throw one last glance over their shoulders
Blow a kiss, and then they’re gone foreverEmbed
