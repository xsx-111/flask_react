Must Try Harder LyricsMother loves me still despite
My failing health and lack of drive
Shame on me, I could be so much better than I am
Songs unfinished, post unopened
Clothes unwashed and vows now broken
Shame on me, I could be so much better than I am
If I could just relax, then I could admit
That I don’t know what I want, but this is not it
If I could just recall the dreams I had as a kid
If I could just relax, if I could let my guard slip
I’d be such a winner2Embed
