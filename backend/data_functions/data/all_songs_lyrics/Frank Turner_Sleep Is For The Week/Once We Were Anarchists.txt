Once We Were Anarchists Lyrics
The demonstrations got boring
Well it was obvious that the government was ignoring us
It’s hard to drag yourself through empty streets
On an empty stomach and no sleep
The shortcomings got clearer
As the price we paid got dearer and dearer
It’s supposed to be a case of give-and-take
Well I was feeling the give and making a mistake
And I’ve heard it said that the unexamined life
Isn’t much worth living, and I’m sure they’re right
But it’s hard to keep on fighting the good fight
When no one else seems bothered, yeah
When no one’s on your side

I’m young enough to be all pissed off
But I’m old enough to be jaded
I’m of the age where I want things to change
But with age my hopes have faded
I’m young and bored of being young and bored
If I was old I could say I’d seen it all before
In short, I’m tired of giving a shit
I’ve got friends who are bankers
And it’s an easy rhyme to call them wankers
But I must say I envy the way that they live
In a style that’s all take and no give
While I’m playing the Lone Ranger
Riding to the rescue of six billion strangers
Armed with only unoriginal songs
And a sense that something’s wrong

And I must admit that I’m tired of saying "No" all the time
But I must admit that I don’t really know what would be right
And if politics is helping all the people then my political career is pretty fucked
Because the truth is I don’t like people all that much
The times they aren’t a-changing
Yeah, England’s still shit and it’s still raining
And everybody’s jaded and tired and bored
And no one lifts a finger because
It’s just not in our culture
Our culture is carrion and we’re all vultures
And no one seems bothered by this state of play
It seems that the stench is with us to stay
So I had a go, I tried examining life
It wasn’t much worth living, I guess they’re right
And I’m tired of fighting a fight that’s not my fight
But so is everybody else, we’re all on the same side

I’m young enough to be all pissed off
But I’m old enough to be jaded
I’m of the age where I want things to change
But with age my hopes have faded
I’m young and bored of being young and bored
If I was old I could say I’d seen it all before
In short, I’m tired, and in short I’m probably fired
If the revolution doesn’t want me I don’t give a shit4Embed
