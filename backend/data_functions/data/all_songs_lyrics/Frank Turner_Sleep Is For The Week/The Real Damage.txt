The Real Damage LyricsI woke up on a sofa in an unfamiliar house
Surrounded by sleeping folks that I didn’t know
On failing to find my friends, I decided that it was clearly time to go
So I made my way out of the door as quietly as I could
There was no one there I knew to say goodbye
Squinting in the sadly sobering sunshine of the Sunday morning light
I started the night with all my friends and I ended up alone
Oh yes I started out so happy now I’m hungover and down
It was about then that I realized I was halfway through
The best years of my life
So I scanned the local landmarks, trying to find out where I was
And maybe even find a bus back home
I was longing for a shower, and for clean sheets, and a charger for my phone
And suddenly it hit me that I got paid this Friday last
And so I rifled through my pockets for some change
But all I found was a packet of broken cigarettes and sinking sense of shame
I had to ask myself, well
Is it really worth it?
Is any of this worth it?
Well the whole thing’s far from perfect
But I’ve yet to figure out a better way to spend my time
Too many suits and dirty looks made me rack my brains
And the real damage started to sink in
It’d been quite a heavy weekend, but I could just about remember where I’d been
I stood on a street corner, and I felt a little sick
It was about then that I realized I was halfway through
The first day of the week2Embed
