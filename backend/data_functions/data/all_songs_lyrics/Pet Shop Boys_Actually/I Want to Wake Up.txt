I Want to Wake Up Lyrics
I heard what you said and I can tell you it's true
I heard you've said that I am crazy about you
Turn in my sleep, the bad dream is over
Think of you and shall I ever recover?

Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up

I stood at the kitchen sink, my radio played
Songs like "Tainted Love" and "Love Is Strange"
As I listened and the words hit my ears
I cried sudden tears

Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up

Wake up

It's mad
To be in love with someone else
When you're in love with he
She's in love with me
But you know as well as I do
I can never think of anyone but you
All my life
All my life
I want to wake up

Play with fire, play with guns
It's easy to impress someone
Turning in my sleep you call me a fool
To fall in love is it so uncool?

Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
Now I want to wake up
Wake up


I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up
I, I want to wake up with you
I, I want to wake up with you, oh, oh
I want to wake up, wake up, wake up
I, I want to wake up, wake up, wake up with you
I want to wake up, oh, oh
OhEmbed
