Shopping Lyrics
We're buying and selling your history
How we go about it is no mystery
We check it with the city then change the law

Are you looking forward?
Now you want some more

We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping

It's easy when you've got all the information
Inside help, no investigation, investigation, investigation
No questions in the house, no give and take

There's a big bang in the city
We're all on the make

We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
Our gain is your loss
That's the price you pay
I heard it in the House of Commons
Everything's for sale
We're shopping
We're shopping


We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping

We're shopping
We're shopping
We're shopping
We're shoppingEmbed
