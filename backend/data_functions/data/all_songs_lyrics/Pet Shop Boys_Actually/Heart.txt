Heart Lyrics
Beat
H-heartbeat

Every time I see you
Something happens to me
Like a chain reaction
Between you and me

My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time

If I didn't love you
I would look around for someone else
But every time I see you
You have the same effect

My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Every time
I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you

Beat

Every time I see you
No matter what we do
There's a strange reaction
Can you feel it too?
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time

I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you

Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
