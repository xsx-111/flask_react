Do You Need My Love Lyrics
Tired of feeling so had
The world that I knew just fell through
And left me outside
And we may be blind more than the others
How it feels so good to feel how I wanna feel
Ever since I saw those lion eyes
Those tired feelings hide behind your cigarette nights
Your love
Breaking apart inside

Do you need me the way I need you?
Let's be true for a change
Do you need someone?
Do you need my love?
Need my love

Tired of feeling so bad
Giving away everything
Gonna learn to take the pain
I know that your love stings
Passion is the only thing
Passion must mean everything
I felt your body scream to be set free
From the pain of what's gone
I'll move you along
Do you need me the way I need you?
Let's be true for a change
Do you need someone?
Do you need my love?
Need my love

Everyone who knows me
Knows I'm crazy for loving you, baby
Do you need me like I need you?
Tell me what I could do
Do you need me, need me

Do you need me the way I need you?7Embed
