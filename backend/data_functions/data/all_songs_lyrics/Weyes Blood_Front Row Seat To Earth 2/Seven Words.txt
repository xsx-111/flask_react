Seven Words LyricsThese seven words I say to you, one by one
I love you and you have to know
If I could change how I'm insane
If I could learn to leave my troubles behind
It's starting to hurt and I know you moved on
Telling everyone how I done you so wrong
Cat scratch a beast
My words that made you bleed
Now I face tomorrow
Now I face tomorrow
In time, we'll both be free from this ball and chain
Hanging on to things
I want you mostly in the morning
When my soul is weak from dreaming
When the dust has cleared
And you forget that I'm here
Hanging on
I've been hanging
Who had the last word
I'm telling you first
Who had the last word
I'm telling you first
These seven words are no longer mine
Who am I but a stranger who took you down
It's starting to burn and I wanna go home
Only home I've known
Lost in the storm
It had to be seven words to set us free
Now I face tomorrow
Now I face tomorrow
Now I face tomorrow7Embed
