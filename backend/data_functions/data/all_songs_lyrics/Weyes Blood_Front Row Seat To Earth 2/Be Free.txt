Be Free Lyrics
It's sad to dream
It constantly seems
Like there's no light at the end of my tunnel
False dreams and promises
How do I get through to you?
Tried to do the best I could
Loved you just like a girl should
Somewhere I got stuck on you

It's just the two of us
And I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
I got my thing

Stay close to the edge and try to admit it
That you gave it away when you started to care and I cared
A long, long time of mine I waited for you to come around
I found a one-way street, that's me
Still hanging on to set you free, make you believe
I'm yours

It's just the two of us
And I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
I got my thing
I will never fear when you're not with meEmbed
