Last Boat Leaving Lyrics
Hush my little one don't cry so
You know your daddy's bound to go
They took his pride, they took his voice
Don't upset him now, don't make a noise
They said "You're lucky son, you've still got a choice"
Last boat leaving

Don't waste your tears, It's not as if I'm in chains
I don't want to go now
It would be better for you, too
If you don't look back when we sail
(Last boat leaving, last boat leaving)

Hush my dear, while I whisper it in your ear
We're not going to sail tonight, we're going to disappear
And it feels like a punishment but I don't know what for
Take care of your mother, son, it's you that she adores
'Cause no matter how long we sail we'll never reach the shore
Last boat leaving

Don't waste your tears, it's not as if I'm in chains
When you go to school, son
You'll read my story in history books
Only they won't mention my name
(Last boat leaving, last boat leaving)
So hush now, my darling, my sweet little one
I hope that you never have to do what I've done
Do you know what I've done?
Why I'm going away?
On the last boat leaving this stinking town

Last boat leaving, it's the last boat leaving

You've had my innocence, you've had my heartbreak
You've taken the place where I once belonged
Now what more can you take?1Embed
