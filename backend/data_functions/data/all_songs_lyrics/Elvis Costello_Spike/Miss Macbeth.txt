Miss Macbeth Lyrics
All the children testified that Miss Macbeth had a fish bone slide
In her cobweb tresses
Her eyes were black as first foot coal
Clutched as white as chalk-dust
Her fingers sweated India-ink and poison-pen letters
There is a hungry hanging tree just below your bedroom window
You can hear her take a broom to beat out a tattoo on the ceiling
Her bloodless face ran red inside but was she really evil?
Was she only pantomime?

Now the chalk on the wall says that somebody saves
That somebody's face has just been washed off the pavement
Into a puzzle where petrol will be poisoned by rain
Miss Macbeth saw her reflection
As confetti bled it's colors down the drain

And everyday she lives out another love song
It's a tearful lament of somebody done wrong
Well how can you miss what you've never possessed
Miss Macbeth

Well we all should have known when the children paraded
They portrayed her in their fairytales sprinkling deadly nightshade
And as they tormented her, she rose to the bait
Even a scapegoat must have someone to hate
And everyday she lives out another love song
"You're up there enjoying yourself, and I know it's wrong"
Well how can you miss what you've never possessed
Miss Macbeth, Miss Macbeth

Sometimes people are just what they appear to be
With no redemption at all
We try to walk upright when we can't even crawl

Miss Macbeth has a golliwog she chucks under the chin
And she whispers to it tenderly then sticks it on a pin
And It might be coincidence, but a boy down the lane
That she said "went white as he could do"
Then doubled over in pain

And everyday she lives out another love song
It's a tearful lament of somebody done wrong
Well how can you miss what you've never possessed
Miss Macbeth, Miss Macbeth
Miss Macbeth, Miss Macbeth1Embed
