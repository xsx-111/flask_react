Satellite Lyrics
She looked like she learned to dance
From a series of still pictures
She's madly excited now
She throws her hands up like a tulip
She looks like an illustration of a cocktail party
Where cartoon bubbles burst in the air
Champagne rolls off her tongue like a second language
And it should have been her biggest night
The satellite looks down on her as she begins to cry
All over the world at the very same time
People sharing the same sorrow
As the satellite looks down
Her darkest hour is somebody's bright tomorrow

He pulled on a cigarette in the crook of his first finger
Felt the static electric charge of her perfect hour-glass figure
As he undressed her with his eyes
Her weakness was his talent
How could she know as she stepped through the lights
That her dress would become transparent
And with his face pressed to the screen
He muttered words he'd never dare to say
If she could see him
All over the world at the very same time
People sharing the same cheap sensation
The thrill of watching somebody
Watching those forbidden things we never mention
The satellite looks down right now and forever
What it has pulled apart let no man tether
His own body to his dream
His dream to someone else
Oh no, oh no

She went back to a pitiful compromise
He'd go back to his family
But for the matter of a thousand miles that
Separated them entirely
In the hot unloving spotlight with secrets it arouses
Now they both know what it's like inside a pornographer's trousers
And in a funny way it's anonymous
The satellite it blesses us and makes these dreams come true
All over the world at the very same time
All over the world

The satellite looks down right now and forever
What it has pulled apart let no man tether
His own body to his dream
His dream to someone else
Oh no, oh no1Embed
