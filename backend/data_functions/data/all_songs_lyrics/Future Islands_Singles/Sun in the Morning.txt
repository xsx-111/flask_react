Sun in the Morning LyricsMine all mine
Wander, away we go
Over lines
I won't let go
She knows why
She feeds my soul
She feeds my mind

Sun in the morning
My sun, every morning
My star of the evening
My moon, always beaming
She loves to watch me go
She hates to watch me go
I hate to watch her go
I love to watch her go
That's cause I always know, she's always coming home
That's cause she always knows, I'm always coming home

Sun in the morning
My sun every morning
My star of the evening
My moon always beaming
Sun in the morning
My sun every morning
She feeds me daily soul, she feeds me daily soul
She feeds me daily soul, she talks right to my soul

Sun in the morning
My sun every morning
My star of the evening
My moon always beaming
She feeds me daily soul, she feeds me daily soul
She feeds me daily soul, she talks right to my soul

Sun in the morning
My sun every morning
My star of the evening
My moon always beaming
She feeds me daily soul, she feeds me daily soul
She feeds me daily soul, she talks right to my soul1Embed
