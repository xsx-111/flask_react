Spirit LyricsTrusted, repeated
Candor, uneven - in it's will to find
The right design
The form belongs, to no one
Holding truth
Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you

Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth for dreams come to those
Who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Be more than words
Be more than strength and kind
Be love and blind
To those who come to you
Sing something new
Belief is wet and ghost
Yet, loves the most of what we do

Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Those winter days
Those winter nights
Those days and those nights
Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you

Don't cast away, Don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Challenge you, challenge you
Challenge you3Embed
