Fall from Grace LyricsYou were mine when I was young
Why does it take so long?
When you were here, it was warm
Now it's just a bitter storm
Now I'm older, turning white
Watching days turn into nights
Now I'm older and I'm grave
Tell me, what's been left to save?
Pardon my reflection
In the mirror, at your feet
Before you go, please tell me
"Was it all inside of me?"
I'll leave here in the morning
I'll leave here in the morning
I'll leave here in the morning
You were mine when I was young
Why does it take so long?
Now I'm older and I'm grave
Tell me, "what's been left to save?"
I held you in the morning
In the doorway of the sea
"Pardon my reflection
It was all inside of me."
We slowly fall from grace
We slowly fall from grace
We slowly fall from grace
We slowly fade away
We slowly fade away
We slowly fade away
We slowly fade away
We slowly fade away1Embed
