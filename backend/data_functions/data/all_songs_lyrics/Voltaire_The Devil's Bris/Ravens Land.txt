Ravens Land LyricsRavens land upon her hair
Clouds adrift on her skin
A smile that tugs upon my soul
And whispers gently in my ear
Eyes of honey look me down
Lips like roses line her mouth
Steely arrows in the air
Are wilted flowers at her toes
And if you ask me how I know
What she looks like I will tell you
She left yesterday
Eyes are east and lips are west
Pulls my head against her breast
Logic, north and Lust is south
Pulls my fingers to her mouth
Legs as firm as canyon walls
From leaping high above the moon
When she drifts down on the air
The ground can't wait to kiss her toes
And if you ask me how I know
What she looks like I will tell you
She left yesterday
Ravens land upon her hair
Clouds adrift on her skin
A smile that tugs upon my soul
And whispers gently in my ear
And if you ask me how I know
What she looks like I will tell you
She left yesterday
She left yesterday
She left yesterday
She left yesterdayEmbed
