The Chosen LyricsLast night a moth came to my bed
Filled my tired and weary head
With horrid tales of you
I can't believe it's true
But then the lampshade smiled at me
It said "Believe" It said "Believe"
I want you to know it's nothing personal
First time I had sex I was 3
First time consenting was 13
Though you weren't there you remind me of those hands
Roses are red, Violets are blue
If I'm schizophrenic then i am too
Whatever it takes to escape
I hope you understand
Why I'm forced to take your life in my hands
I want you to know it's nothing personal
Though we never met I've seen your image in a million waking dreams
Your eyes they call to me "Set me free!"
Did I ever tell you? You look like my mother
She once left me in the supermarket
I promised myself that I'll never feel that way again
Did I ever tell you? You look like my dear old mother
I hope you understand
Why I'm forced to take my life in your name
I want you to know it's nothing all the same
Though we never met I've seen your image in a million waking dreams
Your eyes they call to me "Set me free!"
Last night a moth came to my bed
Filled my tired and weary head
With horrid tales of you
I can't believe it's true
But then the lampshade smiled at me
It said "Believe" It said "Believe"
I want you to know it's nothing personal
I hope you understand
Why I'm forced to take your life in my hands
I want you to know it's nothing personal
Though we never met I've seen your image in a million waking dreams
Your eyes they call to me "Set me free!"
I hope you understand
Why I'm forced to take my life in your name
I want you to know it's nothing all the same
Though we never met I've seen your image in a million waking dreams
Your eyes they call to me "Set me free!"
It's not easy being the chosen
It's not easy being the chosen
It's not easy being the chosen
It's not easy being the chosenEmbed
