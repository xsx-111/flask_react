C.R.E.B. LyricsYeah, God don't know
Believe me, I believe that's true
Everyday I replace yesterday with my brain
Every season passed twice
Blame it on the C.R.E.B
I never meant to forget you
I always forget people I really like
If I haven't seen 'em for a long time
And I haven't seen you for a long time
Round, round and round it goes
Till the full C.R.E.B. knocked out lets you know
Now I'm, one of them
How much of what I am depends upon the C.R.E.B
I never thought I'd forget you

Yeah, every season pass three times
I never wanna forget you
So if your name is (ricky ticky ticky ticky)
And if you go by (ricky ticky ticky ticky)
Tell me you are (ricky ticky ticky ticky)
Your hippocampus isn't unkind
Your hippocampus isn't alright
Your hippocampus on time
Your hippocampus has it's own mind
Your hippocampus never unwinds
Your hippocampus does it alrightEmbed
