On The Way LyricsOn the way to Mars
We can reminisce a lot
Let's talk about the darkness and the stars
Talk about the people we might miss on earth
Untethered Moon
Now is all that matters
There's nothing in the past
But that's alright
We can see the stars in all directions
Now we see a tangled blur of white
Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot
Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot
Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot
Maltesian riot, Maltesian riot, riot, riot, riot
Now I guess I'll finally see
The kind of calmness chaos brings
I got so tired of going ’round and ’round
Waiting for gravity to bring me downEmbed
