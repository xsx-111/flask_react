Some Other Song Lyrics
I can't wait to get back home to you
Talk about the things that we've been through
There is nothing I would rather do
But something's gotta happen pretty soon

Then it's some other song

I don't know exactly what to do
You are all I ever I thought I knew
I could live without this feeling blue
I could live without, how 'bout you?

Then it's some other song
Yeah it's some other song

I don't know how to never fall apart
Please tell me how to never fall apart
No matter how you ever fall

Then it's some other song
Yeah it's some other song
I don't know how to never fall apart
Still wondering how to never fall apart
No matter how you ever fall

And it's some other song
Yeah it's some other songEmbed
