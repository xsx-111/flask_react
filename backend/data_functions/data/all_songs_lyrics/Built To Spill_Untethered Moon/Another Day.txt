Another Day LyricsI can't explain anything to anyone
Don't believe that nothing isn't true
And you know you're not the one who gets to decide
What is right and what is right for you
And I wake up every day just the same
Somewhere between stars and sand
And I was made from material that could never last
An obsolescence that no one would have planned
And I know there's something deep inside
No one's gotta see it to make it real
And I don't expect anyone to read my mind
But when you don't I'm disappointed every time
And if somehow you make it through you're gonna find
I just want you to know how I feel
And our choices fade into the emptiness
Right before we start to fade ourselves
And now it seems like the only thing on my mind
Is getting all these things off my chest before I die
And going back to where the earth is soft to try to find
Somewhere we can bury all our mistakes1Embed
