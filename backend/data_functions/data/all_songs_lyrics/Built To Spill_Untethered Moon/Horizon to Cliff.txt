Horizon to Cliff LyricsOut on the rise
High above the things that really matter
There's no surprise
Nothing's what it seems out on the rise
You can fight through all the reason
And wait another season
Forget about what you wanted
Forget your heart is haunted
Out on the rise
Out beyond the gravity of meaning
There's no surprise
So why would you drift
Horizon to cliff till you die
You can fight through all the reason
And wait another season
Forget about what you wanted
Well I guess I did my best to lock myself out
I even never hid a key
Now it's summer time and now it's winter time
Now it's summer time again
Out on the riseEmbed
