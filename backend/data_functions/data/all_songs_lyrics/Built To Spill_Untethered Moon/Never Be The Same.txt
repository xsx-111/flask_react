Never Be The Same Lyrics
Go everywhere you wanna go
See everything you wanna see
And everyone you wanna know
If that's what you want
You got it, you got it
If that's what you want
We will never be the same
We will never be the same
Seen it all you've seen it all
Seen it all there's nothing else
You know it all, you know it all
So you keep it to yourself
If That's what you think
You thought it, you thought it
If That's what you think
We will never be the same
We will never be the same
I know you got something
Everybody wants to know
I know you know something
Everybody's gotta know
I know you want something
Everybody's gotta go
I know you need something
But that's the way it's gonna be
Because that's the way it's always been
And another century is going to be this way again
We will never be the same
We will never be the same
We will never be the same
We will never be the same1Embed
