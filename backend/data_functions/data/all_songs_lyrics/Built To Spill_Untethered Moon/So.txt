So LyricsWhere where did you go
Why did you leave
What did you know
How how does it feel
When you're the one
Who is alone
Someone somewhere somehow said so
Up up every night
Down in my room
Out of my mind
Lost lost in the light
Looking for you I found
Nothing, nowhere, no one
If nobody came to the door
Then why would you open the door
If nobody came to the door
Then why would you open the door
If you threw a party and everyone smiled
Would you open the door
And if you got in your car but the windows were stars
Would you open the door
Where where did you go
Why did you leave
What did you know
How how does it feel
When you're alone1Embed
