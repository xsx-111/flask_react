All Our Songs Lyrics
You can see right into my mind
If I could keep it together
Someone's gotta look through you to find
Your soul out there somewhere
All our songs
Back before I even remember
And I recall those old songs
Sound like they've been here forever
Ohh man it's over
Man it's over
Or so they say
It's over
When we know there's no other way
And it's so hard to tell
The face that never rang a bell
It's like a lightbulb went out in my head
And now we settle for this complicated metaphor
As we rescind the truth once said
All night listen to the second record
Yeah,  and all these songs sounded like we're in this together
And I found a place where I'll always be tethered
And I knew when I woke up
Rock N' Roll will be here forever
Form a cloud, make all of your particles
Separate and get together, rain on down
Show everybody what it means to get wet
Let's take down all the umbrellas of all of our enemies
And I'll be found in Idaho, America, in the the 21st century
I'm alright
I'm sure I'll be alright
But I don't know, no I don't know
I'm sure I'll be alright
But I don't know
I'm sure you can smell the sky and
Did you know that it is in your faceEmbed
