Living Zoo LyricsWe know where we wanna go
But we can't tell
Alone how to navigate
Our way through hell
Sometimes when you wake up
(Sometimes wake up lonely)
Feel alone
Somehow we get over it
(Somehow keep it going)
And we go on
Ahhh
That's alright
Ahhh
Doin' fine
They say there's a part of us
We can't explain
Please say you'll do anything
To make me stay
Ahhh
That's alright
Ahhh
Doin' fine
Being a human
Being an animal too
Being in a cage and
Being a living zoo
Being a person
Being an animal too
Being all alone and
Being all me and you
Cause we're lions
In our cages
And tigers
In tiny spacesEmbed
