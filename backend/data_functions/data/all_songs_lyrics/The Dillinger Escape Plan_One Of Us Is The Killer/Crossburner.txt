Crossburner LyricsI just could not believe
That so much could be achieved
Are you for real?
Were you for real?
I caught you by the throat
And tried to squeeze
But you weren't real
You were not real
Turn your boat you stow away
It’s better there here’s not okay
I’m sorry it’s so far away
You break your back for little things
Like compliments and wedding rings
I hate that little song you sing
That song you sing

Turn your boat you stow away
It’s better there here’s not okay
I’m sorry you’re far away
Turn your boat around you stow away
Seems you can’t stop making sound
But nothing I can’t read about
Your 2 cents fall right on the ground
Right on the ground
Turn your boat you stow away
It’s better there here’s not okay
I’m sorry it’s so far away
Turn your boat around you stow away
I just could not believe
So much could be achieved
Are you for real?
Were you for real?
Cause you don’t listen
You never listen
You don’t listen
You don’t listen
I've caught you by the throat and tried to squeeze
But you weren't real
You were not real
Why’d I never listen

Turn your boat you stow away
It’s better there here’s not okay
I’m sorry we’re so far away
I’m sorry we’re so far away
I’m sorry we’re so far awayEmbed
