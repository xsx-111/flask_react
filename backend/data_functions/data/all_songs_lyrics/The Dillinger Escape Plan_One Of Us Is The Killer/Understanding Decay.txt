Understanding Decay LyricsDrag the knife across the skin
Tempted to succumb
Carving fervor into flesh
Holy we’ve become
Turning lips to everyone
Giving heart to none
Running backwards erasing time
Seek the fire but never die
The cradle wipes blood red fresh
And through you the host has chosen a name
The cradle wipes blood red fresh
And through you the host has chosen a name
Call the name out
Call the name out
Call the name out
Call the name out
I’ll never be like you
Late to my own funeral
I’ll never be like you
Late to my own funeral
We’ll never be so late like you to our funerals
I’ll never be like you
Late to my own funeral
We’ll never be so late like you to our funerals
Push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages into the world
Push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages to other worlds
Push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages into the world
Push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages to other worlds
Push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages into the world
Push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages to other worldsEmbed
