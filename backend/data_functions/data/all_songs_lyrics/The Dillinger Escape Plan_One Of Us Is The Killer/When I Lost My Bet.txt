When I Lost My Bet LyricsTAKE
Take what you can
You're entitled to the prize
Fill you up with
All that you can take
Take what you can
You're the princess and the prince
Fill you up with
All that you can take
I heard that you were the last to leave
The party you just had to see
Where everybody had to be
The best in town
Heard they tried to kick you out
Cause you were foaming at the mouth
Holding ground you had to play
Cause who knows what you'll win today
You've got to figure out how high you'll get by doing nothing
Opportunity presents itself at every turn
Stick around you never know whose ego you can stroke
Which mask to wear a rung to climb to suck up
Stick around you never know whose ego you can stroke
A rung to climb a pill a line a mask to hide your face
I'm breaking out
Don't keep me down
I'm missing out
Don't keep me
Hey I'm freaking out
Don't turn me down
You're getting there
For sure
Real close
All over the bathroom floor
Who's getting it
You sure
We need more
Never mind the night's
Run
Out
Eyes are spinning
Look at me
You're winning
Can't you see
Lights colliding
You're spun out
You're climbing straight to the top
Your fortune still waiting
You keep climbing
Straight to the top
Your fortune still waiting
YEAH on your hands and knees so you can take
All that you can
All that you can
All that you can
All that you can take
It's getting so close that you can taste it
It's getting so close that you can taste it
WHOA!
It's getting so close
You're getting it
For sure
Your clothes all over the bedroom floor
Who's getting it?
Are you sure?
Need more
Never mind just get
