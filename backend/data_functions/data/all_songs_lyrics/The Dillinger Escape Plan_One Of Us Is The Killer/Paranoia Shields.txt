Paranoia Shields LyricsYou will never find anything
Like a forest in search of its trees
You will never gain anything
Take a bullet to kill a wet dream
I will always be anything
Like a shadow inside of a cave
I can never give anything
Break a sweat just to have some relief
You were always revolting me
Like an echo held up to my face
You were always in search of me
Takes a second to find what you seek
I will never give anything
Break a sweat just to have some relief
I will always be everything
Like a shadow inside of a cave

I feel you close, heating up my coals
But there isn't a hell that I would burden with you
Death brings us close, isn't that morose?
But there isn't a fire that I would waste to burn you
We are both just a fantasy
Won’t you please keep imagining me
You've become such a piece of me
Always were work that I couldn't see
I will never give anything
Break a sweat just to have some relief
I will always be everything
Like a shadow inside of a cave

I feel you close, heating up my coals
But there isn't a hell that I would burden with you
Death brings us close, isn't that morose?
But there isn't a fire that I would waste to burn you
I’ll be with you when you die
Always by your side holding onto nights
How’d we let this go so far
Cause I don’t know where we are
Bring it back to life
I’ll be with you when you die
Always by your side holding onto nights
We’ll try to hold the earth still
How’d we ever get this far
Cause I don’t know where we are
Bring it back to my beginning
Your beginning
I could just go to sleep but I wanna scream
I’d wake you up but then you’d see what I mean
I've manifested you in fever daydream

I feel you close, heating up my coals
But there is a hell that I would burden with you
Death brings us close, isn't that morose?
But there is a fire that I would waste to burn youEmbed
