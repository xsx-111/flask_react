Silence Is a Strong Reply LyricsCan't you hear me calling, I'm shouting out loud
Maybe you've mistaken me for one of the crowd
My back's against the wall, my feeling's on show
Silence is the only reply that I know
The sleeping dog in me won't lie
But when I'm woken you can't, no can't deny
When you fall in love from the very start
You give your love and then they break your heart
When dreams are broken silence is a strong reply
Can't you hear me laughing, exposing my fears
Can't you see me crying, withholding the tears
There isn't any point in closing your hears
The silence that's between us is the passing of years
Take a breath where the earth touches the sky
We can both feel the reason why
When you fall in love from the very start
You give your love and then they break your heart
Because silence is a strong reply
Silence is a strong replyEmbed
