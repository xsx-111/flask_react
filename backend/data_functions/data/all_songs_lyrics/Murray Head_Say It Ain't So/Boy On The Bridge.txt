Boy On The Bridge LyricsThere's a boy on the bridge
And he’s looking ahead with confusion in his eyes
There's a man on the ridge
Who is laughing out loud, heavily in disguise
There's a girl on the lake
Reflecting her thoughts
Which she kisses away with sighs
What would you do in this boy’s place
Move on or compromise?
Freedom of choice is a hell of a burden
Maybe living for kicks is wise
There's a town far below
That is calling him home
Where his friends got bored and laid
There's a hill up ahead
With a mountain behind
With a pub that is barren and frayed
What would you do in this boy's place
Move on or compromise?
Freedom of choice is a hell of a burden
Maybe living for kicks is wise
'Cause he wants to be free
But is frighten to be alone
'Cause he wants to be free
But is frighten to be alone
'Cause he wants to be free
But is frighten to be aloneEmbed
