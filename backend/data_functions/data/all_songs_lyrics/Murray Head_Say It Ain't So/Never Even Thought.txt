Never Even Thought LyricsNever even thought it could happen to me
Maybe I've been blind only others can see
I'm in love
What am I to do can I let it show ?
Do I keep it to myself or should I let her know
I'm in love
Do i nurse it in my heart, hold it back in my eyes
Holding on inside up alone in the sky
I'm in love
Never god are playing games
Even suffer the pain
Let the secret out
Even suffer the dark
I'm in love
I know it's all there I really want to share my life with someone else
"Will she feel the same"?
Never even thought it could happen to me
Maybe I've been blind only others can see
I'm in love
What am I to do can I let it show
Do I keep it to myself or should I let her know
I'm in love
Isn't so easy when you've broke on before
And isn't so hard when you're ready for more
Could you love me ?
Give me simple true anything would do
So long is I know what to me is in you
Could you love me ?
I've got so much of care to give away
There's only one thing I want to hear you say
"I love you"
Never god are playing games
Even suffer the pain
Let the secret out
Even suffer the dark
I'm in love
I know it's all there I really want to share my life with someone else
"Will she feel the same"?Embed
