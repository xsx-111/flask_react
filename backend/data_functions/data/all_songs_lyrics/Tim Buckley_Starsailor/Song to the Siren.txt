Song to the Siren LyricsLong afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang:
"Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you"
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing:
"Touch me not
Touch me not
Come back tomorrow
O my heart
O my heart
Shies from the sorrow"
I am puzzled as the oyster
I am troubled as the tide:
Should I stand amid your breakers?
Should I lie with death, my bride?
Hear me sing:
"Swim to me
Swim to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you"10Embed
