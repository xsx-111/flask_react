Down By The Borderline LyricsYeah ohh, yeahh
Mm yeaaah

Way down on the borderline
Down where white folks tread easy
That sun beats so hot, sun beats so hot, sun beats so hot
Sun beats so hot, sun beats so hot, no
When a little girl pass by you can smell the way she walks
You can smell, you can smell the way she walks
In late afternoon, ah
Ah, it's in late
Little girl, little girl, little girl, little girl
Little girl, little girl, little girl, little girl
Little girl, little girl, little girl, little girl
Little girl, little girl, little girl, little girl
Smile so bright
Come on boy, come on boy
Come on boy, come on boy
Come on boy, come on boy
Come
Oh, take a walk with me
Take a walk, a walk walk walk with me
Yeah, alright

Baby, on the borderline
Where white folks tread easy
Oh, That sun beats so hot, sun beats so hot, sun beats so hot
Beats so hot, oh
Every time a little girl little girl little girl little girl
Little girl pass me by
I can smell the way she walks
I can smell all the ways smell all the ways smell all the ways
Smell all the ways she walksEmbed
