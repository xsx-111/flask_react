King Creole Lyrics
There's a man in New Orleans who plays rock and roll
He's a guitar man with a great big soul
He lays down a beat like a ton of coal
He goes by the name of King Creole

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumping like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole

When the king starts to do it, it's as good as done
He holds his guitar like a tommy gun
He starts to growl from way down in his throat
He bends a string and that's all she wrote

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumping like a catfish on a pole, yeah
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole (King Creole)

Well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
He sings a song about a jelly roll
He sings a song about a-pork and greens
He sings some blues about New Orleans
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumping like a catfish on a pole yeah
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole (King Creole, go)

He plays something evil, then he plays something sweet
No matter how he plays, you gotta get up on your feet
When he gets a rocking fever, baby, heaven sakes
He don't stop playing till his guitar breaks

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumping like a catfish on a pole, yeah
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole (King Creole)
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole (Creole, Creole, Creole)Embed
