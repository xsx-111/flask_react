Round and Round Lyrics
If you believe in me
Like I believe in you
You wouldn't be telling me things
That weren't exactly true

Now all of the changes
Ain't nothin' the same
I'm having the strangest feeling lately
I can't remember my name

'Cause the life I've been living
And the love I've been giving
Will be sure to send you spinning
With your feet never touching the ground
Going round n' round

When it was one for all
And it was all for one
And everything that we did
Never bothered no one, okay

Now all of the changes
Ain't nothin' the same
I'm having the strangest feeling lately
I can't remember my name
'Cause the life I've been living
And the love I've been giving
Will be sure to send you spinning
With your feet never touching the ground
Going round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round


Can you remember the days
When you were sweet 16
And always followed the ways
Of someone else's dreams, okay

Now everything changes
Ain't nothin' the same
I'm having the strangest feel, baby
I can't remember my name
I'm going round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round...


I'm going round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round n' round...Embed
