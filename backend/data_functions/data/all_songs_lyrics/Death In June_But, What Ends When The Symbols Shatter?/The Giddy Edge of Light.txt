The Giddy Edge of Light Lyrics (2x)
Through the winter's woods
To the giddy edge of light (2x)

We shut the door on pain
Those tales are dead - dead forever
A wind must agree
To blow us on course
It can be quick to come
But, once it's gone - it's gone forever
 (2x)

We are all in this vein
It is already too late
What do we witness?
What do we negate?
In this world of shadows
And sordid allusion
 (2x)

All this arrogance and ignorance
Will be washed away
Craving for tomorrow
Craving for today
By association
I want, want everything
 (2x)
