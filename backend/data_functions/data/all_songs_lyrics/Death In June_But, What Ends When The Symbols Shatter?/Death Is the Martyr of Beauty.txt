Death Is the Martyr of Beauty LyricsDrunk with the nectar of submission, of submission
I feel nothing more, I feel nothing more
Than existence, than existence
A loneliness that will not come off
In the narcissism of the harbour
We are lost
Vaster than night
My pride, my threat, my thrust
This is beyond very far
This is beyond, oh, this is beyond
This is beyond very far
This is beyond, this is beyond
Is this the final exorcism of an obsession?
In the obsession?
Swept clean of the past and its errors
Shall we take new roads?
We shall take new roads
Look, lost vast night
Tearing and loathing, thrashing without you
To the church of tomorrow
Death Is the Martyr of Beauty
Look, here is our runic wreath
Look here!1Embed
