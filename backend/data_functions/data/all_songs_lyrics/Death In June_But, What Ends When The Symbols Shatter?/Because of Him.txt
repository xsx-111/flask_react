Because of Him Lyrics
Because of him
This world has hope again
Because of him
This world has got a friend

A friend that will eradicate
All life's false humanity
Helping one race, one creed
To meet their need

So that all may see
That it's all so wonderful to care
To love, to cull, to share
To love, to cull, to share
 (16x)
Oh, let us start today
To live and die the same way...Embed
