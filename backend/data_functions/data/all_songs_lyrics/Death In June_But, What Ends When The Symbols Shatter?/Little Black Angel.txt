Little Black Angel Lyrics
Black angel, black angel, as you grow up
I want you to drink from the plenty cup

My little black angel
My little black angel

My little black angel, as years go by
I want you to fly with wings held high
I want you to live by the justice code
I want you to burn down freedom's road

My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel

Oh, lie away, oh, lie away sleeping
Lie away safe in my arms
Your father, your future protects you
Locks you safe from all harm
Little black angel, I feel so glad
You'll never have things I never had
When out of men's hearts all hate has gone
It's better to die than forever live on
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel

Oh, lie away, oh, lie away sleeping
Lie away safe in my arms
Your father, your future protects you
Locks you safe from all harm
Little black angel, I feel so glad
You'll never have things I never had
When out of men's hearts all hate has gone
It's better to die than forever live on

My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel

My little black angel, as years go by
I want you to fly with wings held high
I want you to live by the justice code
I want you to burn down freedom's road
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel
My little black angel1Embed
