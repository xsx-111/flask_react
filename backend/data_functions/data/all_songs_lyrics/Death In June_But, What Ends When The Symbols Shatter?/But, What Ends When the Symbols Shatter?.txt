But, What Ends When the Symbols Shatter? LyricsWhen life is but disappointment
And nothing is amusing
The one wild hunt
For loneliness
Is a life without god
Is an end without love
Soulless today
And soulless tomorrow
We struggle for the joy
Oh, we struggle for the joy
That life is haunted by
That life is haunted by
Its memories - its meaninglessness
Yearn to be gathered, cracked and saved
A thought, for a lifetime
A thought, for a night time
But what ends when the symbols shatter?
And who knows what happens to hearts?
But what ends when the symbols shatter?
And who knows what happens to hearts?
But what ends when the symbols shatter?
And who knows what happens to hearts?
But what ends when the symbols shatter?
And who knows what happens to hearts?
