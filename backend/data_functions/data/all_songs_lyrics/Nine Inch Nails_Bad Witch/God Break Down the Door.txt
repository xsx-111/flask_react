God Break Down the Door Lyrics
God break down the door
God break down the door
You won't find the answers here
Not the ones you came looking for

God break down the door
Everything all at once
There aren't any answers here
No, no, not anymore

God break down the door
God break down the door
You won't find the answers here
Not the ones you came looking for

God break down the door
Everything all at once
There aren't any answers here
No, no, no, no

Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in
Remove the pain and push it back in (pull it out, push it back)
Remove the pain and push it back in (pull it out, push it back)
Remove the pain and push it back in (pull it out, push it back)
Remove the pain and push it back in (pull it out, push it back)
Remove the pain and push it back in
We are a treacherous people
As night falls down again
In this house of dust
The shades are drawn in
All of the thousands of rooms
We sleep hypnotized from the center
Yes in this new place we call home
Is there anybody but you sitting in the dark
Wondering if you'll remove my skin
Not so different after all
Remove the pain or push it back in
Maybe not so different after all
That kind of thing just doesn’t happen here
I didn’t think that could happen around here
I didn’t think that could happen to me
Can you see what is happening
Pull it out, and push it back see
I’m not from this world not anymore
Not me and I’ve come to believe that’s OK
I know who I am yes
I believe I am sleeping after all5Embed
