Over and Out LyricsTime is running out
I don't know what I'm waiting for
Time is running out
I don't know what I'm waiting for
Time is running out
I don't know what I'm waiting for
I think this keeps happening
Over and over again
Feel like I've been here before
Over and over again
Am I remembering you correctly
Over and over again
I've always been 10 years ahead of you
Over and over again
I think this keeps happening
Time is running out
Over and over again
I don't know what I'm waiting for
Feel like I've been here before
Over and over again
Am I remembering you correctly
Time is running out
Over and over again
I don't know what I'm waiting for
I've always been 10 years ahead of you
Over and over again
I think this keeps happening
Time is running out
Over and over again
I don't know what I'm waiting for2Embed
