Shit Mirror Lyrics
Got a new face and it feels all right
Power and strength and appetite
I eat your loathing hate and fear
Should probably stay away from here

Hey look what’s staring back at you
Caught reflecting in your eyes
I’m becoming something new
It’s getting hard to recognize

New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right

I tried a bit then I tried some more
I left her on the bathroom floor
I think I knew when it crossed the line
I think I knew the whole goddamned time

Hey look what’s staring back at you
Caught reflecting in your eyes
I’m becoming something new (else)
It’s getting hard to recognize
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
Feels all right3Embed
