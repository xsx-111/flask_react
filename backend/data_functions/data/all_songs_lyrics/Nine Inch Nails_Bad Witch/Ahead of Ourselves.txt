Ahead of Ourselves Lyrics
Everything all figured out
Like it was meant to be
We’re on the precipice (I can feel it)
We’re on the precipice
Created us in his image
Better be proud of his work
That is if he existed (not so sure anymore)
That is if he existed

And we just can’t help ourselves
And we just can’t help ourselves
And we just can’t help ourselves
And we just can’t help ourselves (I don’t think that’s me)

Obsolete, insignificant
Antiquated, irrelevant
Celebration of ignorance
Why try change when you know you can’t?

Did you ever get that feeling?
Man, I can’t seem to shake it
Not quite as clever as we think we are
Knuckle dragging animal
When we could have done anything
We wound up building this
We deserve
With illusions of enlightenment
With our snouts in the dirt
With our snouts in the dirt
Obsolete, insignificant
Antiquated, irrelevant
Celebration of ignorance
Why try change when you know you can’t?

We got ahead of ourselves
We got ahead of ourselves
We got ahead of ourselves
We got ahead of ourselves2Embed
