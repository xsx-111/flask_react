Piper at the Gates of Dawn Lyrics
The coolness of the riverbank
And the whispering of the reeds
Daybreak is not so very far away
Enchanted and spellbound
In the silence they lingered
And rowed the boat
As the light grew steadily strong
And the birds were silent
As they listened for the heavenly music
And the river played the song

The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn

The song dream happened
And the cloven-hoofed piper
Played in that holy ground
Where they felt the awe and wonder
And they all were unafraid
Of the great god Pan
And the wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn

When the vision vanished
They heard a choir of birds singing
In the heavenly silence
Between the trance and the reeds
And they stood upon the lawn
And listened to the silence

Of the wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
Wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
It's the wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
Wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawnEmbed
