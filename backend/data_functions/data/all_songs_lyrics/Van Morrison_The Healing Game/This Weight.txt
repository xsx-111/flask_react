This Weight Lyrics
This weight is weighing on my heart
This weight is tearing us apart
This weight is weighing on my soul
Just won't leave me alone

You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

In the neighbourhood (In the neighbourhood)
People watching me (People watching me)
Got to move to protect my sanity
Anonymity is all I want you see
You may think it's mediocrity, but

You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

And the Hollywood ain't no good
I would rather be like Robin Hood
If I could only lose this...
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

And this Hollywood (This Hollywood)
Oh it ain't no good (No good)
I would rather be just like Robin Hood
If I could only lose this...

You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight

In the very first it was rock and roll (This weight)
Set me free in body and soul
But this weight is just bringing me down
It's never satisfied every time I go to town

You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weight
You know I'm talking about this weightEmbed
