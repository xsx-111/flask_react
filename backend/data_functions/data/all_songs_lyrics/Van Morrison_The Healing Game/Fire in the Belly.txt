Fire in the Belly Lyrics
Call of the wildest
It's got the best of you
Fire in my heart
Fire in my belly too

Got a heart and a mind
And a fire inside
And I'm crazy about you

You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with your hidden surprise
You

Stoke up the engine
Bring me my driving wheel, driving wheel
Once I get started
You'll know just how I feel

'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you

Gotta get through January, gotta get through February
Gotta get through January, gotta get through February
Gotta get through January, gotta get through February
Gotta get through January

Spring in my heart
Fire in my belly too
(Fire in my belly too)
(I come apart baby)
I come apart
(I come apart)
(I don't know what just to do)
Don't know just what to do
(Right on)


You, you on your high flying cloud
You, you when you're laughing out loud
You, you with the stars in your eyes
You, talking 'bout you

I gotta get through January, I gotta get through February
Gotta get through January, I gotta get through February
I gotta get through January, I gotta get to February

Spring in my heart, spring in my heart
(Spring in my heart)
Fire, fire in my belly too
(Fire in my belly too)
I come apart
(I come apart baby)
I come apart
(I come apart)
I don't know just what to do
(I don't know what just to do)
(Right on)
(Right on)


You, you on your high flying cloud
You, (you), you when you're laughing out loud
You, (you), you with the stars in your eyes
(You with the stars in your eyes)
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)
You with the stars in your eyes
(You)
You with your hidden surprise
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you, talking 'bout you)
Talking 'bout you
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)
Talking 'bout you
(Talking 'bout you)
Talking 'bout youEmbed
