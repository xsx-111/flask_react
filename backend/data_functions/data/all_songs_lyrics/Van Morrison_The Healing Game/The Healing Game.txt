The Healing Game Lyrics
Here I am again
Back on the corner again
Back where I belong
Where I've always been
Everything the same
It'll never change
I'm back on the corner again
In the healing game

Down those ancient streets
Down those ancient roads
Where nobody knows
Where nobody goes
I'm back on the corner again
Where I've always been
Never been away
From the healing game

Where the choirboys sing (Where the choirboys sing)
Where I've always been (Where I've always been)
Sing the song with soul (Sing the song with soul)
Baby don't you know (Don't you know, don't you know)
We can let it roll (We can let it roll)
On the saxophone (On the saxophone)
Back street jelly roll (Back street jelly roll)
In the healing game, alright
Where the homeboys sing (Shoo be doo wop bop bop)
Sing their songs of praise (Shoo be doo wop bop bop)
'Bout their golden days (Shoo be doo wop bop bop)
In the healing game (Shoo be doo wop bop bop)
Sing it out loud (Sing it out loud)
Sing it in your name (Sing it in your name)
Sing it like you're proud (Sing it like you're proud)
Sing the healing game (Sing the healing game)

Sing it out loud (Sing it out loud)
Sing it in your name (Sing it in your name)
Sing it like you're proud (Sing it like you're proud)
Sing the healing game (Sing the healing game)
Sing the healing game (Sing the healing game)
Sing the healing game (Sing the healing game)
Sing it in your name (Sing it in your name)
Sing the healing game (Sing the healing game)

Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing it in your name
Sing me the healing game (The healing game)
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing it in your name
Sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing it in your name
Sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing it in your name
Sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing it
Sing the healing game
Sing it in your name, yeah
Sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing the healing game, sing the healing game
Sing it in your name
Sing the healing game1Embed
