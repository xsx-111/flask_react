Waiting Game Lyrics
On a golden autumn day returning
Where each moment never is the same
And pure joy sometimes comes with patience

When I'm waiting on, waiting game
When I'm waiting on, waiting game

Must be reason for all this inaction
Does it mean that everything must change?
(Everything must change)
Sometimes I'm looking for perfection
(Looking for perfection)

When I'm waiting on, waiting game
When I'm waiting on, waiting game

I am the observer who is observing
I am the brother of this snake
I am the serpent filled with venom
A god of love and a god of hate
There is a presence deep within you
(Ooh deep within you)
Sometimes they call it higher flame
(Sometimes they call it higher flame)
And the leaves come tumbling down, remember (Remember)

I'll be waiting on, waiting game
I'll be waiting on, waiting game

I am the observer who is observing
I am the brother of this snake
I am the serpent filled with venom
A god of love and a god of hate

There is a presence deep within you
(Ooh deep within you)
Some people call it higher power in flame
(Higher power in flame)
When the leaves come tumbling down, remember
(Remember, remember)

I'll be waiting on, waiting game
I'll be waiting on, waiting game
(One more time)
Waiting on the waiting game (Waiting game)
Waiting on (Waiting on the waiting game)
(Waiting on, waiting game)
Waiting on (Waiting on)
Waiting on (Waiting on)
(Waiting on)
When I'm called (When I'm called)
I'll come the waiting game (Waiting game)
(Waiting game, waiting game, waiting game)Embed
