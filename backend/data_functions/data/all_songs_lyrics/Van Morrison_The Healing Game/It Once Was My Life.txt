It Once Was My Life Lyrics
There were people on the sidewalks (Sidewalks)
Strolling down the avenues (Avenues)
They were sitting outside in cafes (Cafes)
We were looking for the muse (For the muse)
Well I was locked in by the system (Ooh)
Where no freedom is the rule
Now I spend all my time (All my time)
Just trying to make it understood (Understood)

It once was my life (Was my life)
That's what everybody said (Everybody said)
All the things I used to do (Used to do)
And the people that were friends (That were friends)
I've got to make it mean something (Ooh)
At the end of the day
It once was my life (Was my life)
They can't take that away (That away)

Trials and tribulations and stupidity still rules
Sometimes it looks like I'm on a ship of fools

It once was my life (Was my life)
When my message was just the street (Just the street)
Then it became something else (Something else)
And now it's incomplete (Incomplete)
I'm just trying to get back to when (Ooh)
Can somebody please shed some light?
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be uptight (Be uptight)
Used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be uptight (Be uptight)

Trials and tribulations (Trials and tribulations)
And stupidity still rules (Still rules)
Some days it just feels like
I'm still on a ship of fools

I'm back here on the boards (On the boards)
I can hear the engines roar (Engines roar)
Everybody's got to pay (Got to pay)
Some people got to pay more (Pay more)
Well you can tell the people anything (Ooh)
Spoon feed them anything you like
It used to be so simple (Be so simple)
It used to be my life (Be my life)

Now everything is so complicated (Complicated)
Just to speak or use the phone (Use the phone)
Some people try to use me (Try to use me)
Just 'cause they don't have their own (Have their own)
Don't know who's round the corner (Ooh)
Trying to sell me some more tripe
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life baby (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
It used to be my life (Be my life)
(Be my life)
Used to be my life (Be my life)Embed
