Rough God Goes Riding Lyrics
Oh, the mud-splattered victims
Have to pray out all along the ancient highway
Torn between half-truth and victimisation
Fighting back with counter attacks

It's when that rough God goes riding
When the rough God goes gliding
And then rough God goes riding
Riding on in

I was flabbergasted by the headlines
People in glass houses throwing stones
Gaping wounds that will never heal
Now they're moaning like a dog in a manger

'Cause when that rough God goes riding
And then rough God goes gliding
There'll be nobody hiding
When that rough God comes riding on in

And it's a matter of survival
When you're born with your back against the wall
Won't somebody hand me a Bible?
Won't you give me that number to call?
When that rough God goes riding
When that rough God goes gliding
There'll be nobody hiding
When that rough God goes riding on in
Riding on in
When that rough God goes riding
When that rough God goes gliding
There'll be nobody hiding
When that rough God goes riding on in
Riding on in
There'll be no more heroes
They'll be reduced to zero
When that rough God goes riding
Riding on in, riding on in
Riding on in, riding on in
Riding on in

Riding on in
Riding on in
Riding on in
Riding on inEmbed
