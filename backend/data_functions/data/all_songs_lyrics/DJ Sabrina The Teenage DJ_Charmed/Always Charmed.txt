Always Charmed LyricsI was always charmed by you
Lost in a love that I always knew
Familiar as a memory
You were too special
You were too precious
And you were gone
Far too soon
I’m starting to fall for you
I’m starting to fall in love, with you
Right or wrong
Right or wrong
I still, love you
I know, I was charmed too
My doubts in the past
Love came too fast
Your sweetness, your beauty, so hypnotizing
I wonder if I had asked
But no, my heart, it never could last
(You never felt the way to )
I’m starting to fall for you
I’m starting to fall in love, with you
Sabrina, I’ve been waiting for you
I’m still charmed, I’m still enchanted
But most of all, I’m still in love
And I’m still falling (falling) (falling)
With you, just you
Sabrina
I’ll always love you (love you) (love you)
Love you (Love you)
Wow
Love you
Waiting, all night
I’m waiting
To that much 
All this timе I’m waiting
Love, love

All this time I’m waiting
For you
I nеver loved you quite enough
I never loved you quite enough
Oh, oh, ohEmbed
