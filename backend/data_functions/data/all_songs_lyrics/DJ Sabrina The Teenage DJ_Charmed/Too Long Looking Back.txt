Too Long Looking Back LyricsStirring me up, cooling me down
Make me wear that tired old frown
Seems it's all just in the game
You can play me all the same
You make me work for love
Hurts me more than you
When you mess with me
You break my heart in two
'Cos you know
(We got bliss, riding the four)
We got bliss, riding the four-letter wagon
(Controls in the back, rolled blank)
Controls in the back, rolled blank turret
(We go round and together)
We go round and together there's something
(Too long looking back)
Too long looking back
Speeding along, got your soul
Got me wanting all day long
You can run, you can roll
You just makе me oh-so alone
Got me fourth in linе
Nothing else I do
You've been messing me
I've got to know the truth
'Cos you know
(We got bliss, riding the four)
We got bliss, riding the four-letter wagon
(Controls in the back, rolled blank)
Controls in the back, rolled blank turret
(We go round and together)
We go round and together there's something
(Too long looking back)
Too long looking back
It's been too long
Long rolling round
Stirring me up, cooling me down
Playing me for a fool
Too long
Reeling me on, all year long
Feel the sunlight break of dawn
Make my heart the true to feel
Got yourself some love to steal
You make me work for love
I'm giving you this clue
When you mess with me
It hurts me more than you
'Cos you know
(We got bliss, riding the four)
We got bliss, riding the four-letter wagon
(Controls in the back, rolled blank)
Controls in the back, rolled blank turret
(We go round and together)
We go round and together there's something
(Too long looking back)
Too long looking back
(We got bliss, riding the four)
We got bliss, riding the four-letter wagon
(Controls in the back, rolled blank)
Controls in the back, rolled blank turret
(We go round and together)
We go round and together there's something
(Too long looking back)
Too long looking back
(We got bliss, riding the four)
We got bliss, riding the four-letter wagon
(Controls in the back, rolled blank)
Controls in the back, rolled blank turret
(We go round and together)
We go round and together there's something
(Too long looking back)
Too long looking back
(We got bliss, riding the four)
We got bliss, riding the four-letter wagon
(Controls in the back, rolled blank)
Controls in the back, rolled blank turret
(We go round and together)
We go round and together there's something
(Too long looking back)
Too long looking backEmbed
