Forever LyricsThis is DJ Sabrina The Teenage DJ
Bring in the flavour, bring in the funk
We've got a great selection right here for you tonight
Don't go anywhere or touch that dial, alright? Alright
Cool
I feel the tension rising
I'm gonna tell you tonight
You're every dream I have
I don't want to wake up
Leave me in my heaven
Don't make me wait long
Don't make me stay strong
You don't even have to call me
Go on the town with yours truly
I'll show you what I mean
Mean everything that I say
I'll show you in my own way
Need to hold you
To be with you
Nothing elsе
Comes near
To this mysterious powеr you have over me this hour
Of this time it's clear
You've overwhelmed my expectations
I expect your love for all occasions
Captivate my heart
And our bed I won't forsake with only you I want to wake
Let the world stand still
With you my mind is still racing
And it's you I'll be embracing forever
Your body is my temple
I want to feel it all over
The one thing that I know
You're everything that I want
So take me to heaven
Fame and fortune
Will be yours soon
Nothing else
Comes near
To this mysterious power you have over me this hour
Of this time it's clear
You've overwhelmed my expectations
I expect your love for all occasions
Captivate my heart
And our bed I won't forsake with only you I want to wake
Let the world stand still
With you my mind is still racing
And it's you I'll be embracing forever
That mouth that begs to kiss me
How do you make it look so good?
I know you understand
I know that you believe
Let's hold each other thru midnite
Your persuasion
This occasion
Nothing else
Comes near
To this mysterious power you have over me this hour
Of this time it's clear
You've overwhelmed my expectations
I expect your love for all occasions
Captivate my heart
And our bed I won't forsake with only you I want to wake
Let the world stand still
With you my mind is still racing
And it's you I'll be embracing foreverEmbed
