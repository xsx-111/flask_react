Charmed LyricsCharmed, oh so Charmed by your magic
Life before you was so tragic
Restless, hopeless, lost, without aim
The old me was missing you, such a shame
I didn’t know it, but I know that it’s true
I can’t wake up anymore without you
You gave me a future I didn’t know before
You put my heart in a spell and now I’m yours forever more
Do you you
Feel the way I do, do, do?
All because of you, you, you
I feel the way I do, do, do
Do you you
Feel the way I do, do, do?
All because of you, you, you
I feel the way I do, do, do
Oh, Charmed to be with you
Yeah, Charmed when I daydream
Ah, Charmed like a soul who was wandering around this lonеly world without a home
Oh, Charmed to be in lovе
I’m so excited I can’t believe that I’m so
Charmed
That you made me your own
Never again will I be alone
Never again will I be alone
Do you, you (Remix!)
Feel the way I do, do, do?
All because of you, you, you
I feel the way I do, do, do
Do you, you
(Like, why would you waste your time?)
Feel the way I do, do, do?
(It makes no sense why people waste their time)
All because of you, you, you
(I-it doesn’t make any sense) (sense) (sense)
I feel the way I do, do, do
Pointing the finger, I'm counting on loving you
Over and above the passion
I'm connected to you
Put your hand on my heart and listen
What I need is a dedication to last me all the way through
Sabrina
Check it
Check it, yo
Yo, Hollywood pops, it don’t stop (stop) (stop)
Wreck it, when the weak fail dealing with the mind itself 
Before you know it, it’s so heroic
Nevertheless, never the less
And I know that you are so 
Do you, you (Why'd you have to go and make me like you?)
Feel the way I do, do, do? (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
All because of you, you, you (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
I feel the way I do, do, do (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
Do you, you (Why'd you have to go and make me like you?)
Feel the way I do, do, do? (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
All because of you, you, you (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
I feel the way I do, do, do (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)

Right?
Uh, well you do need to  all night, today
I, so
You wanna go out?
Do you, you (Why'd you have to go and make me like you?)
Feel the way I do, do, do? (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
All because of you, you, you (Why'd you have to go and make me like you?)
I feel the way I do, do, do (So mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
Somebody’s always yapping at me like over and over again, like (Do you, you)
And he’d be like, that’s like me
Over and above the passion (feel the way I do, do)
I'm connected to you (all because of you, you)
Put your hand on my heart and listen (I feel the way I do, do)
What I need is a dedication to last me all the way through
