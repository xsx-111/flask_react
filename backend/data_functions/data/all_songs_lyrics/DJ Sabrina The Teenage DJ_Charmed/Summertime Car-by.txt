Summertime Car-by LyricsI'm going for mine (Damn!)
It's amazing
This confession (Ladies, listen up.)
List-en up
How I still been stuck  from up under some 
Hey yo
What up boy?
It's amazing
This confession
Run again, run again

Ahi papa,  para verlas, la fiera
Hay basura  cuando llegue 
Ladies, listen upEmbed
