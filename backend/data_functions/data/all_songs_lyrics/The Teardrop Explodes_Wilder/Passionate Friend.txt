Passionate Friend LyricsThe friend I have is a passionate friend
But I can`t see you buying
Love a dream of a love affair
That`s, over, past & dying
Celebrate, the great escape
From lunacy divided
Hunnanoo, I'm seeing you
But nobodys decided
A sound that`s drifting out from you
When the love has boiled away
Colours shape and there are things that need
A beating heart not a cheating heart
But a cheating heart, is still a beating heart
I believe in you today
My life see`s me wandering
Lost in smiles forever
Erase my mind see what I find
Axes dream together
I`ve got all sleeps secrets hidden in my bag
But a lot are leaving 'cos their not believing
That you could ever do that thing
And never bring yourself to sing
Bah bah bah bah bah
The friend I have is a passionate friend
But I can`t see you buying
Love a dream of a love affair
That`s, over, past & dying
Celebrate the great escape
Carry my soul away
From sufferance intolerance
Leaving you today
Bah bah bah bah bahEmbed
