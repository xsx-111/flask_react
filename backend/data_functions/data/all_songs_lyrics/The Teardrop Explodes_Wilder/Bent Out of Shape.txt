Bent Out of Shape LyricsAll my life I've been bent outta shape
Can't you see it's killing me
Listen to the sound I make
Listen to 
The words I sing but they never mean
Anything I need them to
Believing is a dreamer thing
Believing is more than I know
When the fire is far away
It's ecstasy but it loses me
I can see it's a fine place
Yes, yes it's everywhere
All my life I've been bent outta shape
Course it comes as no surprise
These are dreams that I never had
See the lines arounds my eyes
Allusions of illusions of a-losing you
See the houses in-between
Secret dreams of Melanie
And Melanie knows who I mean
When the fire is far away
It's ecstasy but it loses me
I can see it's a fine place
Yes, yes it's everywhere
When the fire is far away
It's ecstasy but it loses me
I can see it's a fine place
Yes, yes it's everywhereEmbed
