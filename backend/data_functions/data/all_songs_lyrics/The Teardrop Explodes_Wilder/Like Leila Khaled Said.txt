Like Leila Khaled Said LyricsYou can smother me with kisses
You can smother me with dreams
You can always be the mistress of my schemes
But the sad is a very special thing
It can leave you at the start
It can see you standing naked
In a jar
But another ship could find you
And now's your chance, and now's your chance
Another ship could find you
And now's your chance, and now's your chance
Just like Leila Khaled said
Just like Leila Khaled said
Meeting people round the table
Trying hard to get excited for your brand new name
Bringing friends all round for dinner
Shown an empty crazed pack that said "Crystal was here"
Just like Leila Khaled said
Just like Leila Khaled said
Hey, how does he do those things?
They never really get the chance
And before this we wake
We'll forget the things that drive affection
Put aside these old reflections
Just like Leila Khaled said
Just like Leila Khaled saidEmbed
