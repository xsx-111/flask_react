Colours Fly Away LyricsMore by luck than judgment here am I
Smiling at the fighting once again
Frightened of my hands
Frightened of my friends
Call it by a very different name
Colours fly away from you
Lost in valid wondering
Angels fly their camoflage
Darkness that is shattered by the dawn
There's a new boy here to play our game
Shoot my eyes out I could wake up dreaming
This is where I score
Wise up to my tricks
Colour in my face and yell extremist
Colours fly away from you
Lost in valid wondering
Angels fly their camoflage
Darkness that is shattered by the dawn
Someone's sleeping in my attic room
Someone's watching everything I'm doing
Harry Ranjet sings
Save a song for me
Heard you on the radio today
Colours fly away!Embed
