The Culture Bunker LyricsOh, take me to the moon
It's safe and I want to lie down
Oh, take me to your heart
There must be a soft spot somewhere
I'd like some of this
I've been waiting so long
Waiting for the Crucial Three
Wondering what went wrong
I stormed out of the culture bunker
Finger on the pin, do you like my grin, huh?
Black underneath with a burning seat for you
Oh, I feel cold when it turns to gold
I feel cold when it turns to gold for you
Early mornings in my town
You hear the doodlebugs roar
They all make a noise
But finally they crash to the ground
Oh so many times
Silly things, why don't they learn?
Don't expect us to tell you
It's fun to see you burn
I stormed out of the culture bunker
Finger on the pin, do you like my grin, huh?
Black underneath with a burning seat for you
Oh, I feel cold when it turns to gold
I feel cold 'cos you're so far away
I stormed out of the culture bunker
Finger on the pin, do you like my grin, huh?
Black underneath with a burning seat for you
I feel cold when it turns to gold for you
For youEmbed
