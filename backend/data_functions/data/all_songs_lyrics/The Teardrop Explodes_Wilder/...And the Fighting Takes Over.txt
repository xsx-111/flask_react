...And the Fighting Takes Over LyricsAnd then the fighting takes over
And I regret what I say
And whether or not there's other joy in laughter
That's taken far away
And as two souls rush together
I look again into your eyes
But we were just a pair of little children
Two children, no surprise
I fold you up into a corner
Can't fly away from me again
I think about the first time and lately
Oh, lately I think againEmbed
