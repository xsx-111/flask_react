The Great Dominion LyricsSuddenly
I came to my senses
A night on fire put out all traces of feeling
I'm only concerned with looking concerned
I don't want to get my laces burned
We talked for hours
Except for the fainting
We seemed so enchanted but now my expression is changing
See, see for yourself, I'm run down by a dream
I stand back from a shark attack, and it's all the same
Mummy, I've been fighting again
Mummy, I've been fighting again
Mummy, I've been fighting again
Mummy, I've been fighting again
I should have known
You'd seek my opinion
From all over the country and out to the great dominions
Careful, some of the blunders of history have been made that way
I'm still stuck in this pickle jar on a paper carpet
Mummy, I've been fighting again
Mummy, I've been fighting again
Mummy, I've been fighting again
Mummy, I've been fighting againEmbed
