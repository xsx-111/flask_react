Pure Joy LyricsWhat's that for if it's not for me
And I don't want to see it anyway
Red man's sack bursting at the seams
Here comes daddy to tread on my dreams
I said "I don't believe that
You said you'd try to understand"
I've got a good car but it's not a good car
It won't take me to paradise for the day
I sit painting my uncle's fences
He said "here's a glass of ignorance for you"
I said "I shouldn't drink that
Too many people say it's good for you"
Pure joy wins out again
And makes it easy
And then the clouds come down o'er you
I take my time, take my time, time, time
I'm only here for youEmbed
