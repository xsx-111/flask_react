Charging the Void Lyrics
I think I am losing my mind
Blasting forward through a filamentous sky
Beckoned by the flash of exploding light
My soul crosses over the Great Divide

Charging the void
Isolated, I’ve been redeployed
A rider on the crest
Carry forth or plummet to death
Autopilot function has been overridden
For Isolation subjects, choice has been forbidden
But death and destruction are what I’ve been given

Charging the void
Isolated, I’ve been redeployed
A rider on the crest
Carry forth or plummet to death
Particles known only in theory, within my grasp
Entering the cloud of the exploded mass
To live is to die, disjunction seals our fate
So many tyrants lie, pleading at the gates
Regimes at an end with policies left to amend
Where would the future lie if regimes had time to bide
So bring unto me morbid mastery
I shall revoke the throne atop the stellar tree
I choose a different path from those now dead in the mire
They could not wield the flame of life. To which, now I conspire
I charge the void
I’ve found the purpose
Immortalize this life
I will return to the surface
A lust for control and power
Has grown in isolation
A sky that once brought hope and light
Now brings me desolation
I must wield the sands of time to reclaim what is mine
Stargazers have made the claims
Of enocules bursting from Alshain
Deep within the serpent’s spire
I forge a path that takes me higher
I’ve crossed the Great Divide
Now I peer into the depths of death’s door
Through the rippling veil I acquire
The dust of life that Cygnus obscures
To the other side, I have done it
I now command the draw of death’s door
To the relic Alshain, now I’ve got it
A molecule like nothing before
Star fields of Aquila set ablaze
Reap the ashes of the great Alshain
Relic Alshain
Oh Shahin-i-tarazu, now my flesh is born anew
Within my hands, I hold the sands
A sky of pillars gives life and land
The blackest night unveiling death
One inhaling, exhaling breath
Of the swan with blackened wings outstretched
A path unseen unfolds for me
I charge the void and ascend the tree
To the bird of morbid mastery
I heed the Cygnus call
They will want the dust obtained through my gall
I bring the gift of extended life
No longer will control be born of strife
I burn through disregarded space
Dispatched, forgotten, now I stake my independent claim
I will rule this stark domain1Embed
