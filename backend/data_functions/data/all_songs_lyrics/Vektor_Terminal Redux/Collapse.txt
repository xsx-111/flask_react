Collapse LyricsWe don’t belong at these heights
Watching over all
We’ve come to the point of the obelisk
Impaled as we fall

Collapse under the weight of time
In this still life of our design
Collapse into a great resolve
Everything falls
A broken image reflects from a shattered surface
Its shards of truth cut clean their meaning, our purpose
A tearful dawn sheds light
On what we have become
We were not meant to live like this
No life, no freedom

A broken image reflects from a shattered surface
Its shards of truth cut clean their meaning, our purpose
To struggle, to glean, to want, to bleed
We’ve bided time
We’ve traveled to distant worlds
On our quest for knowledge and power
We’ve traced the galactic whorls
And now full circle
Unfulfilled by what we’ve seen
This is it, one galaxy
Out of the shadows, my silhouette is torn
Freed from the darkness, I see my vile form
Bleeding out from a spiral clade
This is all I have
This is all that I have
To live, to die, to lose our pride
To accept our fate
Life is not ours to dictate
Stagnation is death in a constitution of progress
Now at the zenith there is nowhere left
Nowhere left to go but down
Ruling in the present while the future eludes us
The further we push forward
The harder it becomes to look back
To struggle, to glean, to want, to bleed
To live, we must die
We live to die1Embed
