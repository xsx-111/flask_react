Cygnus Terminal LyricsThrough the black, the hull is stacked
Taking in the haul from Alshain
Growing cracks, but still intact
Encroaching on the Cygnus domain
Beacon light within my sight
The terminal is glowing in space
Symbol for the free, but not for me
I’m preparing to plead my case
Like the moon is silent, consumed by the void
All screams from inside are destroyed
I was served an injustice as head of the Guard
Unbalanced and covetous was my charge
I have returned
With malice that can’t be unlearned
I have arrived
Like the rise of a massive tide
Cygnus Terminal
Iso Subject 5, where were you?
Gone for 13 years and only aged 2
We deal with the terminal, we deal with death
We are the bringers of balance; we are the lungs of the cosmic breath
Iso Subject 5, your tracker was damaged at take-off
How could you survive?
We thought you were gone
Cygnus Terminal
Iso Subject 5, you say that’s not your name?
Isolation must have twisted your brain
We deal with the terminal, we deal with death
We are the bringers of balance, we are the lungs of the cosmic breath
Iso Subject 5, you’ve strayed from your tests
You must have lost your mind
Why don’t we just kill you now and put this all to rest?
I crossed the Great Divide
I now have command over time
It’s futile to object
Now grant my parole from the Isolation Project
All the years trapped in silence
All there was to confide in
Was my waning sense of worth
Now reprieved of the tests
My soul is battered at best
But I’ve lived to see my rebirth
Policies of my decree
Once again, are enforced by me
Epsilon, Pteropticon
Failing now because of my leave
LCD, at full capacity
This is where I’ll restart my work
Take the names of those who caused me shame
Be silent, swift, and deft on your search
Like the moon is silent, consumed by the void
All screams from inside are destroyed
I have returned
With malice that can’t be unlearned
I have arrived
Like the rise of a massive tide1Embed
