Psychotropia LyricsI have ended their reign of strife
The land is cleansed with the ebb of the tide
I give you the sands; now we must rebuild
The world is ours to be shaped by our will

Psychotropia
An ageless utopia
Psychotropia
A reflection to be a
Mirrored image of my reverie
Our thoughts are aligned; connected by screens
Imagine a world where we are the force
That shapes this planet without recourse
Yield from the pain in the path of resistance
You’re a sheep unshorn, nothing more
Believe in the gain from my path of persistence
A seed unborn, nothing more
In our time we have seen
A new light of liberty
A new dawn now unfurls
We create a perfect world
Revel in the consciousness
Of a world in a waking-life
Watch as all my hopes and dreams
Materialize
Balance attained through stability
We must eliminate change
Change is the force that brings down regimes
Balance must be maintained

Forward we go
Psychotropia
In a world that’s shaped by our minds
Aspiration designs
Sterilize the population
The ageless have no need to procreate
Genetic banks have my hand-picked genes
If misfortune on someone awaits

Forward we go
Psychotropia
In a world that’s shaped by our minds
Aspiration designs
We are aligned; we’ve bound our minds
A new regime: what will it glean?
What will we find with endless time?
Unleash the hive (x3)
Raze the land to construct a new beacon
That will shine out from every surface
We are Cygnus V.2
We dictate balance and purpose

Forward we go
Psychotropia
In a world that’s shaped by our minds
Aspiration designs
In our time we have seen
A new light of liberty
Now we spread our cosmic law
Through the skies over all

Psychotropia
An ageless utopia
Psychotropia
A shrouding dystopia
Trudging through the heaps of waste
An abstract world outside the screens we embrace
The air imbues a film of scum
The city’s center rises above the slumsEmbed
