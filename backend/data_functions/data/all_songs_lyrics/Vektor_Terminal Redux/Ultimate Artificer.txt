Ultimate Artificer LyricsEnvelope the world in storms
After a great reprieve
Chaos and terror breed in my lies
I will make you believe
Master of ancient darkness
Who lives by the black decree
Looms over dark, flashing upbursts
In facilities unseen

A parallax is forming
Within the Sanctioned Sphere
A parallax is forming
An oculus to the stars appears

Ultimate artificer
You live to spread fear
Usurp the world in silence
Quelling defiance
Low orbit power grids
Placed by the Cygnus Creed
Were used as a docking point
That I now oversee
Lightning ignites the air
A glimpse of the grand design
Cumulonimbus cloak
Sprites explode to the sky


And the Reapers fly in
Soon, the cleansing begins
And no longer we crawl
Before we rise, many must fall
Obelisk to the stars
Your shadow splits the graves
Of the ones who lived for you
They have died in vain
Obelisk to the stars
Your shadow meets my eye
You are obsolete because I am
What you symbolize
Cygnus exploits the alliance
Cygnus demands compliance
And the Reapers fly in
Soon, the cleansing begins
And no longer we crawl
Before we rise, many must fall
Low orbit power grids
Placed by the Cygnus Creed
Ready the power
Ready the machines
