Intro / Flowers Lyrics
I see blinding light and I know
I, boy, I and I know
And I need, can I please, can I know, I plead
Oh, feel full, full, feel full
When I'm with you, you
Oh-I, I-oh know, know, know, know
I know

B-b-b-b-bye, bye
When and when boy, walk again
Walk again with me
He die, die, die, die, die
On the day, he really, really
About to die
On the day he died
And he'd really think about the why, why, why
He forgot to talk about the why, bye, byeEmbed
