My Sister Says the Saddest Things Lyrics
Ah, my sister
Ah, my sister
Hold my hand in the night
Ah, my sister
Ah, my sister
Hold my hand in the night
Tick tock, baby, ah
Tick tock, baby, ah
Ah, my sister
Ah, my sister
Ah, my sister
Hold my hand in the night

Ladies walk about, singing in the night
You will never tell
Ladies walk about, singing in the night
You will never tell

I will cry on the 4th of July, and
I don't really mind, and
I haven't the time, and
I will cry on the 4th of July, and
I don't...
Ladies walk about, singing in the night
You will never tell
Ladies walk about, singing in the night
You will never tell

My only friend, this is the end
My only friend, this is the end
My only friend, this is the end
My only friend, this is the end7Embed
