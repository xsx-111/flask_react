Hallways Lyrics
I see inside myself and I know when I go
Little bird flying in the night, if only I, fly

Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy

I fell in your arms, take my hands until I'm filled
We fell apart
(Fell apart)

Oh no, baby we fall, fall deep then climb
Until we feel, until the sky

Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy

Nightfall
My home
Oh, fantasy
Oh, my fantasy
Take your heart and go to fantasy
Oh, in my fantasy
Oh, no, oh fantasy
Oh, oh, in my own
I left

Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasy
Oh, fantasyEmbed
