Devon Lyrics
Ah-ah, ah-oh
Yeah

Oh, my love, I'll wait
I am waiting here all day
And I'm nothing without you
When you and I were, and I loved you

Oh, my love, I know
That you are asking me to go
And I know I am holding onto dust
But my heart is telling me I'm right

Take my hand if you care
I can be your girl
You'll be my man
But you don't love me anymore
And I've never felt so broken up before
(I am well, I am well, I am well)

Ooh, baby darling
I will wait before
Ooh, baby darling
I will wait before
Ooh, long night
I will wait before
Ooh, every night
I will wait before, before
I die, I die, I die, I
Oh, my love, I know
That you are asking me to go
And I know I am holding onto dust
But my heart is telling me I'm right

Take my hand if you can
I can be your girl
You'll be my man
But you don't love me anymore
And I've never felt so broken up before
(I am well, I am well, I am well)
