Swan Song Lyrics
Eyes on, open road
You go by your own
I don't care
Leave me baby
I went away
Lead the way
You know the way

We don't know
We don't, we don't, don't, don't
Let, let it boy
See?

Hold on to your heart, yeah
I, I, I...
Oh, oh, oh...

Eyes on, I'm going this way
You know, you know the way
Do you know the way?

We don't know
We don't know the way
We don't know...
Oh, oh, oh...5Embed
