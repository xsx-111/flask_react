Heartbeats Lyrics
Oh, I, I go back alone
And I keep wonder, oh
I go back alone
Do you want it?

You
And I can't live my life now
Without you
And I can't think of all I wanna do
You only hated me
I gave you all of me
And I want to see

I took a dare
I wasn't scared
I put my back into it
I know the past
I took a chance
And I can't waste it all on you

Hold me
Am I still alive? I wanna know, I wanna know
Hold me
Am I still alive? I wanna know
Hold me
Am I still alive? I wanna know
Hold me
Am I still alive? I wanna know
Oh, I go back alone
And I will leave behind
I go back alone
What do you want?

You
And I can't live my life now
Without you
And I can't think of all I wanna do
You've only hated me
I gave you all of me
And I want you

I took a dare
I wasn't scared
I put my back into it
I know the past
I took a chance
And I can't waste it all on you

Hold me
I wanna know, I wanna know
Hold me
I wanna know, I wanna know
Hold me
I wanna know, I wanna know6Embed
