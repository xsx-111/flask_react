Dream Fortress Lyrics
Oh, touching
He can't have it
I can tease
Oh, lie with me
Tired of living on my own, baby
Oh, how dear, when I see
(Have it when it's waiting for you)
Oh, no, you see the way and I can't see
(Have it when it's waiting for you)

I can't my baby
(You're down, I know)
I can't my baby, oh
I can't my baby
I can't my baby...

I am on my own
Oh, I don't know how
Oh, be on time oh
Oh, I don't know how
(Have it when it's waiting for you)
Oh, be on time
(Have it when it's waiting for you)
I can't my baby
(I won't today)
I can't my baby
(And I will know where I'm from)
I don't know how my baby

Here I am, running in the dark
Here I am, running away
Here I am, running in the dark
Here I am, running away4Embed
