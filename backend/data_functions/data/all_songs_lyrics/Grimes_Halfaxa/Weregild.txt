Weregild Lyrics
Voignamir, Voignamir
Say something for me, Voignamir
Say something for me, Voignamir
Say something to me
Voignamir!

Werewolves, werewolves
Skies will brighten
Werewolves, werewolves
Skies will brighten
Brighten, brighten
Brighten

I-I'm on my way of the day
And I know
And I howl
And I prey
I-I'm on my way of the day
And I know
And I howl
And I prey

I was like the skies
So bright at night
I was like the skies
I can see space on the radio
I was like the skies
So bright at night
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
I can see space on the radio
I was like the skies
As bright at night
All the way
I was like the skies
All again
I was like the skies
So bright at night
All the way
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
I know, I know
I know, I know
And I'm ready to play
I, I know..
And I'm ready to play

I-I'm on my way of the day
And I know
And I howl
And I prey

I was like the skies
So bright at night
I was like the skies
I can see space on the radio
I was like the skies
So bright at night
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
I can see space on the radio
I was like the skies
All the way
I was like the skies
All again
I was like the skies
So bright at night
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
I was like the skies
So bright at night
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
Only 'cause I can't watch the day
Only 'cause I can't watch the day8Embed
