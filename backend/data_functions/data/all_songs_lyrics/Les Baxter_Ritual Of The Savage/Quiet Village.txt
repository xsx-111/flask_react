Quiet Village LyricsAlone in my quiet village I pray
You will be returning one day
To me
Return to me
Alone living with the mem'ry of you
Promising you'd always be true
To me
Be true to me
Above me there's a moon on fire
Telling you to love me as I desire
And ever the flame in my quiet village will burn
Darling till the day you return to me
Return to me, return to meEmbed
