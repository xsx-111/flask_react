The Life Divine LyricsThe love divine
Will always shine
Although we think
(of eye and mind?)
One day we'll see
That life divine
Is nothing but
The law divine
The law divine
The law divine
The law divine
(repeat)
The law divine
Is love divine
The law divine
Is love divine
The law divine
Is love divine
Is love divine
Is love divine
(repeat)
The love divine
Is love divine
And in our hearts
The light will shine
And then we'll (...?)
(...?) time
That love divine
Is yours and mine
Is yours and mine
Is yours and mine
(repeat)Embed
