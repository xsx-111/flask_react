Your House LyricsYour love is a life for I
Realized that so much
When I first met you
That was some time ago oh
From then until this
Resist no no no close to you
Oh yes right from the start
Oh no no no could never part
Oh I hear from that thought
CHORUS
I wanna live in your house
I wanna live in your house
You say dry your _ nose
Wipe that tear drop from your... eye
Was in a little situation
Came with a solution
Was a revelation to hear
Triumphant calling
Triumphant trumpets
SCAT
Spap spa da dap pap spa spa
CHORUS
I wanna live in your house
I wanna live in your house
Oh I no hear
Too much for what some say
Cause at the close of the day
They'll be so far away
But then I know
One things for certain
Came at the closing of the
Woo oh oh oh
Yes, I know one thing for certain
You'll be there you'll be there
It was you
That raise the flag above I head
Once when I was once when I was
In a little situation
Came with a, came with a solution
Was a revelation to hear
Triumphant calling
Triumphant trumpets
CHORUS
I wanna live in your house
I wanna live in your house
To make I home
To make I home yeh
I wanna liveEmbed
