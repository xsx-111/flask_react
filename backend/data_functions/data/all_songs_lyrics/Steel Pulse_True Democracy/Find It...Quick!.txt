Find It...Quick! LyricsI can't believe what I see
Mankind so incomplete yeh
Violence on your box at home
Shouts and screams
From your neighbours next door
Vandals prowl the dim lit streets
Muggers hide In alleys they creep
This world hatred has grown
Love fly gone out through the window
And we've got to find it
CHORUS
------
Somewhere somewhere
Somewhere somewhere
We got to find this love oh
Oh help us Jah above yeh come on
We got to find this love
Those in authority reject the cries of want
Those in power corrupt and weak in heart
This world don't you know that
Hatred has grown
Love fly gone out through the window
We've got to find it we got to find it
Love fly gone out through the window
We've got to find it
CHORUS
------
Somewhere somewhere
Love is
A golden chord that binds all commandments
Make all hearts sing
Could we be at the brink of defeat
Let truth rise and all lies die
Love has gone out through the window
We've got to find it
CHORUS
------
Somewhere somewhere
We've got to find this love
Oh help us Jah above
Let the wounds of this land be healed
A time of peace a time of plenty--mankindEmbed
