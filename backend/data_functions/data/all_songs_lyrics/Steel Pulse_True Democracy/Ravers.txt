Ravers LyricsWoops outside your head
Woops outside your head
Crucial and red
When the sun goes down Me little moonshine darling
And you're in the mood for love and you feel like dancing
Rub it up Rub it up Rub it up Rub it up
Boogie to some music
Boogie to some music
Boogie to some music
Boogie to some music
Come mek we go deh in a rub a dub (stylee)
A dis ya ridim drive the whole world (wile)
Come mek we go deh in bang diddly bang (stylee)
I wanna know how you're feeling (irie)
Sounds call ravers
Got you craving for more
Sounds call ravers
Got you craving for more
Come mek we go deh in a rub a dub (stylee)
A dis ya ridim drive the whole world (wile)
Come mek we go deh in bang diddly bang (stylee)
I wanna know how you're feeling (irie)
Reggae bandwagon is the fashion that's going around
Dub masters back in town with the fashion that's going around
Didn't you hear
Woops outside your head
Woops outside your head
Crucial and red
Woops outside your head
Woops outside your head
Woops outside your head
Disco blaring through the window Ravers sounds got full control
A new day is dawning arrives without warning
Chart busting sounds to rock down the house say
Boogie to ze muzik
Boogie to ze muzik
Boogie to ze muzik
Boogie to ze muzik
Reggae bandwagon is the fashion that's going around
Reggae bandwagon is the fashion that's going around
So when the sun goes down me little moonshine darling
And you're in the mood for love and you feel like dancing
Rub it up rub it up rub it up rub it up
Sounds call ravers
Got you craving for more
Sounds call ravers
Got you craving for more
CHORUS

Come mek we go deh in a rub a dub (stylee)
A dis ya ridim drive the whole world (wile)
Come mek we go deh in bang diddly bang (stylee)
I wanna know how you're feeling (irie)
Woops outside your head
Woops outside your head
Woops outside your head
Crucial and red
Come mek we go deh in a earthman (stylee)
Come mek we go deh in bang diddly bang (stylee)
I wanna know how you're feeling (irie)
I wanna know how you're feeling (irie)
Got you craving for more
Got you craving for more
Got you craving for more
More and more, more and more, moreEmbed
