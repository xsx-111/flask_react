Blues Dance Raid Lyrics
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Some shekels fe I shenks
Just a burn up de lambâ€™s bread
Session rocking, yeah

So dem come so dem drop
From time to time dem a watch I
Dem a spy wid dem bad eye

Tipped off by informers
Dem a watch who come out and come in
Yeah (come a raid I blues dance)
Yes they knew when the time would be right
Run come gate crash I party
(Come a raid I blues dance)
Raid blues dance, raid I blues
(Come a raid I blues dance)
Kick off the door, woe I name dem call
I back against de wall a rub a daughter
(Come a raid I blues dance)
Dem a run come kill I vibe, interfere wid I
The pigs come to destroy Rasta cry blood
Dreadlocks cry blood
Raid blues dance
Out of darkness out of night
People screaming, batons wheeling
A lot of bleeding, bruised feelings

Search warrant for their outivation
Walkie talkies reinforcements
From dem pocket dem draw handcuff
Dis ya session it rough
Every step of the way got to retaliate yeh
Fight dem back, mash dem down
Vex to death, dem a threat
Mek arrest kiss me neck
Raid blues dance, raid I blues
A run come a run come who
Run come kill I vibe interfere with I
Pigs come to destroy, Rasta cry blood
Dreadlocks cry blood
Come a come a come a come a raid
Come a kick up I speaker
Come a mash up I tweeter
Come a grab up I ishenks
Come a lick out I window
Come a move out I soft drink
Come a rough up the people
Come a turn off me system
Have fe give you some bitch lick
Come a smash up I turntable
Come a scratch up I music
Come a drive up you meat van
Come a come a come a raidEmbed
