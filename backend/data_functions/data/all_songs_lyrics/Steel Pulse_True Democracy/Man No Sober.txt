Man No Sober LyricsWoooh! Man no sober
The drunkard he staggers around
The alleys of cities and towns
His sorrows he tries to drown
Solution to his problems
Can never be found
Booze is what he choose
Like a gipsy he's tipsy
He drinks too much whiskey
Like a gipsy he's tipsy
He drinks too much
A Mr Winehead stagger deh
Booze is what he choose
Watch him how topples over
CHORUS
------
Man no sober
In and out of discotheques
In and out of wine bars
Burnt out shell looks a wreck
Got to help him somehow oh
Greets bartenders drink firewater
Dance bossanova he topples over
CHORUS
------
Man no sober
With a bottle in his hand
Hangover
(Repeat)
In and out of discotheques
In and out of wine bars
CHORUS
------
Man no sober
From dust till dawn he
He staggers around
From dust till dawn
He drinks it all day long
Yow yow watch him how he topples overEmbed
