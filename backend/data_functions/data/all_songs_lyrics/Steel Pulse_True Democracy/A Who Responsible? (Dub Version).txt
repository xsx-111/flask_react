A Who Responsible? (Dub Version) LyricsThe struggle goes on
Some say the earth will keep on turning
Dread times are near and I'm not joking I a warning
As we continue the same old moaning
The chosen race just keeps on begging, yeah
And I wanna know who, a who responsible?
They don't give a damn no, they don't give a damn no
Mother's joy turn to pain and hollering
Weeping for their babes and sucklings
Spirits of the innocent wandering, I kill you
Separation everlasting
But I wanna know who, a who re, who responsible?
I wanna know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no, they don't give a damn no, oh Lord
Oh papa, dem chest keeps on burning
Fist clench tight a grit dem teeth and blood is boiling
The price is high yet they keep on paying, yeah, oh Lord
The little bundles of love they are all missing
I wanna know who, a who responsible?
They don't give a damn no, they don't give a
They don't give a
Brothers and sisters this plight we're facing
Get involved problems to solve yourselves concerning
Divided we are so one by one we are falling
The front line of the battle is hottest your duty's calling
I demand to know who, a who re, a who responsible?
I wanna know a who, a who re, I wanna know who responsible?
They don't give a damn no, woah, they don't give a damn no
Talking down South Atlanta killings
Talking down South Deptford bombings
Talking down South Azania coming
They'll cut your hearts out and I'm not joking
Turn no blind eye brothers be willing
Yeah, the front line of the battle is hottest
Your duty's callingEmbed
