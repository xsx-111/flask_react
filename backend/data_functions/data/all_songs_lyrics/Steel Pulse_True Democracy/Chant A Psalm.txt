Chant A Psalm LyricsRejoice rejoice
Good tidings I bring you
Hear ye a message to you my friend
Voices cry invoke your angels
When pressure drop it cannot conquer dread no
So blow away your bluesy feeling
Spirits say take the world off you shoulder
One foot in the grave is a foolish step to take (dancer)
Who sow in tears shall reap in joy
Wise man doctrines assure your safety
No more stumbling block back stabbers get down
To the righteous revealed
The secret of the scriptures
The wicked dem portion is vanity
Disciples of Lucifer
In your hands lie your destination
The book of true life you hold the key
Mystical powers to you unfold
Seek ye the half that has never been told
Get behind me satan (in dis ya Armageddon)
I've got chant
CHORUS
------
Chant a psalm a day
Reach you in a vision yeh come on
Come walkies down easy street
Attract these angels in dreams and your prayers
Remember the three holy children
Remember the visions of Daniel
Remember the magic of Moses so
Dash away your bluesy feeling
Spirits say take the world off you shoulder
One foot in the grave my friend
A foolish step to take
When pressure drop it cannot conquer dread
Got to be wise yes yes in dis ya Iwa
Woe betide for the wicked
Disciples of Lucifer
Get behind me Satan (in dis ya Armageddon yeh)
I got to chant
