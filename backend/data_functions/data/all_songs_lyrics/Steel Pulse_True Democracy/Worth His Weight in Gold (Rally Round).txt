Worth His Weight in Gold (Rally Round) LyricsCHORUS
Rally round the flag
Rally round the red
Gold black and green
Marcus say sir Marcus say
Red for the blood
That flowed like the river
Marcus say sir Marcus say
Green for the land Africa
Marcus say
Yellow for the gold
That they stole
Marcus say
Black for the people
It was looted from
They took us away captivity captivity
Required from us a song
Right now man say repatriate repatriate
I and I patience have now long time gone
Father's mothers sons daughters every one
Four hundred million strong
Ethiopia stretch forth her hand
Closer to God we Africans
Closer to God we can
In our hearts is Mount Zion
Now you know seek the Lion
How can we sing in a strange land
Don't want to sing in a strange land no
Liberation true democracy
One God one aim one destiny
CHORUS
Rally round the flag
Remember when we used to dress like kings
Conqueror of land conqueror of seas
Civilization far moved from caves
Oppressor man live deh
I curse that day
The day they made us slaves I say
How can we sing in a strange land
Don't want to sing in a strange land
Liberation true democracy
One God one aim one destiny
CHORUS
Rally round the flag
Red gold black and green
A bright shining star--Africa
Catch star liner right now--Africa
A history no more a mystery--Africa
Respect and authority--Africa
Climb ye the heights of humanity
Rally come rally rally come rallyEmbed
