Big Science  LyricsOoo coo ooo coo coo it's cold outside
Ooo coo ooo coo coo it’s cold outside
Ooo coo ooo coo coo. Don't forget your mittens
Hey pal! How do I get to town from here?
And he said:
Well just take a right where they're going to build that new shopping mall
Go straight past where they’re going to put in the freeway
Take a left at what's going to be the new sports center
And keep going until you hit the place where
They're thinking of building that drive-in bank
You can't miss it. And I said: This must be the place
Ooo coo coo ooo. Golden cities. Golden towns
Golden cities. Golden towns
And long cars, in long lines and great big signs
And they all say: Hallelujah. Yodellayheehoo
Every man for himself. Ooo coo coo
Golden cities. Golden towns. Thanks for the ride
Big Science. Hallelujah. Big Science. Yodellayheehoo
You know, I think we should put some mountains here
Otherwise, what are the characters going to fall off of?
And what about stairs? Yodellayheehoo. Ooo coo coo ooo
Here's a man who lives a life of danger
Everywhere he goes, he stays - a stranger
Howdy stranger, mind if I smoke? And he said:
Every man, every man for himself
Every man, every man for himself
All in favor say aye
Big Science. Hallelujah. Big Science. Yodellayheehoo
Hey, Professor! Could you turn out the lights?
Let's roll the film
Big Science. Hallelujah
Every man, every man for himself
Big Science. Hallelujah. YodellayheehooEmbed
