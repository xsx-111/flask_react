The Big Top LyricsWhen Buckminster Fuller came to Canada, he kept asking the same question:
"Have you ever really considered how much your buildings weigh?"
The Canadians took this very seriously. (Hey, we never thought of that!)
He showed them plans for domed cities, cities with no basements, no foundations
Cities that could be moved in a minute
Portable cities
Portable towns
He said;
Think of it as camping out
Think of it as one big tent
He said:
Think of it as
The Big Top ... spinning ... lightweight ... portable
He said: Think of it as
The Big Top
Spinning ...
Lightweight ...
Flyaway ...
He said:
Think of it as the
