Loose Goose Lyrics
Fo shizzle, dizzle
(Down)
Fo shizzle, dizzle
(Down)
Fo shizzle, dizzle
(Down)
Fo shizzle, dizzle
(Down)


Well, here comes another MC
Tonight 
 special request to all of man 
Fo shizzle, drizzle
Ri-Ri-Right for my special request


Ballet, who says tres bon?
N'estâ€”ce pas?
Mais non?
Special request,  (Oola!)
Easy, easy, , easy
Easy, minor tear, easy, easy
Your heels are worn and your tou-tou's torn, yes, sir, yes, sir
Easy, take it easy
You think you're suave with your eye-brows shorn, no, sir, no, sir
In this ballyhoo, who says, "Sehr gut?"
Easy, take it easy (Nicht war?)
Slow down, down, down, down, down, down, slow down (Ach, nein?)
Wunder bar!
Fo shizzle, drizzle
(Down)
Fo shizzle, dizzleEmbed
