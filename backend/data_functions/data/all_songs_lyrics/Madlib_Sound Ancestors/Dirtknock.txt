Dirtknock LyricsHold it in your lungs
Turn it up
See how long I did that?
Um (Sure)
Mercy (Did that a couple of times)
How can I hope to be
Someone for you to see?
Blind as the fate decrees (Turn it up)
I will go on (Turn it up, turn it up)
Teaching myself to be (Turn it up)
The young untold (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
(Turn it up)
'Ting— (C'mon, see)
Blind as the fate decrees (Turn it up)
I will go on (Turn it up, turn it up)
Teaching myself to be (Turn it up)
The young untold (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
(Turn it up)
(Turn it up)
Am I in vain to— (Turn it up, turn it up)Embed
