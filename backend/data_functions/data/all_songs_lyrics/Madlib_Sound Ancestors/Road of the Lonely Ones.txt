Road of the Lonely Ones Lyrics
Now is the time
Now is the time
Right now

Where did I go wrong?
Can you tell me now?
Did I ever treat you bad?
Or did I ever do you wrong?
Or did I
I'd like to know the answer girl
Where did I go wrong?
I must've done something
I must've done something wrong
To be left with such a lonely song

Where did I go wrong?
Can you tell me now?
Did I ever treat you bad?
Or did I ever do you wrong?
Or did I
I'd like to know the answer girl
Where did I go wrong?
I must've donе something
I must've done somеthing wrong
To be left with such a lonely1Embed
