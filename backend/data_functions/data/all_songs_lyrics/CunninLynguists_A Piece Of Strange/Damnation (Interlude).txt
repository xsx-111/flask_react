Damnation (Interlude) Lyrics
The devil takes many colors and shapes
Walking through hell
The devil takes many colors and shapes
Walking through hell
The devil takes many colors and shapes
Walking through hell
The devil takes many colors and shapes
Walking through hell
The devil takes many colors and shapes
Walking through hell

Pull down the shutters, for damnation is near
Pull down the shutters, for damnation is near

Won't ya come and help me
Won't ya come and help me
Won't ya come and help me, Lord
Won't ya come and help me
Won't ya come and help me
Won't ya come and help me, Lord

Pull down the shutters for damnation is nearEmbed
