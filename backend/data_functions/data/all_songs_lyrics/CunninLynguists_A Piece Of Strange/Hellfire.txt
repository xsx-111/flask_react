Hellfire Lyrics
I am the god of hellfire and I bring you
I am the god of hellfire and I bring you
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
I'll see you burn, hellfire can't scorch me

Fire! Not obtained by propane or lighter
Not a man gon' contain these flames they burn higher, yell
Fire! and it's not on the roof, it's in the booth
Then spreads from the stage to the youth
Who all root for more
Fire! You can smell it in your clothes and your nose
See a hater closing his nose, we closing the doors
They gotta bounce, cause I learned
Where there's smoke there's fire
Similar to the streets, where there's spokes there's tires
Keep rollin like X poppers, see them flames
They gone need dental records to retrieve them names
Of course the sheer force'll scorch upon contact
Zippo flow, here we go, let's all cock back and fire!
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
I'll see you burn, hellfire can't scorch me

Fire! Melt Antarctica down
Evict polar bears, help bring art to the sound, spit
Fire! Like lit cigarettes in dry leaves
Goodbye, leave, or die whenever your eyes see
Fire! That burns like a wound with a pool of liquor
Running through it like a molten river
Imagine hell like it's a motion picture
Hopeless folks roasting like it's a joke but sicker
Try living with fire!
Not like water in mixed drinks
Forget rank when enemies challenging this tank
Fire! Murder, death, kill with the grill
You've heard the best, don't sit still as you feel this
Fire! Folks catch chills off the skill it's
The Vill, ill will, liquefy shields with
Fire! Too late, secure the perimeter
It'll enter ya soul you can't control the limits of
Fire!
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
Fire! Hellfire can't scorch me
I'll see you burn, hellfire can't scorch me1Embed
