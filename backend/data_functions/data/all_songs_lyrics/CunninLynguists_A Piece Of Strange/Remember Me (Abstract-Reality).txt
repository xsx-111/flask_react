Remember Me (Abstract/Reality) Lyrics
The abstract has become the reality
The abstract has become the reality
The abstract has become the reality


The abstract has become the reality
The abstract has become the reality


To the setting sun, to the setting sun
To the setting sun, to the setting sun
Remember me
Remember me


Easy for us to forget
Easy for us to forget
To the setting sun
Remember me, oh lord
Remember me, oh lordEmbed
