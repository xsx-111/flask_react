Thieves Lyrics
There's thieves among us
Painting the walls
With all kinds of lies, and lies
I never told it all

What's in my pocket?
You never knew
You didn't know me well
So well, as I knew you

And I know, and you know too
That a love like ours is terrible news
But that won't stop me crying
No, that won't stop me crying over you

I'm not a prophet
Old love is in me
New love just seeps right in
And, it makes me guilty

Why do you look like that?
It's not all that bad
I'll see you sometimes
Sometimes, lonely isn't sad
And I know, and you know too
That a love like ours is terrible news
But that won't stop me crying
No, that won't stop me crying over you (Uh)
No, that won't stop me crying over you

We two are makers
Just made this mess
Two broken hearts don't beat
Any less, oh
There's thieves among us
Painting the walls
With all kinds of lies, and lies
I never told it all

And I know, and you know too
That a love, like ours
Is terrible news
But that won't stop me crying

No, that won't stop me crying over you (uh)
No, that won't stop me crying over you (uh)
No, that won't stop me crying over you
You
