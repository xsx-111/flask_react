I Can Hear Music Lyrics
This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sounds of the city baby
Seem to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
I look at you, and we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sounds of the city baby
Seem to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near


I can hear music
I can hear music
The sounds of the city baby
Seem to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

I can hear music
I can hear music
I can hear musicEmbed
