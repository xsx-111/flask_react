Over It Over Again Lyrics
Why do I always want to sock it to you hard?
Let you know what love is like
When I'm keeping all my cards up on the shelf
Where you can't see them

Why do I always want to keep it to myself?
Taking advantage only works when
You're leaving someone else out in the dark
(I didn't mean to)

Running away from you (Is just like)
Is just like running a business (And I'm)
Keeping up with the games you play, every day

I've gotten over it over and over again
I've gotten over it over and over again
I've gotten sick of it, a lick of it will suck me back in
I've gotten over it over and over again

Running away from you (Is just like)
Running a business (And I'm)
Keeping up with the games you play, every day
I've gotten over it over and over again
I've gotten over it over and over again
I've gotten sick of it, a lick of it will suck me back in
I've gotten over it over and over againEmbed
