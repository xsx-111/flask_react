Lost: Season One Lyrics
How it always ends up like this
Two lovers staring at each other through a phone screen
Lost
For this, I really can’t find the time
Trying to keep running with my life, ‘cause if I stop
I’m lost

Hope you know where you are
I hope someone’s lent you their guitar
And I know you’re out feeling everything
And I’m in bed watching season one of Lost

Keep running to save face
We’re still living like dogs in space
Lost, with so little direction
Of course, I haven’t forgotten you
Such an impossible thing to do, but if I look back
I’m lost

Hope you know where you are
I hope you feel like you’ve gotten far
And maybe you were told you were special
One too many times and now you’re lost
Maybe I don’t get it, maybe I’ll never get it
Maybe I don’t get it, maybe I’ll never get it
Maybe I don’t get it, maybe I’ll never get it
Maybe I’ll never get it, maybe I’ll never get it
I’m just lost

Now it always ends up like this
It’s just me staring at couples across the street
And they look so clean and happy
But I don’t wanna end up like that
Going through the motions of lying in bed back-to-back
How it always ends up like that

I wanna be losers forever
Drink coffee in bed together
And not talk to anyone
And figure out what it is that we had lost
What it is that we had lost

Ah, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-ohEmbed
