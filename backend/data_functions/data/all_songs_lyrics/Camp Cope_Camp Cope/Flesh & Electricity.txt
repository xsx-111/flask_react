Flesh & Electricity Lyrics
Each day, I ride my bike to the hospital
Walk around, check vital signs, and pretend to be useful
Sometimes, though, I really don’t know what I’m doing here
My father says it’s atonement for my reckless years

Like the antagonist from that book
For that class that I once took

I’ve been desensitised to the human body
That I could look at you naked and all I’d see would be anatomy
You’re just bones and insecurity
Flesh and electricity to me

Each night, I try to find that feeling in my bed
The two-dimensional happiness
When you live your life through a camera lens
People stick together and they pull themselves apart
Dehydration, separation, like the chambers of my heart

And then the weight fell off like clothes
Never knowing where it goes
I’ve been desensitised to the human body
That I could look at you naked and all I’d see would be anatomy
You’re just bones and insecurity
Flesh and electricity to me

Tearing labels off your bottles
In a living room
Feeling nothing, wanting nothing
Because that part of me left with you
Now, I plan my day around
The eight and twelve medication rounds
There are no shocks or surprises
No, it’s nothing like that

‘Cause I've been desensitised to the human body
That I could look at you naked and all I’d see would be anatomy
You’re just bones and insecurity
Flesh and electricity like meEmbed
