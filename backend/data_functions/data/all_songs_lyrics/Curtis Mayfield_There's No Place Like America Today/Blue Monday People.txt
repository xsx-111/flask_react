Blue Monday People Lyrics
Some people feel so empty
All their problems and hurt of pride
You make me so happy, sweet baby
Love is by my side

Waking up now in the morning
A little morning sigh
Ready not to get it together
We know temptation
Don't tell the whole story
But you and me, baby
We have taken inventory

(Blue Monday people)
We Blue Monday people
And I know there's a few
(Blue Monday people)
I don't know your problems
Only you know how to solve them
(Blue Monday people)
When seasons are strong
Sometimes your life don't get along
(Blue Monday people)
But when cupboards are bare
Our love we can share
Truth is not the whole question
(Truth is not the whole question)
What is the answer you hide?
(Answer you hide)
The system need us
But it's trying to mislead us
They know this money don't feed us

Depression ain't just
Quite what you promised
Won't you, mister, be honest
Acting like a child
Sometimes we get wild
Right when the loving is strong
We don't want to get along
Don't have to listen to me
One day you may see

(Blue Monday people)
We Blue Monday people
Just trying in a strain
(Blue Monday people)
Life breaking our hearts
I'm so tired, it's a shame
(Blue Monday people)
This hustling affair
Ain't the way I even care
We'll be together in spite
Of the crimes of the night
Crimes of the night
Crimes of the night
Need someone to see me through
Need someone to comfort me
Sometimes you can let me be
Just let me be

Depression ain't just
Quite what you promised
Won't you mister be honest
Acting like a child
Sometimes we get wild
Right when the loving is strong
We don't want to get along
Don't have to listen to me
One day you may see

(Blue Monday people)
We Blue Monday people
And I know there's a few
(Blue Monday people)
I don't know your problems
Only you know hot to solve them
(Blue Monday people)
When seasons are strong
Sometimes your life don't get along
(Blue Monday people)
But when cupboards are bare
Our love we can share
(Blue Monday people)
We're Blue Monday people
(Blue Monday people)
We're Blue Monday people
(Blue Monday people)
Ah ah
(Blue Monday people)1Embed
