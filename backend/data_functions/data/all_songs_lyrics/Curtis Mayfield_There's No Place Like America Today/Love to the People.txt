Love to the People Lyrics
Well, fallin' in, out of the streets again
Unemployment lines, a lot of people standing in
News is bad on every TV show
So I tune in my radio, talkin' 'bout

Love to the people
Little bit of warning to the cold
Little bit of brotherhood
Guarantee it can be good for the soul

Well, nothing but beans on the table
Livin' the blues, paying the dues
I'm not hardly able
A lot of folks thay say there is no way
And don't look to another day
Well, there's another way

Love to the people
Little bit of warning to the cold
Little but of brotherhood
Guarantee it can be good for the soul
In the morning - it's alright
I'm not givin' up - this little pride
I got a lifetime - to keep livin' mine
The way you do it - is to get right to it
Sometimes I think before our life is gone
We'll see the kingdom come

Well, well, love to the people
Little bit of warning to the cold
Little but of brotherhood
Guarantee it can be good for the soul
Love to the people
Little bit of warning to the cold
Little but of brotherhood
Guarantee it can be good for the soul

Ah, ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah

In the morning - it's alright
I'm not givin' up - this little pride
I've got a lifetime - to keep a-livin' mine
The way you do it - is to get right to it
In the morning - it's alright
I'm not givin' up - this little pride
I've got a lifetime - to keep a-livin' mine
The way you do it - is to get right to itEmbed
