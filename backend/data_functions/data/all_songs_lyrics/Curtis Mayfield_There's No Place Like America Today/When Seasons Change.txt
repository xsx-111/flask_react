When Seasons Change LyricsWhen seasons change and we've again surpassed September
A lot of scars that kind of scare you to remember
Scufflin' times in seeing people trying to put you down
For goodness sakes
People trying to take what you know you've found
Stranded in someone else's neighborhood
Listening to the undertone
Lord! Sure makes it a blessing to know you got your own
Time makes you suffer when seasons change
Can't call no names when you got your own self to blame
Praying to Jesus make me a little stronger
So I might live the life a little bit longer
So many changes going in and out of my life
How can anyone survive
When everybody's been made a sacrifice
Look all around and see yourself so weak and so vulnerable
So you're trying to be strong but your money ain't too long
And it's so terrible
Don't you know if you want a good life
Best look into yourself
'Cause the world is cold and everybody's bold
And there's no one else
Time makes you suffer when seasons change
Can't call no names
When you got your own self to blame
Strain won't give me no satisfaction
Taxes are taking up a new collection
So many changes going in and out of my life
How can anyone survive
When everybody's been made a sacrifice
When seasons change and we've again surpassed September
A lot of scars that kind of scare you to remember
Scuf flin' times in seeing people trying to put you down
For goodness sakes
People trying to take what you know you've found2Embed
