Jesus LyricsMaybe the words I say is just another way to pray
I don’t know
Don’t think that I’m any saint ’cause
I can’t do nothin’ for you
I only asked of you just as I got to do myself
Look into your inner self only you know how to be
Free
If you wanna grin let it smile
Feel a little happy go on and dance a while
Can nobody play down God’s lovin’ child
‘Cause when the spirit hits you you got to move
And just as He made us one of many
Then aren’t the many of us maybe only one
Surely can you be the rising sun but
The depth of night the light for sight
Sort of sets the moral standards of soul
Gives you the strength to pay the price of life
And rewards you with a bit of fulfillment
The definition of true He is more real than you
Isn’t he?
Almighty Doctor must have been a heavenly man
JESUS!
Lot of inspiration all over this land Jesus
In spite of your fears you can shed happy tears
Jesus!
Don’t care what you call Him none can befall Him
Hear me say Amen! Amen! Amen! Hear me say
Amen!
Now stand up and clap your hands
Amen! Amen! Amen! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Travelin’ Soul the way the story goes
We all know He was crucified
But what He gave us never will die!
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time!
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
You need courage in time of fear
Because of undyin’ news you hear
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
Strength in time of new temptation
Don’t want to lose a love relation
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
And drinkin’ and drinkin’
The world I see before me is tryin’ to make me a slave
Jesus!
Than to see many children hungry
I’d rather go to my grave Jesus!
The lovin’ way of life
Has terribly been arranged Jesus!
Something’s mighty mighty wrong
And it seems awful strange
Just like a back up gear there are those in fear
Of falling near we who are already here
Look-a-here, look-a-here, look-a-here
You need courage in time of fear
Because of undyin’ news you hear
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
Strength in time of new relations
Don’t want to lose a love relation
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
And a...
