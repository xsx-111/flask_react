Always Be There LyricsFeed me hungry, feed me cold
When lines run deep and when I'm old
(Doo-wap Doo-ba-doo-wap oh yeh)
Will you be there for me?
Will you always be there?
Will you always be there?
Fear of loneliness on a lonely planet
Fear of having it all and then not to have it there
Feed me with affection every day
Will you always be there?
There for me?
(Will you always be there?
Will you always be there?)
Bathed in the celestial bloom of your embrace
Let's play with the stars
This is our universeEmbed
