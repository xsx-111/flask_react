Gemilude LyricsFor all it's worth
I've been jackin' in the basement from birth
Never really knew it
Until I started walking to earth
While feelings inside me
Got me here rhyming
Escape to my hotel room doing time there
I'm thankful for that
I'm in the studio with Basement Jaxx
(Yeah, funky!)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Gemini? That's right
Gemini...
Gemini?
Gemini...
Yeah...Embed
