Red Alert LyricsRed alert! Red alert! It's a catastrophe
But don't worry
Don't panic
Ain't nothin' goin' on but history, yeah
But it's alright
Don't panic
And the music keeps on playin' on and on
And the music keeps on playin' on and on
Red alert! Red alert! It's a catastrophe
But don't worry
Don't panic
Ain't nothin' goin' on but history, yeah
But it's alright
Don't panic
And the music keeps on playin' on and on
And the music keeps on playin' on and on
On and on
On and on
And the music keeps on playing on and on
On and on
On and on
And the music keeps on playing on and on
The way you shake, shake, shake, shake
The way you shake, shake, shake, shake
Baby
Yippie-yay-yay-yay-yo
Yippie-yay-yay-yay-yo
Yippie-yay-yay-yay-yo
Yippie-yay-yay-yay-yo
On and on
On and on
And the music keeps on playin' on and on
And the music keeps on playin' on and on
And the music keeps on playin' on and on
And the music keeps on playin' on and onEmbed
