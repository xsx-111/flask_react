The Devil Had A Hold Of Me LyricsNow I was just a girl of two
Now I was just a girl of two
With a golden heart and a button shoe
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me
There was something wrong with the butcher's boy
Was something wrong with the butcher's boy
He trembled in his hand and voice
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
The others knew to let him be
But the devil had a hold of me
Now the tailpipe spit and the engine roared
The tailpipe spit and the engine roared
I's waving out the Plymouth door
And the devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
The old folks saw the last they'd see
The devil had a hold of me
I dreamed last night that my time was done
I dreamed last night that my time was done
And my soul flew up to the holy son
But the devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I snapped back down when he pulled my lead
The devil had a hold of me
There're those who'll laugh and not believe
There're those who'll laugh and not believe
Until you feel that touch upon your sleeve
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of meEmbed
