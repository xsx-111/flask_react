Caleb Meyer Lyrics
Caleb Meyer, he lived alone
In them hollarin' pines
And he made a little whiskey for himself
Said it helped to pass the time

Long one evening in back of my house
Caleb come around
And he called my name 'til I came out
With no one else around

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains
But when I go to sleep at night
Don't you call my name

Where's your husband, Nellie Kane
Where's your darling gone?
Did he go on down the mountain side
And leave you all alone?

Yes, my husband's gone to Bowlin' Green
To do some business there
Then Caleb threw that bottle down
And grabbed me by my hair
Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains
But when I go to sleep at night
Don't you call my name

He threw me in a needle bed
Across my dress he lay
Then he pinned my hands above my head
And I commenced to pray

I cried My God, I am your child
Send your angels down
Then feelin' with my fingertips
The bottle neck I found

I drew that glass across his neck
As fine as any blade
Then I felt his blood pour fast and hot
'Round me where I lay

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains
But when I go to sleep at night
Don't you call my name
Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains
But when I go to sleep at night
Don't you call my nameEmbed
