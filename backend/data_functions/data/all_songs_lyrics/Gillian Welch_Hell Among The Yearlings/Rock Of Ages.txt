Rock Of Ages LyricsRound, round, I wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
When my body gives out
Gonna read the final pages
Oh, my mother who's gone
She told me I should meet her
Someday streets of gold
Gonna guide me on to greet her
Once my father sat down
And told me of the prophets
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
They're gone but not forgotten
Round, round, I wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
Til my body gives out
Gonna read the gospel pages
Moses heard a voice
It called him up the mountain
Forty days had set
When Moses come a shoutin'
Round, round, I wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
When my body gives out
Gonna read the final pages
Round, round, I wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
Til my body gives out
Gonna read the gospel pages
Round, round, I wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
When my body gives out
Gonna read the final pagesEmbed
