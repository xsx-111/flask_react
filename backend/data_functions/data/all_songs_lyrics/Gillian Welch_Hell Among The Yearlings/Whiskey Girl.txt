Whiskey Girl LyricsNowhere man
And the whiskey girl
Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
They loaded up for
A weekend in the underworld
I'd take you down
Honey if I could
I'd take you down
Honey if I could
We'd find a place
In the sunshine
We'd be feeling good
Don't you know
That it ain't a crime
Don't you know
That it ain't a crime
If all the squares
And the junkmen
Think you're out of line
Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
Nowhere man and
The whiskey girl
They loaded up for
A weekend in the underworldEmbed
