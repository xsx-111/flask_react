Good Til Now LyricsBalled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Goodbye, darling, I been good till now
I went walking with a girl as pure as milk
I went walking with a girl pure as milk
Standing on the corner, sweating through a yellow silk
Rocks in my pocket and a devil on my back
Rocks in my pockets and a devil on my back
You won't even come across the tracks
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Goodbye, darling, I been good till nowEmbed
