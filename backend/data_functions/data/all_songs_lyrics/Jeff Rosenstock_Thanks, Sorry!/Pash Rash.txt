Pash Rash LyricsI've been doing this for half my years;
I've been mouthing off in bars, trading shame for self-respect
My trajectory is crystal clear
I can see it in the stars that frame the shame above my neck
That frame the shame above my neck
And the sky is always pitch black
When I sneak away, I only wanna come back and see your face, see your face again
I want to listen to The Cribs, my dear, while we make out in your car
And fuck the haters who object -- they've overrated self-respect
The sky is always pitch black when I sneak away
I only wanna come back to see your face, to see your face again
To see your face, to see your face again
Not borne on beams from outer space through AMOLED displays
To see your face, to see your face again5Embed
