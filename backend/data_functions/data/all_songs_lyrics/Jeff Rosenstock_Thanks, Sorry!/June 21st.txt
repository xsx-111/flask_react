June 21st LyricsGone
It's beautiful out there
There's nothing I'd rather do
Than slay the nightmare
Arm in arm with you
I didn't leave the house all day
For the last thirty Saturdays
It's time to trade the darkness for a view
Because it's June 21st
And this winter was the worst we've ever seen
But we made it through the freeze
And now it's June 21st
And this winter was the worst we've ever seen
Now it's 84 degrees foreverEmbed
