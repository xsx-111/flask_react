Festival Song Lyrics
It feels completely ridiculous
That I'm a willing participant
Gazing at the purples and pinks
In the shadow of a bank-sponsored skyline
"Unite against the establishment!"
While drones transmit the images
To a server farm in the valley
For a culture that'll eat its own insides

Oh, they wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if it wasn't worth it
If you didn't have something they could take

A long look at the billboards
That smother the air till you can't ignore 'em
And glamorize department store crust-punk-chic
'Cause Satan's trending up and it's fashion week
But this is not a movement, it's just careful entertainment
For an easy demographic in our sweatshop denim jackets
And we'll wonder, "What just happened?"
When the world becomes Manhattan
Where the banks steal the apartments just to render them abandoned
Oh, they wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if it wasn't worth it
If you didn't have something they could take

We're not stupid people, but this financial oppression
Has got everyone believing all that we can do is nothing
'Cause we organize through avenues they lace with advertisements
So the ones we try to rage against are still lining their pockets

Oh, they wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if you weren't worth something
They wouldn't be your friend if it wasn't worth it
If you didn't have something they could take5Embed
