Live From New York! Lyrics
Well, I forgot my fuckin' setlist, so we're off to a good start
Thank you so much for coming, uh

What's up everybody who travel from far away, to be here again or if its for the first time? Umm this is, this is cool
We're lucky to be doing this, really appreciate it, thanks everybody for being here
Leeeeettttssss go
