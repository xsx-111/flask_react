You, in Weird Cities Lyrics
Philip's living up in Chicago
Matty's working hard in Ohio
Fitzy and Chris are very far away
Sean, Ian and Rick are in Michigan
And we try to see each other whenever we can
But there's only so many days that we can stay
I'm always getting high
When no one is around
'Cause nothing makes me feel
Anything's worthwhile
Nothing makes me happy
I'm like a bratty child
Nothing makes me laugh
Nothing makes me smile

Some of my friends are good Americans
How can they empathize with the trouble that I'm in?
I don't have to wake up, I don’t have to feed a kid
And it's got to the point where I'm not sure if that's something I wanted
Instead of getting high
When no one is around
'Cause nothing makes me feel
Anything's worthwhile
Nothing makes me happy
I'm like a shitty child
Nothing makes me laugh
Nothing makes me smile
But when I listen to your records
I don’t need to look at pictures
It’s like I’m hanging out with you

In weird cities
Getting lost, and pretending
That we’ll never go back
We’ll never go back
You, laughing with me
Getting lost in weird cities
Like we’ll never go back
We’ll never go back

To always getting high
When no one is around
‘Cause nothing makes me feel
Anything’s worthwhile
Nothing makes me happy
I’m like a shitty child
Nothing makes me laugh
Nothing makes me smile

But when I listen to your records
It’s like I’m hanging out with you, you, you, you
When I listen to your records
It’s like I’m hanging out with you
Listen to your tunes
Like I'm there with you
When I listen to your tunes
It's like I'm there with you

I wanna hang out with you
I wanna hang out with you
I wanna hang out with you
I wanna hang out with you
I wanna hang out with you
You
You
