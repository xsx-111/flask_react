Craig Of The Creek
Who's gonna help when the danger overwhelms
And the mysteries are piled high?
Who's gonna be around, never gonna let you down
When you're on a wild ride?
Your friends are always by your side
It's Craig of the Creek, he's gonna save the day
It's Craig of the Creek, he's gonna save the day
It's Craig of the CreekEmbed
