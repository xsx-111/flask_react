The Internet Is Everywhere. LyricsI want you to know I'm glad you're not dead
All the hate in my heart has gone out of my head
It took me some time but I understand
That I made enemies where I should have stayed friends
'Cause it's way too much work to hate your old friends
I want you to know that I'll be alright
If you feel like I do and you're over the fight
Sure, there are times when I can't get by
But show me a person who always feels fine
And I'll show you a lying sack of shit
But oh, I know
I wouldn't think about me too
But the smallest things make me remember you
And it's hard when I know we were such good friends
And it's hard when I know that we can never be friends
There are nights when I miss my friends
When I look through old pictures
Think about you again
And I hope that you're happy that I'm not dead
And we both ended up kinda okay in the end1Embed
