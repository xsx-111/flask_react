HELLLLHOOOOLE Lyrics
They would pluck us from the lives we're living
With no fucks given and profit from the pain
Forcing you and I to feel like children
Cause if they didn't, we wouldn't be too scared to say that

We don't wanna live inside a hellhole
And waste our energy on all these assholes
We don't wanna live inside a hellhole

I've gone to the platform, spent a long time waiting
With ceilings dripping as mice run through the rain
Why do we accept the hand we're given?
The dealer's grinning, she knows we're terrified of change

But we don't have to live inside a hellhole
And give our money to some fucking asshole
We don't wanna live inside a hellhole

I'm gone
I'm gone
We don't wanna live inside a hellhole
I'm-Embed
