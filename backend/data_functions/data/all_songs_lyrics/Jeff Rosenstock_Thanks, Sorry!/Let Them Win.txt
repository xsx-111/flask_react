Let Them Win LyricsThey can kick us in the knees
They can push us in the trees again
They can roll their eyes
They can criticize, oh yeah
They can hang us out to dry
They can profit from their lies again
They can shake our souls
They can send us home, oh yeah
We’re not gonna let them win, oh no
We’re not gonna let them win, oh no
They can make us feel afraid
And try to turn it into hate, oh yeah
They can steal our slice
For the hundredth time
Judge us when we cry
And never empathize
With anyone but themselves
We’re not gonna let them win, oh no
We’re not gonna let them win, oh no
They’re not gonna win
They’re not gonna win
Again
Again
Again
Again
They'll sic us on each other
To displace our power
But it won’t happen again
Not again
Not again
Not again
They’re not gonna win
They’re not gonna win
Again
Again
Again
Again
We’re not gonna let them win
We’re not gonna let them win
Fuck noEmbed
