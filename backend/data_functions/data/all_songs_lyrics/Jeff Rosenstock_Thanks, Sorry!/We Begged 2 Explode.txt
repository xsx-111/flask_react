We Begged 2 Explode LyricsSomeone's gonna bleed and dribble trails in the snow
Stretching to the bus from an overstuffed home
We begged to explode
Laura said to me, "This decade's gonna be fucked
Friends will disappear after they fall in love (Fall in love)
Fall in love and get married
Isn't that shit like, crazy?
The workin', havin' babies and promotions?
The cheatin', cryin', leavin', and divorcin'?"
As we're bouncing up and down trying to make the floor break
Stop sneering at our joy like it's a careless mistake
You fuckheads complain because you like to complain
Like I blame rock and roll when it's just the champagne
That keeps me detaching from reality
Just waiting for someone to come and save me
Won't somebody fucking please come and save me?
Oh please, hurry up, someone, come and save me
From all these magic moments I've forgotten
All these magic moments I've forgotten
On a weary floor that can’t support all of us
In a giddy haze and dancing carpet to dust
All these magic moments I’ve forgotten
All these magic moments I’ve forgotten
All these magic moments I’ve forgotten
All these magic moments I’ll forget once the magic is gone3Embed
