Perfect Sound Whatever LyricsWhen I'm aching for their respect
I won't abandon anything
When I'm shaken awake by regrets
I'll try to just get back to sleep
Perfect always takes so long
Because it don't exist
Perfect always takes so long
Because it don't exist
It doesn't exist
Next time I see you
I'll find better words than I'm sorry
(I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!)
Perfect always takes so long
Because it don't exist
Perfect always takes so long
Because it don't exist
It doesn't exist
It doesn't exist
It doesn't exist
It doesn't exist3Embed
