KKK Hiway Lyrics
Did you know that the KKK adopted a highway?
Just a few miles away from my mom's house
They paid their money and they put up a sign
I guess they dress up in sheets and go pick up the trash
The trash, the trash, they pick up the trash
The trash, the trash, they pick up the trash
They should know it when they see it
They get a good look every day in the mirror
They get a good look every day in the mirror

Thanks!Embed
