9/10 Lyrics
Every night you go to bed
You wake up just a little more in pain
Every time you’re dressing for a sunny day
The clouds surprise you with rain
Every cigarette you smoke
‘Cause you’re addicted to a quiet source of company
Every time you told ‘em you were busy
‘Cause you’d rather go to sleep

Nine times out of ten I’ll be stoned on the subway
Reading backlit directives of what I should do
Dodging eye contact with anyone who looks my way
Nine times out of ten I’ll be thinking of you

Every little victory don’t matter
When nobody seems to care
Winning ten bucks on a scratch-off lotto ticket
The keys you thought disappeared
Every vacant moment you’ve exhausted all the options
That you thought could fill the hole
Every star you’re wishing on
Just hoping for a little self-control
You're tired of feeling selfish
You're tired of feeling restless
You're tired of feeling down
Nine times out of ten I’ll be stoned on the subway
Reading backlit directives of what I should do
Dodging eye contact with anyone who looks my way
Nine times out of ten I’ll be thinking of you

I’m so out of place
When I can’t be with you
If I don’t see your face
It’s almost like I missed you
Don’t see your face
It’s almost like I missed you
It’s almost like I miss you
It’s almost like I miss you

Nine times out of ten I’ll be stoned on the subway
Reading backlit directives of what I should do
Dodging eye contact with anyone who looks my way
Nine times out of ten I’ll be thinking of you1Embed
