Bonus Oceans LyricsYeah, I got friends who wanna catch up on old times
But that just makes me feel ashamed to be me
And I, I've got friends who wanna relive the past
And deify memories
And they just scream to me
That if you don't die young, you're gonna live too long
If you don't die young, you're gonna live too long
You're gonna live too long
On the stoop of the apartment next to my shitty job
An old friend passed me on the street today
I said, "Hello," and tried to catch up on old times
She walked the other way
Maybe I seemed to scream
That if I got cancer or somebody shot me
I'd be like a child or something
Asking doctors to do me favors
Or cross my fingers and hope it gets better
Like a broken record, I seem to scream
That if you don't die young, you're gonna live too long
Yeah, if you don't die young, you're gonna live too long
I was getting drunk in a foreign ocean
And trying to wrap my head around problems
And all my bitterness just seemed passe
Because I realized as soon as I said it
How long it'd take to swim from Jones Beach to Indonesia
And maybe you're waiting on a call from me
And maybe you're working in a crowded restaurant
And you're the one who's got a life so fucked up
That you don't know what happened
Just like you saw me working at some restaurant
Embarrassed 'cause my life was just so fucked up
And I don't know how it happened1Embed
