Stranger in a Strange Land Lyrics
Was many years ago that I left
Home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me
That all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem

No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends
From home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me

Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone
And men again they came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying
Where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see

No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place, so all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home


What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place, so all alone
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison...2Embed
