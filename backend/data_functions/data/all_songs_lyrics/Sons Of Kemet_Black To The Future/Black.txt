Black Lyrics
Black is tired
Black would like to make a statement
Black is tired
Black's eyes are vacant
Black's arms are leaden
Black's tongue cannot taste shit
Black's stomach cannot compress death
And black would like to state that black is not a beast of myth
To be slain in a fable
Recounted atop a round table
Surrounded by blue-collared brave men
Black has demands
Black demands baton-proof bones and bullet-resistant skin
Black thinks no person that's trigger nervous deserves a gun
Much less a badge
And black knows one day its arms will be up
Its lips pinned, its shadow
Its shadow will be reaching for something
That isn't there and then that'll be enough
Black says "keep your forty acres
Just let black reach for the end of the street
Let black weed for the last  wheat
Just let black reach into black's own car
Let let black reach into black's own lungs"
Black doesn't want its young ones seeing their fathers dead on YouTube
Girls in halfway  just to keep them alive
Black says its always been like this
It's you who's late to walk
And black has seen your grin
Your grin is a cutlass flag
And black's eyes are bleeding
From gripping the knife-edge you offered on your side of the handshake
Go write your thoughts and prayers on a piece of paper
Fling it at the moon, see what that will do
You call for calm, you call for peace
Like sacrifices on mountain peaks
He doesn't end the palaver
But he come at the top, where the negus still in lava
Black is angry now
Black as the day
And black's snare is a firefly dancing in grief
A curseword trapped in a bracket
A sentence too intense for one full stop
Black says that you don't understand
Black says that you cannot compare
Black says that its pain is too 
Black says that you cannot digest
Black says "how can you relate?"
When these black limbs are 
And this black blaze is dance
This black sorrow is dance
These black prayers is dance
This black struggle is dance
This black pain is dance
This black struggle is dance
And this black blaze is dance
Just leave black be
You already have the world, just leave black be
Leave us alone!Embed
