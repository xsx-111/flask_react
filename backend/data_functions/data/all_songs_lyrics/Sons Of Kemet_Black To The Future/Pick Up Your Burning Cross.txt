Pick Up Your Burning Cross Lyrics

I don't think you remember me
I was in the last place, lost the race
Oh my yah yah yee
Paid the cost, stole the fee
The crimes and the lies of a ghetto enterprise
I don't think you remember me
I don't think you remember me
I was in the last place, lost the race
Oh my yah yah yee
Paid the cost, stole the fee
The crimes and the lies of a ghetto enterprise
Oh yah yah yah yee

I don't think you rеmember me
Pick up ya burning cross
Pick up thе pace
Roscoe and Moye
Improv on the page
Ain't no end
Just hell and wageEmbed
