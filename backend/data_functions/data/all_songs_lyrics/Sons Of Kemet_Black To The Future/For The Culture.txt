For The Culture Lyrics
Oh my gawd!
Check
Yeah!
Bluku Bluku!
Jeesh!

She got  in a 
She's got my back to the wall
She nearly made me fall
She made me nearly look a fool
You gotta make her get low
You gotta go with the flow
A-make her wine down low
A-make her wine down

Yo, I'm looking for the dancehall queen
Called Beverly, Chantelle and Shareen
Open the door, no, tell 'em come in
 the officer if we call them in
Cah the way they body look it's like a dancеhall dream
And she a-mash up the dancеhall scene
See the gal there, you see what we mean
Jesus, you see what we mean
Check
Yeah
Yo, I'm looking for the dancehall queen
Called Beverly, Chantelle and Shareen
Open the door, no, tell 'em come in
 the officer if we call them in
Cah the way they body look it's like a dancehall dream
And she a-mash up the dancehall scene
See the gal there, you see what we mean
Jesus, you see what we mean

Me have me money, yeah me have me 
 all the  medication all you mean
When the mandem say, "man can't smoking at the door"
Tiptoe talking at the dance
Fun time I step in the dance
Beautiful gal I won't make an advance
Beautiful gal I want more than a dance
Kingston, Jamaica 
Becoming bruck up on a gal by the name of Jesus
Yeah!
Called Lisa, Leanne and Nadine
Called Beverly, Chantelle and Shareen

Yo, I'm looking for the dancehall queen
Called Lisa, Leanne and Nadine
Open the door, no, tell 'em come in
 the officer if we call them in
Cah the way they body look it's like a dancehall dream
And she a-mash up the dancehall scene
See the gal there, you see what we mean
Jesus, you see what we mean
She got  in a 
She's got my back to the wall
She nearly made me fall
She made me nearly look a fool
You gotta make her get low
You gotta go with the flow
An' make her wine down low
An' make her wine down

Cah I'm looking for the dancehall queen
Called Beverly, Chantelle and Shareen
Open the door, no, tell 'em come in
 the officer if we call them in
Cah the way they body look it's like a dancehall dream
And she a-mash up the dancehall scene
See the gal there, you see what we mean
Jesus, you see what we meanEmbed
