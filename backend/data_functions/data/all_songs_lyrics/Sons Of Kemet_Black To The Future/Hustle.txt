Hustle Lyrics

I've been doing mileage with my phone on silent
Hear no, see no, felt the violence
God got my blessings on auto pilot
Why ain't no one tell me peace of mind was pricey?
I could dance with the devil but that's unlikely
Might go broke but that's unlike me
I was born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me

Feeding my soul
I go make nothing something
Show you my lows
I don't feeling nothing, nothing
We're all here for show
Now watch me go show you something
Feeding my soul
I go makе nothing something

Born from the mud with the hustlе inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
You could test my spirit, just not today
I got demons on my back and a lot on my plate
Someone tell 'em back back, I got something to say
First they love you, then they hate you, then it's part of the game
They cannot — I ain't nothing to play with
Took my niggas off the block, pulled my negus off slave ships
You can test my spirit, but don't test my patience
I only fear god and you can meet thy maker
I've been

Feeding my soul
I go make nothing something
Show you my lows
I don't feeling nothing, nothing
We're all here for show
Now watch me go show you something
We're all here for show
Now watch me go

Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
You don't need to pose and posture
When you born in the struggle
I know a negus with a needle that could burst all your bubble
These peace signs are just a piece of the puzzle
Spit to the muzzle
Silence the lambs
Kiss and they cuddle
Forget that they cut you
It's just part of the hustle

Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud with the hustle inside me
Born from the mud
