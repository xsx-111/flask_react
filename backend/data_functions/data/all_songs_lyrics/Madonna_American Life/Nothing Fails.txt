Nothing Fails Lyrics
I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you? You silly thing
Just take it from me
It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, nothing fails
I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved, mmm
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray (But I feel so moved, mmm)
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray (Pray)
(I'm not religious) I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna pray)
But I feel so moved, mmm
I'm not religious (I'm not religious) (But it makes me wanna pray)
Makes me wanna pray (Makes wanna pray)
I'm not religious
But I feel so moved, mmm (Makes me wanna pray)
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray (Makes me wanna)

Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears
