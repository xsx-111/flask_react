Hollywood Lyrics
Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood

There's something in the air in Hollywood
The sun is shining like you knew it would
You're ridin' in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and it feels so good

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

I lost my memory in Hollywood
I've had a million visions, bad and good
There's something in the air in Hollywood
I tried to leave it, but I never could
Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood

There's something in the air in Hollywood
I've lost my reputation, bad and good
You're riding in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and you feel so good

Music stations always play the same song
I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
Check it out
This bird has flown

Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
