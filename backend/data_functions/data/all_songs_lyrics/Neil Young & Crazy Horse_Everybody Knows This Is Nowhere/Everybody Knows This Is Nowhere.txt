Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere Lyrics
I think I'd like to go back home and take it easy
There's a woman that I'd like to get to know, living there

Everybody seems to wonder what it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
La la la, la la la la
Everybody, everybody knows, everybody knows (La la la, la la la la)
Oh yeah

Every time I think about back home, it's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there right now just passing time

Everybody seems to wonder what it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
La la la, la la la la
Everybody knows (La la la, la la la la)
Everybody knows (La la la, la la la la)
Everybody knows, everybody, everybody knows (La la la, la la la la)
Oh yeah
Everybody knows, everybody knows (La la la, la la la la)
Oh, yeah, ooh (La la la, la la la la)
Ooh, ooh (La la la, la la la la)
Everybody knows, everybody knows (La la la, la la la la)
Ooh (La la la, la la la la)
La la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la laEmbed
