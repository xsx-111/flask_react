Cowgirl in the Sand Lyrics

Hello, cowgirl in the sand (Hello, cowgirl in the sand)
Is this place at your command
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet sweet smile?

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game


Hello, ruby in the dust (Hello, ruby in the dust)
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hopin' that we turn back

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

Hello, woman of my dreams (Hello, woman of my dreams)
Is this not the way it seems?
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game
