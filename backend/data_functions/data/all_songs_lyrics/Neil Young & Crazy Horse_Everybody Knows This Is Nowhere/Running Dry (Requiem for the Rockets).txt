Running Dry (Requiem for the Rockets) Lyrics
Oh, please help me, oh please help me
I'm livin' by myself
I need someone to comfort me
I need someone to tell

I'm sorry for the things I've done
I've shamed myself with lies
But soon these things are overcome
And can't be recognized

I left my love with ribbons on
And water in her eyes
I took from her the love I'd won
And turned it to the sky

I'm sorry for the things I've done
I've shamed myself with lies
My cruelty has punctured me
And now I'm running dry

I'm sorry for the things I've done
I've shamed myself with lies
But soon these things are overcome
And can't be recognized

I'm sorry for the things I've done
I've shamed myself with lies
But soon these things are overcome
And can't be recognizedEmbed
