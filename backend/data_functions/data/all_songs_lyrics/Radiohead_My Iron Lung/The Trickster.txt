The Trickster Lyrics
Rust in the mountains, rust in the brain
The air is sacred here in spite of your claim
Up on the the rooftops, out of reach
Trickster is meaningless, trickster is weak

He's talking out the world, talking out the world

Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

I wanted you so bad, that I couldn't say
All things fall apart
We wanted out so bad, that we couldn't say
These things fall apart

We're talking out the world, talking out the world

Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Truant kids, a can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from their chestnut tree
Long white gloves, police check carefully
Escaped from the zoo, the perfect child facsimile is

Talking out the world, talking out the world

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey2Embed
