Lewis (Mistreated) Lyrics
Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it, don't jump
Changed shape to fit, in the end, you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey, don’t do it, don't jump

Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really mattered

We never noticed, we never understood
He just get crushed to fit, he never even smiled at the best
It's the best, it’s the best day of your life

Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really matters
No, I swear, I swear, I swear
Oh, mistreated, a low corporate
Mistreated, a low corporate

I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis2Embed
