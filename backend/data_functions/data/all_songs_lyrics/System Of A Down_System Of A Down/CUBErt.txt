CUBErt Lyrics
Preflight delight
Defaced street lights
A pyramid mind fuck
Don't leave your seats now

Popcorn everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Corn everywhere canned
Cliché people cannot dare, dare, dare, dare

I want to be
A fallen ruby
Guest vibrations
Don't leave your seats now

Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people cannot dare, dare, dare, dare

Dare, dare
Dare, dare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people cannot dare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people cannot dare, dare, dare, dare5Embed
