Peephole Lyrics
When your stars are-
And your rivers fly
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky
When your-

When your stars are baked and your rivers fly
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky
When your castle breaks and your feet are dry
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky

Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried

Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high

When your moon is fake and your mermaids cry
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky
When your tunnel fades and your guide is shy
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky
Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried

Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high

Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high2Embed
