Mind Lyrics
Oh, baby, come close to me
Let me love you
Oh, baby, come close to me
Let me feel you
Look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other

Go away, go away
Go away, go away!

Well now mutually, mentally molested children of a Mother
Mutually, mentally molested children of Sin
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that took you under
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that broke your skin

Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame! Hate!
For Fate's Seed!
Go away, go away
Go away, go away!
Now, you need the ones you love and love the ones that you need
Need the ones you love and love the ones you bleed
Lives rearranged and lives in my range, can you see?
Lives rearranged and lives in my range, can you see?

Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame! Hate!
For Fate's Seed!

Die! Die! Die! Die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!

Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other9Embed
