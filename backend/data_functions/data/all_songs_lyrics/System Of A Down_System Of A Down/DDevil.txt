DDevil Lyrics
Plagiarized existence exist among the writers of the word
Shake your spear at Shakespeare, shake your spear at Shakespeare

Loud and noisy, strong refrigerators
Gaining independence, gaining independence

Stupid people do stupid things, smart people outsmart each other
Then themselves, then themselves, then themselves, then themselves

Take me down there, photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy, the devil is so lovely

The devil is so lovely
The devil is so lovely
So lovely, so lovely

My blue moon rivets in exits, forewarned customary spirits
By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself

Take me down there, photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy, the devil is so lovely
Take me down there, photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy, the devil is so lovely6Embed
