War? Lyrics
Dark is the light, the man you fight with all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold this bounty soul, a gentile or a priest?
Who victored over the Seljuks when the holy land was taken?

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

Was it the riches of the land, powers of bright darkness
That lead the nobles to the East to fight the heathens

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it
No International security, no call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill a man, history teaches us so
The reason he must attain must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens5Embed
