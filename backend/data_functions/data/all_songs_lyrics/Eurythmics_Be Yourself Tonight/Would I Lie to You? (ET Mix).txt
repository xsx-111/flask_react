Would I Lie to You? (ET Mix) LyricsWould I lie to you? Would I lie to you
Honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you
Sugar
Would I lie to you?
My friends know what's in store
I won't be here anymore
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor
Watch we walkin'
Walkin' out the door
Believe me
I'll make it
Make it
Believe me
I'll make it
Make it
Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you
Honey? . . 
Tell you straight
No intenrention
To your face
No deception
You're the biggest fake
That much is true
Had all I can take
Now I'm leaving you
Believe me
I'll make it
Make it
Oh yes
I will
Believe me
I'll make it
Make it
Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you
Honey? . . 
Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you
Honey? . ..
My friends know what's in store
I won't be here anymore. . . 
Believe me
Watch me
Watch me -
Believe me
Watch me
Watch me
Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you?Embed
