Conditioned Soul (Live) LyricsWhen will you make up your mind?
When will you make up your mind?
Darling just be yourself tonight
There's nothing wrong with the way you feel
The moon and stars are in the sky
We're centuries apart and the lights are shining down on you
Ah ah, conditioned soul
When will you make up your mind?
(I can't stand it)
When will you make up your mind?
(I can't stand it)
Everybody's kissing someone
Holding hands just to get some fun
I couldn't care less if I ever get none
Or never fall into some lover's arms again
(I can't stand it)
Ah ah, conditioned soul
Ah ah, ah ah, conditioned soul
Darling don't be afraid tonight
Something's wrong with the way you feel
The moon and stars have all gone by
We're centuries apart and the lights are dying
Everybody's hurting someone
Stabbing back just to get some fun
I hope to God I don't get me none
Or never fall into some killer's arms again
I can't stand it
I can't stand it, no, no, no
I can't stand it, oh no
I can't stand itEmbed
