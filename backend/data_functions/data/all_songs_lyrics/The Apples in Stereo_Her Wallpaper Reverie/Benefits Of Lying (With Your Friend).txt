Benefits Of Lying (With Your Friend) Lyrics
Everything I say
Falls away
Like the fade on the radio song
And everything I try
Passed me by
Like the tide seems to rise, then it's gone

Still there's something to be said
For company in bed this time of morning
See? I knew we'd agree
How can anyone deny
The benefits of lying with your friend
We'll try it again

Sometimes when I'm by myself
I can't find myself
And there's no one there
Sometimes I can see myself
I can be myself
With a friend now

Every day I rub
Both my eyes
And my mind fills with complications
And everywhere I go
Passed by slow
Fading moments and aspirations
Still there's something to be said
For company in bed this time of morning
See? I knew we'd agree
How can anyone deny
The benefits of lying with your friend
We'll try it again

Sometimes when I'm by myself
I can't find myself
And there's no one there
Sometimes I can be myself
I can see myself
With a friend, now
A friend, now-ow

I'll never know you
Like you know yourself
You'll never know me
Like I know myself
I'll never know you
Like you know yourself
You'll never know me
Like I know myself
I'll never know you
Like you know yourself
You'll never know me
Like I know myself
I'll never know you
Like I know myself
You'll never know me
Like you know yourself1Embed
