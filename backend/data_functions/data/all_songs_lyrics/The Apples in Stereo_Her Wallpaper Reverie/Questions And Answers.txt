Questions And Answers Lyrics
Forty years and still seems everything's okay
Just ask a question that will make it go away
You still can't change it with the waving of your hand
It comes to mean that everything is surely planned

They're sending me a picture of the moon
And star-mapped skies for travelers in tune
With all that falls beneath us from the sky
Be steady light, shine bright behind my eyes

Answer the question:
Is it straight or in a line?
Or still a spiral not aware of such a sign
And with the gravity that seems to pull us down
There is awareness to align us with the ground

They're sending me a picture of the moon
And star-mapped skies for travelers in tune
With all that falls beneath us from the sky
Be steady light, shine bright behind my eyes

They're sending me a picture of the moon
And star-mapped skies for travelers in tune
With all that falls beneath us from the sky
Be steady light, shine bright behind my eyes
They're sending me a picture of the moon
And star-mapped skies for travelers in tuneEmbed
