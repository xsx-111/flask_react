The Shiney Sea LyricsI would do anything to be anywhere else
As it is, as you know, I don't know which way to go
No, no, no
I would do anything to do anything else
As it is, as I am, everything is out of hand
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
Sea creatures dream in their shiney sleep
Sea creatures dream of their briney deep
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
I would do anything to be anything else
As it is, as you know, I don't know which way to flow
No, no, no
I would do anything just to peel back the waves
Make a hole, so I can breathe, so I can live under the sea
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
Sea creatures dream of the way the world could be
Sea creatures dream of the shiney sea
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
As it is, as you know, I don't know which way to flow
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, noEmbed
