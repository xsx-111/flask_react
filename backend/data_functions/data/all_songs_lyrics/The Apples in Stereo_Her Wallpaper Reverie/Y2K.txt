Y2K LyricsI know you believe the fucked up things that you read are gonna happen fast
When they come to pass
I know that believe that what you watched on TV was just another clue
That they wrote for you, yes
Doobie-do-do-doo
At least that much is true
Doobie-do-do-doo
The wrote it just for you
Doobie-do-do-doo
They showed it on the news
Doobie-do-do-doo
For people just like you and me
Who like to believe that what we receive is true
I know you believe the fucked up things that you read are gonna happen
(yeah. that's not gonna happen.)
I know you believe the fucked up things that you read are gonna happen
(??)
I know you believe the fucked up things that you read are gonna happen
(yeah, yeah)Embed
