Strawberryfire Lyrics
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Strawberry design
In her mind
Strawberryshine
Her mind is a plane
Or window pane
It's all the same
Coming up on on a song
She dreams along
Then she is gone
Her dream is a fire
A streaming choir
Strawberryfire

Took a trip on a stereo song
Drifting along with the radio on

Strawberry surprise
Oh what lies
'Neath her green eyes
Her room I have seen
But I have not been
Into her dreams
Her dream is so sweet
It's all she needs
Just leave her be
Her dream is on fire
And she's so tired
Strawberryfire
Took a trip on a stereo song
Drifting along with the radio on

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
AhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhEmbed
