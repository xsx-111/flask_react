Ruby Lyrics
Ruby
Oh baby don't you know
Girl, your silence hurts me so
Are you listening?
Ruby
Oh baby can't you see
It's the source of misery
Are you listening?

Troubles
They seem to follow me
As far as I can see
It must be my destiny
Troubles
They carry you around
From the crib into the ground
They will never set you down

Mm la la la
La la la la
Mm la la la
La la la la
Ruby
Oh baby can't you see
I'm so sad it's killing me
Are you listening?
Ruby
If you like to think out loud
It might really help me out
Are you listening, girl?

Troubles
They seem to follow me
As far as I can see it must be my destiny
Troubles
They carry you around
From the crib into the ground
They will never set you down

Mm la la la
La la la la
Mm la la la
La la laaa

Ba ba ba baa
Ba ba ba baa
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening, girl?
Ba ba ba baa
Ba ba ba baa
Ba ba ba baa
Mm, are you listening, girl?
Troubles
They seem to follow me
As far as I can see it must be my destiny
Troubles
They carry you around
From the crib into the ground
They will never set you down

Mm la la la
La la la la
Mm la la la
La la laaa

Are you listening girl?
Ba ba ba baa
Ba ba ba baa
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening girl?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening girl?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening girl?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening girl?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening?
Ba ba ba baa
Are you listening girl?Embed
