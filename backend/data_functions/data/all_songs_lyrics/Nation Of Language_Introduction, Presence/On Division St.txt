On Division St LyricsYou buried me
Right where I belonged
You buried me
Right where I belonged
And still, I'm waiting there
On division st
I would like to find the answers I was always rudely denied
A song so sweet
From back when I was born
The loving creak
Of floorboards by the door
Hopeful I waited, hopeful I called
But no one would answer at all
On division st
I would like to find the answers I was always rudely denied1Embed
