The Wall & I LyricsA divide
Calling all the faithless in flight
What am I?
I am only dust in this light
But I would like to find another way to find you here
You sat in the garden by the road
Mummified, nullified in the soil
The feeling weighs a fuck load in the morn
They must have dropped the call
Thank goodness I wrote
A disguise
Wear it til I think that it’s real
I don't know
You may never know how I feel
But I would like to find another way to find you here
But I would like to find another way to find you here
I stared up the wall and he said
“‘I don’t know’ is not an answer to the question”
In the time
That it takes to open this wound
Lay me down
Tell me it’ll be different soon
But I would like to find another way to find you here
I stared up the wall and he said
“‘I don’t know’ is not an answer to the question”1Embed
