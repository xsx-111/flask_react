Automobile LyricsIn a car with a lover I’m concerned
I never deserved
In the night and I’m bleeding and she’s hurt
Never deserved
Tell me now that I always was the worst
You’re never reserved
Another mile and another hateful curse
I may have deserved
In a landscape harsh and thick
Thick with the dreams that you never quite kicked
You carry on for a long time
I know you know
But you won’t admit
The only way outs not the way you came in
You carry on for a long time
In a car with a lover I’m concerned
I never deserved
In a landscape harsh and thick
Thick with the dreams that you never quite kicked
You carry on for a long time
I know you know
But you won’t admit
The only way outs not the way you came in
You carry on for a long time
In a car with a lover I’m concerned
I never deserved
All the times that you said you loved me first
That never were heardEmbed
