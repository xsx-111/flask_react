Friend Machine LyricsOne touch
Look away
And as far as I can tell
I can’t defend myself
Before you know my name
I can’t defend myself
I was an open book
All the weight of the spine
To the cold curbside
I need a friend machine to help me outside
And tomorrow comes
And they all stop singing along
I need a friend machine to help me just to last the night
I look for deliverance but
I’m living under some kind of spell
I can’t defend myself
It’s just an itch
There in the bottom of the mind
Come out with it
You make me wonder all the time
Are you listening, friend?
Will you tend to me and I’ll tend
To the cold curbside
I need a friend machine to help me outside
And tomorrow comes
And they all stop singing along
I need a friend machine to help me just to last the nightEmbed
