Rush & Fever LyricsWe'll never find ourselves so in love

Crush my love
Leave it there
Curse the heart
Causing it

I could always find you sitting there
With you second hand malaise
I looked at you with a rush and fever
That melts my teeth away

Save us, save us saints from above
Why would I say what I would want?
Save us, save us saints from above
Why would I say what I would want?
(We'll never find ourselves so in love)

They say "how can people find what I can never find"
"How can people find what I can never find?"
We were supposed to feel young in the heart
I could always find you sitting there
With you second hand malaise
I looked at you with a rush and fever
That melts my teeth away

Save us, save us saints from above
Why would I say what I would want?
Save us, save us saints from above
Why would I say what I would want?
'Cause I remember when you couldn't find the time
I remember when you couldn't find the time
Save me, save me, save my soul
I couldn't find you there
And what are these tasteless moments but
Wandering in wasted air
Save me, save my soul
I couldn't find you there
'Cause I remember when you couldn't find the time
I remember when you couldn't find the time
Save me, save me, save my soul
I couldn't find you thereEmbed
