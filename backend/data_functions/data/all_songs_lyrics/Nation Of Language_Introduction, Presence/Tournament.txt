Tournament LyricsAnd that’s fine
I’m wasting away
I took the long road home
And it never paid off for me
But to feel the proof
As I’m walking around the city
In a torrent of rain
To feel the proof
As I’m walking around the city
In a torrent of rain
But you can see for yourself
I’m not rushing away
‘cause I’ve been waiting for a long long time
Watching
I’ve been waiting for a long long time
By the second day, the mystery was gone
And ten thousand lights would shine
On nothing else
But you can see for yourself
I’m not rushing away
Cause I’ve been waiting for a long long time, watching
I’ve been waiting for a long long time
I can build a world around me
Underneath the light
And another and another
I can build a world around me
Underneath the light
There’s people on the phone
You need to tell them what you want
Laying on your side
Your words have never felt so far off1Embed
