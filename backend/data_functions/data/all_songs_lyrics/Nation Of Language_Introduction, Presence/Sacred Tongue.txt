Sacred Tongue LyricsI walk, nine o’clock
As you stroll on the Quay d’Orsay
Stretched out on the bench
Make me wait at the garden gate
But as I watch you recline
Serpent, siren and saint congregate inside
And I look back on another time, colorblind
Colored by the weight of a sacred tongue
But if our shirts don’t fit and the jeans are ripped
That's fine, that's alright
And when our conscience clears I can murmur something trite
Laying by your side
Light shifts, the curtain lifts
You perform to great acclaim
I rescind the invitation or orchestrate my shame
Never had a name for myself
All that in due time
Before you carve my heart out know
I’m gonna let you every time
I will let you every time
I was always waiting for you to go
‘Cause you never cared for me
You feign towards the door and I’m down on my hands and knees
But as I watch you recline
Serpent, siren and saint congregate inside
And I look back on another time, colorblind
Colored by the weight of a sacred tongue
But if our shirts don’t fit and the jeans are ripped
That's fine, that's alright
And when our conscience clears I can murmur something trite
Laying by your sideEmbed
