Indignities LyricsAnd they pile up
These indignities
And I wrestle
With these indignities
In the paper I don't really read
It says everything's changing faster than me
And I don't understand
Gotta take control of things
All I really wanna say is just cut it out
And they pile up
These indignities
On my laptop
With these indignities
In the paper I don't really read
It says what if there's more than binary
And I don't understand
Its not the way it used to be
All I really wanna say is just cut it out
The TV shows, when I'm alone, they know
Pouring it into my home
The crass, the new, the heathen, and the low
When I'm alone
Pouring it into my home
Oh the shameEmbed
