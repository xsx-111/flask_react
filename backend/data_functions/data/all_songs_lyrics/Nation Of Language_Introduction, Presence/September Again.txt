September Again LyricsI wander off on
Some kind of vision of sunlight
But our hands fall
From your left
From my right
So you go back to church to reclaim the feeling
You say you don't understand why
And you spend extra time standing naked in the mirror
When you wanna wear something nice
And it's September again
Flipping through the same old books
But you're reading less
And it's September again
I don't mind
I don't mind
I'm gazing upon
Stained glass and ceilings of pure white
The choir calls
From the back
And it's nice
So you go back to church to reclaim the feeling
You say you don't understand why
And you spend extra time standing naked in the mirror
When you wanna wear something nice
And it's September again
Flipping through the same old books
But you're reading less
And it's September again
I don't mind
I don't mind
Now you've got to know
You move in cascading light
Oncoming autumn
You can't remember the last time
A life so long
And you fade
And it's fine
So you go back to church to reclaim the feeling
You say you don't understand why
And you spend all your time standing naked in the mirror
When you wanna wear something nice
And it's September again
Flipping through the same old books
But you're reading less
And it's September again
I don't mind
I don't mindEmbed
