Laughing Stock Lyrics
We do believe it ends right here
The orchestrations and the dream is clear
Shuttle departs and they're all there
Everyone's cracking up but we don't care

And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real

Whisper, the cymbals ride on in
Though this time, we'll trade the strings for old 110
Headphones will assure position when
The crowd fades and the overture begins
Begins

And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real
I don't believe the way this feels
Slight alterations leave enraptured ears
Headphones will insure possession when
The crowd fades and the overture begins
Begins

And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra realEmbed
