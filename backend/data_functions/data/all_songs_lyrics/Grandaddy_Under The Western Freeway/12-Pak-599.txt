12-Pak-599 LyricsWon't somebody please
Take away my keys
Drunk again
And running in
To memories' trees
Curtains in the sky
Certain they will cry
But you would too
For your friend who
Just spilled it when he tried
Stage my grand comeback
Resting on my back
Though I'm dead you know
My hair's gonna grow
Don't make me go
I don't wanna go aloneEmbed
