Poisoned at Hartsy Thai Food LyricsMr. Hartsy came over and asked
"What the heckâ€™s going on?"
And both of them began to throw up
All over the photos on the table
Billy spilled his Pepsi
Sandra, she was laying on the floor
Nobody knows where the poison goes
Where it came from, nobody knows
Poisoned at Hartsy'sEmbed
