Nonphenomenal Lineage LyricsHello, good morning, sir
The results are back
Now it's time to pack
Your things and go
Seems you came up rather short
Of the average sort
Now I must inform
You've no reason left to remain here
Now surely you'll understand
Only gifted hands
Will receive the chance
To touch down on fortune
Now we'll gather up your things
And lead you to the gate
And you will go away
And never attempt to return hereEmbed
