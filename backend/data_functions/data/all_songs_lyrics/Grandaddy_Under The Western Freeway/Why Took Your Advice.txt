Why Took Your Advice Lyrics
I took your advice
And turned my cable off
You said you'd do it too
How come you never call?

I took your advice
And fixed my radio
But I can't find anything
That sounds good anymore

I took your advice
And bought the microscope
But I can't find anything
I wanna see up close

I took your advice
I took your advice
I took your advice
I planned things
How come you never call?
How come you never call?Embed
