Summer Here Kids Lyrics
Summer here, kids

After she lets you glide around
Finally hit the ground like a paper plane
Take a trip, join me in the sun
But not really though, 'cause I ain't having fun

'Cause summer here, kids
Summer here totally lies
Tourist info said I'd have a good time
Summer here, kids
All of them, awful lies
Tourist info said I'd have a good time

Do as I didn't do because
I'm a picture of imdumbivinity
Stay alone, put a record on
Listen to the songs, keep yourself at home

'Cause summer here, kids
Summer here totally lies
Tourist info said I'd have a good time
Summer here, kids
All of them, awful lies
Tourist info said I'd have a good time
I'd have a good a time
I'm not having a good time
I'm not having a good timeEmbed
