Collective Dreamwish of Upperclass Elegance LyricsHere I sit and play guitar
Drink beer out in the country
Having narrowly escaped my trip
Into town and now it's Sunday
So, here I sit and play guitar
Count stars out in the country
Having narrowly escaped my trip
Into town and now there's no one aroundEmbed
