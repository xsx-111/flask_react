A.M. 180 Lyrics
Don't change your name
Keep it the same
For fear I may lose you again
I know you won't
It's just that I am unorganized
And I want to find you when
Something good happens

If you come down
We'll go to town
I haven't been there for years
But I'd be fine
Wasting our time
Not doing anything here
Just doing nothing

We'll sit for days
And talk about things
Important to us like whatever
We'll defuse bombs
Walk marathons
And take on whatever, together
Whatever, together
Whatever, together
Whatever, together
Whatever, together
Whatever, together1Embed
