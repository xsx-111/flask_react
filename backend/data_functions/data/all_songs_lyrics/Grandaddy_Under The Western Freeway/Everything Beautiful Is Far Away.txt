Everything Beautiful Is Far Away Lyrics
He just finished eating dinner
And stepped outside the cave to smoke
A cigarette he'd made from rolled up photo paper
They were pictures of things back on Earth
He looked out on the greyish white expanse
Of uninhabited terrain he now called home
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

He'd seen plenty of mirages and imaginary visitors up until then
So he wasn't sure what to think when he saw swans
And they were wading on the shores of a pale white lake
That he'd never seen there before
And it was quite beautiful
And it was far away
'Cause everything beautiful is far away
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

He knew he was as good as gone
But gone was somewhere he really didn't mind going to
Since the shuttle had crashed, many years had passed
And the pictures of his loved ones
That he drew on the walls of the cave
Had finally faded
He put out his smoke and proceeded toward the lake
Repeating to himself
"Everything beautiful is far away."
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
My problem is, I'm dumb
This I might overcome
Right now, it's just too hard for me
I just wanna punch who ever lead me hereEmbed
