Go Progress Chrome LyricsGo progress chrome
They painted the moon today
Some brand new future color
Go progress chrome
I aim to shoot the scaffolds
I like it how it's always been
Go progress chrome
Nocturnal glare confusion
The night owl and I will hunt the contractor
Go progress chrome
I won't be at your unveiling
I like it how it's always been
How it's always beenEmbed
