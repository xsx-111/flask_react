Books Written for Girls LyricsYou can compliment me on the style of my hair
Give me marks out of ten for the clothes I wear
You probably thought I had more upstairs
I disappoint you, I can see through your perfect smile
He likes to read books written for girls
Prides himself on being a man of the world
In the darkest of places he gets his thrills
He will disappoint you if you see through his perfect smile
I think separation is OK, you're no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted me to play the fool, play by your rule
Now my door has swollen from the rain
God knows we'll never see her face again
People get shattered in many ways
They can disappoint you if you see through their perfect smiles
I think separation is OK, you're no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted me to play the fool, play by your rule
The fool, play by your ruleEmbed
