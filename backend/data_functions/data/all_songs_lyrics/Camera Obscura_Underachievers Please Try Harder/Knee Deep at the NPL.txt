Knee Deep at the NPL LyricsWe went out dancing
It was time we had fun
We didn't leave 'til three
I know we're not the only ones
When we got outside, the snow had started to fall
I made a ball
I threw it at Gavin
Because he's tall
Yeah, he's tall
So now we have the snow up to our knees (yes please)
A walking winter land, it's always bound to please
I know it's true to say my smile's been weak
I wonder if you know by now
I'm falling deep

I can hear you calling to me in the morning
How can I be falling in love with you?
I can hear you calling to me in the morning
How can I be falling in love with you?
You could offer me a penny for my thoughts
They're not worth a damn, they're not worth a lot
I've been getting loose with my tongue and free with my hands
How can I expect you to understand who I am?
I can hear you calling to me in the morning
How can I be falling in love with you?
(She's doing her own thing, she's making my heart sing)
I can hear you calling to me in the morning
(And she's moving along to the beat of the song, it's true)
How can I be falling in love with you?
(I'll keep you safe and warm tonight)Embed
