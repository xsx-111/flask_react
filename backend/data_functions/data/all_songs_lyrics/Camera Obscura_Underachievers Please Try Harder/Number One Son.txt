Number One Son LyricsTook a walk in the park for a laugh, we had sparkling wine
Oh yes, it was dark trees, could not be identified
The girl you were with, did she have you on your knees?
I shut my mouth, my ears, I don't want to hear you, please
Now we're skipping school, going to listen to records
Wrapped up in mohair, dissing your elders
I dip a chocolate finger, take a sip from my cup
Remember what your dad said, "button your lip"
You've got to toughen up for him
He's the kind who will do you in
I should know that it's no fun
You will never be Number One
Number One Son
God I've tried to help but I think I just hinder
Find another girl, could she ever be kinder?
Love unlike lightning can strike you twice
I don't know much, but here's my advice
You've got to toughen up for him
He's the kind who will do you in
I should know that it's no fun
You will never be Number One
