Before You Cry LyricsNo sense, no style, I said I loved you for a little while
When you cried no, high speed became go slow
Come back this time, wishful thinking is going to make you mine
Push turns to shove, I got no more room for love
I hope you hear me, I can't stand you next to me
Get lost goodbye, I'll smile before you cry
I love you baby, please don't hate me
You're feeling a little sad tonight but you'll be alright
You're feeling a little sad tonight but you'll be alright
You're feeling a little sad tonight but you'll be alrightEmbed
