Footloose and Fancy Free LyricsBuy me an advent calendar
It seems the thought of days without you make me sadder
Don't visit me now; you make me want to do myself in
I'll see you sometimes, but I won't see you soon
I won't see you soon
I know some things about you; I won't spill the beans
'Cause there's a spool in my own camera that's never been seen
I could write it all down; I know it won't be enough
I want you to be happy with someone to love
Someone to love
And it won't be me
Said it won't be you
Pretty soon we'll agree to be free
Footloose and fancy free
Footloose and fancy free
Footloose and fancy freeEmbed
