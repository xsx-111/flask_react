Keep It Clean Lyrics
Does it make you happy to ignore me on streets?
I guess by now you think I'm weak
I wish you would have said something before now
I wouldn't share a bag of chips with you
And in my opinion you don't have a clue
I'm being cruel, I'm being cruel

I don't want to be part of your scene
I'll stay with him, I'll keep my nose clean

You're the one pretending to be licking stamps
All alone in a room following lines on maps
It's clear you don't want me here
How about I send you a book on nutrition?
Stop spoon-feeding me non-fiction
Just for a while, I will fake a smile

I don't want to be part of your scene
I'll stay with him, I'll keep my nose clean

Oh, why did you say she was a friend of mine?
I thought it was me you couldn't stand
I'm confused, I will win, you will lose
You've taken to phoning my house when you're drunk
And then confessing all your love
I wish you would have said so before now

I don't want to be part of your scene
I'll stick with him, I'll keep my nose clean2Embed
