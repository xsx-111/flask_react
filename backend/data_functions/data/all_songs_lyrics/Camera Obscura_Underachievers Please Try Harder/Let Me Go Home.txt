Let Me Go Home LyricsHurry up, baby, 'cause we're going somewhere tonight
One glass of wine and you're mine and you know I just might...
You know I just might
You know I just might
Well the room goes boom to the sound of Temptations and more
Twisting and turning that girl's looking good on the floor
Good on the floor
Good on the floor
Well the four walls they collide
Until the blue-eyed girl decides to let me go home
Let me go home
Host plays "Ghost in my House", gets a fist in the eye
Vinyl is crushed in the rush for the liquor supply
The liquor supply
The liquor supply
Supremes in our dreams
Do we quit bein' obscene on the stairs(?)
Daylight appears through the curtains and nobody cares
Nobody cares
Nobody cares
Well the four walls they collide
Until the blue-eyed girl decides to let me go home
Let me go home
Daylight appears through the curtains and nobody cares
Supremes in our dreams
Do we quit bein' obscene on the stairsEmbed
