Suspended from Class Lyrics
You're such a beautiful writer
That's not all you are
I'm sorry about making a pass
It was subtle but I think that you grasped
The meaning intended
I can be a friend to you
I won't pretend
I'm not interested in breaking your heart
It's not love, no it's nothing like that
I'll leave that to lookers like him
Oh, he's such a delicate thing
Now it's such a fragile thing that we have

I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class

We could go out dancing
But, in truth, it is the last thing that I have on my mind
Please say if I'm way out of line
I won't need telling twice
Now he wants to kiss
He says he can't resist
You're going to have to keep it hidden inside
I've a feeling that pigs might fly, might fly
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class

You're such a beautiful writer
And that's not all you are
I'm sorry about making a pass
It was subtle but I think that you grasped
The meaning intended

I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse2Embed
