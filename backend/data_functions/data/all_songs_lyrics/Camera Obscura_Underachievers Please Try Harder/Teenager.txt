Teenager Lyrics
For your birthday, she sent you a card
She didn't sign her name, she gave an autograph
And now she's trying to call your bluff
Is she your true love?
We knew the boy who went from Maude to Ted
She asked, matter-of-fact, had he gone off his head?
He was uncomplaining as a tree
Not a thing like me

You're not a teenager, so don't act like one
Sure she is a heartbreaker, does she have one?
Is it down to me, down to me? We both rarely speak

I went for a stroll after dark
I thought of you and her while staring at the black
I didn't have you down for being easily led
Or the girl well-read

You're not a teenager, so don't act like one
Sure she is a heartbreaker, does she have one?
Is it down to me, down to me? We both rarely speakEmbed
