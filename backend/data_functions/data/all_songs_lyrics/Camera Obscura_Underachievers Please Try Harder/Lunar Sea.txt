Lunar Sea LyricsFor the Lunar sea see the river moon and you've got it
Match the finest words to the greatest tune and you bought it
See me cross in style, walk the longest mile in a minute
Where do drifters go? Wonder if they know there's no limit
At the rainbow's end, find a perfect friend, say you're sorry
Make me dream at night, break my heart on sight, don't you worry
Swept the sounds of love from the skies above and I knew it
Swim the seas of blue just to drown in you and I blew it
You hear it, the shiver in spine, don't come near it
I love it, you soar and you cry, rise above it
Got my lunar sea for your river moon if you let it
Match my finest words to your greatest tune, won't forget it
You hear it, the shiver in spine don't come near it
I love it, you soar and you cry, rise above it
Fly by lunar sea lullaby, fly by lunar sea lullaby
Fly by lunar sea lullaby, fly by lunar sea lullabyEmbed
