AN IDEA IS A WORK OF ART Lyrics
On a quest to get open and free
Indeed, on a quest to get open and free

I do as I please as it pleases me
Sneezed on the knee of an MC most egregiously
Never begged they pardon calling my behavior modern
I circumambulate with the psycho-active animate
Basket case candidate for high stakes life, gambling
I'm ambling to the greater matter with my gray matter
Build gray matters, build better answers to destructive questions
Mother inventions, weathering God's pop quizzes
No matter what the odds, isn't odd, isn't it
How this wall between us dislodge with one fidget
It's not a gimmick, but a superpower
I've seen whole crews devoured by a person who is now a tagline on a bodybag
Bagpipes 'cause you had to lollygag
Gully gully wall with the Buddy Holly walk in Islamabad
Or it felt like it
Yelling Hellfyre into microphones, came out swingin'
Vaseline on forehead, winner sorted
Fiddlesticks, write a riddle to grant your own wish
Toss the homie a beat like "hold this"
Art rap globalist, legion of hoodwinkers
Seasonal mood lingers, among broke bootleggers
Hoop jumper for pleasures
The many ventures of them pennypinchers
The skinny ledger leaker
Minute hedge fund freaker, done being a thinker
Hehe, 'til we meet again
At the Comfort Inn, hunter huntering
At the Comfort Inn, hunter huntering
It's the others who other whoever
It's the others who other whoever
On the quest to get open and free
On the quest to get open and free
Ran through a lot of gasoline
Ran through a lot of gas and lean
It's the opposite of picking cotton
Rule number five
It's the opposite of picking cotton
On the quest to get open and free
We built better answers
It's the others who other whoever
It's the others who other whoever
On the quest to get open and free
A quest to get open and free
Ponder this Einstein
How does music fold space and time?
Realign locations with emotional space and verse stations
Less diverse as Hawkins with the gate open
Two billion ghosts walking the base of oceans
I'm talking about the base of the crossing
The low end to the screen
More frequencies in between and some focus on the moon
But this base was born on an island of survivors and reverberations and depths of millions of square miles
Our blues born from the deepest blue and black and green
To guide us through psychosomatic smokescreens
To flip the world over
We ride trauma like moguls on slopes
Invoking old moguls in hopes royal lines will guide us
What if royalty despised us?
And there's no chosen, no laws
Just Rakim on them mountaintops
Or Nasir at Harvards by Paul
We're riding waves in centuries before slave trades no surprise we glide on the micros
One off bars on technos
 hoorays, we gonna ease into Cantonese
Same with if it's Anglais, Francais, and Espanol
Meandering through Mandarin with a one that's one million years old
This beat is gold
Ergo, Milo knows the only gold is soul
That's what Columbus was really looking for
It's the others who other whoever
It's the others who other whoever
On the quest to get open and free
The quest to get open and freeEmbed
