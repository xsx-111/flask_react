MASTERPLAN Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There was a time when peace was on the Earth
And joy and happiness did reign and each one knew their worth
In my heart how I yearn for the spirit's return
And I, and I cry as time flies, as time flies
There is a place where love forever shines
And rainbows are the shadows of a presence so divine and the glow of that love
We’ll light the sky, up above
And it's free, come with me, can't you see
The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness through all the land
The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness through all the land
The creator has a working plan
Peace and happiness through all the land
The creator makes but one demand
And it’s happiness through all the land
Through all the land
And we're very happy about that
Quite happyEmbed
