OMENS & TOTEMS Lyrics
Old
Old, old, totem
They're still getting off on confessional prose poems, bold omens
Professional rappers often only heard post mortem
Perhaps try trade school, electrician training seems prescient
The best apprentices are a tad hesitant, teachers too
Most people try to delete their blues, and with it most of life
But, those are dirty thoughts on such a gorgeous night
This beat sound like a long walk to the dumpster
Funk like nostrils of muenster, made myself an apostle of wonder
I want to behold magnificence, I want to behold magnificence
The seed sprouted and we shouted way past rooftops
Walk across, indeed, poppin' bottles off
The sprout grew to sapling eye, that's what's happening
Lost in shade, then umber, the way to the under
The permanent other bardmen
Dreams are nursed in darkness and there's no parking, on foot
Preaching the rhyming word is absurdist
Pledging allegiance before reading the terms of service agreement
No antecedent, order the ancestor moth meetin'
And tonight I'm holding court with my heathens
A staff made of Pringles, beard lookin' wizardly
I remember it vividly, send the enemy my utmost sympathies
Ruby yacht, we scream it diligently, pillage differently
On a teeter totter with lasers lurks milky moon
Word to Skipp Coon
I never needed freedom papers
I never needed freedom papers
Gimme space to wave my arms around
Sword have you in the mood to put your armor down
It's the gumption of the gumshoe
Living room Kung Fu, you gon' have to catch me first
My net worth is not material
This day began with flax milk and cereal
Prolly end with rice and beans
Fuck wealth and the hype machine
Rather have health and an icy spring, or electrician training
I can hear a rapper hesitating, but that won't pay this car note, will it?
Out the barrel into the skillet, out the barrel into the skillet
And the whole time I was screamin'1Embed
