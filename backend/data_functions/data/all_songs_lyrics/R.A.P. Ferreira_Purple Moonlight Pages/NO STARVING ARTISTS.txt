NO STARVING ARTISTS Lyrics
(I've fallen off the wheel)
Built yourself back, shoulder chip by shoulder chip
Only to find the method used erroneous
Why you always transmittin' from a place of desperation?
(I've fallen off the wheel)
Why those low frequencies be your final destination, huh?
(I've fallen off the wheel)
Singing weeping willows, while that Dilla swing
Coax the bellowing from the center solar plexus
Noble savage, ghost ride the Lexus (I've fallen off the wheel)
Parallel universe, we was bumpin' letters to Alexis
Never have I ever been impressed with
How they compromise the message for the spectacle of presence of the bespectacled heckler
I widen the vector, you clowns pine to be victor
I pivot to miss her
Curvature of the swerve became permanent fixture
Like, old timey sangs in Hymie's Basement with the whiny faces
These hidden forces propelling the door swing
Arpeggiated with poems
Rode into the sunset on a ark of bones
Cultural mothership, turned to sacred utterance
Dalliance, an army of one green stallion
(I've fallen off the wheel)
We growin' scallions
Yeah
Sorry to say (I've fallen off the wheel)
I've fallen off the wheel
(I've fallen off the wheel)
Built yourself back, shoulder chip by shoulder chip
Only to find the method used erroneous
Why you always transmittin' from a place of desperation?
Why those low frequencies be your final destination, huh?
(I've fallen off the wheel)
No starvin' artists, just artists starvin' to know
No starvin' artists, just artists starvin' to know
No starvin' artists, just artists starvin' to know
Just artists starvin' to know, it's no starvin' artists, nah
Artists starvin' to know
No starvin' artists, we don't do that
No starvin' artists, we don't do that (I've fallen off the wheel)
I've fallen off the wheel
I am no longer a starving artist
I've fallen off the wheelEmbed
