U.D.I.G. (UNITED DEFENDERS OF INTERNATIONAL GOODWILL) Lyrics
Check it out
King poetical dingbat, hip cat science
Theoretical ink splat, scope that
Wingding, impeccable Hulk stache
Versaille oak path, Ruby Yacht be the GOAT in gas
Lotus staff to the temple dome
Overpass, overgrown grass
Luscious laugh, make the greens more vibrant
Need my own island to transmit from, admit one
Black Orpheus, nickel cadmium
Who put the bean in they back?
No heat on my naps, leanin' the strut
Never the flask, mean on wax
Nicer in person, not quite friendly
Right hand tempted, R.A.P. Ferreira run the beat like Caster Semenya
A rasher of catastrophes is how you break a fast
Sand blasted brass, hiccuping PlayStation
Found our in when they was hesitatin'
Me and mine, you know we hella patient
Me and mine, you know we—
One fell stroke, no Gödel code with the L in the hell hole
Shell toe genie, blue meanie
A cosmology Luchini, an odd policy
You startled me with all that thirstiness
Blind lemon, Ice 9 meltin'
Helmet made of toothpicks starts rusting openly
Texas Hold 'em with only me
Well, Horace Silver was there grinning, but not playing
Praying but not—
Forget to pay the toll, and then the letter comes
Forget to pay the toll, and then the letter comes
I better get this done, but I never do
And that's the essence of what's eating at you
I say to me, in earnestness, "did you earn this?"
Before scarfing several
Before scarfing several
As always, the question remains, "Can you dig it?"
United Defenders of International Good Will, you dig?
It's all our turf
It's all our turf1Embed
