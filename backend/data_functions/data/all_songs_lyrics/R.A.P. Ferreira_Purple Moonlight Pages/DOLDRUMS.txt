DOLDRUMS Lyrics
I wrote this outside of Wegmans. After they kicked me out for, for kickin', kickin’ too many rhymes

Endure the doldrums
Severe learning, my middle hurting
Growing up and it's to be such a little person
Dissapointment cloaks resentment
Wearing a cloak in Wegmans and being escorted out
Is this what rap's about? What do you rap about?
Miscellaneous capers, visually zany language
To maim my baby brain wit
That’s why I only play my raps round him
Naps soundin' reasonable
So I take one, might cook all day
And I call that luxury
If them supremacists need a enemy, I'm your Hucklebee
You not gon' outwit, out-plot, out-steal or muzzle me
Won't even mention hustling, it's puzzling
When the meek act Big Willie, shit really

Just kick back and inherit the world (Ah yeah)
Just kick back and inherit the world (Ah yeah)
Just kick back and inherit the world (Ah yeah)
Just kick back
Scrape scraps, pieces, hacks, master tongue
Bastard, plug seven, lung, reverends
Grew antennas, increased livity
Recognize the signs of cycle, slow farming humility
I accept the mystery, I accept the mystery
I accept the mystery, I accept the mystery
Superstitious metaphysics, stained with humdrum
All my homies sufferin' the same conundrum
Superstitious metaphysics, stained with humdrum
All my homies sufferin' the same conundrum
Superstitious metaphysics, stained with humdrum
All my homies sufferin’ the same
And the goal is to retain, the goal is to retain
The goal is to retain the most whole
It’s the soul folks, it's the soul folks
It’s the soul folks, it's the soul folks
Can you find the level of difficulty in this?
Can you find the level of jubilee in this?
Can you find the level of revelry in this?
Can you find the level of freedom in this?
Can you find the level of spirit in this?
(Ah yeah)2Embed
