Respectdue Lyrics
In this era, you need to get your businesses right
You need several businesses, you know LLCs, corporations and things
You need, you need, you need uh, you need to be part of the business class

They know the difference, wouldn't dare to speak it
Stationary from the temple of the nappy Jesus
Workin' on the 16 that could capture freedom
Meaning I'm raising seas to their absolute zenith
Bakin', baguettes, at the Bookoo Bread Company, head hunting
Tracing every crumb and trail by the thumb and nail
Numerous jerks clandestine activity rather the solid gumbo works
Respect due
To the old school crew
To the new school crew
And the true school crew
Respect due
To the old school crew
To the new school crew
And the true school crew

That's the line of your age, that's the lineage
We need that veil of anonymity
Where sales transcend hand to hand proximity
Revoke the old smoking crooner
Bar-b-que courtesy J.R.R. Tolkien Jr
George R.R. Martin, Lawrence
Went fartin' in Florence, no Welch
Thank him for his greens and no help
No exit, no side bets
The head of potlikker enterprises presides on this
I might just slide on this, as if
Pad of butter hittin' hot skillet
Can you find the level of difficulty in this
You ain't got the necessary instruments
Or, put it like this, even faculties
Bet they ain't got a stack of, uh, files on me
'Cause I'm from nowhere, armed with nothing
Showboating and stunting
Miraculous nature of getting open and bluffing
Respect due
To the old school crew
To the new school crew
And the true school crew
Respect due
To the old school crew
To the new school crew
And the true school crew

Charlatan artisan, approachin' perfection
Parliament hearkens, a focused inspection
Peace not made of steel
You can't fade the real
They get paid to kill
Rap is a way to heal
Perhaps the bandage or the bondage
Armistice farmer for compliments and earnestness
Floating like the melanated butterfly I am
Over a planet where corpse is synonymous with land
Thinking heavy thoughts while taking flight
We walk in a big line, me and all the good ideas I'm having
Curse glyph to crane my neck, pirate seas
Squint tryin' to seek somethin'
I miss payphones
I miss proclaiming every quarter slid to the world
I got somethin' to say to someone
The fuck you mean?
Yellow cord danglin' from the ceiling
Is how I power this here machine
Respect due
To the old school crew
To the new school crew
And the true school crew
Respect due
To the old school crew
To the new school crew
And the true school crew

Last thing, steamin' on outta here
Catch it, the Ruby Yacht
Longer hellos and quicker goodbyes
We don't like sleepin' on white sheets
Angel with the ramen noodle curls
Pattin' my hand sayin' hurry up dear
I need to hustle tips tonight and I'm
Dumbstruck, awestruck, homestruck
My right foot heavy
My right foot heavy
My right foot heavy
(ha ha ha ha ha ha, shit got so ill)Embed
