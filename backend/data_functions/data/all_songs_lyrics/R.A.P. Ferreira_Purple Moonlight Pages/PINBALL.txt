PINBALL Lyrics
The new news sounding very Laurel and Hardy
On their laurels, artsy, deplorable carvings
Avoiding win-loss dichotomy
Litmus testing my own toxicity
Categorical error, botched history
Look at the page and see the word missing
This flow my inalienable right
Halogen bulb light, jelly donut
Gilded lily with my hillbillies on fiddle and spoons
Fiddler rooves, prince of the corduroy coons
Bust the jazz hands, she hit the lumpy dance
Lakim Shabazz enters a deep trance, levitating
Discrete demands, steady pressure, no hesitating
Pointer finger callus, pigeon pecking, no malice
And that could change with some introspecting
That's very interesting, that's very interesting
And that could change with some introspecting
That's very interesting

And then I played pinball with Zev Love X
And then I played pinball with Zev Love X
And then I played pinball with Zev Love X
R.A.P. Ferreira run your tape deck
Yeah, shouts to the middle rank
It's dog eat dog, big bank take little bank
And shouts to the ink tank
For painting my lemons gold
External modem, used to download centerfolds
It's taking all day for a mislabeled JPEG
Eight leg, body rock, rhyming like J-Treds
I'm what the fire burns, flame is what I deserve
My wallet getting lighter, trying to guess what I might've earned, heavy
Hold it down like a tongue depress
Nonetheless mother-fuck more and cuddle less
Rudderless, big dumb history
I should've chose a gig with income consistently
Got a neck full of tattoo kisses
A three room house with a bathroom prison
The front looks good but the back tooth's missing
And Geti said we walk like jazz musicians
(I don't think that's it though, I think it's, you just like middle aged)1Embed
