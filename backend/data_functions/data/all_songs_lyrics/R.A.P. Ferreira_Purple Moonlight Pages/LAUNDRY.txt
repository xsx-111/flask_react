LAUNDRY Lyrics
Another day, another load of laundry
Soon as I woke up, that feeling was hauntin' me
Another dad with a hamper
I wonder if Chance the Rapper do his own laundry
Who cares?
I scoop socks calmly from under chairs
Underwears is its own load and spin cycle
Towels too, how are you?
I been busy keepin' this home together, you know
A family just growin' together
The hoverin' scent of cool linens
While the loop demands the fools keep sinnin'
Myself included, shit

I'm just hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He stare with them wide ol' eyes
Hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He stare with them wide ol' eyes
I'm hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He stare with them wide ol' eyes
We doin' laundry, we doin' laundry
We doin' laundry, we doin' laundry
(I'm hot like clothes in the dryer, clothes in the dryer)
You know the devil is a liar, silk pants don't go in the dryer
Hang 'em on the back of Boppa's recliner
I feel inspired by the shuffle of my fold
Cut a jib, born of my rib
We should have four or five hundred kids
I wonder how many loads of laundry that is
How many bottles of Gain will I gain in this game
Former rappers is fast dog walkers or podcast talkers
If the loose shoe fit
Perhaps I will launder zoot suits for tips on tour with mariachi dancers
You know that's not an applicable answer for a ten year plan
But, I'm sure it'll all go according to plan
Nonetheless, nonetheless
Presently I'm just, you know

Hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He starin' with them wide ol' eyes
Hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He starin' with them wide ol' eyes
Hummin' in the kitchen
We doin' laundry, we doin' laundry
(I'm hot like clothes in the dryer, clothes, clothes in the dryer)
(Hot like clothes in the dryer)
(Hot like clothes in the dryer)
(Hot like clothes in the dryer)
(I got skills that you can't comprehend)Embed
