ABSOLUTES Lyrics
Hassle proof, spit it in nothin' but absolutes
I don't remember askin' you for a comment
S'posed to feel like bombardment
Vigorous work, the real jerk, no Steve Martin
No he not Spartan, no he not sparrin'
My mind's favorite yoga pose is pullin' okey dokes
Heroes turn to hoagie rolls, it's so laborious
I plot peace as a coordinate
My dojo taught insubordinance is glorious
I prefer when they forfeit, tap out, rap mount
The bag is bounced past, then I cashed out
Left a note said, left a note said, left a note said
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Back of the note had a post script reading
At her I marveled, fiddles with whale bone toggle
The self is the obstacle, fossilization ain't optional
Survival isn't logical
Niggas became absurdists, surrealists, dada flows
S'pose you can holler if you feel this
Those beyond the tasteful, a trip to Office Max for staples
This shit is graceful
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Open the mouth to give testimony, bear witness
You need fresh air and a prayer for forgiveness
Tuck and weave, like Febreze, particulates
You know my tongue be ticklish
You have my active thanks
The rhythm become sacrosanct
Dandelion wine on an empty stomach
Broke the bank, stretched the budget
Broke the bank, stretched the budget
I played the wake, sampled the buffet
Left some flowers by the grave
I sampled the buffet, played the wake
Left some flowers by the grave
And when I die I won't stay
(When I die I won't stay)
