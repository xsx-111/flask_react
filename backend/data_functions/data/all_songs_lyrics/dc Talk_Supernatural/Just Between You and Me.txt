Just Between You and Me LyricsSorrow is a lonely feeling
Unsettled is a painful place
I've lived with both
For far too long now
Since we've parted ways
I've been wrestling
With my conscience
And I found myself to blame
If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel my pride away
Just between you and me
I've got something to say
Wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom now
Just between you and me
I've got something to say
If confession is the road to healing
Forgiveness is the promised land, oh
I'm reaching out in my conviction
I'm longing to make amends, yeah
So I'm sorry for
The words I've spoken
For I've betrayed a friend
We've got a love
That's worth preserving
And a bond I will defend
Just between you and me
I've got something to say
Wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom
Just between you and me
I've got something to say
In my pursuit of God
I thirst for holiness
As I approach the Son
I must consider this
Offenses unresolved
Will keep me from the throne
Before I go to Him
My wrong must be atoned
If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel this pride away
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Just between you and me
I've got something to say
Wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to say
So let me say it today
It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to say
Confession needs to be made
It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to say
Confession needs to be made
It's my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom
I've got something to sayEmbed
