Red Letters LyricsPages filled with a holy message
Sealed with a kiss from heaven
On a scroll long ago
Phrases, words that were bound together
Now have the power to sever
Like a sword evermore
Heed the words divinely spoken
May your restless heart be broken
Let the supernatural take hold

There is love in the red letters
There is truth in the red letters
There is hope for the hopeless
Peace and forgiveness
There is life in the red letters
In the red letters
One man came to reveal a mystery
Changing the course of history
Made the claim he was God
Ageless, born of a virgin
Mary
Spoke with a voice that carried through the years
It's persevered
Heed the words divinely spoken
May your restless heart be broken
Let the supernatural take hold


What you say moves me, revelation, come and take me
The more I look  the more I see 
The Word of God  is what I need
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, it's the book of love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's the book of love
That moves

Speak to me, breathe in me new life 
Let Him in your heart 1Embed
