Wanna Be Loved Lyrics
We all wanna be loved
We all want just a little respect
We all wanna be loved
Tell me what's wrong with that

A rainy Monday afternoon
There's a funk over the city
Everybody's movin' to a different tune
Some are weak
And some are strong
And some are sittin' pretty
Then there's others who are barely hangin' on
It's no easy situation (situation's crazy)
People livin' in their separate worlds (separate worlds)
But one thing that we've got in common is

We all wanna be loved
We all want just a little respect
We all wanna be loved
Tell me what's wrong with that

I've never heard a dying soul
Wish that he had taken
More time on his portfolio
I swear, I've never heard a Mama say
Should've never had that baby As a Doctor holds her newborn on display
It's the heavenly prescription
A little bit will go a long, long way (long, long way)
Just put yourself in their position, don't

Now, Faith and hope are worth a mention
But love is holding its position


Love is a thing that we all claim and it is free
Love is a thing that we all claim and it is free, it is free (2x)1Embed
