Song for Sunshine LyricsHoney'd sweet apples, they're rotting away
Millions of people never start in the race
There's stuff on our plates that has not been alive
Someone else pays full price for my cheap flight line
Sunshine, we all see the same sky
I am a man filled with longing desire
The gifts of creation are ready for hire
A look and a label are all I require
Enough's not enough, I never ask why
Sunshine, we all see the same sky
Looking, learning, asking the same 'why?'
Honey`d sweet apples, they're rotting away
Millions of people never start in the race
There's stuff on out plates that has not been alive
Someone else pays the real price of my cheap flight life
Wheel of fortune spins
But the wheels on fire come crashing on you
Honey`d sweet apples, they're rotting away
Sunshine, we all see the same sky
Looking, learning, asking the same 'why?'
Sunshine, we all see the same skyEmbed
