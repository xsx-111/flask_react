Friends of Mine Lyrics
When we're all in a crowd
And you catch her eye
And then you both smile
I feel so good inside

And when I'm with her
She talks about you
The things that you say
The things that you do

It feels so good to know two people
So in love
So in love

They are friends of mine (Joyce and Terry)
They are friends of mine (Paul and Molly)
And they've got something (Liz and Brian)
It's so hard to find (Joy and David)
They are friends of mine (Kim and Maggie)
They are friends of mine (June and Daffy)
And they've got something (Jean and Jim)
You don't often find (and Jim and Christine)
She takes your hand
When the world stays outside
That's something to see
That's nothing to hide

And when I feel bad
When people disappoint me
That's when I need you two
To help me believe

It feels so good to know two people
So in love
So in love

They are friends of mine (Joyce and Terry)
They are friends of mine (Paul and Molly)
And they've got something (Liz and Brian)
It's so hard to find (Joy and David)
They are friends of mine (Kim and Maggie)
They are friends of mine (June and Daffy)
And they've got something (Jean and Jim)
You don't often find (and Jim and Christine)
It feels so good to know two people
So in love
So in love

They are friends of mine (Joyce and Terry)
They are friends of mine (Paul and Molly)
And they've got something (Liz and Brian)
It's so hard to find (Joy and David)
They are friends of mine (Kim and Maggie)
They are friends of mine (June and Daffy)
And they've got something (Jean and Jim)
You don't often find (and Jim and Christine)

Joyce and Terry
Paul and Molly
Liz and Brian
Joy and David
Kim and Maggie
June and Daffy
Jean and Jim
And Jim and ChristineEmbed
