Changes Lyrics
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad
How brown her eyes

Now
See her walk by
Peppermint coat
Button-down clothes
Buttoned-up high
Diamonds and stones
Hang from her hand
Isn't she smart?
Isn't she grand?

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad
How brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice
She spoke to me

Now
Silver and gold
Strawberry clothes
Money will buy
Something to hold
See in her eyes
Nothing will last
Like emerald stones
And platinum clasp
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad
How brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice
She spoke to me

Now
Silver and gold
Strawberry clothes
Money will buy
Something to hold
See in her eyes
Nothing will last
Like emerald stones
And platinum clasp

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad
How brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice
She spoke to me
I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad
How brown her eyesEmbed
