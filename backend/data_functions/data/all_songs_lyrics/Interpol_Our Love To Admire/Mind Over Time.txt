Mind Over Time Lyrics
I will still be up by fall
I'll still be up by fall either way
Still be up by fall
I'll be still to hear the call either way

Street of thought
In all your bones
Hold your place and
Save your throne
Lie awake supine and golden
Wait for grace
It's time

Mind over time
Mind over time

Sleight of fate
And borrowed clothes
Songs of places
No one knows
Draped in lace we all lean over
To greet the great
It's time
Mind over time
Mind over time

It's Paul, and um, it's been really good to see you, man
Uh, I don't know if I've been away, or you've been away
But uh, you didn't stay long so I just wanted to tell you that it was good to see you, you know?
And uh, it's a shame it didn't work out
But uh, if we could've gotten together for that little recording, it might've been a good experience
But eh, maybe after the holidays, um
Listen, you can call me anytime, please
If you're sure you're not too busy
If you ever need to, just call me, right?
Bye, hope your holidays go well

Street of thought
In all your bones
Hold your place
And save your throne
Lie awake supine and golden
Greet the great it's time

Mind over time
Mind over time
It's mind over time
It's your mind over time3Embed
