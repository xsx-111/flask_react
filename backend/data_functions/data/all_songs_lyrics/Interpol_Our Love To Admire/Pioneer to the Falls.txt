Pioneer to the Falls Lyrics
Show me the dirt pile and I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
You vanish with no guile and I will not pay, but the soul can wait
The soul can wait

Well, it's still pretty what with all these leaves, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
But if it's still pretty what with all these leaves, we'll be fine, oh
And supervise

You show me the dirt pile and I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
Then you vanish with no guile and I will not pay, but the soul can wait
I felt you so much today

I know you try
You try, straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
Girl, I know you try
You fly straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
But here comes the falls
So much for make-believe, I'm not sold
So much of dreams deceit, I'm not prepared to know
Your heart makes me feel, your heart makes me bold
For always and ever, I'll never let go
Always concealed, safe and inside
Alive

Show me the dirt pile and I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
In a passion it broke; I pull the black from the gray, but the soul can wait
I felt you so much today8Embed
