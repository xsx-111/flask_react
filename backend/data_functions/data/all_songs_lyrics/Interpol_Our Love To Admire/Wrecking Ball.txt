Wrecking Ball Lyrics
Can it be true?

Nobody warned you
Nobody told you
To make up your mind
Nobody told you
That I could just waltz through and shake up your style
I'm inside
Like a wrecking ball through your eyes
And I change it all from inside

Strange and fine (Don't wait)
All this hardware, slope of time (Don't wait)
And that one's for me, go inside (Don't wait)
Going somewhere, hopeless tactile (Don't wait)
That one's for me, open wide (Don't wait)
Yawn like new year

Nobody warned you
Nobody told you
To make up your mind
Nobody told you
That I could just walk through and shake up your style
I'm inside
Like a wrecking ball through your eyes
And I change it all from inside
Strange and fine (Don't wait)
All this hardware, slope of time (Don't wait)
And that one's for me, go inside (Don't wait)
Going somewhere, hopeless tactile (Don't wait)
And that one's for me, open wide (Don't wait)
Yawn like new year (Don't wait)
Stay and fight
Stay and fight (Don't)
Stay and fight2Embed
