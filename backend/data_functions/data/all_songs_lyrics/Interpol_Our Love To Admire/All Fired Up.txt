All Fired Up LyricsI dream of you draped in wires and leaning on the brakes
As I lead you with restless liars and dealers on the take
And I can read you like a gumshoe; watch this meeting hall sweat and shake
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you all on
I'll take you on
Oh, I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I haven't struck you with desire, fault line, no crutch, no stall
And I can bind you with no ties or leash and watch you fall
See, I got this soul
It's all fired up
This soul, I got this soul
It's all fired up
This soul - it's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
I teach you of Death's desires reflected in lakes
As I lead you in a fearful file to a precipice of fate
And I welcome you, I welcome your sweethearts that bleed and break
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you all on
I'll take you on when your, your will is gone
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I haven't struck you with desire, fault line, no crutch, no stall
And I can bind you with no ties or lease time and watch you fall
See, I've got this soul
It's all fired up
This soul
I've got this soul
It's all fired up
This soul
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine1Embed
