The Lighthouse LyricsThis place is set to break
It's just as safe from the outside tonight
And I want that
I face the storms appetite
From the lighthouse
And I want that
I embrace the storm and the night
Whole...
What do the waves have to say now?
What do the waves have to say now, now?
Slow now
And let the waves have their way now
Slow
And let the waves have their day
And I want that
Here I’ve been living, unloosened from sin
Upward and outward, "Begin, begin."
Here I’ve been loosened, unliving within
Inwardly urgent, I'm sinking again
