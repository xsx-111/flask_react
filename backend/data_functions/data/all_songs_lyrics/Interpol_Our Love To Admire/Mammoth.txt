Mammoth LyricsSpare me the suspense
Spare me the suspense
I got no currency, but I'm heaven-sent
So spare me the suspense
Just spare me the suspense
Hey, lady wraith
Oh, I so hope you try
You're late, babe, you know it's your time
I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
Alone you can't make amends
No, I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
We should dance like two fucking twins
Just spare me the suspense
There are seven ancient pawnshops along the road
I know seven aching daddies you may want to know
Ooh, right on
Hey, lady wraith
Oh baby, I can't deny
I got a taste, a taste, a taste and it's time
But I won’t let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
Alone you can’t make amends
No, I won’t let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
It’s enough with this fucking incense
Just spare me the suspense
There are seven ancient pawn shops along the road
Oh I know seven aging daddies you may want to know
When you played your heart out, you made me turn around
Ooh, right on
Wait, oh, you froze in the night
You're late, there's a hole in the sky
No haste, no lesson, no lie
Got a taste that I can't deny
(Spare me the suspense)
And you wait till you know that it's time
You wait till you know that it's time
You wait till you know that it's time
You wait till you know that it's time
You say to me, set black fires, do you know?
You say to me, set black fires1Embed
