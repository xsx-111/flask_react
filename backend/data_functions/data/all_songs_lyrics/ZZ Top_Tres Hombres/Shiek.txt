Shiek Lyrics
I met a shiek from Mozambique
Who led me to the Congo
He dreamed to go to Mexico
And sample a burrito
My temperature had risen again
It must have been a hundred and ten

Under the oaks I was telling some jokes
And thinking I had it made
Getting on with the folks, having some Coke
Cooling off in the shade
My temperature had risen again
And it must have been a hundred and ten
Hmm!

I took a boat that couldn't float
To Rio de Janeiro
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba
But I'll be gone tomorrow
My temperature had risen again
It must have been a hundred and ten
