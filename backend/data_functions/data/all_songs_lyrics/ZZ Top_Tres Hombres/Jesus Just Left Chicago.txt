Jesus Just Left Chicago Lyrics
Jesus just left Chicago
And he's bound for New Orleans
Well now, Jesus just left Chicago
And he's bound for New Orleans, yeah
Working from one end to the other
And all points in between

Took a jog through Mississippi
Well, muddy water turned to wine
Took a jog through Mississippi
Muddy water turned to wine, yeah
Then out to California
Through the forests and the pines
Ah, take me with you, Jesus

You might not see him in person
But he'll see you just the same
You might not see him in person
But he'll see you just the same, hey
You don't have to worry
Because taking care of business is his name
