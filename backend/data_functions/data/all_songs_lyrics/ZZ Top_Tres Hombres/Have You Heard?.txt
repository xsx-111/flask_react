Have You Heard? Lyrics
Have you heard about Jo Ti Mahr?
Yeah yeah yeah
Well, then you could not be lost
Yeah yeah yeah
Which way are you comin' from?
Goin' up or gettin' down?
Well, have you thought about it some
Or have you put it down?

Have you heard about Heaven?
Yeah yeah yeah
Seven come eleven
Yeah yeah yeah

Have you heard, dear brother?
Yeah yeah yeah
Well, let's help one another
Yeah yeah yeah
Have you heard? Oh yeah
Have you heard? (have you heard)
Oh yeah (uh-hu)
Have you heard? (have you heard)
Oh yeah (uh-hu)
Have you heard? (have you heard)
Oh yeah (uh-hu)
Have you heard? (have you heard it)
Oh yeah
Have you heard? (have you heard it)
Oh yeah
Have you heard? Oh yeahEmbed
