Hot, Blue and Righteous Lyrics
Hot, blue and righteous
An angel called me aside
Hot, blue and righteous
Said, "Stick by me and I'll be your guide"
I heard the words as I closed my eyes
Down on my, down on my bended knees
It fit like a glove and I realized
Something good's happening to me

Hot, blue and righteous
An angel called me aside
Ooh, ooh, ooh1Embed
