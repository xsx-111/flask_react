Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers Lyrics
And if you see me walking down the line
With my favorite honky tonk in mind
Well, I'll be here around supper time
With my can of dinner and a bunch of wine

Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah
Baby, don't you want to come with me?
And the crowd gets loud
When the band gets right
Steel guitar crying through the night
Yeah, trying to cover up the corner fight
But everything's cool because they just tight

Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah
Baby, don't you want to come with me?
Ah, play it boy!

The joint was jumping like a cat on hot tin
Lord, I thought the floor was gonna give in
Soundin' a lot like
They got House Congressional
Cause we're experimental and professional
Beer drinkers, hell raisers, yeah
Well, baby don't you want to come with me?
