Precious and Grace Lyrics
Riding top the floodway on a Friday night
The landscape's a fine and natural sight
Just cruising slow through the dark of night
With Precious and Grace everything's all right

Good God Almighty
We was going down slow
Yeah, if we knew just where we had to go
Crying, just a flying down a put out road
With Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford

So if you're out rolling late some night
Yeah, and you need that supernatural delight
I'm talking to you, brother
I know somebody's, they's just out of sight
Get with Precious and Grace
They gonna to treat you right
