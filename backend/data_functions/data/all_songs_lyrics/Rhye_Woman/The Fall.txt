The Fall Lyrics
Ooh, make love to me
One more time, before you go away
Why can't you stay?
Ooh, my love...Come home to me
Just for a while, I'll leave this piece of you
Why can't you stay?

Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
(Don't ruin this heart of mine)

The sun is gone
It fell into the fall
But I don't want it this way
Why can't you stay?

Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
Dont run away
There should be words
There should be words that explain the way
But I'm tongue tied and twisted
Where's those words...


Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear16Embed
