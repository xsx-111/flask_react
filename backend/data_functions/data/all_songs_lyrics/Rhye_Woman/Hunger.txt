I’m not alone, just feel like a shadow
Call it fate, I’m stuck in this state
Tangled myself in these silkened threads
Tucked in these mangled bed with this marbled pig's head

Hungry in this cell we've made for ourselves
Can you hear that sound? (hear that sound)
It’s running through the ground (oh, the ground)

I’ll show my teeth, pull the sword from the sheath
Started to drool down the side of your face
I thought we were made from love
Now we are eating our own rind
Thought we were made from love
Now we are eating our own rind

Hungry in this cell we've made for ourselves
Can you hear that sound? (hear that sound)
It’s running through the ground (oh, the ground)

Hungry in this cell we've made for ourselves
Can you hear that sound? (hear that sound)
It’s running through the ground (oh, the ground)
It's the way we were made to be
Tripping on our own feet
‘Cause we’ve poisoned those wells (poisoned those wells)
We dug for ourselves5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
