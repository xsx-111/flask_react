Shed Some Blood Lyrics
Sitting in your space asking myself why
Sitting in your space asking myself why you can stave off
I'm walking through that door (I don't wanna be)
I'm shattered to the core

We shed some tears baby
We shed some tears baby, oh
We shed some blood
Move my way
Move my way
So move my way

Speeding my home on this road to oblivion
Don't want to hear your voice on the phone
Want to be your choice not just a moan
Don't call me love unless you mean it
Don't call me love unless you mean it
Don't call me love unless you mean it
Don't call me love unless you mean it
At least not to my face

We shed some tears baby
We shed some tears baby, oh
We shed some blood
Move my way
Move my way
Move my way
So move2Embed
