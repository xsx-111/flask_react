Verse Lyrics
Oh my song says it all
Do you hear it in the verse?
Oh I'll call when you see it on my face
See it on my face

Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
(Oh I know...)

In the morning light, those circles fade
I've always hated that moment
It's bittersweet in my mouth
Just as we face ourselves
Oh my song says it all
Do you hear it in the verse?

Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Oh I know...
Oh I know...
Oh I know...

We've comped this bass together
Let's build
Let's build7Embed
