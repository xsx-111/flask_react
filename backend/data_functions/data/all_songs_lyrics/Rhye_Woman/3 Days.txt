3 Days Lyrics
Oh, I'm famished
So I'll eat your minerals
Like a rabid beast at a foolish feast
I'll steal your breath
Like a twisted thief with a mangled glove
It's just my nature, I ruin love
It's just my nature, I ruin love

Stealing kisses in those misses within beats
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
I'm killing you... I'm killing you
Stealing kisses in those misses within beats
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
I'm killing you... I'm killing you

There's a window in time
3 days to feel each other crack this spine
It's gonna break, cave in on itself
Love is terminal, not built to last
Burn bright, burn fast
Burn bright, burn fast

Stealing kisses in those misses within beats
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
I'm killing you... I'm killing you
Stealing kisses in those misses within beats
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
I'm killing you... I'm killing you
So many ways
So many ways

We got 3 days to feel each other

We got 3 days to feel each other
We got 3 days to sing this song
We got 3 days to feel each other
We got 3 days to sing this song
We got 3 days to feel each other
We got 3 days to sing this song10Embed
