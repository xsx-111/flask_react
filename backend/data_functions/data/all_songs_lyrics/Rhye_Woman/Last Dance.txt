Last Dance Lyrics
Tell me lies and lullabies
But don’t tell me to change
Ohhh, don’t give me that face
Sick with hope, cracks in this heels
Bitter seal fashioned from steal

Ohhh, this last dance, turn away (turn away)
Ohhh, this last dance (this last dance)
To walk away (walk away)

Tell me lies and lullabies
But don’t tell me to change
Ohhh, don’t give me that face
These oily feathers prepped for a fight
Game on, game on, game on tonight

Ohhh, this last dance, turn away (oh turn away)
Ohhh, this last dance (this last dance)
To walk away

This last dance
It’s tough to face (tough to face)
It's tough to face (it's tough to face)
This last dance (this last dance)
This last dance (this last dance)
It’s tough to face (tough to face)
It's tough to face (it's tough to face)
This last dance (this last dance)
This last dance
Tell me lies and lullabies
But don’t tell me to change, no
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but don’t give me that face
Ooh Whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa2Embed
