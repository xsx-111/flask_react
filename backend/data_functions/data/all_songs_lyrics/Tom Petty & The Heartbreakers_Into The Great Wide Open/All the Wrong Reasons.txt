All the Wrong Reasons Lyrics
Trouble blew in on a cold, dark wind
It came without no warning
And that big ol' house went up for sale
They were on the road by morning
Oh, the days went slow into the changing season
Oh, out in the cold for all the wrong reasons

Well, she grew up hard and she grew up fast
In the age of television
And she made a vow to have it all
It became her new religion
Oh, down in her soul, it was an act of treason
Oh, down they go for all the wrong reasons

Where the sky begins, the horizon ends
Despite the best intentions
And a big old man goes up for sale
He becomes his own invention
Oh, the days go slow into the changing season
Oh, bought and sold for all the wrong reasons

Oh, down they go for all the wrong reasonsEmbed
