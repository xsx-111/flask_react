Out in the Cold Lyrics
The day fell down, the air got cold
I walked out in the street
Daydreamed for a mile or two
Staring at my feet
Like a workin' boy out of luck
Fallin' through the cracks
Night rolled in, I turned back home
A hard wind at my back

I'm out in the cold (Out in the cold)
Body and soul (Out in the cold)
There's nowhere to go (Out in the cold)
I'm out in the cold (Out in the cold)

Well, I woke up, my brain was stunned
I could not come around
I reached out to grab my keys
And tumbled to the ground
I thought of you, starry-eyed
I wonder where we stand
Did I just fall from your arms
Down into your hands?
I'm out in the cold (Out in the cold)
Body and soul (Out in the cold)
There's nowhere to go (Out in the cold)
I'm out in the cold (Out in the cold)

I'm out
Standin' in a doorway
I'm out
Walkin' around
Hands in my pockets

I'm out in the cold (Out in the cold)
Body and soul (Out in the cold)
With nowhere to go (Out in the cold)
I'm out in the cold (Out in the cold)Embed
