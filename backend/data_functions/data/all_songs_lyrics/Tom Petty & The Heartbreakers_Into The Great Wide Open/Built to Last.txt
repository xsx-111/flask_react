Built to Last Lyrics
Somewhere out my doorway
Somewhere down my block
I can hear her heartbeat in rhythm with my clock

I want her more than diamonds
I want her more than gold
I want her more than anything anyone could hold

We were built to last on until forever
The world is changing fast, but our love was built to last

She has followed me down
Along some empty streets
She has followed me where the rain would fall in sheets

And I know I've been changing
Changing like the wind
I was feeling burned out, I got tired of it

We were built to last on until forever
The world is changing fast, but our love was built to last
So come to me, my darling
Hold me while I sleep
I know you feel lost, but you're not in too deep

We were built to last on until forever
The world is changing fast, but our love was built to last
We were built to last on until forever
The world is changing fast, but our love was built to lastEmbed
