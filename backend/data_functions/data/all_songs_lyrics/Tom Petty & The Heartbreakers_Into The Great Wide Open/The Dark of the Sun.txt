The Dark of the Sun Lyrics
In the dark of the sun
Will you save me a place?
Give me hope, give me comfort
Get me to a better place

I saw you sail across a river
Underneath Orion's sword
In your eyes, there was a freedom
I had never known before

Hey, yeah, yeah
In the dark of the sun
We will stand together
Yeah we will stand as one
In the dark of the sun

Past my days of great confusion
Yeah, past my days of wondering why
Will I sail into the heavens
Constellations in my eyes?

Hey, yeah, yeah
In the dark of the sun
We will stand together
Yeah we will stand as one
Hey, yeah, yeah
In the dark of the sun
We will stand together
Yeah we will stand as one
In the dark of the sun
Hey, yeah, yeah
In the dark of the sun
Oh, in the dark of the sunEmbed
