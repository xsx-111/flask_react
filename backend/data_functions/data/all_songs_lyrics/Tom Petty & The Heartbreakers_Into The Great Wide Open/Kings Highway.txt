Kings Highway Lyrics
When the time gets right, I'm gonna pick you up
And take you far way from trouble, my love
Under a big ol' sky out in a field of green
There's gotta be something left for us to believe

Oh, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

No, you can't hide out in a six-gun town
We wanna hold our heads up, but we gotta stay down
I don't wanna end up in a room all alone
Don't wanna end up someone that I don't even know

Lover, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway
Yeah, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway
Yeah, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings HighwayEmbed
