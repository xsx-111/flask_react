Too Good to Be True Lyrics
Her imagination ran wild
Could this really happen to me?
She could barely hold back the tears

It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true

Everything that she'd waited for
Everything that she'd dared to dream
Suddenly was outside her door

It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true

There was no talk of giving in
And just as hope was wearing thin
Her eyes were like a child again
Too good to be true
Morning on the outskirts of town
Sitting in the traffic alone
You don't know what it means to be free

And it was too good to be true
It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true
Too good to be trueEmbed
