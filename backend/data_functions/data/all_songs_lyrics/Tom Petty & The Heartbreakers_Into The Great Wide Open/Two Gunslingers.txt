Two Gunslingers Lyrics
Two gunslingers walked out in the street
And one said, "I don't want to fight no more"
And the other gunslinger thought about it
And he said, "Yeah, what are we fighting for?"

I'm takin' control of my life
I'm takin' control of my life
I'm takin' control of my life now
Right now, oh yeah

Well, the crowd that assembled for the gunfight were let down
Everyone hissed and booed and a stranger told his missus
"That's the last one of these gunfights
You're ever gonna drag me to"

I'm takin' control of my life
I'm takin' control of my life
I'm takin' control of my life now
Right now, oh yeah

Well, the two gunslingers went ridin' out of town
And were never heard from no more
And there ain't been a gunfight for a long time
Maybe never, but nobody knows for sure
I'm takin' control of my life
I'm takin' control of my life
I'm takin' control of my life now
Right now, oh yeah
Now, right now, oh yeah
Now, right now, oh yeah1Embed
