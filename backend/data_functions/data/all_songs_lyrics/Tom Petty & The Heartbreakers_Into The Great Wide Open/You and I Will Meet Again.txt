You and I Will Meet Again Lyrics
You and I will meet again
When we're least expecting it
Somewhere in some far-off place
I will recognize your face
I won't say goodbye, my friend
For you and I will meet again

I heard you singing to no one
I saw you dancing all alone
One day you belong to me
Next day I just wouldn't know
One day all the rules will bend
And you and I will meet again

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling so strong
Maybe someday our roads will cross

A red-winged hawk is circling
The blacktop stretches out for days
How could I get so close to you
And still feel so far away?
I hear a voice come on the wind
Saying you and I will meet again
I don't know how, I don't know when
But you and I will meet againEmbed
