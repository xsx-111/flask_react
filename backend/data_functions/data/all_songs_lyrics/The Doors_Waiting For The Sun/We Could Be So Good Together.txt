We Could Be So Good Together Lyrics
We could be so good together
Yeah, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah we could, I know we could

Tell you lies
I tell you wicked lies
Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies

Tell you about the world that we'll invent
Wanton world without lament
Enterprise, expedition
Invitation and invention

Yeah, so good together
Oh, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah we could, know we could
Alright!
Do-da do-do-do, do-do bup-bup bup today

We could be so good together
Yeah, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah we could, know we could

Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies
Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies

The time you wait subtracts the joy
Beheads the angels you destroy
Angels fight, angels cry
Angels dance and angels die

Yeah, so good together
Oh, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah we could, know we couldEmbed
