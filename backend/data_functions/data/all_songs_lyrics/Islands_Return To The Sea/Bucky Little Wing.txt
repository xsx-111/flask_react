Bucky Little Wing Lyrics
Passed him by a long time ago
But didn't stop to pick him up that
Day even though he was late
We drove by

A year later my family moved
He moved to the same town far away
We became friends, smoked cigs, played ball together in all kinds of weather
We worked on our jump shot

Bucky little wing, you flew away

His name was Charles, he was my friend
We got along, but in the end
Bucky little wing, you flew away

It was tough being weak, while Bucky was strong
His daddy died in a car wreck
And I got sick of being pushed around
Standing my ground when Bucky had my back
Hiding in a bush and it's okay

We started rolling with a different crew
Before I knew it we drifted to
Bucky little wing, you flew away

Then some racist kids, this is what I heard
Pushed him underneath a moving truck
It swerved but got his head on accident
They ran like devils in the night

Word was he died. I didn't cry but oh, oh how I tried
Monday came and he did too, so he didn't die
Just some violet bruises and one shut eye

Can't believe that he survived
He was like a ghost after that day
But he was just so mighty you might say

His name was Charles, he was my friend
We got along but in the end
Bucky little wing, you flew away
Bucky little wing, you flew awayEmbed
