Jogging Gorgeous Summer Lyrics
Woke up with rain on my head
Can't drive off so what should I do instead?
Swim to the biggest flower there
To warm(?) you and kiss you, my love
So when the storm clouds dissolved into thin air
Like when my hands got lost in your thick hair
The dogs barked long days, not dark
The sky's blue so what should we do?

We can do anything we want to

Millions of sunsets, but the one I'll remember
The one where you told me you'd love me forever

Took a long walk into the woods
Climbed in the world's biggest tree
And then they tried to cut it down
But we didn't make a sound
The sun blinded them
They couldn't see
Woke up next to you in your bed
Another day to do it all again
Creeped out into the sun
Another day to give you all my love

Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember
Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember

Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember
Is the one where you told me you'd love me foreverEmbed
