If Lyrics
If the clothes make the man
Then the moths make the holes
And it shows
Yes it shows
By the shape the hole grows

If early man really did mate
With Neanderthal then
Modern man
Is a mix
Of bestial sex

If you ain't sweet to me
I'll desert you in a heartbeat
If you don't savor me
I'll salt you, make you savory

If the boy keeps on hitting his head
Against the dash of the car
Will the horsefly leave his ear
Will the blood make it hard?
If you ain't sweet to me
I'll desert you in a heartbeat
If you don't savor me
I'll salt you, make you savory

If sequencing genes
Brings them back to breed
Will we get along
With them this time?

If you ain't sweet to me
I'll desert you in a heartbeat
If you don't savor me
I'll salt you, make you savory

When the sky finally falls
If you're holding me
I can die finally knowing
It ends peacefullyEmbed
