Swans (Life After Death) Lyrics

Swans, swans, swans sing songs all night long
Who knew how warm the islands were?
While the frogs look on
It's what the birds prefer
And it's still warm after the sun has gone

I woke up thirsty the day I died
And the tide was swirling
My mouth is so dry
And all I see is sea to shining seas

Swans, swans, swans sing songs all night long
Who knew how warm the islands would be?
And who knew just how much the sky covers me?
It makes you forget what it means to be free

I climbed into the blowhole
In the ribs, I found you
With a wick, we lit a flame
Now look at the smoke that it blew
The mouth is so wide
Yet all I see is sea and azure sky
A little wave and ebb tide
Rivers leak
Salt seeps in
Heals wounds
Winds pry apart
Rivers leak
Salt seeps in
Heals wounds
Winds pry apart
Rivers leak
Salt seeps in
Heals wounds
Winds pry apart

Swans, swans, swans sung songs
'Til the morning dawned on us
And the sun-smudged peach moon
Still hung loose
Bones, bones, bones grown homes
With the sparrows in the trees we leave them for
They love the marrow

I'm thankful for my life
I'm thankful for my life1Embed
