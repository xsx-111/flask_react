Rough Gem Lyrics
The world beat you for something nice
You worked hard, died poor
You mined what you died for
Diamonds

You can whistle my name
It's the mines in Africa
That are to blame
You can scoop out my brain
Shape it into an ear and then tell me your pain

Held death at bay from the first day
Stayed awake, stayed awake
The rabbit was removed under the whole moon
Long bird, short road

Dig deep but don't dig too deep
When it's late you'll see the hole is empty
And oh so deadly
They want me raw and smooth like glass
They want it fast but they don't want flaws
I'm a girl's best friend
Can you cut, I can cut
Cause I'm a rough gem
Who lives in those lights in the distance?
Watered down, the rain will help you out
I had a dream it was all a dream
But it was ruined by the sun shining through meEmbed
