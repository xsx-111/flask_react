Humans Lyrics
Love bird, you flew into my window
Now in the sticky love nest sits a widow
The tree it fell on all the people
Who'd gathered there to watch it topple
Now turn around, it's burning down
The city we live in
Should we mobilize? Take them by surprise?
Let them have their way with us?
No myrrh, speed by old enemies
Broke my heart to see
Foundations ripped apart and investments fade away
I guess we got off to a bad start

No oxygen
What is the outcome?
Hungry humans
We've got to eat some of them
We'll burn those bridges
When we come to them
I'm not just their leader
I'm also one of them
The food supply has been depleted
The river's run dry just when it was needed
The rats come out to take it over
Singing, squeaking, "We built this city"
It's hard to breathe but we couldn't leave
Nowhere left to go
Almost everybody died; drank the tears from those who cried
We shrivelled from the sodium
And a map was found with an X on it
So we followed it there
And what did we find? An underground design
As we entered in, to our surprise

Oxygen
Rivers and playgrounds
The ancients just stayed down
They never stopped moving
We stumbled towards them
But they locked all the barn doors
So we had to dig deeper
We had to dig deeper
And the deep was dark; I wanted to sleep
Forever, wake up later, maybe never
We had to build a civilization
Let the planet focus on the planet's rotation
We tried, we tried, we really tried
But no one could do it
Not really alive, never learned how to survive
We were humans being useless


No oxygen
What is the outcome?
Hungry humans
We've got to eat some of them
We'll burn those bridges
When we come to them
I'm not just their leader
I'm also one of them

We fade into oblivion
No traces of civilized living eating the earth
We're fading to oblivion
No traces of civilized living eaten by earthEmbed
