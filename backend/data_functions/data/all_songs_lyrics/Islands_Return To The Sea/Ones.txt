Ones Lyrics
In my mouth, my eyes, my ears, my nose
Then my limbs are free like trees let leaves
Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave

Blue, can't move my head, my head, my head
Go home, go home, go home

My legs can't stand, anymore
With wings, things would be far, even if they were near
Here in my head

Close my eyes and see ones
Here in my head
Close my eyes and see ones
Here in my head

Some voice said stand 'cause you can
And that's all that you have
You're not in this alone
We all live in awkward little homes
We all live in our
Heads, our legs, our toes, our eyes, our throats
Homes, homes, homes, homes, homesEmbed
