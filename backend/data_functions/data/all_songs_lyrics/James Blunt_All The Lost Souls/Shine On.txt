Shine On Lyrics
Are they calling for our last dance?
I see it in your eyes
In your eyes
Same old moves for a new romance
I could use the same old lies, but I'll sing

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out
But it paid for the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
Cause they're all just slaves to the gods they made
But you and I just shone
Just shone

And when silence greets my last goodbye
The words I need are in your eyes, and I'll sing
