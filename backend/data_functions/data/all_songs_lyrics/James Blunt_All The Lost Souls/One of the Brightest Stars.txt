One of the Brightest Stars Lyrics
One day your story will be told
One of the lucky ones who's made his name
One day they'll make you glorious
Beneath the lights of your deserved fame

And it all comes round
Once in a lifetime like it always does
Everybody loves you cause you've taken a chance
Out on a dance to the moon
Too soon

And they'll say told you so
We were the ones who saw you first of all
We always knew that you were one of the brightest stars

One day they'll tell you that you've changed
Though they're the ones who seem to stop and stare
One day you'll hope to make the grave
Before the papers choose to send you there

And it all comes round
Once in a lifetime like it always does
Nobody loves you cause you've taken a chance
Out on a dance to the moon
Too soon
And they'll say told you so
We were the ones who saw you first of all
We always knew that you were one of the brightest stars

And they'll say told you so
We were the ones who saw you first of all
We always knew that you were one of the brightest starsEmbed
