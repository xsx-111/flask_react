Same Mistake Lyrics
Saw the world turning in my sheets
And once again, I cannot sleep
Walk out the door and up the street
Look at the stars beneath my feet
Remember rights that I did wrong
So here I go
Oh ooh-
Oh ooh-
Oh ooh-
Hello, hello. There is no place I cannot go
My mind is muddy but my heart is heavy. Does it show?
I lose the track that loses me, so here I go
Oh ooh-
Oh ooh-
Oh ooh-
And so I sent some men to fight, and one came back at dead of night
Said he'd seen my enemy. Said he looked just like me
So I set out to cut myself and here I go
Oh ooh-
Oh ooh-
Oh ooh-

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
Cause I'll just make the same mistake again
Oh ooh-
And maybe someday we will meet
And maybe talk, and not just speak
Don't buy the promises, cause
There are no promises I keep
And my reflection troubles me
So here I go
Ah ooh-
Ah ooh-
Ah ooh-

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
Cause I'll just make the same mistake
I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
Cause I'll just make the same mistake again
Ah ooh-
Ah ooh-
Ah ooh-
Ah ooh-
Saw the world turning in my sheets (Ah ooh-)
And once again, I cannot sleep (Ah ooh-)
Walk out the door and up the street (Ah ooh-)
Look at the stars (Ah ooh-)
Look at the stars fall down (Ah ooh-)
And wonder where (Ah ooh-)
Did I go wrong?3Embed
