Give Me Some Love Lyrics
Me and my guitar play my way
It makes them frown
But little pieces by the highway bring me down
Mine is not a heart of stone, I am only skin and bone
And those little pieces are little pieces of my own

Why don't you give me some love?
I've taken ship-load of drugs
I'm so tired of never fixing the pain
Valium said to me
I'll take you seriously
And we'll come back as someone else
Who's better than yourself

Many faces at the doorway all hang round
Watch me fighting in the hallway but make no sound
So I'm standing all alone, and I'm only skin and bone
So many faces but they all look out for their own


And some day soon they'll drop the bomb and let it all out. Someday
I know that someday soon we'll all be gone so let it all out
Let it all out today
And give me some love
Yeah, give me some love
Come on, give me some love todayEmbed
