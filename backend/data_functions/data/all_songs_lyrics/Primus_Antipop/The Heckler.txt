The Heckler Lyrics
Through the door, it slithers in, accompanied by its peers
Always groveling for attention while no one ever hears
In its mind, it's full of wit and quite the social king
Plants itself among the rest to give the deadly sting

It's just a matter of opinion
It's just a matter of opinion
It's just a matter of opinion

Further now there's a man of taste, of talent and precision
To work and strive at his art form has been his life's decision
The stage is set, the perfect show is put before the mass
Only to be ridiculed by some slimy, pompous--

It's just a matter of opinion
It's just a matter of opinion
Yeah

It's just a matter of opinionEmbed
