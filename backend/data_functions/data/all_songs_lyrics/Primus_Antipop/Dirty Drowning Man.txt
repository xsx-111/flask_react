Dirty Drowning Man Lyrics
I'm a dog, a dirty flying dog
I drink Campari with marinated wild hog
I've no sense; I lick electric fence
I put barbed wire in my pants and do a celtic dance
But when I can, I am a givin' man
I'll flip you out the fire, and back up into the fryin' pan

If you're down lookin' like you're gonna drown
Of all your friends, I'm the one who's most apt to stick around

I'm a drownin' man
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this dirty drownin' man?

You're so fine, so bright and shiny fine
And I'm so proud to say that you in fact are a friend of mine
And doubly pleased with crooked and wobbly knees
I dive on in and backstroke right across these seas of cheese
But on the times when I'm not such a giving man
Please flip me out of the fire and backup into the frying pan
If you're down lookin' like your gonna drown
Of all your friends, I'm the one who's most apt to stick around

I'm a drownin' man
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this dirty drownin' man?

I'm a dog, a dirty flying dog
I drink Campari with marinated wild hog
I've no sense; I lick electric fence
I put barbed wire in my pants and do a celtic dance
But when I can, I am a givin' man
I'll flip you out the fire, and back up into the fryin' pan

If you're down lookin' like you're gonna drown
Of all your friends, I'm the one who's most apt to stick around

I'm a drownin' man
(Who will save this drowning man?)
Who will save this drownin' man?
(Who will save this drowning man?)
Who will save this drownin' man?
(Who will save this drowning man?)
Who will save this dirty drownin' man?
If you're down lookin' like you're gonna drown
Of all your friends, I'm the one who's most apt to stick around

I'm a drownin' man
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this dirty drownin' man?
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this drownin' man?
Who will save this drownin' man?

Who will save this drownin' man?Embed
