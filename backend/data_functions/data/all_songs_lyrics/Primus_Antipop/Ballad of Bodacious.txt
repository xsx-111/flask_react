Ballad of Bodacious Lyrics
Who's gonna ride Bodacious? Who's gonna tame him down?
Look out for Bodacious, he's bound to hold his ground
Here comes Bodacious, y'all just step aside
Big and bad Bodacious takes a toll from those who ride

Bodacious here, I'm a whole lotta bull, over nineteen hundred pounds
He's born in Goltry, Oklahoma. and he's the baddest sonsabitch around
If a Burma bull ever were a superstar, then Bodacious just might be
He's a cream-colored, beefy brawn, full-fledged, four-footed bovine celebrity

Who's gonna ride Bodacious? Who's gonna tame him down?
Look out for Bodacious, he's bound to hold his ground
Here comes Bodacious, y'all just step aside
Big and bad Bodacious takes a toll from those who ride

Young Bo met a man named Tuff Hedeman at the start of his buckin' spree
And Tuff became one of the few to make the whistle back in nineteen ninety-three
Tuff tried to ride Bo again at the finals in nineteen ninety-five
Bodacious had got a little older and wiser, Tuff barely come out alive

Bodacious here, I'm a whole lotta bull, over nineteen hundred pounds
He's born in Goltry, Oklahoma. and he's the baddest sonsabitch around
If a Burma bull ever were a superstar, then Bodacious just might be
He's a cream-colored, beefy, brawn, full-fledged superstar, bovine celebrity
Who's gonna ride Bodacious? Who's gonna tame him down?
Look out for Bodacious, he's bound to hold his ground
Here comes Bodacious, y'all just step aside
Big and bad Bodacious takes a toll from those who ride

Who's gonna ride Bodacious? Who's gonna tame him down?
Look out for Bodacious, he's bound to hold his ground
Here come the Bodacious, y'all just step aside
Big, badass Bodacious will take a big hunk outta your prideEmbed
