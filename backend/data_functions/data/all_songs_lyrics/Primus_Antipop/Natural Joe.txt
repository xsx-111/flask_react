Natural Joe Lyrics
There's a boy out 'luma way
Named Joe Eugene
He's one mellow-ass son of a bitch-a
He loves that wheat grass
And cold bean curd
He's one healthy-ass son of a bitch-a

But late at night
He sneaks on down to the liquor store
For a bottle of sheep dip

Natural Joe
Got an easy flow
Wherever he goes
They say, "Here comes Joe"

Joe, he's a happy man
And he won't do you wrong
He's one respectable son of a bitch-a
Now Joe ain't no patriarch
But he's smooth with the girls
He ain't no chauvinistic son of a bitch-a
But late at night
He sneaks on down to the porno store
For a little bit of...

Natural Joe
He's hanging low
Wherever he goes
They say, "Here comes Joe"

There's a boy out 'luma way
Named Joe Eugene
He's one mellow-ass son of a bitch-a
He don't like firearms
He don't own knives
He's one pacifistic son of a bitch-a

But late at night
He eases on down to the video store
For a little bit of...

Natural Joe
Got an easy flow
Wherever he goes
They say, "Here comes Joe"
Natural Joe
Looking slow and low
Look, there he goes
Go, Natural JoeEmbed
