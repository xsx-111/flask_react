The Final Voyage of the Liquid Sky Lyrics
I've been fightin' gravity since I was two

Questers of the prize
Blind men in the snow
Some streak the skies
I choose to go below

Skin moves toward malignant
Worshipping the sun
They clamber over corpses
To be the chosen ones

Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid sky

Descend through the darkness
To the vast terrain
Down here on the bottom
You rarely hear the rain

Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid sky
Drift along liquid skyEmbed
