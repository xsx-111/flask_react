Power Mad Lyrics
I do not wear panties, I never worn panties, but if called upon, panties I will wear
Big white house panties, or small delicate European briefs
Whatever panties  strap up  panties but...

Oh, here he comes

Military show is blastin' off to Kosovo
Military show with lightning speed
Sensitivity, oh, just a rusty nail in the corporate show
How many stabs before we bleed?
Those Pinocchios chattering out in stereo
Boy Pinocchio and his golden deed
Masculinity, oh, galvanized in the worldwide show
As we fertilize the seed

Power-mad, I didn't chop the tree down dad
I only try to do what's right
Power-mad, the best friend that you ever had
Unless, of course, you choose to fight

Power-mad, driving out of the shadows
He never tires when he plays
Power-mad, he's a streak in the nighttime
Speculating how he'll take on the world someday
Originality, oh, just a rusty nail in a Broadway show
How many stabs before we succeed

Power-mad, I didn't drop my pants down dad
I know my left hand from my right
Power-mad, the best friend that you ever had
Unless, of course, you lose the fight

Power-mad, driving out of the shadows
He never tires when he plays
Power-mad, he's a streak in the nighttime
Speculating how he'll take on the world

Power-mad, driving out of the shadows
He never tires when he plays
Power-mad, he's a streak in the nighttime
Speculating how he'll
Take on the world someday1Embed
