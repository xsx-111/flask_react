Eclectic Electric Lyrics
Bring me back again
I'd really rather not be out here on my own
Someone reel me in
I'm drifting ever farther from my home

I remember when I was a baby
Gazing in amazement at the sky
Sing it twinkle twinkle little baby
Daddy's gonna learn you to fly
High
Like a comet through the sky

Bring me back again
I'd really rather not be out here on my own
I'm drifting with the wind
Trying to hold the course that I've been shown

I remember when I was a baby
Staring in amazement at the sun
Better shield your eyes now little baby
No one ever said you were the one
No one ever said you were the one
No one ever said you were the one
Who can't be blinded by the sun
I think I'm blinded by the sun
I like to taunt, I like to tease
I'll bring your psyche to its knees
Juggling
Sanity is coming to your town
Who gives a damn what you say
You're pissing all your dreams away
Juggling
Sanity is coming to your town
Juggling
Sanity is coming to your
Sanity is coming to your
Sanity is coming to your town

I remember when I was a baby
Gazing in amazement at the sky
I remember when I was a baby
Gazing in amazement at the sky

Better shield your eyes now little baby
Better shield your eyes now little baby
Better shield your eyes now little baby
Pressing onward through the night
