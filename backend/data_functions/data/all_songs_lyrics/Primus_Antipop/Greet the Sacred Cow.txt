Greet the Sacred Cow Lyrics
Slice me off a big slab
Of that sympathetic cheer
If I'm zapped with the radiation
They say I'll last another year
Huh!

Line 'em up now
To greet the sacred cow

My hands are full of protein
My arms are made of fire
If you're calling me a diplomat
Then I'll be calling you a liar
Huh!

Line 'em up now
Line 'em up now
Line 'em up now
To greet the sacred cow

Line 'em up now
Line 'em up now
Line 'em up now
Line 'em up now
To greet the sacred cow
Line 'em up now
Line 'em up now
To kill the sacred cowEmbed
