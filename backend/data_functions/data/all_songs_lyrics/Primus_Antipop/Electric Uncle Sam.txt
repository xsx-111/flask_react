Electric Uncle Sam Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah

I am the plan
I am the man
Who tells you what, and when you can
I'm the old one that torments you
I am the voice that tells you to

Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie
Mess with me and, boy, you're surely gonna die
If ever you're in doubt about who or where I am
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere, I am your Uncle Sam
Electric Uncle Sam

You beg me please, on bended knees
Not to sit among the enemies
If you feel like you wanna dance
Then step aside and take a chance

Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie
Mess with me and, boy, you're surely gonna die
If ever you're in doubt about who or where I am
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere, I am your Uncle Sam
Electric Uncle Sam
Yeah
I am your Uncle Sam
Yeah
I am your Uncle Sam
Yeah
