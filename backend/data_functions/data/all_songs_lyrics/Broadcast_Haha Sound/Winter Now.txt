Winter Now Lyrics
Snow lies all around, there's no sense of doubt
You are the only one to keep me sane when all is wrong

Oh, my heart waits in winter now

Deep in every dream, though you're far from me
There in the deepest snow, I only wanted you to know

Oh, my heart waits in winter now

Falling quietly there reminding me, though it's just a dream
You're closer than you've ever been

Oh, my heart waits in winter now4Embed
