Ominous Cloud Lyrics
Oh, let me sail away
From the beach and lonely bay
The boats on the sea are blissfully free
They will come to no harm
'cause the waves are so calm

Oh, let me think a while
To the playground of your smile
The wind through the flame
Whistles your name
Though you said goodbye
You did not leave my mind

Oh, I've got to get away
From this town, don't want to face
The ominous clouds
Oh, not now, not now, not now
I've got to find a place
Be myself and learn to face
The ominous clouds
But not now, not now, not now
I'm gonna sail away
Want to look back on the bay
And hide with my hand
What's left of the land
Though I leave it behind
It will not leave my mind

Oh, I've got to get away
From this town, don't want to face
The ominous clouds
Oh, not now, not now, not now
I've got to find a place
Be myself and learn to face
The ominous clouds
But not now, not now, not now

Oh, not now, not now, not now
But not now, not now, not now2Embed
