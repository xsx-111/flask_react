Lunch Hour Pops Lyrics
I wait on the stairs for a break in my mind
Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside
I wait on the stairs for my thoughts to align
You are the sun in my mind
You are the sun in my mind

Clouds rock like a ship at sea
Sooth the waves of injury
Clouds rock like a ship at sea
Sooth the waves of injury

I wait on the stairs, there's a view in my mind
Objects of love in the sky
Objects of love in the sky
I wait on the stairs for my thoughts to be kind
What better view will I find?
What better view will I find?

Inflated with transparency
Float away my injury
Inflated with transparency
Float away my injury
Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside

I wait on the stairs for a break in my mind
Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside

Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside
Let the balloons go outside2Embed
