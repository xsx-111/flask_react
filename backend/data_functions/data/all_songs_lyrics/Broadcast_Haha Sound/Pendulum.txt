Pendulum Lyrics
Captured under hypnosis, faster and faster images, ah-ah-ah
Can a meaning be obtained or this mystery explained?

I'm in orbit, held by magnet
And the force feels so much closer than love

Logic offers no defence underneath this influence, ah-ah-ah
While this puzzle of intent holds emotion in suspense

I'm in orbit, held by magnet
And the force feels so much closer than love

Caught between the day and night
And a knot that pulls too tight, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

I'm in orbit, held by magnet
And the force feels so much closer than love2Embed
