Before We Begin Lyrics
Here again, at the end
Before the beginning
So the salt will spill again
Throw it over your shoulder

Oh, it's in tomorrow, fortune or sorrow
Wait, you may win
I don't mean to show that I know how this goes
Before we begin, again

You may hide on one side
And me on the other
You may speak, but wait for me
Should my sentence faulter

Oh, it's in tomorrow, fortune or sorrow
Wait, you may win
But now it feels empty, there's no need in guessing
Before we begin again

Oh, it's in tomorrow, fortune or sorrow
Wait, you may win
But now it feels empty, there's no need in guessing
Before we begin, again
So, here we are, again
Back to the beginning
So the salt will spill again
Throw it over your shoulder

Oh, it's in tomorrow, fortune or sorrow
Wait, you may win
I don't mean to show that I know how this goes
Before we begin, again3Embed
