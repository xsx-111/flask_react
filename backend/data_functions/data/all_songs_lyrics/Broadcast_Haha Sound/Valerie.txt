Valerie Lyrics
Inside the mask, another disguise
I fall to sleep before closing my eyes
Tiredness draws in my head a cartoon
Sun at the window, good things coming soon

Shake your earrings over my head
Lay down your dreams on my pillow before bed

The silence of ice at the borders of day
Sun in my face will not keep them away
Sinking me into the white of your room
Sky through the curtain, good things coming soon

Shake your earrings over my head
Lay down your dreams on my pillow before bed
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Shake your earrings over my head
Lay down your dreams on my pillow before bed1Embed
