Man Is Not a Bird Lyrics
The sky is faint, there tears remain in me
The rain has stopped falling
The fading light, walls barely white in me
The night has stopped calling

I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside

Here in this room, no more a tomb
Thoughts of you conclude without ending
Caution will keep, worries still speak
Fewer the leaves are descending

I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside

Here in this room, no more a tomb
Thoughts of you conclude without ending

The lonely distance and time
The only tears falling outside
I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside2Embed
