Colour Me In Lyrics
I am grey, still on the page
Oh, colour me in
Just an outline, sketchy but fine
Oh, colour me in
If green is chasing the hills over miles
If blue is pursuing the sky
See if the red of your heart doesn't mind
Where you begin to colour me in

Something new and nothing to do
Then I'm just the idea
I must be real, 'cause somehow I feel
That I'm just the idea
Let's share the blue of the towering sky
The green of the hills that roll by
Leave the red of your heart to decide
If you cannot choose which colour to use

I'll always wait
It's never too late to colour me in
To colour me in
Today or next year, I'll always be here
If you want to colour me in
I'll always wait
It's never too late to colour me in
To colour me in
Today or next year, I'll always be here
If you want to colour me in2Embed
