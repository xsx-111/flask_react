All The Wild Horses LyricsAll the wild horses
All the wild horses
Tethered with tears in their eyes
May no man's touch ever tame you
May no man's reigns ever chain you
And may no man's weight ever lay afraid your soul
And as for the clouds
Just let them roll
Roll away
Roll away
As for the clouds
Just let them roll
Roll away
Roll awayEmbed
