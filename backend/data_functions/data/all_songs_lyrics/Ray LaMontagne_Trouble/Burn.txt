Burn LyricsOh mama don't walk away
I'm a goddamn sore loser
I ain't too proud to say
That I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind
Oh mama don't leave me alone
With my soul shut down so tight
Just like a stone cold tomb
Ain't it clear when I'm near you
I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time
Oh so don't pay no mind
To my watering eyes
Must be something in the air
That I'm breathing
Yes and try to ignore
All this blood on the floor
It's just this heart on my sleeve that's bleeding
Oh mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving
From the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had
Was just selfish and sad
Yes but to see you now with him
Is just making me mad
Oh so kiss him again
Just to prove to me that you can
I will stand here
And burn in my skin
Yes I will stand here
And burn in my skinEmbed
