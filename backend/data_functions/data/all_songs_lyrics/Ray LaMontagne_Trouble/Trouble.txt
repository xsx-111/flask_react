Trouble Lyrics
Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble been dogging my soul since the day I was born
Worry
Worry, worry, worry, worry
Worry just will not seem to leave my mind alone

Well, I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
She won't let me go
She won't let me go, no
She won't let me go, no, no...

Trouble
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Feels like every time I get back on my feet she come around and knock me down again
Worry
Oh, worry, worry, worry, worry
Sometimes I swear it feels like this worry
Is my only friend
Well, I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
She won't let me go
She won't let me go, no
She won't let me go, no, no...

Oh, ah
Oh, ah
She good to me now
She give me love and affection
Say, she good to me now
She give me love and affection
I said I love her
Yes, I love her
I said I love her
I said I love
She good to me now
She good to me
She good to me2Embed
