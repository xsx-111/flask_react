How Come LyricsPeople on the street now
Faces long and grim
Souls are feeling heavy
And faith is growing thin
Fears are getting stronger
You can feel them on the rise
Hopelessness got some by the throat you can see it in their eyes
I said how come
How come
Everybody on a shoestring
Everybody in a hole
Everybody on an old jet plane crossing their fingers and toes
Government man spin his politics till they got you pinned
Everybody trying to reach out to each other
But they don't know where to begin
I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All I see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come
The pistol now as prophet
The bullet some kind of lord and king
But pain is the only promise that this so called savior is gonna bring
Love can be a liar
And justice can be a thief
And freedom can be an empty cup from which everybody want to drink
I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All i see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come
It's just man killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
I don't understand it
It's just man killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
I don't understand it
It's just man killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
I don't understand it
I don't understand it
I don't understand it
I don't understand it
How come
I said how come
How come
I said how comeEmbed
