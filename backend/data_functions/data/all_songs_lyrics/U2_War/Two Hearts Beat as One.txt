Two Hearts Beat as One Lyrics
I don't know, I don't know which side I'm on
I don't know my right from left or my right from wrong
They say I'm a fool, they say I'm nothing
But if I'm a fool for you, oh, that's something

Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts

I can't stop to dance, honey, this is my last chance
I said, can't stop to dance, maybe this is my last chance

Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts

Beat on black, beat on white
Beat on anything, don't get it right
Beat on you, beat on me, beat on love

I don't know how to say what's got to be said
I don't know if it's black or white, there's others see it red
I don't get the answers right, I'll leave that to you
Is this love out of fashion or is it the time of year?
Are these words distraction to the words you wanna hear?
Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts beat as one
Two hearts

I try to spit it out, try to explain
The way that I feel, oh yeah
Two hearts

Well, I can't stop to dance, maybe this is my last chance
I said I can't stop to dance, maybe this is my last chance
I said don't stop to dance, maybe this is my last chance
I said I can't stop to dance, maybe this is our last chance
I said don't stop to dance, maybe this is our last chance
Oh, oh!Embed
