Drowning Man Lyrics
Take my hand
You know I'll be there
If you can
I'll cross the sky for your love
For I have promised
For to be with you tonight
And for the time that will come


Take my hand
You know I'll be there
If you can
I'll cross the sky for your love
And I understand
These winds and tides
This change of times
Won't drag you away

Hold on, and hold on tightly
Hold on, and don't let go of my love
The storms will pass, it won't be long now
This love will last, this love will last forever
And take my hand, you know I'll be there
If you can I'll cross the sky for your love
Give you what I hold dear

Hold on, hold on tightly
Hold on, and hold on tightly
Rise up, rise up with wings like eagles
You run, you run
You run and not grow weary
Hold on, and hold on tightly
Hold on, hold on tightly
This love, lasts forever
Now this love lasts foreverEmbed
