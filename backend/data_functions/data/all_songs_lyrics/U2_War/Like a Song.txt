Like a Song Lyrics
Like a song I have to sing
I sing it for you
Like the words I have to bring
I bring it for you

And in leather, lace and chains, we stake our claim
Revolution once again
No I won't, I won't wear it on my sleeve
I can see through this expression and you know I don't believe
Too old to be told, exactly who are you?
Tonight, tomorrow's too late

And we love to wear a badge, a uniform
And we love to fly a flag
But I won't let others live in hell
As we divide against each other and we fight amongst ourselves
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song

Let the bells ring out (Oh)
Let the bells ring out (Oh)
Is there nothing left?
Is there, is there nothing?
Is there nothing left?
Is honesty what you want?
A generation without name, ripped and torn
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain
Nothing at all, and if you can't help yourself
Well, take a look around you, when others need your time
You say it's time to go, it's your time
Angry words won't stop the fight, two wrongs won't make it right
A new heart is what I need, oh, God, make it bleed

Is there nothing left? (Oh)
(Oh, oh)

Let the bells ring out (Oh)
Let the bells ring out (Oh)
Is there nothing left?
Is there, is there nothing?
Is there nothing left?
Is honesty what you want?

Let the bells ring out (Oh)
Let the bells ring out (Oh)
Is there nothing left?
Is there, is there nothing?
Is there nothing left?
Is honesty what you want?Embed
