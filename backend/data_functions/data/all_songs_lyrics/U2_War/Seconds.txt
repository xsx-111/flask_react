Seconds Lyrics
Takes a second to say goodbye, say goodbye, oh, oh oh
Takes a second to say goodbye, say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, say bye-bye
Where you going to now?
Lightning flashes across the sky
East to West, do or die
Like a thief in the night, see the world by candlelight
Fall, rise and...
Fall, rise and...

In an apartment on Times Square
You can assemble them anywhere
Held to ransom, hell to pay
A revolution every day
U.S.S.R., G.D.R., London, New York, Peking
It's the puppets, it's the puppets pull the strings, yeah
Fall, rise and...
Fall, rise and...

Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye
It takes a second to say goodbye
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
Push the button and pull the plug
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
Fall, missing is the rise and fall
Fall, I will rise and fall

And they're doing the atomic bomb
Do they know where the dance comes from?
Yes, they're doing the atomic bomb
They want you to sing along

Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye2Embed
