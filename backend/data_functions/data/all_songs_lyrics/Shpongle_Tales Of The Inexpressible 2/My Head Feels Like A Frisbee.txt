My Head Feels Like A Frisbee LyricsMy head feels like a frisbee; twice its normal size
Feels like a football and someone's moved the goal posts. Everything is slightly out of joint and weird; disconnected
I had to hold onto the walls
And we noticed that women, especially the hippy ladies, started reacting differently
With your permission their nipples get hard; they start dancing in a whole other kind of way
Catching butterflies in the air
People get goosepimples. They laugh, they cry at the same time. They get horny and holy at the same time- you see them
This one brought me down to my knees
I had to hold onto the wall
My knees shaking, quivering
My head feels like a frisbeeEmbed
