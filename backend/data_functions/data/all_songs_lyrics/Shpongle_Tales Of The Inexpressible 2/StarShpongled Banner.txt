StarShpongled Banner LyricsThat is so weird
Well, y'know, it's like this experience that I had was like, y'know, erm, it was kind of the most profound experience I've had in me life, like
I am a shaman, magician
The sun is purple
3D dimensions
I am for mental extensions
You know the mind has a thousand eyes
Oohh, Que TerrorEmbed
