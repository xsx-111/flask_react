Sleigh Ride LyricsStep inside this house of steel
Step inside the spinning wheel
Slither with her been so long
Been so long since I've been home
Step inside the sinking ship
Tests of time are never quick
Still we ride the burning ship
Ride the ship cause we can't quit
We chase pace racin'
The white light
Make haste to embrace
The moonshine
'Til we dine on the fruits
Of the mind's eye
...so fine
Isolation
Isolation
Feel the stiffness of isolation
Reject your mind's incarceration
Reject your self-incineration
We chase pace racin'
The white light
Make haste to embrace
The moonshine
'Til we dine on the fruits
Of the mind's eye
...so fineEmbed
