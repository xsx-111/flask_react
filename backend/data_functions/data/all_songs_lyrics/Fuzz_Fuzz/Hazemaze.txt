Hazemaze LyricsYou scream out, try not to repeat
Hazy mazes try to be discreet
You tell them the secrets of your mind
But the answer still you cannot find
But the answer still you cannot find
Now your tryin', tryin' to be true
Hazy mazes tryin' to get to you
Well it will end where it began
With your body placed beneath the sand
In again; the cycle never ends
Made of skin, forgive your human sin

I found the truth; it came from our hand
It spoke with force, it came from the sand
And it said
It spoke with sound, it will amaze
Open up your ears, hear the great voice
As it saysEmbed
