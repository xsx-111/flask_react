Raise LyricsHe raised the sun up high
And left us all to live or die
He lets the babies die and
Mothers cry- what's his side?
It makes me wonder why he
Never tries
To testify
Those books you hold so high
Must've lied
No lies
COMPROMISE
Watch the world as it dies
The hands in command
Hold the keys to the land
We sink as we swim
And the end bares its grin
One choice
Do what's rightEmbed
