33rd of August / When the Baby in My Lady Gets the Blues LyricsLord today there's no salvation
The bands packed up and gone
Left me standing with my penny in my hand
There's a big crowd at the station where a blind man sings his songs
But he can see what they can't understand
It's the thirty-third of August and I'm finally touchin' down
Eight days from Sunday finds me Saturday bound
Once I stumbled through the darkness tumbled to my knees
A thousand voices screamin' in my brain
Woke up in a squad car busted down for vagrancy
Outside my cell as sure as hell it looked like rain
But now I put my dangerous feelings under lock and chain
Guess I killed my violent nature with a smile
Though the demons danced and sung their songs within my fevered brain
Not all my God-like thoughts Lord were defiled
It's the thirty-third of August and I'm finally touchin' down
Eight days from Sunday find me Saturday bound
She's my baby
Once in awhile
She's a lady
But the lady
Don't smile too much lately
No the ladys got the blues
Lord I need her
When she's not around
But I'll see her
The next time she's down
When the baby in my lady
Gets her blues
When the baby in my lady
Remembers someone
Is waiting
Just to hold her
Not to scold her
For what she has done
I need her
When she's not around
But I'll see her
The next time she's down
When the baby in my lady
Gets the blues
Yes if she needs me
How could I mind
When she leaves me
Lord it's so fine
When she needs me
When my ladys got the blues
She's my baby
Once in awhile
She's a lady
But the lady
Don't smile too much lately
The ladys got the bluesEmbed
