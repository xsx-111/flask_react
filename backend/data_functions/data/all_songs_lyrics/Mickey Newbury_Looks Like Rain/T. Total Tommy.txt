T. Total Tommy LyricsTo the sad-eyed misinterpreted hung-up child of clay
So the drunken poets pretty words didn't help you find your way
Was it your mistake for thinkin’ he was born before his time
Or was it his for thinkin' he might save you with his flimsy rhyme
T Total Tommy took a toke of tea
Black cats backin' up a big oak tree
Tick tocks tickin’ out a tune on time
Last words lookin' for a line to rhyme
Saw fishs swimmin' in the sea-saw-sea
But me well I'm only lookin'
I see so many with no place tonight their sleepy heads to lay
With pen in hand I take a stand I got nothin' deep to say
Some words are better left to whisper only to the wind
Some men kill with bullets Lord others use a pen
Sidewalks singin' of a troubled time
Small talks marchin' to a nursery rhyme
Day trippers trippin’ on a mornin’ high
Stop watch watchin' for a chance to die
Bad dogs barkin’ up an empty tree
But me well I'm only cryin'Embed
