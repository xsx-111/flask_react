She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye LyricsWell, mornings come and Lord, my mind is aching
The sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
And with my tears it goes tumbling to the floor
Once again the old town will be talking
Yes Lord, I've seen the pity that's in their eyes
'Cause they could never understand
It's her sorrow, it's not a man
No matter what they say, we know she tried
Baby's packed her soft things and she's left me
I just know she didn't mean to make me cry
It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She just didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbyeEmbed
