Write a Song a Song / Angeline LyricsWrite a song, a song
Write a song about her
Hum a tune, a tune
Hum a tune, You miss her
Words that wouldn't rhyme
Wouldn’t rhyme... It's over
Start another line
Start a line anew
She's the kinda girl, a man Lord, remembers
Remembers... remembers...
She’s the kinda girl you just got to love her
If you know her
And I knew her
Sitting in the dark
In the darkness of my room
I wonder why
I look the sky
Look the sky
Begins to softly cry
Morning new
Running through the grass
Through the sweet green
Morning dew
Clinging to her golden hair
I had to leave her
Yesterdays newspaper forecast
No rain for today
Yesterdays news was old news
The skies are all grey
Winter is in labor
And soon give birth
To the Spring
And sprinkle the meadow
With flowers for my Angeline
Heartache and sorrow
And sadness, unendlingly find
Wings on her memory
With them, she flies to my mind
She stretched her arms for a moment
Then went back to sleep
While morning stood watching
Ever so silently weep
She opened her eyes, Lord
The minute my feet touched the floor
The cold hardwood creaked
With each step that I made
To the door
There I turned to her gently
And said, "Hun, just look
Its Spring"
Knowing outside the window
The Winter looked for Angeline
But yesterday's newspaper
Forecast no rain for today
Sitting in the dark
In the darkness of my room
I wonder why
I look the sky
Look the sky
Begins to softly cry
Morning new
Running through the grass
Through the sweet green
Morning dew
Clinging to her golden hair
I had to leave herEmbed
