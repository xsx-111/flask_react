Mardi Gras in New Orleans LyricsWell I'm going to New Orleans, I'm gonna see the Mardi Gras
Well I'm going to New Orleans, I'm gonna see the Mardi Gras
When I get to New Orleans I wants to know what's carnival for
I've got my ticket in my hand, I'm gonna go to New Orleans
I've got my ticket in my hand, I'm gonna go to New Orleans
When I get to New Orleans, I want to see the Zulu King
When I see the Zulu King, down on Rampart and Dumaine
When I see the Zulu King, down on Rampart and Dumaine
I'm gonna stay right there until I see the Zulu QueenEmbed
