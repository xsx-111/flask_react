Forty-Four LyricsGoin' downtown
Buy me a fourty-four
Goin' downtown
Buy me a fourty-four
Bad news this mornin'
Baby don't want me no more
Gonna kill myself
Livin' ain't worthwhile
Gonna kill myself
Livin' ain't worthwhile
When I leave here
Don't want nobody to cry
I don't know why
Everything happen to me
I don't know why
Everything happen to me
Tried to be a good man
Bad bad whiskey ruined me
That's why I'm goin'downtown
Buy me a fourty-four
I'm goin' downtown
Buy me a fourty-four
Bad news this mornin'
Baby don't want me no moreEmbed
