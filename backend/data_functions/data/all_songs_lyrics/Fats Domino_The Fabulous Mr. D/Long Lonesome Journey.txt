Long Lonesome Journey LyricsThis is a long lonesome journey
Sometime I can hardly see my way
This is a long lonesome journey
Sometime I can hardly see my way
It'll be my good one lovin' woman
Can't be mistreated each and every day
But my day will be comin'
That I won't have to cry no more
Yes my day will be comin'
That I won't have to cry no more
I'll be lovin' my true love
And you'll know I'll have to let you go
This is a long lonesome journey
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
This is a long lonesome journey
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Waitin' for the one to love me
And I know that just can ever beEmbed
