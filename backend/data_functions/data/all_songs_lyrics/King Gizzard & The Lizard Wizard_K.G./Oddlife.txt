Oddlife Lyrics
All this rock and roll is bad for my ears
Let me tell you one thing about my life, it's weird
All this headbangin' is bad for my brain
Let me tell you one thing about my life, it's strange

Sugar Plum Fairy dances now
Echoed feet on the hallowed ground
Energy peaks on the voyager's crown
Back to the bus for another round
Managing feats by managing feet
Head of the hydra tastes the breeze
Conduit sees from the living room suite
Boredom is what boredom breeds, you see

So deranged
Life is strange
It's human
Odd life, woo


All this indecision in anthropods
Let me tеll you one thing about our life, it's odd
All this wire walking upon thе knife
Let me tell you one thing 'bout human odd life
Sugar Plum Fairy dances now
Echoed feet on the hallowed ground
Energy peaks on the voyager's crown
Back to the bus for another round
Managing feats by managing feet
Head of the hydra tastes the breeze
Conduit sees from the living room suite
Boredom is what boredom breeds, you see

Bitumen
Crossroad knife
It's human
Odd life, woo

No concept of geography
I wake up and I'm still fatigued
I'm drinking 'til I'm dead asleep
Ridin' high 'til I'm back home in one piece
Another car park in the middle of nowhere
Another promoter hanging in your hair
Another backstage green room to prepare
It's an odd life, gotta be aware

It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get in the stride

It's an odd life
'Til you get it right
It's an odd life
'Til you get it right
It's an odd life
'Til you get it right
Odd life
Odd life
Odd life
