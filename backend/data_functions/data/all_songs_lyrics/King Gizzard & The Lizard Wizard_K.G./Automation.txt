Automation Lyrics
Join the last migration
It's fun, fuck the system
Your new mess made is great
King of a bald primate
We are not worthy
Of our heir's glory
Mental rotation for the overlord
(Woo!)

Superorganism
Caused a schism bending light through prisms
Cyber surgeon
JavaScript person
Digital cleanse
Tell all your friends the neural network's at work
(Woo!)

Automation, automation
Automation, automation
Automation, automation
Automation

Prepare for mutation because after all, I'm sure I heard the crack of doom
Death kiss
Everyone should be talkin' 'bout this
Human comet dinosaur inside a simulation
Automation
(Woo!)
Automation, automation
Automation, automation
Automation, automation
Automation, automation1Embed
