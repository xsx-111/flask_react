Some of Us Lyrics
Ancient tombs like sand-filled wombs of
People's life past, understand everything
Melted iron, untold aeons
Crafted demise, destroying everything

Black sand timelines, shifting skylines
Faded guide signs, revealing everything
Ancient Thracians from lost nations
Long gone people understand everything

Some, some, some of us see
Some, some of us don't
Assured everything turns into dust

Rigor mortis, fossil tortoise
Remains dormant underneath everything
Ageless microbes reveal xenophobes
Endless plague thus infecting everything

Sapien rituals born of mind tools
Sects of false gods fade into everything
Eternal tribes of purgatory scribes
Ancient words thus foretelling everything
Some, some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Assured everything turns into dust

Some, some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Everything turns into dust1Embed
