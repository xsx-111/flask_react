The Hungry Wolf of Fate Lyrics
Would you throw our construction to the hungry wolf of fate?

Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe

Death looms like a leering figure
Bring our species into sight

Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe

Would you throw your deduction to thе hungry wolf of fate?
Fill his plate with your namesakе
Fatten him with your ego

Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe
