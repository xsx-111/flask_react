Minimum Brain Size Lyrics
Riddle me this
Did you ever grow?
Break the spider's legs
Just to feed the crow
Sympathetic crowds
Are not well endowed
They dance like flies on shit
Swarming in the clouds

This is to all of the people
Who had it coming
A few bickies too many
(I'm so lonely)
It's to all of the people
Who said they couldn't hack it
I'll open their eyes

To minimum brain size

Re-enter the uterus
And refund all your cells
Do it back-to-front
Like nobody else
Stay there for a while
"When you're back inside
You will not be missed"
Said the tear to the eye
It's pathetic though
You're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob
Faceless undertow
Himpathetic bro
You're weaker than you know
You don't have a say
A-a-anymore

This is to all of the people
Who had it coming
A few bickies too many
(I'm so lonely)
It's to all of the people
Who said they couldn't hack it
Radicalise

To minimum brain size

It's pathetic though
You're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob
Lowest of the low
Himpathetic bro
You're weaker than you know
You don't have a say
A-a-anymore
At the center of it all
You ain't got the gall
You're pissing on a flame
Standing on a ball
It's pathetic though
You're weaker than you know
You don't have a say
A-a-anymore
A-a-anymore3Embed
