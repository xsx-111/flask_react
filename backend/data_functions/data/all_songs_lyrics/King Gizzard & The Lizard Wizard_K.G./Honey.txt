Honey Lyrics
You taste like honey, all warm and runny
Kinder than a candy, effervescent shandy
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion

Like the wind on a sail, I'll steer you along
And the germs outside I'll keep you from
Like the hail in the morn, I'll sing you a song
While the mead I make can brew for you

You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it
We're endless motion, drink to that notion
Buoyant is your spirit, gotta keep me near it

Like the wind on a sail, I'll steer you along
And the germs outside I'll keep you from
Like the hail in the morn, I'll sing you a song
While the mead I make can brew for you
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey


You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion5Embed
