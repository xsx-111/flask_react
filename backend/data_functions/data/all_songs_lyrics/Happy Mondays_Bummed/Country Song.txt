Country Song LyricsWell I’m a simply city boy
With simple country tastes
Smoking wild-grown marijuana
Keeps that smile on your face
But it says so, so, so, so longer to you
But it says so, so, so, so longer
Listening to my system, just the other night
Watching my TV with the sound turned down
Checking out the late, late, late, night fight night
Checking out the late, late, late, night fight night
Biting off your hands
Throwing your peas and pans
Knocking you to the floor
Accusing you, you filthy whore
And more, more, more, more, more now
More, more, more, too much more now
Well I’m a simply city boy
With stupid country tastes
Smoking wild-grown marijuana
Keeps that smile on my face
Depending on the mood, mood, mood, mood, mood, mood
Depending on the mood, mood, mood, mood, mood, mood
Better get your house for sale, the Indians are coming
Better get your house for sale, the Indians are coming
Redneck, gotta lot of redneck in ya
Redneck, gotta lot of redneck in ya
Better get your house for sale, the Indians are coming
Better get your house for sale, the Indians are coming
Redneck, gotta lot of redneck in yaEmbed
