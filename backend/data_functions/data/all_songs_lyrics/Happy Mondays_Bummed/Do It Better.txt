Do It Better LyricsOn one, in one, did one, do one, did one, have one, in one, have one
Come on, have one, did one, do one, good one, in one, have one
Swapped the dog for a cold cold ride
It was deformed on the in but deformed on the outside
Stuck a piece of crack in a butcher's hand
Demanded he give me my cat back
Don't purchase me coz I won't work
I gave away my oil and the seeds in my boots
There was a boom in the room as the papers marched in
He built himself together then sat down
Mislaid the dog for a dumb old ride
She was dumber on the in, deformed on the outside
Stuck a piece of crack in a good girls hand
Demanded she give me my love back
Took my path with a touch of life
Coz theres hills you don't take and roads you can't climb
There was a boom in the room as the snidey snide in
They snide themselves together and snide down
On one, in one, did one, do one, did one, did one, have one
In one, have one, have two, have three, have one, have one
In one, do one, do it one better
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Double double good
Double double good
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Double double good
Double double goodEmbed
