Brain Dead LyricsYou're rendering that scaffolding dangerous!
Grass eyed slashed eyed brain dead fucker
Rips off himself steals from his brother
Loathed by everyone but loved by his mother
It's not the hip or the ship that gets you caught
No one likes to feel that they've been bought
Why then?
Should you do it again and again and again?
He's a wise guy, when guy don't like my eye spy
Always a snide try never a clean guy
Loathed by everyone but loved by his mother
Give you a calls
For the, thing upstairs
She takes him his night time brown and flask
Sews up his night time brown and mask
You bleed in my eye, you bleed in my eye
White track
Grass sliding, slash-eyed brain dead fuckup
Rips off himself and steals from his brother
Loathed by everyone but loved by his mother (kiss kiss)
Why then?
Should you do it again and again and again
Why then?
Do you do it again and again and again
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
OhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhEmbed
