Fat Lady Wrestlers LyricsI just got back from a year in the sack
It must've been somethin' I'm eatin'
I just got back from a year away
It's down to somethin' you're drinkin'
You've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen
You've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen, you've been seen
You've been with fat lady wrestlers
And Germans in trenches
And teachers who speak to themselves
Snide sneak corner, and baby beat a pauper
Peasants who eat from the road
I just got back from a year away
Must've been somethin' I'm drinkin' somewhere
I just got back from a year in the sack
It's down to somethin' you're eatin'
You did work, you did work, you did work, you did work
You did work, you did work, you did work
You did work, you did work, you did work, you did work
You did work, you did work, you did work
You did it with fat lady wrestler
And Germans in trenches
And teachers who eat on their own - sometime
Snide sneak corner, baby beats a pauper
Gypos that steal from their own
Just got back from a year away
It must've been somethin' I'm drinkin' somewhere
Just got back from a year in the sack
Did you suss the clowns that you're meetin' ?
You did work, you did work, you did work, you did work
You did work, you did work, you did work
You did work, you did work, you did work, you did work
You did work, you did work, you did workEmbed
