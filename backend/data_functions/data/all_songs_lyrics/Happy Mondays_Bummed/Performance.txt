Performance LyricsNo comedians
One day he was admiring his reflection
In his favorite mirror
When he realised all too clearly
What a freakin' old beasty man he was
Who is? You is, you is now son
I took to hiding, I took to hiding
I took to hiding, hiding strange things
I took to dribbling, we took to dribbling down my front
I starting running, I starting running on the spot
Picked ya picture, now i'm gonna eat ya
Picked ya picture, now i'm gonna eat ya
We're all food, you're cake
We're all the food, you're weirdos' cream
Quick quick, fast fast, quick quick, fast fast
I took to dribbling, I took to dribbling down my front
You took to hiding, you took to hiding strange things
One day she was touching her reflection
In her favorite mirror
When she realised all to clearly
What a freakin' old weirdo she was
Who was? She was, she is...
Fast fast, quick quick, quick quick, fast fast
She took to hiding, she took to hiding strange things
I took to dribbling, I took to dribbing down my frontEmbed
