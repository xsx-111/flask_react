Wrote For Luck Lyrics
I wrote for luck, they sent me you
I sent for juice, you give me poison
I order a line, you form a queue
You're trying so hard is there anything else you can do?
Well not much - I've not been trained
I can sit and stand, beg n' roll over
I don't read, I just guess
There's more than one sign, but it's getting less
And you were wet, but you're getting dryer
You use to speak the truth, but now you're liar
You use to speak the truth, but now you're clever

And I wrote for luck and they sent me you
And I sent for juice, you give me poison
I order a line, you form a queue
Try anything hard, is there anything else you can do?
And you were wet, but you're getting dryer
You use to speak the truth, but now you're clever
You use to speak the truth, but now you're clever
And when it's hot, you start to melt
'Cause you're not made a king, you're made of chocolate
And when it's cold, you tend to crack
And keep on piling out, not pulling back
