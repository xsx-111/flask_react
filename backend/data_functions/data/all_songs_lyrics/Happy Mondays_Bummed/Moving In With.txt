Moving In With LyricsHe's got two bent pigs in the crash downstairs below
Chewing at the door asking "Why you so slow?"
Got a schizophrenic acquaintance patient no place to go
Stuck with his dick in my window
We're moving in, on, with you
You're moving in, on me and
Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Goosey Loosey
Turkey Lurky, Ducky Lucky, Chicky Licky
It seems we're all on the move when the sound's falling in
It seems we're all on the move when the sound's falling in
I'd say they're all on the move when the sky's coming in
You got four muddy pigs in the flat downstairs below
Chomping at the door he say "Why you so slow?"
Got a schizophrenic acquaintance patient no place to go
Stuck with his dick through my Afghani window
We're moving in, on, with you
You're moving in, on me and
Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Goosey Loosey
Turkey Lurky. Tricky Licky, Ducky Lucky
I'd say we're all on the move when the sound's falling in
I'd say we're all on the move when the sound's falling in
I'd say they're all on the move when the door's coming in
I like a bit of a cavort, old ladies and important inhabitantsEmbed
