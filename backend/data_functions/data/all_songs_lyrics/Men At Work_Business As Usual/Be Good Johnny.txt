Be Good Johnny Lyrics
Skip de skip, up the road
Off to school you go
"Don't you be a bad boy Johnny
Don't you slip up
Or play the fool"
"Oh no Ma, Oh no Da
I'll be your golden boy
I will obey ev'ry golden rule"
Get told by the teacher
Not to day-dream
Told by my mother

Be good, be good
Be good, be good, be good
Be good, be good, be good, be good (johnny)
Be good, be good
Be good, be good, be good
Be good, be good, be good
Be good, be good, be good
Be good (johnny)
Be good, be good

"Are you going to play football this year, John?"
"Nah!"
"Oh, well you must be going to play cricket this year then
Are you Johnny?"
"Nah! nah! nah!"
"Boy, you sure are a funny kid, Johnny, but I like you! So tell me
What kind of a boy are you, John?"
I only like dreaming
All the day long
Where no one is screaming
