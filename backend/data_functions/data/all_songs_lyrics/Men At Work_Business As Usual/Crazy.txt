Crazy LyricsI called you up on the telephone
You weren't there, you weren't at home
He didn't know what to do
Now he's sniffin glue
Honey you're driving him
Crazy, hazy, crazy
I'm amazed if, 'mazed if I get through, go
I went down to the corner street
Bought a record with a beat
But that just didn't do
Made him think of you
The record is drivin' him
Crazy, hazy, crazy, hazy
He needs some love, this madness is drivin' him
Around the bend, he can't see to the end
Round and round and round and round he goes
Got new neighbours, moved in next door
They got some daughters, I counted four
He's forgotten your name
I know who's to blame
These honeys are drivin' him...
Crazy, hazy, crazy, hazy
Round and round and round and round he goesEmbed
