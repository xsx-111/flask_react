Wheels of Steel LyricsWhen my foot's on the throttle, there's no looking back
I leave my motor tickin' over when she's parked on the track
I've got a '68 Chevy with pipes on the side
You know she's my idea of beauty and that's what I drive
She's got wheels
Wheels of steel
She's got
Wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Talkin' 'bout my wheels of steel
I don't take no jibe from no motorway pigs
When I'm cruisin' down the freeway, I don't give no lifts
If you see me comin', get out of my way
You know a Trans-Am didn't, I blew it away
She's got wheels
Wheels of steel
She's got
Wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
My-my-my, my wheels of steel
I'm burning aviation fuel, my foot's to the floor
You know she's cruisin' 140, she'll do even more
I'm burnin' solid rubber, I don't take no bull
'Cause my wheels of steel are rollin', they're rollin' your way
She's got wheels
Wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
My-my-my, wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Talkin' 'bout my wheels of steel
I'm burning aviation fuel, my foot's to the floor
You know she's cruisin' 140, said she'll do even more
I'm burnin' solid rubber, I don't take no bull... shit
'Cause my wheels of steel are rollin', if you're comin', come quick
She's got wheels
Wheels of steel
She's got
Wheels of steel
My-my-my wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Talkin' 'bout my wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
Wheels of steel
My, my wheels of steel
Oh, yeah, wheels of steel
Oh, yeah, wheels of steel
Oh, yeah, wheels of steel
Oh, yeah, wheels of steel
Oh, yeah, wheels of steel
Oh, yeah, wheels of steel
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, haha
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!Embed
