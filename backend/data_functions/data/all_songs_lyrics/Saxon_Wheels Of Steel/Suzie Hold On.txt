Suzie Hold On Lyrics
I wish I had a fortune
I'd take the pain away
We could be together
That's how we need to stay
'Cause you can change the world
The world in which you live in, live in
Suzie hold on
Do everything you believe to be right
Doing it all the time
Fighting the fight you believe to be right
Doing it all the time
When we were far apart
No one could be closer
Please don't take your life
'Cause that would break my heart
Try to stop your crying
We both know you're dying, dying
Suzie hold on
Do everything you believe to be right
Doing it all the time
Fighting the fight you believe to be right
Doing it all the time
I wish I had a fortune
I'd take your pain away
We could be together
That's how we need to stay
'Cause you can change the world
The world in which we live in, live in
Suzie hold on
Don't you know that you can change the world
Don't you know that you can change the world
Change the world, you can change the world
Suzie you can change the world
I can't stop you crying
Even though you're dyingEmbed
