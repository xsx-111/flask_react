Machine Gun Lyrics
Move in to the front underhanded fire
Hear the bullets flying millions every hour
Tracers in the night shooting across the sky
For God's sake cover me I don't wanna die
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Over the top into the wire
Running like a madman into the fire
No-mans land, fighting for your life
Fighting hand to hand forced to use your knife
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Come the wheels of terror crushing all before
Chews you to the bone to hear the monsters roar
With the clash of iron the battles never won
For the forgotten soldier it's only just begun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
It's gonna shoot you down
Move in to the front underhanded fire
Hear the bullets flying millions every hour
Tracers in the night shooting across the sky
For God's sake cover me I don't wanna die
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Come the wheels of terror crushing all before
Chews you to the bone to hear the monsters roar
With the clash of iron the battles never won
For the forgotten soldier it's only just begun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun
Gonna shoot you downEmbed
