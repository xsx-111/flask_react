Freeway Mad LyricsI'm screaming down the freeway
Gonna try and burn you out
I'm keeping in the fast lane
Top me and I'll take you out
And I know, yes I know
I want it so bad
I'm freeway mad
I'm burning down the freeway
Doing ninety miles an hour
I'm faster than a speedboat
Pulling every inch of power
And I know, yes I know
I want it so bad
I'm freeway mad
I'm going down the freeway
Never gonna get me out
Steaming like a freight train
Gonna blow my pistons out
And I know, yes I know
I want it so bad
I need it so bad
I want it so bad
Fu-fu-fu-fucking freeway madEmbed
