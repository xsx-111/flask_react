See the Light Shining Lyrics
When you're dyin', when you're dyin'
There ain't no use in cryin'
I'm gonna keep on livin' till the light
Shines down on you
Burnin' right in
Ya can't stop when you're winning
I'm gonna show my hand make history
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
There ain't no use in tryin'
I'm gonna keep on livin' till the light's
Shining down on you
Burnin' right in
Ya can't stop when you're winning
I'm gonna show my head make history
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
I can see the light shining
It's shining down on me, yeah
I can see the light shining
It shines on you and me, yeah, you and me
There's a new day dawning
It's here to set me free, yeah
I can see the changes coming
It's coming over me, over me
I can see the light shining
I can see the light shining
I can see the light shining
I can see the light shining
Shine on, shine onEmbed
