Street Fighting Gang Lyrics
When I went to school
I was nobody's fool
No good for me
I was living carefree
Staying out all night
Learning to fight
I got the dirty
I was tough, I was mean
It was up to me
Stree-stree-stree-street fighting gang
I don't need no spelling
I take my winning when I'm ready
But you wouldn't be alike
When we learn to fight
When we start to roam
Then you'd better stay home
'Cause I'm a member of the street elite
You know it's trouble to all we meet
It was up to me
Fighting through the night
Doing alright
We might take your life
Street fighting gang
Street fighting gang
If I take you out one night
And you're risking your life
If I show you the blade
You got a fool in your brain
'Cause I don't give a damn, no
'Cause I don't know you
I'm a member of the street elite
You know it's trouble to all we meet
It was up to me
Street fighting gang
Street fighting gang
I'm in a street fighting gang
Street fighting gang
I'm in a gang
The gangEmbed
