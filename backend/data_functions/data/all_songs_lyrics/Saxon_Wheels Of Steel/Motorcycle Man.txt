Motorcycle Man LyricsIf you see me flashing by
Do not stop me, do not try
'Cause I'm a motorcycle man
I get my kicks just when I can
Motorcycle man
Motorcycle man
I can beat your street machine
We're taking risks, that's what we mean
'Cause I'm a motorcycle man
We get our kicks just when we can
When we can
Motorcycle man
Motorcycle...
If you see me riding by
Do not stop me, do not try
'Cause I'm a motorcycle man
I get my kicks just when I can
When I can
Motorcycle man
Motorcycle man
Motorcycle, motorcycle
Motorcycle man
I can beat your street machine
I'm taking risks, that's what I mean
'Cause I'm a motorcycle man
We get our kicks just when we can
When we can
Motorcycle man
Motorcycle man
Motorcycle, motorcycle
Motorcycle manEmbed
