Stand Up and Be Counted Lyrics
Down, down at the bottom
Ya gotta try to get yourselves up
Ya got nothing to lose when you're there
There at the bottom
Ya gotta stand up
Stand up for your rights
We can make it
You can break it
Stand up
Stand up and be counted
Out, out in the spotlight
Ya gotta leave, leave your worries behind
Ya got nothing to lose when you're there
You be forgotten
Well I'll be damning our lives
While they damn us in hell
We can make it
You can break it
Stand up
Stand up and be counted
We can make it
We can break it
Stand up
Stand up and be counted
Down, down at the bottom
Ya gotta leave all your worries behind
Ya got nothing to lose when you're there
There at the bottom
Ya gotta stand up
Stand up for your rights
We can make it
You can break it
Stand up
Stand up be counted
Stand up, stand up!Embed
