New Lyrics
Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
And I can’t believe I’ve had this chance now
Don’t let it go away, yeah

New, you’re so new
You, you’re new
And I never had this taste in the past
New, you’re so new

My normal hesitation is gone
And I really gravitate to your will
Are you here to fetch me out?
‘Cause I’ve never had this taste in my mouth
Oh, you’re not old
And you’re not familiar
Recently discovered and I’m learning about you

New, you’re so new
You, you’re new
And you’re consuming me violently
And your reverence shamelessly tempting me
Who sent this maniac?
‘Cause I never had this taste in the past
Oh, you’re different
You’re different from the former
Like a fresh battery, I’m energized by you

Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
And I can’t believe I’ve had this chance now
Don’t let it go away

Why am I so curious?
This territory is dangerous
I’ll probably end up at the start
I’ll be back in line with my broken heart

New, you’re so new
You, you’re new
And I never had this taste in the past

Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
And I can’t believe I’ve had this chance now
Don’t let it go away
And I can’t believe it (Don’t let it go away)
Can’t believe it
Can’t believe it (Don’t let it go away)
Can’t believe it

Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
Don’t let it go away
New, you're so new
New, you're so new
New, you're so new
