Ex-Girlfriend Lyrics
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend

I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I hope I hold a special place with the rest of them
And you know it makes me sick to be on that list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed
You say you’re gonna burn before you mellow
I will be the one to burn you
Why’d you have to go and pick me?
When you knew that we were different, completely

I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I hope I hold a special place with the rest of them
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend

I’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed
Your wildness scares me
So does your freedom
You say you can’t stand the restrictions
I find myself trying to change you
If you were meant to be my lover I wouldn’t have to
And I feel so mean, I feel in between
‘Cause I’m about to give you away
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
(For someone else to take)
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
(Am I making a mistake?)
I hope I hold a special place with the rest of them
(All the time that we spent)
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend

I’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed
I’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed

I know I messed up
I’m about to give you away for someone else to take
I’m about to give you away for someone else to take

We keep repeating mistakes for souvenirs
And we’ve been in between the days for years
And I know that when I see you I’m going to die
I know I’m going to want you and you know why
It’s going to kill me to see you with the next girl
‘Cause I’m the most gorgeously jealous kind of ex-girl
But I should have thought of that before we kissed
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I hope I hold a special place with the rest of them
(All the time that we spent)
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend

And now I’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed
Now I’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed4Embed
