Full Circle Lyrics
All I've ever touched or said to them
Becomes a rehearsal for you, just practice
Too many magic moments to be coincidence
It all comes full circle
I knew someone who knew you
And he introduced me to you
Your ex-girlfriend had a boyfriend
Who kissed my girlfriend who did Adrian

The world keeps on getting
Smaller and smaller
And everything comes 'round
Full circle, full circle
Six degrees of separation
We all know someone else
It all comes full circle

And you come from England
My ex-boyfriend, he is Indian
With a British passport, we're all connected
And everyone is affected

The world keeps on getting
Smaller and smaller
And everything comes 'round
Full circle, full circle
Six degrees of separation
We all know someone else
It all comes full circle
It all comes full circle

The world keeps on getting
Smaller and smaller
And everything comes 'round
Full circle, full circle
Six degrees of separation
We all know someone else
It all comes full circle
The world keeps on getting
Smaller and smaller
And everything comes 'round
Full circle, full circle
Six degrees of separation
We all know someone else
It all comes full circleEmbed
