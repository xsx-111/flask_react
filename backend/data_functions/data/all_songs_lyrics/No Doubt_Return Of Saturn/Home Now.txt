Home Now Lyrics(Victoria
Change at Victoria)

I'm hanging out with me
And you're a vacant chair
A chosen compromise
This space we rarely share
And if you lived here you'd be home now
So what you givin' up for me?
And what shall I give up for you?
Aimless expectations passing by

If you lived here you'd be home now
If you lived here you'd be home now

And to make it real
I need to have you here
I need to have you
I need to hold you

Barren wasted heart
Neglect of normalcy
And if you lived here you'd be home now
Oh if you lived here you'd be home now

And to make it real
I need to have you here
I need to have you
It can't be sincere
Unless you spend time here
I need to see you

Supervision is what I need
Some consistence, tangibility
Some casual light days
Part of the furniture
I want to take you for granted
And see you regular
So what you givin' up for me?
And what shall I give up for you?
The separations tired, it's been too long

And to make it real
I need to have you here
I need to have you
It can't be sincere
Unless you spend time here
I need to see you
I need you...
Come home nowEmbed
