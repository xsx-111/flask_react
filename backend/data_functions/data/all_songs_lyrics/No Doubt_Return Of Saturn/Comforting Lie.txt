Comforting Lie Lyrics
I started out on the wrong foot
Now I'm not myself
I am Jekyll, I am Hyde
Found this place to hide
Come seek me
Oh, so up and down
So back and forth
So insecure
Can't get this taste out of my mouth
Swallow it down
Pretend

And hold it, hold it all in
Let it build up
Oh, build a bomb
And blow it, blow it away
Clear it all out
Just end it

I'm just a normal person
Without those problems
When did it change?
Admissions so embarrassing
I'm on the verge of tears again
I'll hold it, I'll hold it all in
I'll let it build up
Oh, build a bomb
And blow it, blow it away
Clear it all out
Just end it

Oh, look I took the Band-Aid off
Did I take it off too soon?
Hysterical confession
My big courageous move

Don't gasp at the predictable
A comforting lie can't last
Preordained checklist of this awkward love
It's so sad

I'll hold it, hold it all in
Let it build up
Oh, build a bomb
And blow it, blow it away
Clear it all out
Just end it
I'll sort it, sort it out
I'll just give it back
No thank you
And toss it, toss it away
Eliminate
Just give up

I, I can't decide
This tug of war
I'm feeling weakEmbed
