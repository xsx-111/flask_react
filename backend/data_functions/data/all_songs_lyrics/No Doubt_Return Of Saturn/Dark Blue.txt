Dark Blue Lyrics
I'm tired from exploring you
I'm sorry you've had some scary days
I'm lucky, they had me on a leash
Exposing, sometimes you frighten me

And it's too bad you're so sad
I wish you could have had what I had

I'm loathing most of your history
Hesitation, but then you siphon me
Your potential, well I'll indulge in that
Violent timing explains the aftermath

And it's too bad you're so sad
I wish you could have had what I had
And it's so sad it's too bad
Maybe I can make you feel better
Oh maybe I'm supposed to make you feel better

I want to comfort you
I want to comfort you
I want to comfort you
Unlike you I had it easy
You're dark blue
Stained from previous days

And you're so sad
It's too bad
I wish you could have had what I had
And it's too bad you're so sad
Maybe I can make you feel better

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I want to comfort you
I want to comfort you
You're dark blue1Embed
