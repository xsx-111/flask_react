Staring Problem Lyrics
My eyes are so rootless
They wander, I follow
I keep staring, I can't stop it
I know I shouldn't
But I can't stop it

Such a cute girl
I'm so jealous
I wish I looked exactly like her
What's it like to have that body?
I'm gawking while I wonder

S-T-A-R-I-N-G
I can't stop staring
S-T-A-R-I-N-G
I can't stop staring

S-T-A-R-I-N-G
P-R-O-B-L-E-M

With my envy I steal glances
Resentful fault finder
This peek-a-boo's become a problem
Predisposed cat fighter
S-T-A-R-I-N-G
I can't stop staring
S-T-A-R-I-N-G
I can't stop staringEmbed
