Marry Me Lyrics
I can't help that I like to be kissed
And I wouldn't mind if my name changed to Mrs
This is one side, my conventional side
An attraction to tradition
My vintage disposition
My sincere architecture
And I want to cook him dinner
But I'm more indecisive than ever
And who believes in forever?

Who will be the one to marry me?

A girl in the world barking up the wrong tree
A creature conditioned to employ matrimony
Crumbling continuity, I pick up the pieces
The ceremony makes me zealous as the past quickly ceases
Fear from being neutered
I'm now prude, now defensive
Quickly I'm altered and tempted by new love only rented

Do you believe you'll marry me?
You might be the one to marry me
Back, looking back, looking back at me
(I'm not how I used to be) I'm not how I used to be
Take me back, take me back into history
Diamond ring, (Tie me down) tie me down just like it used to be
Tie me down how it used to be
I'm not how I used to be
I'm not how I used to be

Who will be the one to marry me?
Who will be the one to marry me?

I'm not how I used to be
I'm not how I used to be

Looking back, looking back at me (How I used to be)
I'm not how I used to be (I'm not how I used to be)
Take me back, back into history
Diamond ring, tie me down just like it used to be

Marry me, marry me
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Happily ever after, happily ever after
Happily ever after, happily ever after
Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
It's pretty when I'm faithful
Mmm, and ever, ever, ever, ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Happily ever after
Happily ever afterEmbed
