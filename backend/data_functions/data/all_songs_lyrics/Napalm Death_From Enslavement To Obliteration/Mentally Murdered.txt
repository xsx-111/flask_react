Mentally Murdered LyricsYour aspirations, unable to stretch
Beyond the barriers of what's expected
As the free thought you were born with
Becomes externally polluted
Lose sight of your ideals
In their brainwashing institutions
Predetermine your values
To befit your substandard existence...
Discouraging creativity
To aim for empty ambitions
Living up to others expectations
Takes hold of your assiduity
Mentally murdered!
Always up to the mark
Set the wheels in motion
A fake sense of security
From your invariable position
Sinking in the crowd
A face minus expression
A mouth that echoes words
Recycled from tradition
Your only contentness
Is in living a lie
Mentally murdered!
Do you possess the strength
To re-create your own life?Embed
