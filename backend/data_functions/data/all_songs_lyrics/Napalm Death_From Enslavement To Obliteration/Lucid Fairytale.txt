Lucid Fairytale LyricsDelude yourself with the notion
That life's viewed defiantly through your eye
Subconsciously following the flock
From which appearance is the only exemption
The stagnant illusion of change
Concealed behind your disguise
What's perspicious on the surface
Is artificial inside
When views are merely symbolic
Of an image you hide behind
The stagnant illusion of change
Concealed behind your disguiseEmbed
