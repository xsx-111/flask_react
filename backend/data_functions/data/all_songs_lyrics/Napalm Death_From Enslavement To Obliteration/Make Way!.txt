Make Way! LyricsSyringe into this earth
A virus known as profit
Extract from it the "goodness"
Which in business terms means greed
Make way!
For another snip at the lifeline
"Look - a new site for expansions!
Let's carnage the forests
Our main source of oxygen."
Then we'll dump our shit
Onto a poisoned land
Where poisoned food
Feeds poisoned minds
And we'll dump it in the waters
Where no life now knows
But down it's contaminated rivers
Our baneful conscience flows
As a toxic cloud blackens (our) air
Once so clean and pure
On natures form of retribution
We all must choke!
The truth is here
Angles kill dreamsEmbed
