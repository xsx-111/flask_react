Practice What You Preach LyricsPreaching secondhand ideas
Tried and tested subjects rear
Practice what you preach
A moral attitude you think they lack
Lacks in you when you turn your back
Practice what you fucking preach!
Taking all that you can get
Forgetting everything you've said
But was it really meant?Embed
