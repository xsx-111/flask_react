Impressions LyricsA shroud of insecurity
Surrounds me every move
Actions reflect
Upon the response they receive
A sense of insecurity
Prevents my instincts being followed
Fear lies in my open-ness
Meeting rejection from the crowd
Why should I feel trapped?
Why should I hold back?
Why can't I...break free?Embed
