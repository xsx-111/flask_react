Evolved as One LyricsYour pride
Why should your pride be so restricted?
Restricted to a mere fraction of this earth
This earth from which we have all evolved
This earth where all of its people are downtrodden
Downtrodden by all those who stand to prosper from exploitation
Downtrodden by those whose slime infests your weak minds
Your weak minds
Weak minds
Weak minds
Weak minds
Weak minds
Weak minds
Weak minds
Weak minds
Weak minds
They've got you where they want you
Are you the next in line?
Are you the next in line?
Are you the next in line?
In line
In line
In line
In line

Weak minds
Weak minds
In line
The next in line
In line

Your weak minds
Your weak minds
Your weak minds
Your weak minds
Your weak minds
Your weak minds
