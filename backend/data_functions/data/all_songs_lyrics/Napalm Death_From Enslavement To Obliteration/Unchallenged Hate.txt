Unchallenged Hate LyricsA chronic complaint of dimness
Prevails your profound ideology
A romantic vision of a master race
Attained through coercive forms of authority
Your observance is negligence
If you see the threat from different cultures
We're all in this sinking ship
Each of us together
Where does the white man stand?
Where does the black man stand?
Where do we all fucking stand?
Knee deep in the shit!
Lock into yourself and you'll find the real oppressor
To a life of unchallenged hate
It's yourself who's the "nigga"Embed
