Inconceivable LyricsOutright - in my thinking
And refusal in accepting
How a word so mundane as sexism
Could in some way relate to me
But as I look inside myself I see...
Opinions are somewhat blurred in conception
Passive thoughts become impassive obsessions
And I find I have the ability...
To manipulate those gullible to my persuasion
With deceitful words and actions
Channelled into one dimensional emotions
Not take persons trust under false pretension
Outright - in my thinking
And refusal - in accepting
How a word so mundane as sexism
Could in some way relate to me
But as I look inside myself I see the contradictionsEmbed
