From Enslavement to Obliteration LyricsCommited to a life of slavery
In the factories our own hands have built
Where we must work twice the graft
Before gaining the goods we've already slogged to create
To consume all things material
Stands above human compassion
As we compete with our fellow man
In the bid for a stronger position
In our ruthless search for prosperity
We become the tools of our own oppression
Forming the backbone of a society
That thrives on mass division
From enslavement
To obliterationEmbed
