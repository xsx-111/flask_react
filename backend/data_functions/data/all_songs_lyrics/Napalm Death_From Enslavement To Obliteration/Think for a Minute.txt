Think for a Minute LyricsThoughts, ideas, hopes, ambitions
Sincere in declaration
Or merely token gestures?
Think for a minute...
The pressures we emphasize
Are pressures we all have to bear
And opinions and feelings we should be able to share
But are we slowly crawling up our own arse?
Has the influence drawn from positive expression
Now lost it's strength to external tips on fashion?
And if our music serves as a means of communication
Why should so much emphasis stem from competition?
Slow down and think...
Are our hearts still there?
Is enthusiasm burning?
Has integrity surpassed
The stage of reviving?Embed
