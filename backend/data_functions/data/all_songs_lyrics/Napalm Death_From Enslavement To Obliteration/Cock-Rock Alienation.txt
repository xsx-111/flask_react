Cock-Rock Alienation LyricsCapitalism, racism, sexism
The foundations of cock-rocking idealism
Exploiting, sucking, manipulating
The wisdom of a starry-eyed nation
Making "idols" out of assholes
"Raunchy" "hunky" machismo type fools
"Who cares if they've got no brains
Just give us tits and tools!"
Fantasy? Reality?
Distinction? Satisfaction?
We love it when you feed us shit
We're so stuck in our dreamworld
Let's forget all your problems
And get into the groove!!
Fantasy? Reality?
Distinction? Satisfaction?!?Embed
