Social Sterility LyricsTime for my omittance, from a sterile existence
Where the weekend pays homage to stereotypical perpetuation
Must inebriate my senses into a state of delirium
Before I turn to the meatrack from my penile selection
Apathy spreads in unison with sexual disease
A scourge that infests the cattle markets of youth
Unconscious, just promiscuous
Deprived of self respect
In the selling of their bodies
All emotions dead
Thoughts absorbed
Lost in sense of direction
It's time to sit down
And re - assess my course of actionEmbed
