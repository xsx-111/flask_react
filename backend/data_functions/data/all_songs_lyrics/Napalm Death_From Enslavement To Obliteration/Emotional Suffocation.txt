Emotional Suffocation LyricsSo this ordeal we're subjected to
Is all part of being (in) love?
Two minds of intense confusion
Contained in feelings of spite and mistrust
The closer one of us tries to get
The further the (other) seems to move
Tangled in trapped emotions
Can't face the prospect of rejection
Uncertainty arouses suspicion
Of your mind I want possession
I try to be honest with you
But are you being honest with me?Embed
