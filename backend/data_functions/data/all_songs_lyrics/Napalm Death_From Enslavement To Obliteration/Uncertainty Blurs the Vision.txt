Uncertainty Blurs the Vision LyricsA vision of life
Where together we walk
Unbound from an existence
Of fear and pain
The key to which
Is self-contained
External freedom
Must evolve from liberation within
To gain respect
And see the qualities in all life
Forms the spark
Which strikes the light
When so minimal the loss
How great be the risk
In reaching out and reclaiming our souls?
But until we overcome
The uncertainty in our fellow man
The vision of hope
Remains an illusion
"You reach out and touch it. You feel it
It is the life and love that is alive in you
The feeling that is beyond thought
A feeling of truth
Reality in you
When it is reached, you can reach it in others
This is the liberation. This is the unityEmbed
