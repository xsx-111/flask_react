Sometimes LyricsSometimes when inattentive
I become confused by my own actions
Slow to see in myself
The faults I'm quick to see in others
Barricaded with problems
I try to hide my face
By submitting my strength
To a mind-destroying substance
But why do I run
When it's myself I try to escape?
Why don't I possess the strength
To learn from my mistakes?
The only way to overcome your fears
Is to look them in the eye!
To be aware of ones faults
Is essential if they're to be corrected
When you lack the desire to change
The anguish becomes abundantEmbed
