Private Death LyricsOn your own again, trapped alive in your grave
You're gonna die wasted, no way to be saved
Private death, private death
Private death, you're dead again
Private death, private death
Private death, you're fucking dead
No point in fighting, your life is already lost
Try to escape: you're nailed to the cross
Private death, private death
Private death, dead again
Private death, private death
Private death, you're fucking deadEmbed
