Twenty Two Days LyricsOh it's been 22 lonely blue days without a word from you
And 44 million more tears I've cried since you walked through that door
The sun never reaches my doorstep each empty day seems to be the same
You've broken your vow but I still love you now, oh this love of mine is a one way losing game
And it's been 22 lonely blue days without a word from you
And 44 million more tears I've cried since you walked through that door
The dreams that we share are gone forever but I still have a little hope in my heart
Is this the way it ends? Are we to be both friends? Oh I can't go on if we're to be apart
And it's been 22 lonely blue dayswithout a word from you
And 44 million more tears I've cried since you walked through that door
Yeah 22 days since you walked through that door
Ah 22 days since you walked through that door
Yeah 22 days since you walked through that door
Mmmm 22 days since you walked through that doorEmbed
