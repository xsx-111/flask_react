Come Back to Me (My Love) LyricsBum bum bum da de da oh oh oh yeah yeah
Bum bum bum da de da ah come back to me my love
Come back to me
16 years ago today early one Sunday morn
Just before the break of day a cute little girl was born
From that very moment on her life's been gay and free
Laughing eyes and loving ways as sweet as she could be
Bum bum bum da de da oh oh oh yeah yeah
Bum bum bum da de da ah come back to me my love
Come back to me
We had a quarrel I can't forget the night I made her cry
Her tender heart just fell apart as she said good-bye
Now today is her birthday my baby's sweet 16
But someone else is in my place to hold my every dream
Bum bum bum da de da oh oh oh yeah yeah
Bum bum bum da de da ah come back to me my love
Come back to meEmbed
