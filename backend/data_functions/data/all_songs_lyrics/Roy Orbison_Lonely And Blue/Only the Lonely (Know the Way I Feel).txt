Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel) Lyrics
Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
Only the lonely
Only the lonely

Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know the way I feel tonight (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know this feeling ain't right (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)

And there goes my baby
There goes my heart
They're gone forever
So far apart

But only the lonely
Know why
I cry
Only the lonely

Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
Only the lonely
Only the lonely
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know the heartaches I've been through (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know I cry and cry for you (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)

And maybe tomorrow
A new romance
No more sorrow
But that's the chance

You gotta take
If your lonely heart breaks
Only the lonely
(Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)1Embed
