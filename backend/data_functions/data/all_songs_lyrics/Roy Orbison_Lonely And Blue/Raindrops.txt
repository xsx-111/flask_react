Raindrops LyricsRaindrops, raindrops
I look out my window and what do I see
Raindrops, raindrops
They mark the pathway to my destiny
Raindrops, raindrops
Yes rain like the tears that fell from my heart
The day you said we'd have to part
And now what's left for me to do
But watch those raindrops and cry over you
You've stolen my love and my heart away
Raindrops, raindrops
And I'll feel the same for the rest of my days
Raindrops, raindrops
Well I've tried yes I've tried I want you to know
I did what you asked I loved you so
But I knew in my heart it wouldn't be long
Till I'd look up and you'd be goneEmbed
