The Act We Act LyricsI'm watching you walk
As you walk that distant way
Take that thing away from me
Take away most everything
I couldn't say I'd blame you
You should never look in back
You wouldn't be to blame
If you couldn't take it back
Hours slipping by as you watch
The worlds collide
Now you're nothing more
Than another passerby
The dark it turns to light
In a distant flash of night
Rolling with the tide I confide
The act we wear it thin again
If affection holds you back
Then what is left to hold
If I could find the answer to that
Question then I'd know
The thoughts that
Clutter up your mind
And leave me feeling drained
And walking pacing up the walls
Across the floor again
All the things I haven't seen
Once the final curtain has been raised
The act we act is wearing thin
The act we act under my skin
The words the words we said goodbye
The words left choking in my mind
The act we act is wearing thin
I think we wear it out again
Another big explosion
Leaving you hoping
That something that once
Held you down
Could leave you feeling
On the ground
The confusion that persists
Decisions that you guessed
The one to stay and watch this
The one you might have missed
All the things I haven't seen
Once the final curtain has been raised
The act we act is wearing thin
The act we act we under my skin
The words the words we said goodbye
The words left choking in my mind
The act we act is wearing thin
I think we wear it out again
The act we act we under my skin
The act we act we under my
Forming a conclusion
And you're left standingEmbed
