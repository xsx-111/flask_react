The Slim LyricsDo you know where you're going
Do you know where you've been
Is it simple is it simple
The chances seemed so slim
In a cloud is it cloudy
You've clouded up again
Your perception your decision
Your decision
Behind I'm left behind
Oh, I'm left behind, I'm left behind
It's a matter of time
Your protection from ejection
My rejection
Protection from the slide
Projection from a slide
Did it all seem so easy
So easy to concede
Giving in giving in
The chances seemed so slim
In a moment just a moment
I felt you rushing in
You were rushing I am crushing
Your rush to cruise this
I'm left behind
Left behind I'm left behind
It's a matter of time
Your protection from injection
My rejection
Protection from the slide
Projection from a slide
I with your breath on my pillow
And I with the memory
I get to wait it out never put it away
When you left with your death
I felt empty when I looked back
On my pillow what you used to say
What you used to say
I...I'm left behind
I...I'm left behind
I with your breath on my pillow
I with the memory
I get to wait
It out never put it away
When you left with your death
I felt anger when I looked back
On my pillow what you used to say
What you used to say
I felt your breath for a moment
I heard your voice for a moment
Then I looked back
On my pillow what you used to say
What we used to say
That the chances seemed so slim
The chances used to be so slim
Now I swim alone
The slim
Alone
To honor and obey
To cherish and to worship
In sickness and in health
For richer for poorer for anything
Til death do us partEmbed
