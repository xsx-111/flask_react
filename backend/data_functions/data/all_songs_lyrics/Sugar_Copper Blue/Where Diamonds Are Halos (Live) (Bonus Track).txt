Where Diamonds Are Halos (Live) (Bonus Track) LyricsWilhelmina remained convinced that her relief was waiting
Beyond
The suburban half-life she loathed from the shadows
She didn't know which way to turn until the carnival of freaks
Passed her by
And whisked her away to where diamonds are halos
Every little bit helps. Believe me
Every little bit helps. Believe me
Every little bit helps. Please help me
Believe me
The men in bars and girls in cars made promises to satisfy
The uncontrollable urge to relieve the frustration
The ugly snag of transient life is that all towns are one in the
Same
It depends which end of the dog she is facing
She's piling laundry on top of the man she impaled with a
Decorative spear
If he was turned face up we could gauge his repose
As the engine turns over she waits for the carnival of freaks
To come by
And whisk her away to where diamonds are halosEmbed
