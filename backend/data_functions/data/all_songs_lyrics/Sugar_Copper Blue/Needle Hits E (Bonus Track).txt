Needle Hits E (Bonus Track) LyricsBeen selling it short
I'm seeing sunlight for the very first time
And I'm changing my ways
Hanging out on the roof in the rain
The tragic comedy
I hit the station as the needle hits E
The needle hits E
Fill it up and take another twenty
You're living in desperation
Half the time you don't even know
I'm hanging out your frustration
On the laundry line
Hang you out to dry
You drag it around
You got a bone in front of your face
And you're dragging me down
I feel for you when I feel out of place
It doesn't bother me
I hit the station as the needle hits E
The needle hits E
You're running out 'cause you're running on me
Somebody should tell your mother
All the things you're carting around
Stop kicking the wall, my brother
Have you lost your mind?
All you do is watch the tank run dry
Been living it large
Fill it up and gimme the wheel
And I cherish the day
When you say the things that you feel
Your storm is over now
I hit the station as the needle hits E E E
The needle hits E
Empty empty empty empty empty EEmbed
