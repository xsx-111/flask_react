Man On the Moon LyricsIt's the man on the moon
Saying goodnight to you
Oh how it shines
He's a good friend of mine
He's a good friend of yours
Even many miles away
I hope he comes soon
It's the man on the moon
In a night of despair
Only one light is there
It's the man on the moon
Saying goodnight to you
If you're holding my hand
As the earth turns to sand
I see your face
I see that look on your face
Don't you know that
Space is the place
If you look to the sky
Look him straight in the eye
And as strange as it seems
If you wish all your dreams
Will come true after allEmbed
