Beer Commercial (Live) (Bonus Track) LyricsIf I live my life
In a beer commercial
Surrounded by creeps
Wondering why (2X)
Wondering why o why o why
Must the earth smell like shit
And if I live my life
In a beer commercial
I'd live near the water
Where the babes are hot
And the men are men
Where there is no ... (3X)
Why must the earth smell like shit?
The creeps are the only reality there (4X)Embed
