Helpless LyricsAnother time, time after time
You make me feel so helpless I
I never tried to change your mind
I keep it to myself, it's
Sometimes I've got to tell you
Is it this time I'll tell you
We've got to go to places
Somewhere I don't mind, it's special
And now you find as time goes by
You're left with nothing
Meaning much
The meaning I will have to try
To take your mind to places
I wish that I could help you
But you seem less than helpless
I always tried to tell you
Someday that it'd seem so special
Time after time what's on your mind
You make me feel so helpless I
You never tried what's on your mind
You make me feel so helpless I
I feel so helpless I
You're left alone with something
And I hope for you it's one thing
That something you and yours can
Hold and hold as something special
And now you find as time goes by
You're left with nothing meaning much
The meaning I will have to try
What's on your mind so helpless I
I feel so helpless IEmbed
