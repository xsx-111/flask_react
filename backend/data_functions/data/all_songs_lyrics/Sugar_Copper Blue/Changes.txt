Changes LyricsI want something like I remember
And I want something that lasts forever
I remember times you said
That you'd be true to me
Look at how the weather's changing
I'm accustomed to your deception
Comes the rule with no exception
And I've been dragged across the river
Running far and wide
Come and see how I feel inside
Change for the better
Change for the worse
Changes with summer and fall
Now you're a stranger
Spare me some change
So I can find someone to call my own
Now that winter has fallen upon us
I need something that's warm and honest
And if I found someone who thinks
That they'll be true to me
I really wouldn't want to change it
I have seen, I have seen
What these changes mean to me
If you're thinking of changing
If you're thinking of staying with me
We need to agree
We need to make some changes
We need what we need
Do I need you
Do you need me
Changes
These changes
Changes
These changes
Changes
These changes
Changes
