Anyone (Live) (Bonus Track) LyricsIf cops and kings were geared with wings
They'd never learn to fly
They're too concerned with rules that govern no one
I don't need blind politics
Or nimble flicks
Or Lucite telephones that click when dialing
But I need you
Who would I want if I didn't love you?
Who would I love if you didn't care?
Who would I love if I didn't love you?
If I didn't love you I wouldn't love anyone
So say goodbye to politics
And nimble flicks
And Lucite telephones that click when dialing
It's easyEmbed
