Try Again (Bonus Track) LyricsWhen the clouds of doubt surround you
And there's no relief in sight
When nothing you do holds a meaning
But you can't give up the fight
You think of the good things that might be in store
You try and you try 'til you just can't try any more
There's one thing for certain, that nothing is certain
You try and you try and you try, can you try anymore?
You try again
Somewhere in the back of my mind
I know this indecision well
And you might think that I seem beaten
But I got up each time I fell
I'm not going to lay here expecting the worst
You try and you try 'til you just can't try any more
I'm not giving up, there is hope in here somewhere
I try and I try and I try and I try anymore
You try again
It would be so easy to stop hesitating
It could be so wonderful from now on
And if I put my mind to finding enjoyment
I could break the spell, the worries are gone
I wish being happy was something so simple
If all of the doubts that I had every day went away
Then maybe I'd get to that point in my life
If I try and I try and I try, maybe I
You try againEmbed
