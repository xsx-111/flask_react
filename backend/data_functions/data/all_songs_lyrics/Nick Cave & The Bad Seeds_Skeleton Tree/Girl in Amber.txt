Girl in Amber Lyrics
Some go on, some stay behind, some never move at all
Girl in amber, trapped forever, spinning down the hall
Let no part of her go unremembered, clothes across the floor
Girl in amber, long does slumber shuts the bathroom door

The phone, the phone, the phone it rings, it rings, it rings no more
The song, the song, the song it spins since 1984
The phone, the phone, the phone, it rings, the phone, it rings no more
The song, the song, it's been spinning now since 19...

If you want to bleed, just bleed (Ah)
And if you want to bleed, just bleed (Ah)
And if you want to bleed, don't breathe a word
Just step away
And let the world spinning now

You turn, you turn, you kneel, lace up his shoes, your little blue-eyed boy
Take him by his hand, go moving spinning down the hall
I get lucky, I get lucky 'cause I tried again
I knew the world it would stop spinning now since you've been gone
I used to think that when you died you kind of wandered the world
In a slumber till you crumbled, were absorbed into the earth
Well, I don't think that any more
The phone it rings no more
The song, the song it spins, it spins now since 1984
The song, the song, the song it spins, it's been spinning now
And if you'll hold me I will tell you that you know that

If you want to leave, don't breathe (Ah)
And if you want to leave, don't breathe (Ah)
And if you want to leave, don't breathe a word
And let the world turn

The song, the song it spins, the song, it spins, it spins no more
The phone, it rings, it rings
And you won't stay

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Don't touch me (Ah)
Don't touch me (Ah)
Don't touch me (Ah)
Don't touch me2Embed
