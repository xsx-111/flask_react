Rings of Saturn Lyrics
Upside down and inside out and on all eights
Like a funnel-web, like a black fly on the ceiling
Skinny, white haunches high and skyward
And her black oily gash crawling backwards across the carpet to smash all over everything
Her wet, black fur against the sun going down
Over the shops and the cars and the crowds in the town

And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she does and this is what she is

Her eyes that look at me through her rainy hair
Are two round holes where the air buckles and rushes in
Her body, moon blue as a jellyfish
And I'm breathing deep and I'm there and I'm also not there
And spurting ink over the sheets, but she remains, completely unexplained
Or maybe I'm just too tongue-tied to drink it up and swallow back the pain
I thought slavery had been abolished
How come it's gone and reared its ugly head again?

And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
And this is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she is and this is what she does
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
And this is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
Then this is what she does and this is what she is
And now she's jumping up with her leaping brain
Stepping over heaps of sleeping children
Disappearing and further up and spinning out again
Up and further up she goes, up and out of the bed
Up and out of the bed and down the hall where she stops for moment and turns and says
"Are you still here?"
And then reaches high and dangles herself like a child's dream from the ring of Saturn3Embed
