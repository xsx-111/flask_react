Skeleton Tree Lyrics
Sunday morning, skeleton tree
Well, nothing is for free
In the window, a candle
Well, maybe you can see
Fallen leaves thrown across the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white like fire
Nothing is for free

I call out, I call out
Right across the sea
But the echo comes back empty
And nothing is for free

Sunday morning, skeleton tree
Pressed against the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white like fire

I call out, I call out
Right across the sea
I call out, I call out
Nothing is for free
And it's alright now
And it's alright now
And it's alright now2Embed
