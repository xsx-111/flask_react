I Need You Lyrics
When you're feeling like a lover, nothing really matters anymore
I saw you standing there in the supermarket
With your red dress falling and your eyes are to the ground
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters when the one you love is gone

It's still in me, baby I need you
In my heart, I need you

Cause nothing really matters
I'm standing in the doorway
You're walking 'round to my place
In your red dress, hair hanging down
With your eyes on one, we love the ones we can
Cause nothing really matters when you're standing

Standing
I need you, need you

Cause nothing really matters
We followed the lines in the palms of our hands
You're standing in the supermarket
Nothing, holding hands
In your red dress, falling, falling in, falling in
The long black cars waiting 'round
I will miss you when you're gone
I'll miss you when you're gone away forever
Cause nothing really matters
I thought I knew better, so much better
And I need you
I need you

Cause nothing really matters
Oh the night we wrecked like a train
Purring cars in the pouring rain
Never felt right about it, never again
Cause nothing really matters
Nothing really matters anymore
Not even today, no matter how hard I try
When you're standing in the aisle
And baby, nothing, nothing, nothing

I need, I need, I need you
I need you, I need you
Just breathe, just breathe
I need you4Embed
