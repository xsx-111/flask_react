Prelude LyricsFunk upon a time
In the days of the Funkapus
The concept of specially-designed Afronauts
Capable of funkatizing galaxies
Was first laid on man-child
But was later repossessed
And placed among the secrets of the pyramids
Until a more positive attitude
Towards this most sacred phenomenon
Clone Funk
Could be acquired
(we want the funk, give up the funk)
There in these terrestrial projects
It would wait, along with its co-inhabitants of kings and pharaohs
Like sleeping beauties with a kiss
That would release them to multiply
In the image of the chosen one:
Dr Funkenstein
And funk is its own reward
May I frighten you?Embed
