Children of Production LyricsWe are children of production
Produced in conjunction
With the urgency of our Dr Funkenstein
In his wisdom he forenotioned
The shortcomings of your condition
So, we the Clones, were designed
We're gonna blow the cobwebs out your mind
We're a flawless testimony
To the attainment of the P.Funk
Endowed with conceivement of true groove
We are deeper than abortion
Deeper than the notion
That the world was flat when it was round
We're gonna blow the cobwebs out your mind (x2)
We're a biological timebomb
Exploding in a timezone
And almost everyone is out of time
We are children of production
Produced in conjunction
With the urgency of our Dr Funkenstein
In his wisdom he forenotioned
The shortcomings of your condition
So, we the Clones, were designed
We're gonna blow the cobwebs out your mind
We are deeper than abortion
Deeper than the notion
That the world was flat when it was round
We're gonna blow the cobwebs out your mind (x2)1Embed
