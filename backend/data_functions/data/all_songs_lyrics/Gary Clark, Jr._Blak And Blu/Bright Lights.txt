Bright Lights Lyrics
Woke up in New York City lying on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's - West 54
You're gonna know my name by the end of the night
You're gonna know my name by the end of the night

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care, cause you don't care

Start off with the bottle ended up with the bottle
Taking shots, waiting on tomorrow
Tryn' ta fill up what's hollow
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name


Got lost in the city tryna find myself
I went up a different person, came down somebody else
I know it ain't right, but it's all in my head
I'm surprised that I'm still alive, should be dead
