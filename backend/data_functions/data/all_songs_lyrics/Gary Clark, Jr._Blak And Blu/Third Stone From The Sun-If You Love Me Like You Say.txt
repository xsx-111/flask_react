Third Stone From The Sun/If You Love Me Like You Say LyricsIf you love me like you say
Why you treat me like you do
If you love me like you say
Why you treat me like you do
Well, I ain't no fool
Yeah, I'm cool, I know the rules
Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late
Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late
Let me tell, you pretty baby
Oh, I gotta set you straight
Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late
Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late
Let me tell you, pretty baby
Oh, I gotta set you straight1Embed
