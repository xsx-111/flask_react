When My Train Pulls In Lyrics
Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old things
And i, I can't take it no more
I would leave this town
But I ain't got no where else to go
Wake up in the morning to more, more bad news
Sometimes I feel like I was born to lose
And i, It's driving me out of my mind
Gonna catch the next train
And move on down the line

I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long
And i, I can't live this life again

Walking down the street you might run across a smiling face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn, walk away, And i
Oh Lord, it's bringing me down
If things don't change around here
Ain't no use in my hanging 'round
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long
And i, I can't live this life again2Embed
