Soul LyricsPretty face, perfect frame, you got it going on
Model walk with that baby talk, you know, girl you got me gone
You so hard to hold onto and I'm really, really hanging on
My friends tell me I'm too far gone, and I really should be moving on
But all I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby, yeah
Had this pretty little thing back home I can't seem to do nothing, no wrong
This really don't make no sense
After everything, my money spent she was so hard to hold onto
And I was really, really hanging on
My friend's said I was too far gone and I should have been moving along
'Cause all I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
This time she's leaving for sure
I know she won't be back no more
She left the key to my door
I'll be alone
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, babyEmbed
