Travis County Lyrics
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Travis County took my picture
But no, I didn't smile
They told me I was gonna be here
For a pretty long while
One day I was walking down the street when
I should've been walking down the hall
Heard a voice calling out, saying
"Ooh, where you going, y'all?"
Now before I could've gathered my thoughts
I turned around and I saw the cops
I pointed arms up right when
He told me I better stop

They put my hands in cuffs
Oh boy, they even locked me up
When I thought that it was all a bluff
Till they started taking my stuff
Now I'm sittin' 'round in my cell
Just a looking at the wall
I didn't even get to make
My one phone call
After I was just sittin' 'round
You know I started getting down
When they let me out
All I could do is scream and shout

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, ooohEmbed
