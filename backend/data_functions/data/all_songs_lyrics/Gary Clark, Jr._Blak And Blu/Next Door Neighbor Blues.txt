Next Door Neighbor Blues LyricsGot a call from my neighbor this morning
Told me that my baby was gone
Got a call from my neighbor this morning
Told me that my baby was gone
Took the keys to my cadillac
Left my clothes out all alone
Came home last night
With a pistol pointed at my head
Came home last night
With a pistol pointed at my head
Said, "You better fess up, oh boy
Or I swear I'm gonna shoot you dead
I didn't know something was wrong
Somethin' wrong been going on
I should've known
I didn't know somethin' been going wrong
When my neighbor called, oh yeah
I found out that little girl was staying next doorEmbed
