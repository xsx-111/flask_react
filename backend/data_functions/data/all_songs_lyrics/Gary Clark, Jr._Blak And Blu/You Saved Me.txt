You Saved Me Lyrics
It's taking me a little while to bounce back
I've been falling from something good
People say I took a little too long
Oh, I did, yeah

Till you came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love
You came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love

It's taking me a little while to call back
I've been working on something good
So every now and then I tend to fall back
Oh Lord, I've been misunderstood


You got it all, baby
I'm so addicted, I can't help but want it more
And more and more
You got it all, baby
I'm so addicted, I can't help but want it more
And more and more2Embed
