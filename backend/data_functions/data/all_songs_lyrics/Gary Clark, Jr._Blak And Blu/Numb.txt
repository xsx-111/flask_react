Numb Lyrics
Well, I'm numb
Yeah woman, I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah woman, I can't feel a thing

She give me hard time in the day
A hard time at night
She can be so sweet till she wanna fuss and fight


Ain't passing from the right
I'm passing to the left
Burn this whole thing down by myselfEmbed
