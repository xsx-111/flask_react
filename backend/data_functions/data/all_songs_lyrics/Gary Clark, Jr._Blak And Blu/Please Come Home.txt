Please Come Home Lyrics
My love is with you
Even though you're far away
You make me love you
And that's where my love will stay
Those times I get lonely
You're the one who truly knows me
I can tell it in the way you talk
You show me

Why don't you please come home
Come on home, girl
You've been gone way too long
Come on home, girl

As time goes by
My days go by slower
My nights are getting colder
And my mind has gone astray
Why don't you please come home, oh
Come on home, girl
You've been gone way too long
Oh, come on home
Ooh, come home, girl
Oh, come on home, girl
Oh please come home, girl5Embed
