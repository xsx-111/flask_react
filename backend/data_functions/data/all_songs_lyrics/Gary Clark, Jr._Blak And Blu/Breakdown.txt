Breakdown LyricsOoh ah
It gets cold outside standing all alone
Spendin' all day on the telephone
All I wanna do is go home
But I won't stop here
Checkpoints got us paranoid
They think they've got another boy
Well I got somethin' you need to know about it, and I can't stop now
I gotta green light I'm on my way
Just turnin' to a brighter day
Everything ain't goin' my way
But I won't stop now
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Once again we do a show and
Leave with a pocket of zero dollar bills
And we feel it's a steal
But we won't breakdown
Backseat of the van
Thinkin' damn I'm the man
With the master plan
And I can't give a damn about nothin' at all
I'm gonna do my thing
And not stop now
So I keep on bringin' it all
Till I reach the light I
I won't stop now, I can see the light
I'm already feelin' late at the light
So I can't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
Well I can see it, feel it, I know (breakdown)
Breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I can't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdownEmbed
