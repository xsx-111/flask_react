Sorrow Lyrics
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow
Sorrow

You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games
Of sorrow
Sorrow
You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow
Sorrow
Ahh, ooh, ooh

I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair3Embed
