Dancing in the Street LyricsOkay
Tokyo, South America, Australia, France, Germany, UK, Africa
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago (Dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans (Dancing in the street)
In New York City (Dancing in the street)
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
It's an invitation across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
They'll be laughing and singing and music swinging
Dancing in the street
Philadelphia, PA (Dancing in the street)
Baltimore in DC now (Dancing in the street)
Don't forget the motor city (Dancing in the street)
On the streets of Brazil (Dancing in the street)
Back in the USSR (Dancing in the street)
Don't matter where you are (Dancing in the street)
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
Way down in L.A., everyday
Dancing in the street (Dancing in the street)
Cross in China too, me and you
Dancing in the street (Dancing in the street)
Don't you know they'll be dancing
Dancing in the street (Dancing in the street)
Don't you know they'll be d-d-d-d-dancing
Dancing in the street (Dancing in the street)Embed
