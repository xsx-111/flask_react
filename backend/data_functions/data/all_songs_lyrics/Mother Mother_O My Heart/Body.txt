Body Lyrics
Take my eyes, take them aside
Take my face, and desecrate
My arms and legs, they get in the way
And take my hands, they'll understand
Take my heart, pull it apart
And take my brain, or what remains
And throw it all away

'Cause I've grown tired of this body
A cumbersome and heavy body

Take my lungs, take them and run
Take my tongue, go have some fun
And take the ears, take them and disappear
And take my joints, take them for points
Take my teeth, tear through my cheeks
And take the nose, go and dispose
Oh, would you go dispose, just go dispose?

'Cause I've grown tired of this body
A cumbersome and heavy body
I've grown tired of this body
Fall apart without me, body
Ooh
Take my eyes, take them aside
Take my face, and desecrate
Arms and legs, get in the way
Bodies break

I've grown tired of this body
Cumbersome and heavy body
I've grown tired of this body
Fall apart without me, body
I've grown tired of this body
Cumbersome and heavy
Tired of this body
Fall apart without me

Tired of this body
Cumbersome and heavy
Tired of this body
Fall apart without me
Tired of this body
Tired of this body
Tired of this body
Cumbersome and heavy body
Cumbersome and heavy body
Heavy body26Embed
