O My Heart Lyrics
Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks
And it bakes in the bad sun
Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh my heart, it's a rock and great boulder
And stuck in the gutter

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far, it come back floating
And I watch it wash it up with the dead fish
But it ain't quite dead, it just is like this
Oh my heart, it's a house in tornado
Oh my heart, it's a house in the sky
In the eye of tornado
Oh my heart, it's a roof in El Niño
Oh my heart, it's a roof made of straw
In the jaw of El Niño

And I pour my heart a new foundation
But it don't set hard, it just stays shaking
And I scratch my name, I scratch my name in
But it don't set hard, it gets mixed back in
Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum
Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum
Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum buhhh...

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh my heart, it's the black in a rainbow
Oh my heart, it's so damn so cold
So damn cold

And I throw my heart into the fire
'Cause I want to set my heart on fire
And I watch it try, befriending embers
But the ice don't melt in mid-December

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks
And it bakes in the bad sun8Embed
