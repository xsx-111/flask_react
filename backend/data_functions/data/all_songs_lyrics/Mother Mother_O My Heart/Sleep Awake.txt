Sleep Awake Lyrics
Protecting you, protecting me
I throw the evidence into a trunk and drop it in the sea
Lie awake, I sleep awake
I sleep with one eye on the bedroom door, the other on the cake
Protecting me, protecting you
Carving away our fingerprints out of our fingertips until they're smooth

Lie awake, I sleep awake
I sleep with one eye on my royal flush, the other on the take
I sleep awake

Protecting this, protecting that
Calling a deadbeat with his dead bolt wrapped around his artifact
Protecting that
Lie awake, I sleep awake
I sleep with one hand on my .45, the other 'round my baby's waist

Lie awake, I sleep awake
I go to bed with all my lights turned on so I don't slip away
I stay awake
Out on the street I keep a started car who only waits for me
Conveniently

Lie awake, I sleep awake
Lie awake, I sleep awake
Ahhh, ahhh
Ahhh, ahhh6Embed
