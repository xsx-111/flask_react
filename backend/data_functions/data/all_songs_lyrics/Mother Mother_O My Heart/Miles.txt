Miles Lyrics
Miles and miles and miles
Before we reach the sand
Cacti and cacti for miles
Miles of dry land, dry land

We gonna make it
Ooh, we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Ooh, we gonna take it

Easy
Once we feel the sea breeze

My my my my my my
My lover, my maker, my breaker
Take me by the hand
We could go walking for miles
Once we reach the sand, the sand

We gonna make it
Ooh, we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Ooh, we gonna take it
Easy
Once we leave the city


We gonna make it
Ooh, we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Ooh, we gonna take it
We gonna make it
Yeah, we gonna make it
Easy, easy

We gonna make it
Ooh, we gonna make it
We gonna take it
Ooh, we gonna take it
