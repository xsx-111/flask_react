Wisdom Lyrics
Folding my clothes, and I feel useless
Don't think I know how to do this
Once I was told, but like any misfit
I spit on some good advice

Out in the cold and tryin' to make fire
Two sticks and stone, still got no fire
Once I was shown, but I was inside then
And spit on that good advice

Wisdom, wisdom
Where can I get some?
Wisdom, wisdom

On the payroll and digging up ditches
Dollar is low, so are my wages
Once I was told just how to get rich
But I spit on that good advice

Wisdom, wisdom
Where can I get some?
Wisdom, wisdom
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Wisdom, wisdom
Where can I get some?
Wisdom, wisdom
I wanna trade my dimwits in for tips
Tips equipped with wisdom, wisdom

Take off my clothes, and I feel useless
Don't think I know how to do this
Once I was told, but I like to fidget
And miss out on good advice
