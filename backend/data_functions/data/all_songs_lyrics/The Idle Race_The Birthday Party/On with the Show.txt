On with the Show LyricsSun is shining for me
I'll be on my way
I'll be rolling along
'Cause I need to feel alright
From the evening 'til the early light
Nowhere to go
But it's on with the show
Wander down any lane
I'll be strolling, too
I do a brave show for you
Don't you know I feel alright
From the evening 'til the early light?
Nowhere to go
But it's on with the show
Feel alright
From the evening 'til the early light
Nowhere to go
But it's on with the show
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la...Embed
