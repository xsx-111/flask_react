Skeleton and the Roundabout Lyrics
Climb aboard my roundabout
Climb aboard my roundabout

I am the fairground man at heart
I run the roundabout this part
I fill this fair, but custom have I none
I turn the handle 'round so fast
It makes my elbow ache
Nobody seems to care
No one rides upon my roundabout
No longer anymore
Oh, what a horrid fair

Climb aboard my roundabout
Climb aboard my roundabout
Climb aboard my roundabout
Climb aboard my roundabout

Money, there is none
I'm thinner than a skellington

But wait a minute, I'm so thin
Then all these aches and pains
Could be a chance for me
I could be a horror
Or a ghost in a ghost train
I think I'll go and see
I meet the man who runs the ghost train
He says, "You're just great!"
"I'll pay you top-class wages
If you'll just hang from this gate"

A year is passing, lots of food
And money come my way
Oh, lucky man am I
But who's this telling me, "You're fired"?
"You're much too fat to be a ghost
Be on your way!"
So here I am

Climb aboard my roundabout
Climb aboard my roundabout
Climb aboard my roundabout
Climb aboard my roundabout

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...Embed
