Pie in the Sky LyricsPie in the sky
Who's to say why it won't happen
Mountains of dreams
Floods like a stream running down them
Through rocky glades
We'll find a way
We want to, so maybe we may
Pie in the sky
Never say die and keep trying
Mountains of dreams
Eyes brightly gleam and you're sighing
We made it then
Needn't say when
I want you again and again
Pie in the sky
Words that imply something stupid
Mountains of dreams
Loving you seemed so illusive
Still we kept on
Nothing went wrong
Together we proved love is strong
Pie in the sky
Who's to say why it won't happen
Mountains of dreams
Floods like a stream running down them
Through rocky glades
We'll find a way
Forever, together we'll stayEmbed
