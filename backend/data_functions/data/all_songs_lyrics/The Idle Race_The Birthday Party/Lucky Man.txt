Lucky Man Lyrics
I'm very lucky
I think you'll agree

I've lost the key to my front door
I can't get in there anymore
Oh my
I've lost the key to my love's heart
It's down the drain and in the dark
Oh my

I think you'll agree

Oh my

He said, "Hurry up and get theâ€”"
Oh my

I'm very lucky
I think you'll agree

I've lost the key to my front door
I can't get in there anymore
Oh my
I've lost the key to my love's heart
It's down the drain and in the dark
Oh my

I'm very lucky
I think you'll agreeEmbed
