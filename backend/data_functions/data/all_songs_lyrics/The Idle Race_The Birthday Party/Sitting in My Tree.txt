Sitting in My Tree LyricsI often sit alone up in a tree
Waving to the ones that wave at me
I think, 'Well just how stupid can they be
Waving to a man up in a tree?'
What they don't know is I am counting them
I even count the ladies and the men
I put the numbers in my little book
And only me can ever have a look
All I ask is a peace of mind
Which I lost somewhere down amongst the mess
All I want is for people to be kind
And walk slower to be counted when they pass
I think, 'Well just how stupid can they be
Waving to a man up in a tree?'
I know that I will have to stop my fun
When I meet a girl who I cannot count on
Maybe marry her and happy we would be
Not counting, but a-sitting up a tree
I put the numbers in my little book
And only me can ever have a look
I think, 'Well just how stupid can they be
Waving to a man up in a tree?'Embed
