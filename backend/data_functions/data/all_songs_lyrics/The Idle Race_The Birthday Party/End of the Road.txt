End of the Road Lyrics
There was peace and quiet for me
Down the walk, beside the sea
Things are going wrong, boy
Things are going wrong

I used to wake up in the morning
To the sound of the birds
Singing at my window
Please wait for me, I'll be there
At the end of the road

Now the good thing's gone with the wind
It's bad today, I moved away
Things are going wrong, boy
Things are going wrong

I used to wake up in the morning
To the sound of the birds
Singing at my window
Please wait for me, I'll be there
At the end of the road
Things are going wrong, boy
Things are going wrong

I used to wake up in the morning
To the sound of the birds
Singing at my window
Please wait for me, I'll be there
At the end of the road

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-oohEmbed
