Follow Me, Follow LyricsSee how they go
On the wings of a shiny bird
And the reason for their leaving
Is not easy
Follow me, follow
Follow me too far away
Follow me, follow
Where you will go
See how they go
On the wings of a shiny bird
And they'll all be friends together
Now they're leaving
See how they try
To be happy when they're leaving home
But the captain of the shiny bird
Won't wait now
Follow me, follow
Follow me too far away
Follow me, follow
Where you will go
See how they go
On the wings of a shiny bird
And the reason for their leaving
Is not easy
Follow me, follow
Follow me too far away
Follow me, follow
Where you will go
Follow me, follow
Follow me too far away
Follow me, follow
Where you will goEmbed
