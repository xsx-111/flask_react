The Birthday Lyrics
She had a birthday yesterday, she cried
Took off her glasses, let her hair down, cried
She told them all at work about the day
How it is no one came?
Whoa oh, whoa oh

She sent the invitations to her friends
They were too busy doing other things
She told them all at work about the day
How it is no one came?
Whoa oh, whoa oh

She took the decorations from the wall
Was it the ladder, loose, that made her fall?
She told them all at work about the day
How it is no one came?
Whoa oh, whoa oh

She had a birthday yesterday, she cried

(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)...Embed
