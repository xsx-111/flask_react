The Lady Who Said She Could Fly Lyrics
Did you meet the lady
Who said she could fly?
She broke off her wings
When she fell from the sky
The effort was brave
And she gave a sigh
"Now I'll sail through the sky
On my own, my oh my"

I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere
I can fly through the sky
And just see if I care

When she was a girl
She would jump rather high
Then she fell in love
With the air and the sky
She discovered her wings
And she gave a loud cry
"Now I'll sail through the sky
On my own, my oh my"
I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere
I can fly through the sky
And just see if I care

Back to the story

Now she's been repaired
And her wings are as new
She's laughing and dancing
Way up in the blue
But look, she has gone
Where could she go to?
Her wings were so silver
Her halo so new

I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere
I can fly through the sky
And just see if I care
I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere
I can fly through the sky
And just see if I care
I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere...Embed
