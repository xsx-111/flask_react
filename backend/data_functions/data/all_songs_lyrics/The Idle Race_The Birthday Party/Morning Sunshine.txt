Morning Sunshine Lyrics
Wait 'til the morning sunshine
Wait 'til the morning sunshine
Feels like another day
I wouldn't know, my love's away
From home today

Wait 'til the morning sunshine
Wait 'til the morning sunshine
It's just the memory
Of sunshine in the morning
Being close to me

And it was
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
(Ah, ah, ah) Ah, ah

Wait 'til the morning sunshine
Wait 'til the morning sunshine
Seems like the world is late
For I can't wait
For sunshine in the morning
Wait 'til the morning sunshine
Wait 'til the morning sunshineEmbed
