The Riot of Your Time LyricsThe only king of rock has gone
Gone to heaven
A star on the way to the stars
Another king of rock is born, '77
Just born to be there when it starts
'94, '95, if the world is still alive
Will be the start for the riot of your time
Here's a ticket for the burning train
To set the world in flames
To play the hero's game
The riot of your time
Here's a ticket for the future days
You'll be the x-rock king
The new electric face
The riot of your time
A new generation's mind
The riot of your time
He's got the message to be more
A new desire
A storm full of life wild and young
"The X-Rock 1994 electric fire"
Will burn out the time like the sun
'94, '95, if the world is still alive
Will be the start for the riot of your time
Here's a ticket for the burning train
To set the world in flames
To play the hero's game
The riot of your time
Here's a ticket for the future days
You'll be the x-rock king
The new electric face
The riot of your time
A new generation's mind
The riot of your time1Embed
