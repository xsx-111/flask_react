Steamrock Fever Lyrics
We'd like to introduce tonight
The kings of a brand new style
They're hungry to play
We'd like to introduce tonight
The new heavy steamrock style
Quite different and strange

All right, how do you feel tonight
Get up to see and cry
The name of the band
Steam right with hands and feet tonight
Get up to see and cry and they will begin

Here they are
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A
All right, how do you feel tonight
Get up to see and cry
The name of the band
Steam right with hands and feet tonight
Get up to see and cry and they will begin
Here they are
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in L.A
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believersEmbed
