Suspender Love LyricsAh, you turn me on
I feel the biggest part of yours
Ah, ah there's something more
So much more baby
Ah, I can't be cool
It's getting stronger every day
Well, yeah, ain't choosin' you
I cut him out baby
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
I can't get enough
Too hard a body drives me mad
Oh yeah it's like a drum
To stay in love baby
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Ah, ah, oh yeah
Ah, ha, ah, ha, ha
Oh baby yeah
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rainEmbed
