Still Walking LyricsStill walking
Share of thee water
In its element
Like all of us
Like a book
Spell of semen
Wall of silence
Or too?
This end
Or all of us
He said
"All of us do it"
Each time asleep
Each time he said
Especially again
Especially item
The totem was his
The uncle was his
Every time it fell open
At the same ritual
Every time she said
The words he cried
And no one saw
That's how it is
He said
"That's the whole problem"
"Each time"
