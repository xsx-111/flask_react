Convincing People Lyrics
There's never a way, there's never a day
To convince people
You can play their game, you can say their name
But won't convince people

There's several ways, and there's several ways
To convince people
Now you're people, and we're people, we've got a way
To convince people

It's the name of the game
It's the game of the name
Convincing people
Convincing people


There's one way though, that you'll never convince people
And that's when you try, to be someone
Who's not telling and who's trying to compel
Who's trying to tell you, what you ought to be convinced of
So there's several ways, and there's several days
To convince your people, and you are the people
Convincing people
Convincing people


We don't want to convince
We don't want to convince people
We don't want to convince, we don't want to convince
We don't want to convince people
Let me tell you what I want
Let me tell you what I want
I want you to do
I want you to do
I'll tell you what I want you to do
I'll tell you what I want you to do
I'll tell you what I want you to do

It's no way, no way, it's no way, it's no way
To convince people1Embed
