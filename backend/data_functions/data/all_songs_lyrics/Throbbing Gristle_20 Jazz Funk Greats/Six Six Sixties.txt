Six Six Sixties LyricsI am one of the injured, a tear blurs flesh
Dissolving like an injured dog
Like wasted limbs get smaller
Pain is the stimulus of pain
But then, of course, nothing is cured
This is the world now
Move a fin and the world turns
Sit in a chair and pictures change
Try to eat us, get trapped or injured
