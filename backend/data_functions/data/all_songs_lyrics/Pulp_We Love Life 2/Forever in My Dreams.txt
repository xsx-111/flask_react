Forever in My Dreams LyricsWhatever we do the cavalier will keep on laughing
From his place upon the wall
And that's how it might be forever
'cos you know most of the time I don't do anything at all
But I'm in love with you - whatever that may mean
I believe we can be together now and forever in my dreams
It's so easy to say forever in my dreams
And I understand that you can't wait forever
For me to decide what's on my mind
This attitude so cavalier, will be the death of me, I'm sure my dear
But in the meantime, try not to think too badly of me
Because I'm in love with you - whatever that may mean
I believe that we should be together now and forever in my dreams
Dreams can cut through life and rip it at the seams
Teach me how to fall in love and how to make it last forever
And I love and respect you, I will honour and obey
But baby will I marry you? Well, that will be the day
And not when we can be together now
And forever in my dreamsEmbed
