Yesterday Lyrics
Yesterday you were the daddy
Yeah, you were steaming
You had it all, then you realized
You were only dreaming
Now you're washing up last night's coffee cups
Yeah, you get cleaning
'Cause yesterday's not today
So it has no meaning

Yesterday you were the dog's
But then you blew it
You set your sights on the best of all, and you got it
But you never knew it
Now you don't feel wronged or noble at all
Just very stupid
Yeah, yesterday's not today
Yesterday is over
Oh yeah, yesterday is so far away
Cannot hurt you

Yeah, yesterday's gone
So yesterday can't hurt ya
Yeah, yesterday's gone
So yesterday can't hurt ya
(Nothing to live up to)
(You've no one to pay)
Yeah, yesterday's gone
So yesterday can't hurt ya
(Look out of your window)
(It's a beautiful day)
Yeah, yesterday's gone
So yesterday can't hurt yaEmbed
