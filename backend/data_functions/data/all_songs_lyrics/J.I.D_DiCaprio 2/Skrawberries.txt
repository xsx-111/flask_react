Skrawberries Lyrics
My girl booty soft and it's shaped like a skrawberry
Her pussy bald with a tat like Stephon Marbury
Carry all my dirt to the grave, I'm the pallbearer
Bury all of my sins, staring out of the Benz
Gone off weed, gone off Hen', gone with the wind
Gone with the pretty long heiress with the fairest skin
Yelling in her face, and she repeat it like a parrot and
Apparently, she gone keep yelling at me, I'ma never win
Where your ass was at when I was sleeping on the couch
And in the whip?
Probably with another nigga, on another nigga dick
I'm on another tip, my skin so tint, strength on strength
One on ten against me, I won't break, I don't bend
Watch your statements, guard your chin
Guard your heart, guard your light
Find your zen, mind your lightness
You doing without cause you ain't looking within
But if you ever in doubt, give this a spin

Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down
Check, look, cool
I mean shawty had relations that we never could speak about
You get mad, I'm mad, we sleep it out
And then she had a man who used to beat her
So she told me she wanted out
Got a couple abortions, now that pussy's a haunted house
Now her heart cold, Antartica, Siberia
Had it planned out, curriculum, criteria
Change, she feel pain, strain, built-up anger
From dealing with a dickhead, putting her life in danger
I understand, it's times that you go through your women things
And sometimes can't gauge clearly on what you be thinking
I swear I got your back and got the tab on what you drinking
You ain't gotta move a finger or pinky when we linking
Whatever keeps your boat afloat or ship sinking
From loose lips of side women stepping out of position
Breaking out of a system, prison
Parallelogram, shaping the prism, stop signs never stopped I
Let's be realistic, I been trying to get in touch with my senses
And be better to my sisters
But niggas think that you feminine when you sensitive
My homegirl rap, and she feminist
Hold it down for the women, I call her "Feminem"
Tell 'em how you really feel headass
'Cause ass shots are dead ass and fake tits been around, we gas it
Girl, you perfect without that makeup or the plastic surgery
I'ma tell you how it is like Ron Burgundy
Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down13Embed
