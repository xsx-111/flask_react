Weekend Woman Lyrics
Hey, look who's here, this place is not my home
A change has got to come
Face hot with tears, how was I supposed to know?
The ABC's of love

Salvation lies within, don't ask me what I did
When God made her he threw away the formula

We fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman

Get in, get out, no time for poetry
You can't change people's minds
I'll meet you there, your walls are painted green
Our vines have intertwined
Was this your parting gift? Black eye and bloody lip
Ten years from now I'll still remember every word

We fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman

I still believe your beautiful lies (I still believe your beautiful lies)
You don't have to die to go to Heaven
I still believe your beautiful lies (I still believe your beautiful lies)
It almost makes me feel young again

We fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
All I want is to reach my weekend woman2Embed
