Beach Boys Lyrics
Heard that before
Uh

The sun won't shine tonight, metro screaming by
Walking with the Mexicans, should I call an ambulance?
We need a melody, a gorgeous four part harmony
So it all makes sense, there's gotta be more than this
Everyone wants to be cooler than everyone else
It's a hip hop world and we're the furniture
Let's get out of the city, let me tell you about a band I loved
When I was a west-side kid, mmm

Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, singing loud in a sweet voice
On a roll like a twist toy, keep cranking them Beach Boys
Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint, keep cranking them Beach Boys

Whatcha wanna do tonight? I'll make it all happen, mixing up OJ
And champagne, cooler than the ice capades
We need a leader, someone to tell us what to do
To raise the bar, to make it rain
We're gonna go caroling in Ocean Park, if you know the notes
Sing from your heart, 'cause it's gonna be fun
I'm a remarkable guy, I keep you trying new things
I keep you young, mmm
Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, singing loud in a sweet voice
On a roll like a twist toy, keep cranking them Beach Boys
Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint, keep cranking them Beach Boys

They'll be there when you wake up
Your soothing midnight mantra
Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, making my eyes get moist
Hold em up at gunpoint

I've heard that before, but I want to hear it again
(I wanna hear it over and over again)
I've heard that before, but I want to hear it over and over again
(I wanna hear it over and over again)

Fellas, I have 3000 words to say
Quit screaming and start singing from your hearts, huh?

Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, singing out in a sweet voice
On a roll like a Rolls Royce, keep cranking them Beach boys
Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint, keep cranking them Beach Boys
They'll be there when you wake up
Your soothing midnight mantra
Turn it up, it's the Beach Boys, making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint, keep cranking them Beach Boys

We, we don't have a blend
Can we hear, can we have a chord?
Just a chord like we used to
When you used to sing clear records, okay?
Let's go, let's go, let's goEmbed
