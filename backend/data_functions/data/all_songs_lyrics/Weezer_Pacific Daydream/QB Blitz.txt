QB Blitz Lyrics
All of my conversations die a painful death you see
I can't get anyone to do algebra with me
It's hard to make real friends, my friends have lots of friends
I don't hang out enough, take drugs and learn to love

This intercom is broken into pieces
I gotta call my QB Blitz, B Blitz
Out on the ice fields of Hoth, I'll be
I'll be missing you like oxygen (xygen)
Whoah whoah whoah
I'll be missing you like oxygen

I want to have the feeling someone's in love with me
You gotta choose between the internet and me
People don't bring me joy, I think you get the point
I'm on an epic quest, pursuit of happiness

This intercom is broken into pieces
I gotta call my QB Blitz, B Blitz
Out on the ice fields of Hoth, I'll be
I'll be missing you like oxygen (xygen)
Whoah whoah whoah
I'll be missing you like oxygen
Sing for the moment, little place on the ocean
In the middle of a snowdrift, we're alone in the universe
Sing for the moment, put a paper lantern over the light
Sing for the moment

This intercom is broken into pieces
I gotta call my QB Blitz, B Blitz
Out on the ice fields of Hoth, I'll be
I'll be missing you like oxygen (xygen)
Whoah whoah whoah
I'll be missing you like oxygen1Embed
