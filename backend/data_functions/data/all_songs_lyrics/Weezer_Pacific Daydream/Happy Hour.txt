Happy Hour Lyrics
I'm like Stevie Ray Vaughan on the stage, high on music
Teeth grindin', sweatin' under the lights, but then my
Boss comes, and she's crushin' me with a 20-ton weight
Just like in Monty Python

Somebody left on the sink, it's still running
My eyes are gonna overflow

I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

I'm like Ponce de Leon, sailing on a ship for the new world
Checking out the birds and flowers, let's chill out on this
Island, I've been sucking on a lime and
Coconut (coconut), coconut (coconut)

I think I could stay here for the rest of my life
Please, don't ever make me go home

I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
It's my happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)
Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about feather birds and MIDI keyboards
Then we'll slow dance, head on my shoulder
Swaying back and forth and
My friends look on and smile
Everything gonna be alright

I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)
I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about feather birds and MIDI keyboards
Then we'll slow dance
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)2Embed
