Mexican Fender Lyrics
Met her at a guitar shop on
Santa Monica and 7th Street
The salesman tried to get my attention
To sell me a Mexican Fender
She came to get her 10,000 steps and
Hang out with her boyfriend
But I was only trying to get to know her
So I took her out to the ocean

It was hot, hot, 100 degrees
But she only went in up to her knees
She didn't want to take off her jeans
'Cause that would be insane

My summer love, oo-we-oo
My summer love, oo-we-oo
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not

She got a bachelor's degree in physics
And a job in computer programming
That's pretty cool for a singer in a band
So I knew we would end up jamming
Later that night we went to her gig
And she asked for some advice
"What do you do with your hands when you're singing
Do you just hold onto the mic?"
It was hot, hot, 100 degrees 
And the trash overflowed out on the street
The heartbreak DJ stepped to me
But I just couldn't get enough

Of my summer love, oo-we-oo
My summer love, oo-we-oo
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not

Gonna fly so high
To a place that we have never seen
Ever since you came 'round
In a greasy tee and faded jeans, woah
I got a cozy pad around the corner
Slide a little closer

My summer love, oo-we-oo
My summer love, oo-we-oo
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not3Embed
