La Mancha Screwjob Lyrics
I've been alone, so many times before
Time's a-wastin', time's a-wastin'
Singing songs behind a bolted door
Time's a-wastin', time's a-wastin'
And now the clock keeps ticking on
It's like my own private time bomb
But then you came along
And now we're famous

You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night
We've come so far, we shine so bright
Hanging out on a summer night
We're getting stronger, stronger, going faster, faster
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh; whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night, yeah

I screwed it up so many times before
I'm like a hoodlum, like a hoodlum
But when you're near I wanna stop the war
And be a porch bum, be a porch bum
I guess I want to apologize
As I looked you in the eyes
We'll break through to the other side
And that's a promise
You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night
We've come so far, we shine so bright
Hanging out on a summer night
We're getting stronger, stronger, going faster, faster
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh; whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night, yeah

I love life with you, with you
I love life with you, with you
I'm an early riser since the day I met you
And I love life with you, with you, with

You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night
We've come so far, we shine so bright
Hanging out on a summer night
We're getting stronger, stronger, going faster, faster
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh; whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night, yeahEmbed
