Sweet Mary Lyrics
When I am all on my own, one foot is in the grave
My sweet Mary comes to help me to find my way
So I give her my thanks, I don't know what I would do
Without out my sweet Mary love to help me to make it through

Ghost come out at nighttime, I hear the rumble of thunder
Flashes of light to follow her, wherever she goes so pretty
But I will never ever touch her, 'cause if I did she might die
I just smile and look on as she leads me to the wondrous sights

When I am all on my own, one foot is in the grave
My sweet Mary comes to help me to find my way
So I give her my thanks, I don't know what I would do
Without out my sweet Mary love to help me to make it through

What did I do to deserve this, give my life to a tiger
Give my last food and water to a strange wayfarer
I'm so blessed in this life, I wanna show my gratitude
She is so beautiful when she flies, I wanna see her fly high away

Who is she? I wanna know
Who is she? (My heart is stolen) I wanna know (My heart is stolen)
Who is she? (My heart is stolen) I wanna know (My heart is stolen)
Who is she? (My heart is stolen) I wanna know (My heart is stolen)
When I am all on my own, one foot is in the grave
My sweet Mary comes to help me to find my way
So I give her my thanks, I don't know what I would do
Without out my sweet Mary love to help me to make it throughEmbed
