Best Night Lyrics
I've been wandering by your room
And nothing's coming out
You're like a spirit through the wind I keep fighting
In a dream, you point a knife
In another dream, you die
It's just a dream that we had once
That went down in the night

I believe that I've been cursed
Been drowned and reimbursed
Got the feeling I can't move without sliding
I'm a thousand miles behind
With a million more to climb
So it's you I hope survives without fighting

Been a soldier from the start
Been released and torn apart
Been inside the only storm that's been raging
It's a dream to hold a knife
In another dream, you'll die
It's just a dream, you won't get lost
Just get down in the nightEmbed
