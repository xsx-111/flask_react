Your Love Is Calling My Name Lyrics
Yeah, there's a ring on mine
Looking for a fire
I'm gonna read your minds
It's gonna be alright
Yeah

I ride the freeway down by the harbor
I catch a strong wind through my mind
I drew a light on the wall

For the tallest tier
If there's a line, cross it off
For the ragged rails
If there's a weight on you
Then it's on me, too
We're like a slave, babe
For our love, babe

I ride the freeway down by the harbor
I catch a strong wind through my mind
Just keep it running, I'll take it over

We're just a feeling down by the harbor, babe
I'll catch a strong wind through my mind
Just keep it rolling, I'll take it over
I'll push it over this time
I ride the freeway down by the harbor, babe
And there's a strong wind through my mind
Just keep it running, I'll push it over
Let's take it over this time


I got the feeling down at the harbor
Just like a strong wind through our days
Just keep it rolling, I'll take it over
Let's push it over this wayEmbed
