Baby Missiles Lyrics
I'm on the back of a new belief
And on the back of a new belief
My friend rides all alone
Yeah, he's up and down like a new Jack Tone
He was alive in the new machine
He felt alive in the new machine
My friend dies all alone
Yeah, just up and down like a new Jack Tone

Yeah, you want to talk about going down
Get on the ground, would make a young man proud
You should have seen all the rattling in my brain
And in the wake of a north-east bus
I came on my back, like a north-east crutch
You should have seen all the rattling in my way
Ooh, just the sound of a north-east bus coming back here
'Cause I don't mind when the pioneers go soft on me
It's just the sound of a north-east bus on its back, babe
You got your head in the common field
Adjust your hands with the common touch

Woohoo, yeah
I was alive in the new machine
He felt alive in the new machine
My friend rides all alone
Yeah, he's up and down like a new Jack Tone
He wanna leave, but he don't know how
He wanna try, but he don't know why
He's going to lean on the back of me
Like a slide on the back of my b-belief

Woohoo

Ooh, just the sound of a north-east bus, walking back here
'Cause I don't mind when the pioneers go soft on me
Itâ€™s just the sound of a north-east bus on its back, babe
You got your head in the common feel
Adjust your hands with the common touch

Woohoo, yeahEmbed
