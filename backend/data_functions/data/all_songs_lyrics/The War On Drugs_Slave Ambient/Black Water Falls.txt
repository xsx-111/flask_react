Black Water Falls Lyrics
Now's the time, unpack your case
And push your gold in the safest place
So scared, you sweat and run for the hills
While I lay back and cherish my chance to grip
My will

There is a train we take downtown
That buckles and bends from the weight of the ground
You'll slowly lose faith in gravity
And give up the urge to sway and charm and love
And breathe

I hear you dish it out, dish it out, dish it out
I hear you dish it out, dish it out
Well, you want to remain
My friend
No, it's not
It's not quite the same

Remember me when you dissolve in the rain
When the rivers run dry through the cold mountain range
Then you'll turn to the name you invented to keep
Your identity safe from the smell of defeat
And there is no way
To carve your righteous paths of rage
By holding the candle to those half your age
Your jaw will be locked from hornets and bees
And you'll understand why I leave so suddenly
With the breeze
Woohoo
