I Was There Lyrics
Come on, baby, hold me close
Let me do my best to both
Let me ride, let it roll
And I was there to catch a man
I thought I had him by the hand
I only had him by the glove

Come on, baby, let me in
You can show yourself to him
You can show me through the doors
And I was there, catching air
Thought I had him by the hand
I only had him by the glove
We was there in the road
Picking diamonds from a tree
Heard a wolf coming through
Coming through and coming hard
Tried to leave the heated car
Tried to lean against the wall

I'll be there, coming clean
Like a runner in the wind
Coming through the morning light
Rising in, in the stone
Tried to leave the heat at home
Running through the morning dim
And I was there to catch a man
I thought I had him by the hand
I only had him by the glove
Come on, baby, let me close
Let me do my best to both
Run through, but cut close
Come on, baby, let me in
You can show yourself to him
Ride the road, ride it rough
Yeah, in the day, I was gone
Tried to leave the heat at home
Run through and run the road
And I was there, coming clean
Like a runner in the wind
Coming through the morning light
And you'll be there on the floor
Picking diamonds from a stone
Looking through the totem poleEmbed
