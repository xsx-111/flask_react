Science and Industry LyricsPrison lights
Pressed against me light
Felt it, dark on skin
My heaven is in motion
Who enlightened you?
When the lights turn, it follows you
(My lights follow)
Who never knew the darkness will soon envelop?
(The darkness seems so full of color)
Who enlightened you?
Who enlightened you?
Who never knew?
Maybe make my escape, goodbye
Heehhehee...
I'm like the guard
Learn all
His eye's got who's waitingEmbed
