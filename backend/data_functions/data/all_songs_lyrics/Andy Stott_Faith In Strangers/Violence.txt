Violence LyricsNumbing this truth and I'm not my hands
You shake your different suits, I watch and meet
Yellow glass, he went taut over here
Inside, inside
Who is stalking? Who is crouching?
Your glassy words gloss over him
Inside, Inside
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Can see far and he's smart
Who is alone in my mind?
Just among the messy
Numbing this truth and I'm not my hands
You shake your different suits, I watch and meet
Yellow glass, he went taut over here
Inside, inside
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Can see far and he's smart
Who is alone in my mind?
Just among the messy
Who is stalking? Who is crouching?
Your glassy words gloss over him
Inside, Inside
Wonder what we're chasing silently?
What are we all chasing silently?
Wonder who's chasing silently?
(I'm not home)
(Someone's watching me...)Embed
