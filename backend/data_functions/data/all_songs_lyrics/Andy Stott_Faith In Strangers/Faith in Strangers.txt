Faith in Strangers LyricsHe wakes up in the morning
Lights bursting on his eyes
Wide open on the pillow
A face he doesn't recognize
Somebody's had enough
Somebody's had enough
In the street is something plaid
Flesh, bone, another lives
He swallows as a child to be caught in control of his lips
Celebrity pages in the paper
Full of them, hard to read
They're the look you love
Sippin' on the ice with shades
Having fun in notoriety
He wakes up in the morning
Lights bursting on his eyes
Mouth wide open in the mirror
A face he doesn't recognize
Bring him back to bed
He has no shirt, no tie
Don't fight the folks around
There's a jerk, it's a knot
Can't seem to smile
Somebody's had enough
Somebody's had enough2Embed
