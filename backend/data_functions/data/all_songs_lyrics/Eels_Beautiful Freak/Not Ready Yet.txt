Not Ready Yet Lyrics
There's a world outside
And I know 'cause I've heard talk
In my sweetest dream
I would go out for a walk

But I don't think I'm ready yet
I'm not feeling up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how

There's some happiness
And my stone face cracks again
Maybe sometime sooner or later

But I don't think I'm ready yet
I'm not feeling up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how

So if I leave my room
Don't you tell me to lighten up
Maybe sometime sooner or later
But I don't think I'm ready yet
I'm not feeling up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how

I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me howEmbed
