Spunky LyricsSpunky don't like her uniform
It never fit so good
Goin' back to the orphanage
And the place where her garage once stood
Well it's a free for all, free for all, free for all
It's a free for all, you and me
And if you don't like what they're telling you
You can't teach a blind man to see
Well I can see
Spunky looks good in her bright red wig
Eating chocolate-chip mint ice cream
A cat named Lola with a violent past
Is balled up asleep 'cross her knees
And it's a free for all, free for all, free for all
It's a free for all, you and me
One day the world will be ready for you
And wonder how they didn't see
Spunky knows she can save the world
In her own little way
Turning in her old uniform
'Cause you know, it really didn't pay
'Cause it's a free for all, free for all, free for all
It's a free for all, you and me
I walk through the world with your name on my tongue
And your picture etched on my screenEmbed
