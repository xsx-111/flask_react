Beautiful Freak Lyrics
You're such a beautiful freak
I wish there were more just like you
You're not like all of the others

And that is why I love you
Beautiful freak, beautiful freak
That is why I love you
Beautiful freak, beautiful freak

Some people think you have a problem
But that problem lies only with them
Just cause you are not like the others

But that is why I love you
Beautiful freak, beautiful freak
Yeah that is why I love you
Beautiful freak, beautiful freak

Too good for this world
But I hope you will stay
And I'll be here to see that you don't fade away
You're such a beautiful freak
I bet you are flying inside
Dart down and then go for cover

And know that I, I love you
Beautiful freak, beautiful freak
You know that I, I love you
Beautiful freak, beautiful freak

Beautiful freak, beautiful freak
Beautiful freak, beautiful freakEmbed
