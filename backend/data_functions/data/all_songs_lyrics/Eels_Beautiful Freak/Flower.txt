Flower Lyrics
Turn the ugly light off, God
Wanna feel the night
Every day it shines down on me
Don't you think that I see
Don't you think that I see
What it's all about?

Hard to look the other way
While the world passes me by
And everyone is trying to bum me out

It's a pretty big world, God
And I am awful small
Every day they rain down on me
Flower in a hailstorm
Flower in a hailstorm
I'm livin' for the drought

I could throw it back at them
But then I'd play their game
Everyone is trying to bum me out
When I came into this world they slapped me
And every day since then I'm slapped again
Tomorrow's king, an unsightly coward
You see, I know I'm gonna win

Turn the ugly light off, God
Don't wanna see my face
Every day it will betray me
Don't you think that I know
Don't you think that I know
What they're talking about?

If they step on me tonight
They're gonna pay someday
Everyone is trying to bum me out

Mmm
