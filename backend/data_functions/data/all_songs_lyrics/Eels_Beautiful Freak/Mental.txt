Mental LyricsIt's like I'm dressed up in my mama's clothing
It's like I'm talking to a voice that doesn't exist
It's like I got a wire crossed upstairs
But all I want is just a little truth and that's it
They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
Thay say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all
Another anchorman is on the TV
He's got that far away and vacant look in his eyes
I turn the channel but nothing is changing
The only truth is that everything is a lie
They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
Thay say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all
There's truth in everything, there's truth in lies
With all this knowledge, well I think I'm gonna be wise
They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
Thay say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all
