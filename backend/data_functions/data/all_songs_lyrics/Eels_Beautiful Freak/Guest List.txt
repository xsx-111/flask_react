Guest List LyricsAre you one of the beautiful people?
Is my name on the list?
Wanna be of the beautiful people
Wanna feel like I'm missed
Hey you, with the walkie-talkie
I know my clothes are not right
I wish I had my own walkie-talkie
That reached to God every night
Everyone needs to be somebody
Everyone needs to find someone who cares
But I don't know if you know what I mean 'cause I'm
Never on your list
Are you one of the beautiful people?
Am I on the wrong track?
Sometimes it feels like I'm made of egg shell
And it feels like I'm gonna crack
Everyone needs to be somebody
Everyone needs to find someone who cares
But I don't know if you know what I mean 'cause I'm
Never on your list
I'm never on your list
I'm never on your list2Embed
