Your Lucky Day in Hell LyricsMama gripped onto the milkman's hand
And then she finally gave birth
Years go by, still I don't know
Who shall inherit this earth
And no one will know my name until it's on a stone
Woah
This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell
Waking up with an ugly face
Winston Churchill in drag
Looking for new maternal embrace
Another tired old gag
Am I just a walking bag of chewed up dust and bones?
Woah
This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell
Father Theresa, you can't make me into you
I never wanna be like you
Why can't you see, it's me
You know it's time to let me go
This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell, in hell
This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell in hell
This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell
In hell, in hellEmbed
