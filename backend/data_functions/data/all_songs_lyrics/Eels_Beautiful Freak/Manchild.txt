Manchild Lyrics"I'm not having any fun
I'm not having any fun
Friday, five sixteen P.M."
And every time you crave for me, I'm here
And anything you hunger for, I'll share
And I will be quietly standing by
While slowly I am dying inside
Hold me in your arms
And let me be the one
Who can feel like I am a child
In love
Everytime I talk to you, you're down ("I'm not happy")
And every time you need a laugh, I'm around ("I wanna be happy... but I'm not happy")
("Alright scumbag") And when you forget I'm here, I'm not
It isn't really me that you forgot
Hold me in your arms
And let me be the one
Who can feel like I am a child
In love
Whisper now
And tell me how
You watch me and tell me
Somehow I'm gonna be alright
"I'm over this
I'm over this."Embed
