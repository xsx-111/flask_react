Rags to Rags LyricsThere's a spider crawling on the bathroom mirror
Right on top of my right eye
And I can't stop staring back, how did I get this way?
Take a big look at a living lie
Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to riches was a bust
Sometimes I dream about it what it's like back home
The railroad tracks and the pussy willow
But I had to leave it and I go back
Whenever my tired head hits the pillow
Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed
So rags to riches was a bust
Busted once again
But I'll show them one day
That I can buy and sell the world
And one day I'll come through
My American dream
But it won't mean a fuckin' thing
Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to rags and rust to rust
Don't let me go
Rags to rags and rust to rust
Don't let me go
Rags to rags and rust to rust
Don't let me goEmbed
