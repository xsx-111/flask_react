Elvis Ate America Lyrics
Elvis, white trash
Elvis, the Memphis flash
Elvis didn't smoke hash
Would have been a sissy without Johnny Cash
Elvis didn't dodge the draft
Elvis had his own aircraft
Elvis, havin' a laugh
On the Lisa Marie in a color photograph
Elvis, under the hood
Elvis, Cadillac blood
Elvis, Darling bud
Flowered and return to the Mississippi Mud
Elvis ain't gonna rot
Elvis in a Memphis plot
Elvis didn't hear the shot
Dr. King died just across the lot from
Elvis, vanilla ice cream
Elvis, girls of 14
Elvis, Memphis spleen
Shooting TVs reading Corinthians 13
Elvis, with God on his knees
Elvis on three TVs
Elvis, here come the killer bees
Head full o' honey, chiki chi-ka-boo
Elvis, the bumper stickers
Elvis, the white knickers
Elvis, the white nigga
Ate a cheeseburger and just kept getting bigger
Elvis sang to win
Elvis, the battle hymn
Elvis, the battle to be slim
Elvis ate America before America ate him

Elvis stamps
Elvis, necromance
Elvis fans
Elvis sychophants
Elvis the public enemy
Elvis don't mean shit to Chuck D

Elvis changed the center of gravity
Made it slippy
Elvis, Hitler
Elvis, Nixon
Elvis, Christ
Elvis, Mishima
Elvis, Marcus
Elvis, Jackson
Elvis the pelvis
Elvis the Psalmist
Elvis the genius
Elvis the generous
Elvis, Forgive us
Elvis, Pray for us
Elvis Aaron
Elvis Presley
