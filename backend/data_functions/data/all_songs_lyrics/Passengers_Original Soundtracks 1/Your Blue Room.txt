Your Blue Room Lyrics
It's time to go again
To your blue room
Got some questions to ask of you
In your blue room
The air is clean, your skin is clear
I've had enough of hanging round here
It's a different kind of conversation
Your blue room

Saw me coming, in and outside
Saw me coming, somewhere to hide

And time is a string of pearls
(Your blue room, once again)
See the future just hanging there
(Your blue room)
A new frame, a new perspective
Looking down on my objectives
Your instructions, whatever their directions
Your blue room
Saw me coming, east by the moon
Saw me coming, can you feel

It's alright
(Your blue room)
One day I'll be back
(Your blue room)
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at
(Your blue room)

We see me slide down
Won't you give me a home
So much for change

Zooming in, zooming out
Nothing I can't do without
A lens to it all up close
To magnify what no one knows
Never in company
Never alone
No car alarm
No cellular phoneEmbed
