(You Drive Me) Crazy Lyrics
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night

You drive me crazy (You drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, crazy (You make me feel alright)
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up (Oh) all night

You drive me crazy (You drive me crazy, baby)
Yeah
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night5Embed
