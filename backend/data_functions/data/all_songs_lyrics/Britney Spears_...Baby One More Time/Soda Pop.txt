Soda Pop Lyrics
Ooh, ooh
Ah, here we go now
Oh

Like the great poet Homer, Agamemnon, or even Zeus
We takin' a vibical expedition, this pop ditty we choose
So be calm, don’t ring the alarm, you see
‘Cause we go on and on
Come-come-come follow me, Britney (Yeah)

Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop (Can't stop now)
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop, shu-bop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop

We're monster riding to the music tonight
A clever way to get by, oh
The pop-speak flowing like it’s fire and ice
So give it a little bly, so

Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop (Mm-hmm)
The clock is ticking and we can't stop (Now)
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop, shu-bop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop
Ooh, ooh
We have a plan, we have a definite plan
To level the vibes (Vibes)
To level vibes again (Ooh-yeah)
See, way overdue for a superlative slam (Oh, yeah)
A wicked time to the end, oh yeah, so

Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop (Ooh)
The clock is ticking and we can't stop (Can't stop)
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop
Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop (Ooh)
The clock is ticking and we can't stop (Can't stop)
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop

So much time, we losing sitting, watching the clock (Watching the clock)
Turn the temp up, baby, let's go over top (Take it to the top now)
No one else will do, I’m waiting for you

So show me what you got, just take a pop shot
And we will never stop, shi-bop-shi-bop
Yeah, the clock is ticking and we can’t stop now
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop (I can’t stop)
Jooks we neatly like we’ve never before (Before-before-before)
Dubbin' it ‘til we drop (We drop, we drop)
We’ll flex tonight until they break down the door (Oh yeah)
The party will never stop, so (So)

Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop (Stop, no)
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop
Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop (No, no)
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop, no
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop

I bet we can party like we never party before
And we keep comin' back for more and more for sure (Sure)
Just bubble Britney when we get on the floor, yeah
And we go on and on until the break of dawn

Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop, no
Open a soda pop, bop, shu-bop shu-bop (Oh yeah)
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop
All we gotta is just
Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop (Oh yeah)
The clock is tickin' and we can’t stop3Embed
