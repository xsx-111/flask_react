I Will Still Love You Lyrics
Time may take us apart, but I will still love you, I promise
Oh, whoa, oh, yeah
And when the stars, stars are falling, I'll keep calling

I promise that you'll be my one my only everything
I'll never be untrue
And I promise back that for your love, I will do anything
I will give you the stars, I will buy you the moon
And even through longest of our nights
And even through the darkest days our
Love will find a way

And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting
I will still love you

You are my summer breeze, my winter sun, my springtime soul, my autumn touch of gold, yeah
You are my sky, my rain, a way which my love flows 'cause you're all
The smile of my heart and the breath of my soul
Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold out hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts
And when the stars are falling (stars are falling), I'll keep calling (I'll keep calling)
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading (dreams are fading), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I will still love you

Tell me how you feel
I finally know how to feel, tell me if it's real
And my heart tells me it's real
So real, so real

And when the stars are falling (stars are falling), I'll keep calling (I'll keep calling)
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting
I will still love you (I will still love you, baby)

Time will take us apart that's true
But I will always be there for you
You're in my heart and you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles between
I promise you that I won't forget
The day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars may too
But I will still, I will still love you
And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I will still love you (I'll still be loving you)
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I will still love youEmbed
