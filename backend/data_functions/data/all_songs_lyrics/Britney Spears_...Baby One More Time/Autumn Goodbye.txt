Autumn Goodbye Lyrics
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye

Thinking of you and the love of our lives
In the sweet summertime
So sad, but true (So true, so true)
We must leave it behind
In our hearts, in our minds

From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we share
Don't forget; I remember

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Memories can fade (they can fade)
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face (on your face)
And maybe someday we can be more than friends
Love will find us again
Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared
On the time that we borrowed

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we share
Don't forget; I remember, baby

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye
We'll leave behind the summertime
Our hearts, our minds
They will remind
We won't forget
The day we met
The day we cried
Autumn goodbye

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbyeEmbed
