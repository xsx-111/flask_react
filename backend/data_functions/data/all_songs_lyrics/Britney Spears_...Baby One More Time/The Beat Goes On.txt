The Beat Goes On Lyrics
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da

Wait 'til you have reached the age, blah blah
History has turned the page, blah blah
We still wanna hear a brand new thing, uh huh
We still need a song to sing, uh huh

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-da
Love is the first and last thing on our minds
From tomorrow 'til the end of time

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes
And the beat goes
And the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-da
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-da
The world keeps turning faster everyday (Everyday)
We still wanna dance the night away

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes onEmbed
