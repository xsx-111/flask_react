Born to Make You Happy Lyrics
Oh, my love
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

I'm sittin' here alone up in my room
And thinkin' 'bout the times that we've been through
Oh, my love
I'm lookin' at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong

If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on
Oh, my love
'Cause livin' in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't wanna cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do (Ooh)

If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
I'd do anything
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
(Just call out my name) Just call out my name
(And I will be there) And I will be there (Ooh)
Just to show you how much I care
Alright (Ooh)
I was born to make you happy (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, oh (Ooh)
Oh, yeah

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

(Oh, oh) I was born to make you happy
(Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah)
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy4Embed
