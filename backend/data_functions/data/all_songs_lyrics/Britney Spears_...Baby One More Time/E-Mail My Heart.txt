E-Mail My Heart Lyrics
Forever

It's been hours, seems like days, since you went away
And all I do is check the screen to see if you're okay
You don't answer when I phone, guess you wanna be left alone
So I'm sending you my heart, my soul, and this is what I'll say

I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance to make it all up to you?

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die
And that I know you're out there and I know that you still care
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever, E-mail my heart

Whoa, I-I can see you in my mind, coming on the line
And opening this letter that I've sent a hundred times
Here's a picture of us two, I look so good on you
And can't you please forgive me for the hurt I put you through

I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance to make it all up to you?
E-mail my heart and say our love will never die
And that I know you're out there and I know that you still care
(Know that you still care)
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever, E-mail my heart

I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance to make it all up to? (You)

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die
And that I know you're out there and I know that you still care (I know that you still care)
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever (Won't you say, won't you say?)
Forever, forever (Won't you say, won't you say?)
