Deep in My Heart Lyrics
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh yeah

Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way?
What have I done? I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change

'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, no
After this love was found
It seems like we can't go wrong

Deep in my heart, I know there's only you
And right from the start, I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love you so
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh, oh yeah

Some people search what seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this, oh yeah
And here we are, with everything we wished for
I've never felt such bliss, oh no
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along
After this love was found
It seems like we can't go wrong

Deep in my heart, I know there's only you
And right from the start, I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love you so
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh yeah, oh, oh

There comes a chance in everyoneâ€™s life
And I believe it won't happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I wanna spend forever (And ever with you)

Deep in my heart, I know there's only you (Only you)
And right from the start, I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love you so (I love you so)
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh
Deep in my heart, I know there's only you (Only you, only you)
And right from the start, I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love you so
Oh, oh, I want you
Deep in my heart
(Deep in my heart)
Oh oh, no
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh
I want you for the rest of my life (I want your love forever)
I want you for the rest of my lifeEmbed
