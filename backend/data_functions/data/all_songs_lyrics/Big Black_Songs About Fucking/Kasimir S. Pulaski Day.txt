Kasimir S. Pulaski Day LyricsSaw something go wrong today
When a long black car went by
Grey car blew up today
When a long black car went by
Never thought it really happened that way
Never thought it really happened that way
Never thought it really happened that way
Through a route, and they blew him away
Down on the south side
Out on Pulaski
There were pieces of a man
All over the skyway
Well I suffered real bad today
Just like in the movies
What's the score getting evened like that?
I even felt a little sick
I never thought it really happened that way
I never thought it really happened that way
I wouldn't want to check out in that way
Through a route, and they blew him away
There were pieces of a man
All over the skyway
There were pieces of a man
Caught right in the ashtray
What are you trying to prove now, Benny?
What are you trying to call me, Benny?
Better stay out of it, Benny
Stay off Pulaski!Embed
