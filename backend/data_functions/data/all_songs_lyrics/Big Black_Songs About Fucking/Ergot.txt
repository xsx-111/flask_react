Ergot LyricsOut!
No!
Crazy thoughts in my head
Must've had some wheat bread
Crazy thoughts in my head
Must've had some wheat bread
Do you see that?
I will run!

Must've had some wheat bread
Must've had some bad bread
What do you see now?
I will run!
Don't eat that!
It makes you want to 
Can't you feel the cold hand ?
I see 
I can hear the sound of it
I fell in the roach bed
Bad breadEmbed
