Pavement Saw Lyrics
She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about it
She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about it

She smokes herself to death and it makes me sick
But she's so pretty that I don't give a shit
She likes to suffer, she has nothing to do
Can't hate the chick 'cause she's got no sense

She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about it
She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about itEmbed
