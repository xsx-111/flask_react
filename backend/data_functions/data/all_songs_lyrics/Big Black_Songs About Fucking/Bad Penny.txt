Bad Penny LyricsOught to know what a liar I am, ought to know me by now
Don't curse me for my nature, don't bless me for my wrongs
Just a bad penny, I always come back to you
Just a bad penny
Just a bad penny, I always come back to you
Should have known you couldn't trust me far as you can throw me, throw me
Couldn't throw me too far
Just a bad penny, couldn't throw me too far
I think I fucked your girlfriend once...
Maybe twice, I don't remember
Then I fucked all your friends' girlfriends
Now they hate you
Just a bad penny, just a bad penny
Just a bad penny, just a bad penny
Such a bad penny, such a bad penny
Bad, bad penny, bad, bad penny
Ought to know what a liar I am, ought to know me by now
Such a bad penny
Ooh bad, bad penny, bad, bad penny
Ought to know what a liar I am, ought to know me by now
Ought to have known you couldn't trust me as far as you can throw me, throw me
Such a bad penny, such a bad penny
Such a bad penny, such a bad penny
Slap my handEmbed
