Fish Fry LyricsHosing out the cab of his pickup truck
He's got his 8-track playing really fucking loud
The one who wouldn't go down on his brother's dead
She's wearing his bootprint on her forehead
Saw her at the picture show out on the highway
After the fish fry, late last Friday
Having a fish fry, number one fish fry
Having a fish fry, keep it in the family
Having a fish fry, number one fish fry
The fish fry out by Frenchtown
They say they saw you out there at Frenchtown
They say they saw you out by Frenchtown
Now I fuck you and I hit you with my shoe
And I hide your bloody body in Frenchtown pond
Sometimes you know you want to fuck somebody up
Sometimes you just want to fuckEmbed
