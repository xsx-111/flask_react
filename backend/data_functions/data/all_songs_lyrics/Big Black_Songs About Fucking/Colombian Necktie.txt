Colombian Necktie LyricsWhen I get loaded, I gotta go off!
Don't call it a safety
Don't call it half-cocked
More like an ashcan, more like a time bomb, more like a stovepipe
Colombian necktie
I don't want to die, I just wanted to give her the works
Don't call it a safety
Don't call it a ripcord
More like an ashcan, more like a time bomb, more like a stovepipe
Colombian necktie
I don't want to die, I just wanted to give her the works
When I get loaded, gotta go off!
Don't call it a safety
Don't call it half-cocked
More like an ashcan, more like time bomb, more like a stovepipe
Colombian necktie
I don't want to die, I just wanted to give her the worksEmbed
