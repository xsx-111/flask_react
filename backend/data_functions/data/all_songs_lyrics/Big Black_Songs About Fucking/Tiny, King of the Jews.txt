Tiny, King of the Jews LyricsI started out drinking
It stays that way
Was not at all human
And I killed another day
On the wall there's another earth
At my neck there's another knife
Another wrinkle in my skin
Another kick that I can't feel
I started out hating myself and when I'm through
I've gotta have something to hate, and I guess it's you
Man's gotta have something to hate, guess I'll do
And when I'm through with myself, I'll start on you
Everything I do makes me want to die
I started out drinking, I wonder why
I started out drinking, it stays that way
Was not at all human
And I killed another day
On the wall there's another earth
At my neck there's another knife
Another wrinkle in my skin
Another trip that I can't make
Man's gotta hate someone, and I guess I'll do
And when I'm through with myself, I'll start on you
I started out hating myself, now that I'm through
I'm looking for someone to hate, guess you'll doEmbed
