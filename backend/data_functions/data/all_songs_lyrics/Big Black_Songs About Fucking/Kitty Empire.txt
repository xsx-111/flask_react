Kitty Empire LyricsThe Emperor makes his rounds, Master of all Cats
Fat in the Midwest, Emperor rolls his little balls -- Catland
Says hi to his pal Walter, for all that smoking in the backyard
The neighbors do not understand, he's an aberration
Even makes a funny noise
He plays great hunter with a ball-point pen
When the cat's away, ah, it's a regular rat day
When the rat's away, ah, King Cat, King Cat can play
I jump around with my wang in the wind
It flops around, you admired it
I am your neighbor now
You can't stop me now
In exchange, I will even run again
If not, then all I want is something else
You will ask them for me
In exchange, I'll piss on everything you value
I am the Emperor of Cats
I do what I want now, cats
I do what I want now, cats
I shit outside if I want to
All a part of my, ow, kitty empireEmbed
