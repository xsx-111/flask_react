Precious Thing LyricsI would like to wrap your hair around your neck like a noose
I would like to wrap your legs around my neck like a lock
You are my precious thing, thing of speed and beauty
You are my precious thing, as long as you remain beneath me
I will hold you down, I will hold you down, I will pin you down
I will hold you down, I will hold you down, I will pound down on you
You are my precious thing, you are my precious thing, you are my precious thing
I will hold you down, I will hold you down, I will pin you down
I will hold you down, I will hold you down, I will pin you down
I will hold you down, I will hold you down, I will pound down on you
You are my precious thing, thing of speed and beauty, you are my precious thing
You are my precious thing, thing of speed and beauty
You are my precious thing, as long as you remain beneath me1Embed
