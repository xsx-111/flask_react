Shadowplay  Lyrics
To the center of the city where all roads meet waiting for you
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank searching for you
I was moving through the silence without motion waiting for you
In a room with a window in the corner, I found truth

In the shadowplay, acting out your own death knowing no more
As the assassins all grouped in four lines dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odor on their bodies made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left

I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let thеm use you for their own ends
To thе center of the city in the night, waiting for you
To the center of the city in the night, waiting for youEmbed
