Something Must Break Lyrics
Two ways to choose
On a razor's edge
Remain behind
Go straight ahead
Room full of people
Room for just one
If I can't break out now
The time just won't come

Two ways to choose
Which way to go?
Decide for me
Please let me know
Looked in the mirror
Saw I was wrong
If I could get back to
Where I belong, where I belong

Two ways to choose
Which way to go?
Had thoughts for one
Designs for both
But we were immortal
We were not there
Washed up on the beaches
Struggling for air
I see your face still in my window
Torments yet calms, won't set me free

Something must break now
This life isn't mine
Something must break now
Wait for the time when something must break2Embed
