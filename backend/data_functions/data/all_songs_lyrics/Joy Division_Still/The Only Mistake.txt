The Only Mistake Lyrics
Made the fatal mistake
Like I did once before
Tendency just to take
Till the purpose turned sour

Strain, take the strain
These days we love
Strain, take the strain
These days we love

Yeah, the only mistake
Was that you ran away
Avenues lined with trees
Strangled words for the day

Yeah, the only mistake
Like I made once before
Yeah, the only mistake
Could have made it before

Strain, take the strain
These days we love
Strain, take the strain
These days we love
And the only mistake
Led to rumors unfound
Led to pressures unknown
Different feelings and sounds

Yeah, the only mistake
Like I made once before
Yeah, the only mistake
Could have made it before4Embed
