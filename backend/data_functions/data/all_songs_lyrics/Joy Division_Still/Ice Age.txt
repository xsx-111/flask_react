Ice Age Lyrics
I've seen the real atrocities
Buried in the sand
Stockpiled safety for a few
While we stand holding hands

I'm living in the Ice Age
I'm living in the Ice Age
Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
Into the cold, it's not an eclipse
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age

Searching for another way
Hide behind the door
We'll live in holes and disused shafts
Hopes for little more

I'm living in the Ice Age
I'm living in the Ice Age
Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
Into the cold, no smile on your lips
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age4Embed
