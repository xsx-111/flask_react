Ceremony  Lyrics
This is why it’s so unnerving
Then again the same old story
This is why the wheels are turning
Turn away and turn again this time
This is not the same old story
Not again, but we will be here
Travel fast and now I’m stopping
Turn again and turn towards this time

I’ll break them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it’s got to get closer
Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time

I’ll break them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it’s got to get closer
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, watching forever
Everything, let it be so
For everything, let it be so
Everything, let it be so7Embed
