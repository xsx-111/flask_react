Walked in Line Lyrics
All dressed in uniforms so fine
They drank and killed to pass the time
Wearing the shame of all their crimes
With measured steps, they walked in line

They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line

They carried pictures of their wives
And numbered tags to prove their lives
And made it through the whole machine
With dirty hearts and hands washed clean

They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line

Full of glory never seen
They made it through the whole machine
To never question any more
Hypnotic trance, they never saw
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line

They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line

Walked in line
Walked in lineEmbed
