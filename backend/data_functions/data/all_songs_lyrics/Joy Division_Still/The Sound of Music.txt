The Sound of Music Lyrics
See my true reflection cut off my own connections
I can see life getting harder
So sad is this sensation, reverse the situation
I can't see it getting better

I'll walk you through the heartbreak, show you all the outtakes
I can't see it getting higher
Systematically degraded, emotionally a scapegoat
I can't see it getting better

Perverse and unrealistic, try to make it all stick
I can't see it getting better
Hollow now, I'm burned out, all I need to break out
I can't see life getting higher

Love, life, makes you feel higher
Love and life, makes you feel higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Love of life, makes you feel higher3Embed
