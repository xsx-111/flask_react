Exercise One Lyrics
When you're looking at life in a strange new room
Maybe drowning soon, is this the start of it all?
Turn on your TV, turn down your pulse
Turn away from it all, it's all getting too much

When you're looking at life, deciphering scars
Just who fooled who? Sit still in their cars
The lights look bright when you reach outside
Time for one last ride before the end of it all1Embed
