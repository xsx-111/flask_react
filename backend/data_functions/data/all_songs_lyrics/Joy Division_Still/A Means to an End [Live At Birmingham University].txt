A Means to an End  Lyrics
A legacy so far removed
One day will be improved
Eternal rights we left behind
We were the better kind
Two the same, set free too

I always looked to you
I always looked to you
I always looked to you

We fought for good, stood side by side
Our friendship never died
On stranger waves, the lows and highs
Our vision touched the sky
Immoralists with points to soon

I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you

A house somewhere on foreign soil
Where aging lovers call
Is this your goal, your final needs
Whеre dogs and vultures eat
Committеd still, I turn to go
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you

In you, in you, in you
Put my trust in you, in you
YouEmbed
