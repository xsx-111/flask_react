Sister Ray  LyricsJimmy came from Carolina
Wants to know a way to earn a dollar
Says he's suffering with a fever
Just like Sister Ray says
Oh, I'm searching for my mainline
Oh, I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, I'm searching for my mainline
Oh, I couldn't hit it sideways
Jimmy's got a new piece
Lying cold for a quarter hour
Took it out of his suitcase
Shot him dead right on the floor
Hey, man, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet
Hey, man, you shouldn't do that
Just like Sister Ray says
Too busy sucking on a ding-dong
Hey, don't you know you'll stain the carpet?
Too busy sucking on my ding-dong
Hey, you know you shouldn't do that
Oh, I'm searching for my mainline
Oh, I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, I'm searching for my mainline
Going to count one, two, three, four
Jimmy came from Carolina
Wants to know a way to earn a dollar
Says he didn't like the weather
It was just like Sister Ray said
Hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim-Jim
Hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim-Jim
Hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim, hit on it Jim-Jim
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Jimmy's got a new piece
Cold hearted for the fingering
Took it out in front of him
Shot him dead right on the floor
Hey, man, you shouldn't do that
Hey, don't you know you'll stain the carpet?
Hey, man, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet?
It's just like Sister Ray said
Just like Sister Ray said
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Had a good night, good night, good night, good night, good night
Had a good night
Good night
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Had a good night, a good night
Had a good night, had a good night, had a good night, had a good night
Just like Sister Ray said
Just like Sister Ray saidEmbed
