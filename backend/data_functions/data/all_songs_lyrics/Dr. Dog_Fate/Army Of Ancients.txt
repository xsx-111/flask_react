Army Of Ancients LyricsAn army of ancients could rise from the ground
And tear every nation apart
And I'd still be sitting there counting my cards
Wondering when will it start?
The oceans and forests could collide into one
And muddy this world in a spark
And I'd still be sitting there twiddling my thumbs
Wondering when will it start?
How did the fox get the raven to crow?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Why at the creek, did the dog lose the bone?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
The man could come back on his fiery throne
To measure the feathers and hearts
And I'd still be whistling Dixie alone
Wondering when will it start?
I don't want to wake up
I don't want to move
I'll skip the sermon and stick to the booze
I'm sorry
Well I'll take what I want in the dawns early light
How did the fox get the raven to crow? (Oh yeah x3)
Why did the hen pick grains in the snow? (Oh yeah x3)
Why did the brother bury his gold? (Oh yeah x3)
The man took the rats but the kids came along(Oh yeah x3)
Why did the mouse help the beast with his thorn?(Oh yeah x3)
Does this town know how to make soup without stones?Embed
