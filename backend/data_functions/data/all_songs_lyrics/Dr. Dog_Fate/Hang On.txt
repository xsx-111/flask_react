Hang On Lyrics
Hang on, hang on
Because it's the little things
Yes, it's the little things
That do us harm
I'm not a stranger
Ain't a mystery
When we both get it wrong
Stay here for a little while more
Because it's a funny thing
Yes, it's a funny thing
I need a friend, not an angel
What do you do when the drowning stops?

And what you though was a hurricane
Was just the rustling of the wind
Why you think we need amazing grace
Just to tell it like it is?
Well, I don't need no doctor
To tear me all apart
I just need you
To mend my heart

Hang on, I'm trying to look you in the eye
You know you should have apologized
Or should I apologize?
Is there an answer?
What do you do when the drowning stops?
Oh, what you thought was a hurricane
Was just the rustling of the wind
Why you think we need amazing grace
Just to tell it like it is?
Oh, I don't need no doctor
To tear me all apart
I just need you
To mend my heart
I need you to mend my heartEmbed
