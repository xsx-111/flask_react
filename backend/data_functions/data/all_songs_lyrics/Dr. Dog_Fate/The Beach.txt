The Beach Lyrics
There's a hole in the roof, and the rain's coming down
The roads are all flooded, there's no way back to town
And this ship we came in on, has just run aground
You know fate has a funny way of coming around
The memories we've buried, have now taken seed
When spring time comes they'll turn into weeds
And they'll creep through your window to smother your dreams
You know fate has a funny way of coming around

Oh they'll carve our names like scripture
To the souls of their feet
Every footprint that they take
It will tell of our deed

Drowning lies, oh they're following me
Till the flow tide comes, to swallow
The beach
This bottle of bourbon's now dry as a bone
It drank us all up and then it left us alone
Well we sense whats to come, but we can't choke it down
You know fate has a funny way of coming aroundEmbed
