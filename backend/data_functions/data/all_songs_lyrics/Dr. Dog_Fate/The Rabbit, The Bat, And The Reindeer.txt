The Rabbit, The Bat, And The Reindeer Lyrics
Well I don't want a thing to do with your kind
And I ain't got no time to kill on your dime
Strung up, hanging 'round
Looking like you're upside down
Well, I ain't one to shed no blood, that's your crime
And I ain't one to sling no mud, I clean it up
You ain't what I call a friend
I wouldn't even if I could pretend
Man, you ain't like anybody else
As night becomes the sun to rise
As dirt becomes the butterfly
As sure as though it always seems to stay the same
And I'll be waiting anxiously
And I'll be falling fast asleep
And I'll be dreaming of the day the dream died, ohh
No sticks, no stones could break my bones like you can
If I knew hate, I'd call it love for you, man
High up on the hill, cheaper than a dollar bill
Man, you ain't like anybody else
Should we pretend that it's the end?
Are you my curse or are you my friend?
And if we got hitched to the end of the road
Will you be there to carry my load?
I'm getting it back with that terrible feeling
My vision is cracked, but it looks like it's healing
I'm getting it back like it's four in the morning
When the sun only shines cause it's been given a warning
I'm getting it back with the rest of the leap year
I'm keeping the rabbit, the bat, and the reindeer
I'm getting it out, whatever I've gotta keep in
I'm telling the truth that I don't when we pretend
Should we pretend?
Should we pretend?
Should we pretend?1Embed
