The Ark Lyrics
God, he called for rain
So I built a ark, but no rain came
I was ashamed
Man, he called for war
So I built a gun and I joined the corps
But I was unsure
Love, she asked for more
But what I gave only made her poor
I wasn't sure
The dove, she promised land
As she laid the branch right into my hand
There was no land

Ooh, what does it mean to be here?
Well, I know because I can and I will
Yes, I know because I can and I will

Oh, what does it mean to be here?
Well, I know because I can and I will
