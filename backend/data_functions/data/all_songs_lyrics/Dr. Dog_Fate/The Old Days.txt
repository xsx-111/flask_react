The Old Days Lyrics
Let go of the old ones
We've got some new ones
Hold on to the good stuff
And let go and get real tough

Down, down, down
Moon gonna fall down
Thump, thump, thump
House gonna fall down
Chop, chop, chop
Tree gonna fall down
Down, down, down
Down to the bottom

Trigger, when you pull it
Go home with a bullet
No birds in the birdcage
Flew off in his old age

Down, down, down
Moon going to fall down
Thump, thump, thump
House going to fall down
Chop, chop, chop
Tree going to fall down
Back, back, back
Back to the old days
The old days
So full in the morning
Put on your dog skin
Wrap up the money
Save it for a sunny

Day, day, day
Moon going to fall down
Thump, thump, thump
House going to fall down
Chop, chop, chop
Tree going to fall down
Back, back, back
Back to the old daysEmbed
