My Friend Lyrics

My friend says that the end holds nothing more
He don't hide his shame
Says it's all the same
Like a man without a name

Old days asleep in the shade by the Brandywine
See a road get paved
See a boy behave
Every bone deserves a grave

But I heard the Good Lord's warning
Like a nightmare
Forgot by the morning
With no more terrifying thoughts of dying
Oh, oh-ohhhh

My Lord, I'm climbing aboard and I'm going home
No time to lose
No time to pack
Take a step and take it back
But I heard the Good Lord's warning
Like a nightmare
Forgot by the morning
With no more terrifying thoughts of dying
Oh, oh-ohhh



Keep on with the living you'll soon enough be dead
You got the whole world spinning in your head
And you don't want to give it up (don't give it up, don't give it up)

'Cause no one should be sorry
We're just another day
You can say your goodbyes
But you won't ever go away (don't go away, don't go away, don't go away)
'Cause love that never leaves is never ever welcome back
And I'm running out of skin thick enough to hide in (don't go away, don't go away)
Now hand in hand we're back in time
We're chasing the train
Looking back, looking back to wave goodbye
We're headed for the same disaster (don't give it up, don't give it up)
But I heard the Good Lord's warning
(Don't give it up, don't give it up, don't give it up)
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da...
You know fate has a funny way of coming around
(Don't give it up, don't give it up, don't give it up)
