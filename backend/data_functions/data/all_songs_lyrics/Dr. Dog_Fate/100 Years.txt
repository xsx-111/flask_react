100 Years Lyrics
When I look back on what I done
About 100 years from now
Going to cry myself to sleep at night
Somebody shows me how
When the sun shines down whats left of me
About 100 years from now
Going to cut my water with a Rebel Yell
And claw my way back to town

100 years
100 years

They'll break me
But I'll break them too
Oh and this years for the brakemen
And this one is for you

When sky cracks open and the thunder comes
About 100 years from now
Going to bury this old yoke and chain
In the cold wet ground
And when I get off at Tennebrook Farm
About 100 years from now
I'm going to marry you out of common sense
And get out from behind this plow
