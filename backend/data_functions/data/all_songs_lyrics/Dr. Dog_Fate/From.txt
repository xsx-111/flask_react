From Lyrics
Oh, oh, my love
Don't you leave me
'Cause I don't wanna learn how to die
Oh, oh, my love
And oh, my my
You know I can't get over
'Cause I can't even seem to get by
Oh, oh, my my
And oh, my land
(Oh, my land)
Now it ain't beneath me
(Ain't beneath me)
'Cause I got my head in the sand
Oh, oh, my land
And you know my eyes
(Know my eyes)
No, they deceive me
(They deceive me)
Seeing but I can't understand
Oh, oh, my eyes

It's like a choo-choo train rollin' away
Another choo-choo rain wash it away
When we're apart
Take a choo-choo train rollin' away
Another choo-choo rain wash it away
When we're apart
'Cause you're a part of my heart
When I'm apart from my heart, my heart
Oh, oh, my God
(Oh, my God)
He listens to me
(Listens to me)
And I ain't even talking out loud
Oh, oh, my God
And He says my son
(Says my son)
Now, listen to me
(Listen to me)
And listen while the listening's good
You're not my son
But you know my love
(Oh, my love)
No, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy)
But it ain't the type to give up and die
That's not my love


From, from, from, from
From, from, from
From, from, from
From, from, from, from
From, from, from
(My heart)
From, from, from1Embed
