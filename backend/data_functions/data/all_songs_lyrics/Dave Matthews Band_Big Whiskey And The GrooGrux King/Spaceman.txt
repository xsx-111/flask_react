Spaceman Lyrics
Probably get it wrong much as I get it right
But I got it right woman when I caught your eye
What I remember most about that night is
I love the way you move, baby

I like most liquor, but I don't like gin
I don't always like the skin I'm in
But when I get it wrong, I gotta start again
Still, I love the way you love me, baby
And I love the way you move
I love the way you move

All the freaks are on parade
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have the good life?
But it don't always work out
So cry, cry baby if we must
But just remember
Oh remember
I love the way you love me baby
And I love the way you move

I'm not all bad, but I'm a faithful sinner
I might get lost, but I'll be home for dinner
If God don't like me he can send me to hell
But I love the way you love me girl
I love the way you move
I prayed to heaven to keep my place
But I looked in the mirror, saw the devil's face
I'd be a dog for a tail to chase
But I love the way you kiss me, baby
And I love the way you talk, baby
You move, I love the way you move

All the freaks are on parade
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have the good life?
But it don't always work out
So cry, cry baby if we must
But just remember
Oh, remember
I love the way you move, baby
I love the way you love me baby

Bad days come when the good day's gone
Working as hard as the day is long
And a working man works, when I get home
I love the way you talk, baby
I love the way you talk, baby
All the freaks are on parade
Wanna fill our belly, so we gotta get paid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have the good life?
But it don't always work out
Cry, cry baby
If we must but
Oh, remember
Oh, remember

All the people are on parade
Thought I saw a spaceman trying to get laid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have the good life?
But it don't always work out
Cry, cry baby
If we must
But
Oh, remember
Just remember
I love the way you love me baby
And I love the way you moveEmbed
