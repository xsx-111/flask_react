Dive In Lyrics
I saw a man on the side of the road
With a sign that read
"Will work for food"
I tried to look busy 'til the light turned green

I saw a bear on TV
And his friends were all drowning
Cause their homes were turning to water
A strange kinda sad, big old bear
Surely would happily eat me
He'd tear me to pieces, that bear
Wake up sleepy head I think the sun's a little brighter today
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the water rising
Summer's here to stay and all those summer games will last forever
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty ocean

Tell me everything will be okay
If I just stay on my knees and keep praying
Believing in something
Tell me everything is all taken care of
By those qualified to take care of it all
Wake up sleepy head I think the sun's a little brighter today
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the waters rising
Summer's here to stay and that sweet summer breeze will blow forever
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty ocean

One day do you think we'll wake up
In a world on its way to getting better?
And if so
Can you tell me how?

I have been thinking that lately the blood is increasing
The tourniquet's not keeping hold in spite of our twisting
Though we would like to believe that we are, we are not in control
Though we would love to believe

Wake up sleepy head I think the sun's a little brighter today
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the waters rising
Summer's here to stay and all those summer girls will dance forever
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty oceanEmbed
