Shake Me Like A Monkey Lyrics
Ooh Ha!
The thing I like about you
Is the way you
The way that you do
The thing I like about you
God or the devil alone
Could not have made you up
The two must have worked as one, together
So good, just want to eat you up
Nothing like the real thing
Lick your sticky fingers, boy
And sing for your dinner sing

Come on, pretty baby
Make me lose my mind
Everybody get together
Going to make love shine

Do you know what it is
To feel the light of love inside you
And all the darkness falls away?
If you feel the way I feel
Then I believe we have the answer
I've been searching for tonight
Love me baby, love me baby
Shake me like a monkey, baby
Forever I'm yours, yours, yours
Yeah, forever I am
I, I, I
Can't stop thinking about you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Why would I want to
I like my coffee with toast and jelly
But I'd rather be licking you from your back to your belly
I, I, I
Think that I'm going to


Cigarettes and coffee
Broken hearts and being lonely
Little girls and ponies
The things that go together
Yes and no ,you have to choose
Romeo and Juliet
The hangman and his noose
You and me, we go good together
Kiss, kiss make a wish
Hope that it comes true
But I ain't waiting for the world to change
Going change the world for you
Come on pretty baby
Make you lose your mind
Everybody get together
Going to make love shine


Forever I am, baby
Forever I am
