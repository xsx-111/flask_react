Why I Am Lyrics
I grew from monkey into man
Then I crushed fifteen million with a wave of my hand
I grew drunk on water turned into wine
'Til I was slave and master at the same damn time

It's why I am
It's why I am
Why I am
Still here dancing with the GrooGrux King

Out of my head and
Into the room
Hello

A king of men, it makes no sense
When I bow to the priest
While I worship the witch

But it's why I am
Always the one to make you smile
Why I am
I'm still a snake in the woodpile
It's why I am
Still here dancing with the GrooGrux King
Out of my head and into the room
So when my ghost takes me from you
You can remember the fool that I am
Don't cry, baby, don't cry

It's the lose and the win of the world
Wrong and right, us and them of the world
It's the you and the me of the world
But only one way out of the world
It's the lose and the win of the world
Wrong and right, us and them of the world
It's the you and the me of the world
Only one way out of the world


We'll be drinking big whiskey while we dance and sing
And when my story ends it's gonna end with him
Heaven or hell I'm going there with the GrooGrux King
