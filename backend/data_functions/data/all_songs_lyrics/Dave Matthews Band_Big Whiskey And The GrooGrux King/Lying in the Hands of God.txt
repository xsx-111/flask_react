Lying in the Hands of God Lyrics
Baby I'll be your solider
Gladly I'll do your bidding
For just a taste of what you're holding
For just a taste you could own me

Save your sermons
For someone that's afraid to love
I'll be right here
Lying in the hands of god

Here it comes diving into to me
Now the floor is the ceiling
If you never flew why would you
Cut the wings off a butterfly?
Fly

Save your sermons
For someone that's afraid to love
If you knew what I feel
Then you couldn't be so sure
I'll be right here
Lying in the hands of god
If you feel the angels in your head
Teardrop of joy runs down your face
You will rise
Fill me up, now drain me
Skin begins to grow back slowly
Faster until I'm choking
I really should call my mother


I am in love with my nothing less
Tear drops of joy run off my face
I will rise


Now the floor is the ceiling
If you never flew, why would you?
Why would you?Embed
