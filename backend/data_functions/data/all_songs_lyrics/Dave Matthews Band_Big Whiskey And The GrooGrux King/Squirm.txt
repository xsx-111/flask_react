Squirm Lyrics
Please find your place
Though room grows scarce
One we're all inside
The service can begin
For a moment, if you please
Forget what you believe
And naked you will see
That we are all the same
The power of your kiss
The words on your lips
Your flesh, your bones
Exactly what you need
Your flesh, your bones
Exactly what you need

Drum beats louder

Why should I feel intrusion?
Why be afraid of what we do not understand?
To eliminate exclusion
Cut out the differences
To feel like we belong

Open up your head
Open up, you primitive
Open up your mouth
Open up your head
Scream sweet primitive
Open up your mouth
It's coming out

Out there no food, no drink
How many days do you think
You'd last with all your
Diamonds and your pearls?
I'm not a king, no
Not a hero
Not a fool
I'm not perfect
I'm flesh and bones
And I'm exactly what you need


The power of your kiss
Your words, your lips
Not a gun to your head
You're gonna die before you're dead
Not sad when you're gone
But when your light's still on
And your wings won't let you fly
Don't be dead before you die
Hunger 'til fed
Give love instead
And when it gets inside
Watch the dead man squirm
Above all things
If kindness is your king
Then heaven will be yours
Before you meet your end
