Time Bomb Lyrics
If I'm a ticking time bomb
Waiting to blow my top
No one would ever know
Not until I blew up
No one would believe it
He was such a normal man
Shake their heads and wonder why
If martians fell from the sky
What would that do to God?
Would we put the weapon down
Or aim it up at the sky?
No one would believe it
Except the fucking nut jobs
They'd laugh and cry, "We told you so!"

Baby when I get home
I want to believe in Jesus
Hammer in the final nail
Help me pick up the pieces

When everything starts to fall
So fast that it terrifies you
When will you hit the wall?
Are you gonna learn to fly?
No one would believe it
Except for all the people
Watching as you fly away
