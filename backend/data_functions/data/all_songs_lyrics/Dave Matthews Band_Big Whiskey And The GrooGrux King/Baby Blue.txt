Baby Blue Lyrics
Confess your kiss
Still knocks me off my legs
First time I saw you
Was like a punch right through my chest
I will forever cause you'll forever be
My one true broken heart
Pieces inside of me
And you forever my baby

You will rest your head
Your strength wants saving
And when you wake
You will fly away
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels
Goodbye my love into your blue blue eyes
In your blue blue world
You're my baby blue

Confess I'm not quite ready to be left
Still I know I did my level best
You give, you give
To this I can attest
You made me, you made me
You and me forever baby

You and me forever1Embed
