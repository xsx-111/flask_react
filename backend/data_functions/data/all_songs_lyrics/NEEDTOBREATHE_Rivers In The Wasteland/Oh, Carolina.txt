Oh, Carolina Lyrics
Oh, Carolina
When I get back home to you, we're gonna start a fire
Oh, you know I miss ya
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give ya

I been all mixed up, been gathering dust
Down and down for days thinking 'bout us
I know we both can't deny it
There was a wrinkle in time way back when
We were living fast and I won't back in
Truth is baby I've been surviving
'Cause I'm on my way

Oh, Carolina
When I get back home to you, we're gonna start a fire
Oh, you know I miss ya
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give ya

I got a foot to the floor, it's almost light
Quarter past an hour and a matter of time
Body's been gone for miles, heart's still driving
'Cause I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm on my way
Oh, Carolina
When I get back home to you, we're gonna start a fire
Oh, you know I miss ya
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give ya

Oh, Carolina
When I get back home to you, we're gonna start a fire
Oh, you know I miss ya
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give ya

Yeah, when I get back home to you
When I get back home to you
When I get back home to you
We're gonna start a fireEmbed
