Where The Money Is Lyrics
We started out we were welcome in
We had enough when we needed it
Grip all you saw in a sea of shame
Run down your dream and then lose your place
I'm falling back up and feeling good
You opportunity struck just like you thought it would

Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
It's just a tragedy trying to take its toll again
Don't want to know where the money is

These days are easy they come to life
These colors brighten they all are mine
I want to move in a lovers march
My only grief is when we spend these days apart

Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
It's just a tragedy trying to take its toll again
Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
It's just a tragedy trying to take its toll again
Don't want to know where the money is
Bury your ropes and let the wise man's daughter
Carry us down to where the walls don't speak
Bury my worries in the deep black water
Bury them down and take the weight off me
Bury your ropes and let the wise man's daughter
Carry us down to where the walls don't speak
Bury my worries in the deep black water
Bury them down and take the weight off me

Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
It's just a tragedy trying to take its toll again
Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
It's just a tragedy trying to take its toll again
Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
Don't want to know where the money is
It's just a tragedy trying to take its toll again
Don't want to know where the money isEmbed
