Multiplied Lyrics
Your love is like radiant diamonds
Bursting inside us, we cannot contain
Your love will surely come find us
Like blazing wild fires singing Your name

God of mercy, sweet Love of mine
I have surrendered to Your design
May this offering stretch across the skies
And these hallelujahs be multiplied

Your love is like radiant diamonds
Bursting inside us, we cannot contain
Your love will surely come find us
Like blazing wild fires singing Your name

God of mercy, sweet Love of mine
I have surrendered to Your design
And may this offering stretch across the skies
And these hallelujahs be multiplied

Multiplied (multiplied, multiplied)
Oh, multiplied
God of mercy, sweet Love of mine
I have surrendered to Your design
May this offering stretch across the skies
And these hallelujahs be multiplied
These hallelujahs be multiplied

Your love is like radiant diamonds
Bursting inside us, we cannot contain
Your love will surely come find us
Like blazing wild fires singing Your name13Embed
