More Heart, Less Attack Lyrics
Be the light in the crack
Be the one that’s mending the camel’s back
Slow to anger, quick to laugh
Be more heart and less attack

Be the wheels, not the track
Be the wanderer that’s coming back
Leave the past right where it’s at
Be more heart and less attack


The more you take the less you have
'Cause it's you in the mirror staring back
Quick to let go, slow to react
Be more heart and less attack

Ever growing, steadfast
And if need, be the one that’s in the gap
Be the never turning back
Twice the heart any man could have

Be the wheels, not the track
Be the wanderer that’s coming back
Leave the past right where it’s at
Be more heart and less attack
Be more heart and less attack
Be more heart and less attack


I stuck my hat out, I caught the rain drops
I drank the water, I felt my veins block
I'm nearly sanctified, I'm nearly broken
I'm down the river, I'm near the open
I stuck my hat out, I caught the rain drops
I drank the water, I felt my veins block
I'm near the sanctified, I'm near broken
I'm down the river, I'm near the open

I'm down the river to where I'm going10Embed
