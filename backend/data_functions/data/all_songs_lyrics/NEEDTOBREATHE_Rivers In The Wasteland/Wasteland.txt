Wasteland Lyrics
I'm the first one in line to die when the cavalry comes
Yeah, it feels like the great divide has already come
Yeah, I'm wasting my way through days
Losing youth along the way

Oh, if God is on my side
Oh, if God is on my side
Oh, if God is on my side
Who can be against me?

There was a greatness I felt for awhile but somehow it changed
Some kind of blindness I used to protect me fom all of my stains
Yeah, I wish this was vertigo
It just feels like I'm falling slow

Oh, if God is on my side
Then who can be against me?

Yeah, in this wasteland where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And it's all that I need to get by
Yeah, in this wasteland where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And it's all that I need to shine
All of these people I meet, it seems like they're fine
Yeah, in some ways I hope that they're not and their hearts are like mine
Yeah, it's wrong when it seems like work
To belong all I feel is hurt

Oh, if God is on my side
Yeah, if God is on my side
Oh, if God is on my side
Then who can be against me?

Yeah, in this wasteland where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And it's all that I need to get by
Yeah, in this wasteland where I'm livin'
There is a crack in the door filled with light
And it's all that I need to shine

Oh, if God is on my side
Yeah, if God is on my side
Oh, if God is on my side
Then who can be against me?3Embed
