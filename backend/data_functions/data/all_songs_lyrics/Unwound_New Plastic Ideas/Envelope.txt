Envelope LyricsShe won't miss you if you let her
She won't miss you if you let her
She won't miss you if you let her
She won't miss you if you let her
I'm not scared to stay alone inside a sealed envelope
Envelope, envelope, envelope
I don't know why I live inside a goddamn envelope
Envelope, envelope, envelope
She won't miss you if you let her
She won't miss you if you let her
She won't miss you if you let her
She won't miss you if you let her
I'm not scared to stay alone inside a sealed envelope
Envelope, envelope, envelope
I don't know why I live inside a goddamn envelope
Envelope, envelope, envelope
I'll shed no tears for the wasted year
I spend waiting here
Don't know what I'll do
When you leave and don't see you for a yearEmbed
