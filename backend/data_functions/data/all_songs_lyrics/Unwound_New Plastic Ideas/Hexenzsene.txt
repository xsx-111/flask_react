Hexenzsene LyricsHex on you, what a shame
Curses too, what should you do?
Ex on you, next in line...
Shames on you all of the time
And now you're alien
Spell it out for yourself
Paranoid insane
Find another name
Some bridges burn, it's not cruel
Stakes are high, low octane fuel
Take a dive, come back again
Want some advice? Do not offend
Hex on you! What a shame!
Curses too, what should you do?
Ex on you, next in line
Shames on you, all of the time
When I notice I don't show it
Don't blame them
Hex on you4Embed
