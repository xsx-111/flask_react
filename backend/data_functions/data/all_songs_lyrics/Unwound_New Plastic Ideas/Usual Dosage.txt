Usual Dosage LyricsWhite sugar always talk it up
White sugar always chalk it up
White sugar always joke around
White sugar just boast your luck
Wouldn't say it's evil but I wouldn't try it either
I wouldn't save it for later but I wouldn't buy it either
It's how you pay for it, how will you pay for it
How to bring it home and how to take it
So usual, so usual, so usual, so usual
And now you fucked it up
Your life - a pretty misery
Bank it around unlucky secrets
Vacant statues, you're not okayEmbed
