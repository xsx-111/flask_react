All Souls Day LyricsSay it first I won't pretend to know
What to do about death and dying more than you
Graves don't talk and souls don't speak in tongues
And the dead sea sank with all the ancient ones
Don't cross your fingers if you're afraid
Cause nobody sings on all souls day
I won't pray
I close my eyes in your company
Too sick to pray for the young in me
Don't want to die so soon
Don't really think I will
Won't dwell on it, for the present do I kill
Don't cross your fingers if you're afraid
Nobody sings on all souls day
I won't pray3Embed
