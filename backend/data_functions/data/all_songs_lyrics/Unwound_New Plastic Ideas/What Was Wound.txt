What Was Wound LyricsDamaged ones made to fit a frame
I already know we're not the same
And you say there's nothing to it
There's no harm but you don't want to do it
And you say there's nothing to it
It's ok but you don't want to do it
Salt of the earth on an open wound
Salt of the earth on an open wound
Cutting in won't seem right
Tear your skin and invite it in
And you say there's nothing to it
There's no harm but you don't want to do it
And you say there's nothing to it
It's ok but you don't want to do it
Salt of the earth on an open wound
Salt of the earth on an open wound
Injury you can't explain
Injure me inflict no pain
And you say why'd I do it
And you say you put me to it
Don't you know you put me to it
Don't know you I said I'd do it
Salt of the earth on an open wound
Salt of the earth on an open wound1Embed
