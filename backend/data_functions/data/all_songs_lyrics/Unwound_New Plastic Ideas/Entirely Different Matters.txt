Entirely Different Matters LyricsYes, I'm certain that a curtain
Needs some pulling, 'cause it's hurting
It makes me think
I'm uncertain that you're her friends
And don't even try to pretend
You're all alone
Doesn't really matter
Doesn't really matter
So you're hating and conspiring
And I'm trying to defend her
You never said
Why you hate her, and you make her
Have intentions to make life worse
It never works
What's the matter
Oh, it doesn't matter
It doesn't really matter
Several different matters
Entirely different matters
Entirely different matters
Entirely different matters
