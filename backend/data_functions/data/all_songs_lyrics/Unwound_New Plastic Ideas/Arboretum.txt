Arboretum LyricsI'm alone and now I'm sorry
I'm at home and now it's scary
And it seems like something's coming soon
Day comes around and I won't wake up
Dismiss the sounds of ill-defined make up
It counts as loud but it just leaves me cold
I was thinking disillusioned
And you were sinking into memory
All I do is create an illusion
All I need is a little intrusion
Form a sound with an idea
Hope to drown before I see you
Cause I was drinking my conclusion
And I was finding my necessity2Embed
