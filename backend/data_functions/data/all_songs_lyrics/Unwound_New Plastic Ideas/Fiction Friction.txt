Fiction Friction LyricsIt's a shattered day all around
It's a shattered day in our town
Seems wrong
It's a saturnday all the time
It's a saturnday once again
Nice time
It's another day down the drain
It's another day just the same
So what
It's a stupid day on this day
It's a stupid day everyday
Good bye
You'd make great fiction, you make great friction
You'd make great fiction, you make great friction
So it's history, you can count me out
It's not apathy, it's incomplete
You'd make great fiction, you make great friction
You'd make great fiction, you make great friction
Flying in the mainstream, second third time not a dream
And a crown don't mean a thing, when it's made of pain
You'd make great fiction, you make great friction
You'd make great fiction, you make great friction
I'm not the king of pain, put it down the drain
Shame it's not obvious, I'm not a prodigy1Embed
