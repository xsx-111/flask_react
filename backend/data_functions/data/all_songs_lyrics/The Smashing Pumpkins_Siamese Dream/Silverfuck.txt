Silverfuck Lyrics
I hear your winter
And I hear your rain
And I've failed your summer ways
And I feel no pain

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way


I hear you fade away
And I hear you crawl
And I gave my life away
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel your pain

And she was my lover, so sweet
And she was my angel
And what I've recovered of me
I put into a box underneath my bed
When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
Lie
Lie

Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you're dead, hole in your head

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way

(Alright, this take, don't give a fuck)2Embed
