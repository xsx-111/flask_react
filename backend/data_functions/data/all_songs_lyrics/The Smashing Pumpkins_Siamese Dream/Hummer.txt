Hummer LyricsFaith lies in
The ways of sin
I chased the charmed
But I don't want them anymore (Yeah, yeah)
And in their eyes, I was alive
A fool's disguise
Take me away from you
Shame my tongue
Fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep
I was happier than Iâ€™d ever been
When you decide
That your life is a prize
Renew and revive
It's alright, honey
It's alright, yeah
Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel okay?
It scares the disenchanted
Far away

Yeah, I want something new
But what am I supposed to do about you?
Yeah, I love you, it's true
Life's a bummer
When you're a hummer
Life's a drag, yeah, yeah
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free
Do you feel
Love is real?
