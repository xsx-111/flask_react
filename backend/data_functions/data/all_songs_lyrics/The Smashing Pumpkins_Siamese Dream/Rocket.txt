Rocket Lyrics
Low (Low, low)

Bleed in your own light
Dream of your own life
I miss me
I miss everything I’ll never be

And on and on
I torch my soul to show
The world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart
No more lies

A crown of thorns
An image formed, behold
The mark I’ve borne
A mark of scorn to you

Consume my love, devour my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out, the stars invite
I think I’ll leave tonight
Soon, I’ll find myself alone
To relax and fade away
Do you know what’s coming down?
Do you know I couldn’t stay free?

I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free, free
Free of those voices inside me


I shall be free
I shall be free5Embed
