Sweet Sweet Lyrics
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet little agony
I don't know just where you've been
But I'll take, take, take
All that you have for me, in sin
Where are we going?

And they all want you to change
And they all want you to change

And the sad, sad, sad
All the sad faces drown, in this town
Where are we going?

And they all want you to change
(Where are we going?)
And they all want you to change
(Where are we going?)2Embed
