Summersong Lyrics
Ramblin'
Where to begin?
I taste the summer on your peppery skin
Been saved
The warm of the waves
I felt a slip into a watery grave

Oh-oh
Oh, hoh, hoh
Lah-di-dah-di-dah
Ah, hah-hoh-oho

My girl
Linen and curls
Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
She's grand
The bend of her hand
Digging deep into the sweep of the sand

Oh-oh
Oh, hoh, hoh
Lah-di-dah-di-dah
Ah, hah-hoh-oho
And summer arrives
With a length of lights
And summer blows away
And quietly, it gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave

Waylay
The din of the day
Boats bobbing in the blue of the bay
In deep
Far beneath
All the dead sailors slowly slipping to sleep

Oh-oh
Oh, hoh, hoh
Lah-di-dah-di-dah
Ah, hah-hoh-oho

My girl
Linen and curls
Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
She's grand
The bend of her hand
Digging deep into the sweep of the sand
Oh-oh
Oh, hoh, hoh
Lah-di-dah-di-dah
Ah, hah-hoh-oho

And summer arrives
With a length of lights
And summer blows away
And quietly, it gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave

It gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave...5Embed
