The Perfect Crime #2 LyricsSing, muse, of the passion of the pistol
Sing, muse, of the warning by the whistle
On a night so dark in the waning
A dawn obscured by slate sky raining
Five and twenty burglars by the reservoir
A teenage lookout on the signal tower
The mogul's daughter in hogtie
The mogul fingers the wrong guy, all lies
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect , the perfect, perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime
It was a perfect crime
The bagman's quaking at the fingers
The hand-off glance a little lingers
A well-dressed man in the crosshairs
A shot rings out from somewhere upstairs
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime
It was the perfect crime
It was like a ticker-tape parade
When the plastique on the safe was blown away
And we all gazed from eye to eye
As we mouthed our silent goodbyes
The valley's sleeping like a bastard
It stinks of slumber and disaster
Two words are spoken on the tap wire
The agent's ploy finds a surefire backfire
It was a perfect, perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime3Embed
