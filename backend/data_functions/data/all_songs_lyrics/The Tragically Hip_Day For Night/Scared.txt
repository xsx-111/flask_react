Scared Lyrics
I could make you scared, if you want me to
I'm not prepared, but if I have to
He said, "I can make you scared, it's kind of what I do
If you're prepared, here's what I propose to do"

You're in Russia and a more than a million works of art
Are whisked out to the woods
And when the Nazis find the whole place dark
They'll think god's left the museum for good

I can make you scared, if that's what I do
If you're prepared, and if I have to
If I make you scared, and you pay me to
That's the deal, now here's what I can do for you

Now there's a focus group that can prove
This is all nothing but cold calculation

Tests have shown that suspicious or hostile
Their lives need not be shortened
Truth be told, they can live a long, long while
Tickled to death by their importance
If you can make me scared, if that's what you do
If I'm unclear, can I get out of this thing with me and you?
And if you feel scared, and a bit confused
I got to say, this sounds a little beyond anything I'm used to

Now there's a precious few that can prove at the root
This is all nothing but cold calculation

Clearly entranced, you're heading back now
Defanged destroyer limps into the bay
Down at the beach it's attracting quite a crowd
As kids wade through the blood out to it to play

Okay, you made me scared, you did what you set out to do
I'm not prepared, you really had me going there for a minute or two
He said, you made me scared too, I wasn't sure I was getting through
I got to go, it's been a pleasure doing business with youEmbed
