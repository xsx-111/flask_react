Daredevil LyricsI can't imagine how you feel, and this is how you feel
You say your name like you're no longer convinced
But now they're strapping you in, and closing the lid
And they're dropping you in, what's done you did
The bell's picking up speed, there's water leaking in
That old equilibrium just starts to spin and spin
Do you like to be judged or liked?
Do you like it inside a barrel
And plunging over the falls?
Curious and grim
We wrestle at the rim
We wonder all about him
And the point of it all
I'll be short and brief and to the point
The fighting has resumed
In that tone of voice
The plague is exhumed
He said, "What I'm going through
Is essentially all true
Made no less amazing by the fact that it's see through"
Do you like to be judged or liked?
Do you like it inside a barrel
And plunging over the falls?
Strong and green and dim
It wrestled him like nothing
Out, out, out and in-
To the thrill of them all
And the real wonder of the world
Is that we don't jump too
And the real wonder of the world
Is that we don't jump too
And the real wonder of the world
Is that we don't jump tooEmbed
