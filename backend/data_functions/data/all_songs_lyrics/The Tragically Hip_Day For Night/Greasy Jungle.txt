Greasy Jungle LyricsGreasy jungle, metropolis noir
Easy tangles the easiest so far
I drove down your road
To Hazeldean where I tasted
Your funeral home's
Sandwiches and coffee
I saw your hands melt
Into one another
I saw you grieve and grow
Care a lot about one another
I stood at your sink
And I felt your warm water
I washed your dishes
And I looked out your kitchen window
Where I saw a soulful
Gymnast melt in the air and shudder
Just above the snow
Making moves that just weren't there
Velvet callow
With wet hands I turned out the lights
And breathing shallow
Hesitated then went upstairs
Where I picked up your housecoat
Dried my hands and touched your hair
And just then you awoke
You could never really barely care
