Thugs LyricsEveryone's got their breaking point
With me it's spiders, with you it's me
Thugs in perpituity
When we're excited little birds around the feeder
The cat's indifferent or he's just furious, it seems that he's never neither
I do the rolling, you do the detail
I do the rolling, you do the detail
Hairbird plucks a hair from a sleeping dog to build her nest
She says I've looked around and I like your hair the best
I do the rolling, you do the detail
I do the rolling, you do the detail
Ruby, honey, are you mad at your man?
Ruby, honey, are you mad at your man?
Honey, are you mad at your man?
I do the rolling, you do the detail
I do the rolling, you do the detail
I do the rolling, you do the detailEmbed
