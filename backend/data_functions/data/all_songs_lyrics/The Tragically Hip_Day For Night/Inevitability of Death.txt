Inevitability of Death LyricsPuffy lips, glistening skin
And everything comes rushing in
We don't go to hell the memories of us do
I get a sense of connectedness
Exclusive, tight but nothing dangerous
We don't go to hell the memories of us do
And if you go to hell I'll still remember you
But I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the inevitability of death to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the inevitability of death to death just a little bit
Terry's gift is forever green
It got me up and back on the scene
We don't go to hell just our memories do
Fantastic gap, common space
Open concept in your smiling face
We don't go to hell the memories of us do
And if you go to hell I'll still remember you
But I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the inevitability of death to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit
I thought you beat the inevitability of death to death just a little bitEmbed
