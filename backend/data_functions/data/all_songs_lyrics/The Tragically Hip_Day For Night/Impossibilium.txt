Impossibilium LyricsI love you even when
I don't even know I'm doing it
Dismiss it out of hand
Cause I don't even know I'm doing it
But your finger starts to wiggle
And landscapes emerge
Can you spare some change, dear
We've only got three hundred feet to go
Roses are worth more dried than alive
Such a you thing to say
How I adore you when you reinvent
The rosy clich√©
Can you spare some change, dear
We've only got three hundred feet to go
And with impossibilium for a payload
We lift the rocket
Out of the pocket
Nothing can stop it
Roses are difficult everywhere
You must promise me you'll stay
These long stems are freakish if anything
But we can cut them down for the vase
Can you spare some change, dear
We've only got three hundred feet to go
And with impossibilium for a payload
We lift the rocket
Out of the pocket
Nothing can stop it
We can only watch itEmbed
