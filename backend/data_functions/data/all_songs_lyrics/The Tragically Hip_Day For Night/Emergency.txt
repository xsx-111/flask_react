Emergency LyricsI've often dreamt of a conversation
That just keeps on coming up again and again
We're sitting in the baby bar bereft
At a shadowy table out past the sentence's end
It's an emergency without end
From until it's no longer fun
To that's no longer relevant
From until we're no longer one
To the bona fide embodiment
Of an endless emergency without end
We're an endless emergency without end
We often stop in these conversations
Things we say here stay here forever, amen
When everything seems either funny or lousy
Funny or lousy, that's where it usually ends
We're an emergency without end
From until it's no longer fun
To that's no longer relevant
From until we're no longer one
To that's no longer permanent
From the last survivors of those terms
To the bona fide embodiment
Of an endless emergency without end
We're an endless emergency without end
We're an endless emergency without end
We're an endless emergency without end
But your finger starts to wiggle
And landscapes emergeEmbed
