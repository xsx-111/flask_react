Strawberries Mean Love LyricsStrawberries mean love
What's it made of?
Think you need love
You can feel love
You can find
Strawberries' love there
Life goes nowhere
Why are you there?
You cannot hide there
What will you find there?
You can find
Strawberries' love there
Doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah
Time can't end soon
Start before noon
All but a balloon
Cast up to the moon
You can find
Strawberries' love there
Seeing fields of
Flowered fields of
Think you need love
What's it made of?Embed
