Lose to Live LyricsTwo, three, four!
To find peace of mind today
You gotta search your thoughts in every way
You gotta fight to live
And lose to live
You gotta hate to love
Love to love
You're looking hard and waiting for
Someone to come through your front door, yeah
Nobody comes
Yeah
All right
Come on
Ah, yeah
There's just no use in trying anymore
You'll never amount to anything
Sure, you can try
You'll never get anywhere
There'll always be someone to put you down
You're not the only one who wants to live and not die
And you won't be the first one to give it one more try
You gotta fight to live
And lose to live
You gotta hate to love
Love to love
Yeah
All rightEmbed
