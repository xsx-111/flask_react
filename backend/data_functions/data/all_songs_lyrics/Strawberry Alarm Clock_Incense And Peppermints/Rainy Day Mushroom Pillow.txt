Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow LyricsRainy day mushroom pillow
Colors green, brown, and yellow
Wonder if they'll turn black ever
Contemplating one together
Poisoned dreams
Distorted dreams
Mushroom dreams
There's no place that can be better
When you're up in clouds forever
Pacify your mind with islands
Colored snow and green-field skies and
Poisoned dreams
Distorted dreams
Mushroom dreams
Don't have to tell you it feels better than
Floating free, walk upon the sand
Got to give you things much better
My mushroom's green and brown forever
Poisoned dreams
Distorted dreams
Mushroom dreams
