KRS-One Attacks Lyrics
We will be here forever
Do you understand? Forever
Forever and ever and ever and ever
We will be here forever, do you understand that?
Get what I'm saying, forever

How many real hip-hoppers in the place right about now?
How many real hip-hoppers in the place right about now?
How many real hip-hoppers in the place right about now?
I was listening to BDP
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks
KRS-One attacks
Remember, Criminal Minded
Rockin' beats, beats, beats
Remember, one, one
Rockin' beats, beats, beats
Remember, jack, jack, jack
Rockin' beats, beats, beats
Remember, but for now just set
Rockin' beats, beats, beats
Dope, dope, do-dope, dope, dope
Dope, dope, do-dope, dope
KRS-One specialize
Rockin' beats, beats, beats
KRS-One specialize
Rockin' beats, beats, beats
How many real hip-hoppers in the place right about now?
BDP
Worldwide, BDP

Party people in the place to be
Party people in the place to be
