Love Hound LyricsYou treat a man like a dog and that's just what you get
You may try to leave him but he'll follow you yet
Can't do a thing to get him off a your trail
You better give up, he's hot on your tail
You used to laugh at me when I said I'll come back
You let me roll over, you let me play dead
You think your little lap dog is dragging you down
I'm a oooh love hound
You went downtown and I followed you there
A sniff of perfume still hung in the air
You took the taxi, I took my time
Rolled down the window and you hid me outside
You used to laugh at me when I said I'll come back
You let me roll over, you let me play dead
You think your little lap dog is dragging you down
I'm a oooh love hound
No earthly reason to live in my home
Just pure motor reflex is keeping me going
Don't bother explaining it'll bring me down child
All I can hear is the call of the wild
You can tease your little puppy mama, that's alright
But when they grow up they just love to fight
You tremble in the dark when you hear that sound
I'm a oooh love hound
A love hound howls under the moon
A love hound gonna come and love you soon
Love you baby till the morning light
Feel that little old love hound bite
Open up your window mama, what's that sound
I'm a oooh love houndEmbed
