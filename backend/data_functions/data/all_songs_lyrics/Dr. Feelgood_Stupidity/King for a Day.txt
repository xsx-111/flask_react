King for a Day LyricsTook my fancy train in 14 days
Now I'm a fancy friend speaking through the air(?)
My, my, my, look at them walk by
These jokers trying to be kings for the day
Come too late, a-wheeling roll-a-dice
Happy in a fool's paradise
My, my, my, pie in the sky
Jokers trying to be kings for the day
Winners laugh, losers scream
There ain't no exit from this stream
Old jokers trying to be kings for the day
See them come, see them go
Exit how in a picture show
And the jokers trying to be kings for the day
The Lady Love is pretty but she's mean
What you say's a game without a dream
My, my, my, look at them go by
Pie in the sky makes you gonna cry
Old jokers gonna be kings for the day
Old jokers gonna be kings for the day
You know old jokers gonna be kings for the dayEmbed
