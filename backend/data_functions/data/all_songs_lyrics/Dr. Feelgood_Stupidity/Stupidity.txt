Stupidity Lyrics(As sung by the current Dr Feelgood line-up, October 1998)
All around the world
Every boy and girl
Come along with me
That's - a stupidity
All around the world
Every boy and girl
Take a lesson from me
That's - a stupidity
Papa says I look so crazy (Lee sang 'silly')
Mama says I look a fool
I don't mind their criticism
They do that every day in school
So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity
So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity
So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity
All around the world
Every boy and girl
Come along with me
That's - a stupidityEmbed
