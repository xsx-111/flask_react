Down at the Doctors LyricsLeave a late show
Still feel alive
Want a place to go
Round about five
Down to the doctors
Down to the doctors
Come on down to the doctors
Make you feel good all night
Everybody needs a shot of R'n'B
So come on down to my surgery
Down to the doctors
Down to the doctors
Come on down to the doctors
Make you feel good all night
Eight bars on piano
Down to the doctors
Down to the doctors
Come on down to the doctors
Make you feel good all night
Come here baby
Ain't gonna do you no harm
I just want to shoot
Some rock'n'roll in your arm
Down to the doctors
Down to the doctors
Come on down to the doctors
Make you feel good all nightEmbed
