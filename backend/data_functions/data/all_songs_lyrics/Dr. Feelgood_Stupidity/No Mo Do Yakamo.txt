No Mo Do Yakamo LyricsNo mo do Yakamo
What you say, no more pay
Here's the catch, no more scratch
No mo do Yakamo
No mo do Yakamo
Living high, lying low
Living fast, dying slow
No mo do Yakamo
Don't let it alarm ya
Think of it as karma
You were really burning for a while
Wasting every dime
Spending it like time
Guess you gonna have to change your style
No mo do Yakamo
Living high, lying low
Living fast, dying slow
No mo do YakamoEmbed
