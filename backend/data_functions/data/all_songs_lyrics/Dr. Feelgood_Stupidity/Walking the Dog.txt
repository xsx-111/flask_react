Walking the Dog LyricsBaby, back
Dressed in black
No silver buttons down her back
High heel shoes, red-tipped toes
She broke the needle but can she sew
Walking the dog
I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now c'mon
I asked her father for those ten cents
And found YOU ever jumped the fence
I jumped so high, I touched the skies
And didn't come back till you knew what it meant
Walking the dog
I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon c'mon now
Tell me Mary, what's your twelve
How does your garden grow
With silver bells and cockle shells?
No, with rabbits all in a row
Walking the dog
I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now c'mon
Baby, back
Dressed in black
No silver buttons down her back
High heel shoes, red-tipped toes
She broke the needle but can she sew
Walking the dog
I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now c'mon
Yeah just a walking
Ooh Wa just a walking
Ooh Wa just a walking
Now, if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now c'mon
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon C'mon
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk that dogEmbed
