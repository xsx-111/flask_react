All Through the City LyricsStand and watch the towers burning at the break of day
Steadily slowing down, been on my feet since yesterday
Gotta get a move on tryin' to find a man I know
Money in my pocket, looking for a place to go
I've been searching all through the city
See you in the morning down by the Jetty
Streets are full of signs, arrows pointing everywhere
Parks are full of people trying to get a breath of air
Listen to the weatherman praying for a drop of rain
Look into the sky, the sky is full of aeroplanes
I've been searching all through the city
See you in the morning down by the Jetty
Walking in the main drag pass the afternoon away
The sun is going down, the streets are still as bright as day
See the shiny cars driving round detecting crime
Hear the sirens wail, the cops are only killing time
I've been searching all through the city
See you in the morning down by the Jetty
I've been searching all through the city
See you in the morning down by the Jetty
I've been searching all through the city
See you in the morning down by the Jetty
I've been searching, I've been a searching for youEmbed
