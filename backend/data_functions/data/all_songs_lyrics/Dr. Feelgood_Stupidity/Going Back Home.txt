Going Back Home LyricsI wanna live the way I like
Sleep all the morning
Goin' get my fun at night
Things ain't like that here
Workin' just to keep my payments clear
I bought a brand new motor
And I'm waitin' for a loan
So I can fill her up and start her
Then I'm going back home
I got a girl a man's best friend
I'd have her now if she'd just come back again
But she left me in the fog
Told me that I treat her like a dog
The last time that I saw her she was buryin' a bone
I'm tired of whistlin' for her
Then I'm going back home
Old Johnny Green he asked me in
We watched his TV and we drank a little gin
Then I float on down the street
Smilin' at the faces that I meet
That was back this morning
Now I'm dizzy sick and stoned
When the world stops turning
Then I'm going back homeEmbed
