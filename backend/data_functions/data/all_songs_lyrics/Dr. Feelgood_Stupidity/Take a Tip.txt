Take a Tip LyricsTake a little tip from Mr. Johnny Green
Keep your rear view mirror clean
Keep an eye on the road and the one behind
Increase your speed if you're so inclined
Gotta to go faster
Gotta get along
Gotta to go faster
Put your foot to the floor
Push yourself just a little bit more
Take a little tip from Mr. Nosebleed Sam
Kissed the screen in a traffic jam
It minced his face and it bust his nose
Broke his leg and ripped his clothes
Gotta to go faster
Gotta get along
Gotta to go faster
Grit your teeth, clench your jaws
Push yourself just a little bit more
Take a little tip from Mr. Racetrack Tony
Stick it on the nose and ride your pony
Dance for the winner and ride your nag
Take your dinner from a new nose back
Gotta to go faster
Gotta get along
Gotta to go faster
Ride your nag till your sore
Push yourself just a little bit more
Gotta to go faster
Gotta get along
Gotta to go faster
Grit your teeth, clench your jaws
Push yourself just a little bit more
Take a little tip from Mr. Johnny Green
Keep your rear view mirror clean
Keep an eye on the road and the one behind
Increase your speed if you're so inclinedEmbed
