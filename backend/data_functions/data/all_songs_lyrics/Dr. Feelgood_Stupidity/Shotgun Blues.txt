Shotgun Blues LyricsRun, get my shotgun
Give me two shells in my hand
Run, get my shotgun
Put two shells in my hand
It's a bullet for my baby
A dedication for her backdoor man
Two kinds of people
Two kind of people I just cannot stand
Two kinds of people
Two kind of people I just cannot stand
One is a lone woman
The other is a cheatin' man
Run, get my shotgun
Put two shells in my hand
Please run, get my shotgun
Put two shells in my hand
I'm gonna kill my baby
And blast and blast her fancy manEmbed
