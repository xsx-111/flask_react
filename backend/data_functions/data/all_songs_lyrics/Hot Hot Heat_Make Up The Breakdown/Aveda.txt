Aveda LyricsI got my head shaved for her
Because she told me it would
Do all the right things for my identity
I never knew that it would;
I never knew that it could;
I think perhaps because it makes no difference
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
All I know is what I've been told
I got all done up for her
Because she told me it would
Do something to correct my identity
I never knew that I should;
I never knew that I would;
I think perhaps because it makes no difference
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
All I know is what I've been told
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
All I know is what I've been told
*I got all done up for her
Because she told me it would
Do all the right things for my identity, identity
I got my head shaved for her
Becuase she told me it would
Do all the right things for my, my, my, my, my*
I can't articulate it;
Consistently frustrated;
Her discontent over my identity
I never knew that it would;
I never knew that it could;
I never knew because it makes no difference
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, Aveda
Hold me down, it feels so right
Hold me down, AvedaEmbed
