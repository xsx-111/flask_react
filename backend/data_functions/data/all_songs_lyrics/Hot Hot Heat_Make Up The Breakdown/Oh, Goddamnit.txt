Oh, Goddamnit Lyrics
Regular exposure to insecticide
Has caused me to break out in hives
I'm losing weight, I cannot wait till Saturday
'Cause Saturday, my tax deductions make me function like
A blue collar, white collar
I don't know, so I gotta holler
Oh, oh goddamnit
I think I've lost it
Oh god, goddamnit
I think I've lost you

Antioxidants have got me causing accidents
Because my wine is spiked with pomegranate
If you've got just one, then slam it
Oh, oh goddamnit
I think I've lost it
Oh god, goddamnit
I think I've lost you

Shot down, it's just such a shame
I bet you feel no pain
Mercy, expect a rivalry
Shot down, it's just such a shame
I'm losing at this game
No fair
Why don't you seem to care?
Lack of consequence has got me making decisions
Based upon truth or dare decision making
No flaking
I end up taking karate
She's naughty, I call shotty
My body will never live up to these expectations
I still make invitations
Oh, oh, goddamnit
I think I've lost it
Oh god, goddamnit
I think I've lost it
Oh god, goddamnit

Shot down, it's just such a shame
I bet you feel no pain
Mercy, expect a rivalry
Shot down, it's just such a shame
I'm losing at this game
No fair
Why don't you seem to care?
Oh, oh goddamnit
I think I've lost it
And I think that I've lost you
Shot down, shot down, it's just such a shame
I'd rather you feel no more pain
Shot down, shot down, it's just such a shame
I think that I'm losing this game
Shot down, shot down, it's just such a shame
I'd rather you feel no more pain
Shot down, shot down, it's just such a shame
I think that I'm losing this gameEmbed
