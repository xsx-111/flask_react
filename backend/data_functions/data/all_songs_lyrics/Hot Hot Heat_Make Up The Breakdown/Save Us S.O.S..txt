Save Us S.O.S. LyricsYou got to You got to You got to
Save us! S-O-S!
I'm out of gas. I'm out of touch
Shipwrecked ferry... marry me -or take me out to lunch
Save us! S-O-S!
I'm out of gas. I'm out of love
No No No No No I won't be coming home
Tell her Tell her Tell her Tell her Tell her
That I still am on the road
No No No No No I won't be coming home
Make sure she knows Make sure she knows
That I would change it if I could
You see?
There's an exit door and it won't open up for me!
There's an exit door and it won't open up you see!
There's an exit door and it won't open up for me!
There's an exit door and you got you got to'
Save us! S-O-S!
I'm out of gas. I'm out f touch
Shipwrecked ferry... marry me -or take me out to lunch
Save us! S-O-S!
I'm out of gas. I'm out of touch
No No No No No I won't be coming home
Tell her Tell her Tell her Tell her Tell her
That I still am on the road
No No No No No I won't be coming home
Make sure she knows Make sure she knows
That I would change it if I could
There's an exit door and it won't open up for me!
There's an exit door and it won't open up you see!
There's an exit door and it won't open up for me!
There's an exit door and you got you got to'
Save us! S-O-S!
I'm out of gas. I'm out of touch
Shipwrecked ferry... marry me -or take me out to lunch
Save us! S-O-S!
I heard a tick-tock, tick-tock, tick... talk to you on the phone
Ring-Ring... though I know that nobody's home
Why not? Why not I ask?
Why not? Why can't we be creative?
Why not? Why not I ask?
Why not? Why can't we be together?
Save us S.O.S you gotta
Save us S.O.S you gotta
Save us S.O.S you gotta
Save us S.O.S
I heard a tick-tock, tick-tock, tick... talk to you on the phone
Ring-Ring... though I know that
You gotta just save us S.O.S you gotta
Save us S.O.S
I heard a tick-tock, tick-tock, tick... talk to you
Not homeEmbed
