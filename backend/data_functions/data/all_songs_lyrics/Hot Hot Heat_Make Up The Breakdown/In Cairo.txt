In Cairo LyricsWalking oh so slowly
Don't know anybody
Feels like I'm in Cairo
Talking oh so quickly
Please explain what they mean
Taking matters too light
How did this start a fight
Why did I tie them tight?
Double knotted tonight
I guess this must be Cairo
Diamonds and brass hid behind painted glass in the heart of Cairo
Sinking in way too deep
I won't care what they think once I've left for Cairo
Thinking about it too hard
Shouldn't take this too far or I'll end up in Cairo
How did I find my back in... Cairo?Embed
