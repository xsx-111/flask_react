This Town LyricsGonna walk right through this town
And laugh with a crowd of strangers chasing me
Never stop to look behind my back, so tell me what they said
Because I fear my life's in danger now in this town
How did you get to my motel -do tell soon
Gonna walk right through this town again with a crowd of strangers
Watching me, picking every little thing apart
So, tell me what they said because I get attitude from this town
-in this town. How did you get to this town?
...Through this town?
Gonna walk right through this town again knowing that I'm only here tonight
Never cared to stop and say hello;
So, tell me what they said because I don't have time to hang around in this town
Maybe... maybe I should think to stay
Maybe I won't ever return
Maybe... maybe I should stop and play
Gonna walk right through this town again
But, all I know is I really should be on my way
Wouldn't mind one more night in townEmbed
