Naked in the City Again LyricsSays she's got it all
Says she's got it all
Says she's got it
I don't wanna be the one to tell her that she don't
But she just don't...
Late night, in a lonely city...
So hard, she tries to look pretty
Boys don't even notice her though
She's in need of attention so
Lost and naked in the city again...
Intoxicated by a quarter to ten
Lost and naked in the city again
Begging for a piece of their attentionEmbed
