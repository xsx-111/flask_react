No, Not Now LyricsOh no, she's not a secret now
But, nobody cares
Oh no, she's not a secret now
The wolves have smelled her scent
Oh no, she's not a secret now
But, nobody cares
Oh no, she's not a secret now
Some of us wouldn't be lying
If we said were trying too hard
But, it all works out in the end
Some of us would be trying too hard to begin lying
But... but, it seems to all work out in the end
Oh no, she's not a secret now
But, nobody cares
Oh no, she's not a secret now
The wolves have smelled her scent
Oh no
Nobody likes a child who complains
And I won't be that child anymore
Some of us wouldn't be lying
If we said were trying too hard
But, it all works out in the end
Some of us would be trying too hard to begin lying
But... but, it seems to all work out in the end
Oh no, she's not a secret now
But, nobody cares
Oh no, she's not a secret now
The wolves have smelled her scent
Oh no
Nobody likes a child who complains
And I won't be that child anymore
Nobody likes a child who complains
And I won't be that child anymoreEmbed
