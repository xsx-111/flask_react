Talk to Me, Dance with Me LyricsYou are my only girl, but you're not my owner girl (x4)
Talk to me... dance with me here in the spotlight, girl
Talk to me... dance with me here. You're the spotlight girl
So perfect you paint it... yet so manipulated
So calm and so patient... yet oh so calculated
So safe and comforting... this doesn't feel like flirting
So fun I'm distracted... forgot you keep track of it
You are my only girl, but you're not my owner girl (x8)
Talk to me... dance with me here. You're the spotlight girl
(x3)
Talk to me... dance with meEmbed
