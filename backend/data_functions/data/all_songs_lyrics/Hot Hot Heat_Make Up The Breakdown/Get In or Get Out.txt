Get In or Get Out LyricsHe never thought that he would leave so soon
Passed out in May
But then woke up June hanging over July
Security! Security! Beware:
The cost of living is a one way fare
I'm pulling the alarm, so get in or get out
His polyester sticks out in the crowd
It's true, there is such a thing as too loud
-but I won't let him know
White lipstick smeared upon my bathroom mirror
He stuck me with the bill -but I don't care
I'm pulling the alarm
So get in or get out.....
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Make up your mind and get in or get out!
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Say what you will, but get in or get out!
We never thought that he would leave this town
We always thought that he would hang around
Getting old with the rest
Jean jackets folded on his closet shelf
The weather begs for leather coats
Ah well, I'm pulling the alarm
So get in or get out....
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Make up your mind and get in or get out
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Say what you will but get in or get out...
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Make up your mind and get in or get out
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Say what you will but get in or get out
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Make up your mind and get in or get out
Ugly or pretty, it's still my city
Say what you will but get in or get outEmbed
