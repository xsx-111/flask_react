Another One Bites the Dust (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics
I feel a little boogie coming on, what do you think?


One! Two! Three! Four!

Hey, hey
You know what song
Get in the groove, babe

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, sing it!
(Another one bites the dust)
One more!
(Another one bites the dust)
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Hey, hey, hey

Another one bites the dust
(Another one bites the dust)
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust


Be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be, be-dop-bop-be-dop-bey
Be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be, be-dop-be-dop-be-dop-bey
Hey, hey everybody c'mon
Another one bites the dust, yeah
(Another one bites the dust)
Another one bites the dust, yeah, yeah
(Another one bites the dust)
Another one bites the dust, yeah
(Another one bites the dust, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
Gimme yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
Another one bites the dust
(Another one bites the dust)
Another one bites the dust, yeah
(Another one bites the dust, yeah)
Lock the doors
(Lock the doors)
Lock the doors
(Lock the doors)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Bop-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be-bop, be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop...
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Yeah, hey-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
Yes I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, hey
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotcha!


You know something? There's been a lot of rumors lately... about a certain band called Queen. Rumors are that uh... the rumors are that we're going to split up. What do you think?

No!

They're talking from here


My apologies, but I say what I want. You know what I mean? So forget those rumors. We're going to stay together until we fucking well die. I'm sure of it


I keep-- I must tell you. I keep wanting to leave, but they won't let me. Also, I suppose-- we're not bad for four raging queens, are we, really? What do you think?
