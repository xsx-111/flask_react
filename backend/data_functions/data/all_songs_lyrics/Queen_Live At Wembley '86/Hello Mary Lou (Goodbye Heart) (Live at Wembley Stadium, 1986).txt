Hello Mary Lou (Goodbye Heart) (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics
I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
I knew I wanted you forever more
Hey, I'm not one that get's around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And oh, I never did see you no more

I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
One more time
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart


Ay!
Ay, wait a minute
One minute!
I need my fucking- but I don't care. Let's go!Embed
