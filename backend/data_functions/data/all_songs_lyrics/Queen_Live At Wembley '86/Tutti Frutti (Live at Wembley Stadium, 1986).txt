Tutti Frutti (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics
Bop bopa-a-lu a whop bam boo
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo

I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
She rock to the east, she rocks to the west
But she's the girl that I know best

Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo

I got a gall named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy
I got a gal named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy
She knows how to love me, yes indeed
Boy, I don't know what you're doin' to me
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo
(A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo)

Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo


I got a gal named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy
I got a gal named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy
She knows how to love me, yes indeed
Boy, I don't know what you're doin' to me
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo

Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo
Hey!
