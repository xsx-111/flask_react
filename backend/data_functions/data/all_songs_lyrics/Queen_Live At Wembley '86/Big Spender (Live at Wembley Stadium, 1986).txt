Big Spender (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) LyricsAhhhhh
The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a woman of distinction
A real big spender
Good looking - so refined
Wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind?
Let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every one I see
Hey, big spender!
Spend a little time with me ...Embed
