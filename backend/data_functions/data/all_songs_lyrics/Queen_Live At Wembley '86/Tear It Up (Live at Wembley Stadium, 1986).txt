Tear It Up (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics
Yeah!
Are you ready?
Well, are you ready?

You gotta tear it up, break it up
Shake it up, baby
Tear it up, shake it up
Make it up as you go along
Tear it up, square it up
Shake it up, baby
Tear it up, stir it up
Stake it out, and you can't go wrong

Give me your mind, baby, give me your body
Give me some time, baby, let’s have a party
There is no time for sleepin', baby
Soon it's round your street I’m creeping
You better be ready

Tear it up, break it up
Shake it up, baby
Tear it up, stir it up
Make it up as you go along
Tear it up, square it up
Shake it up, baby
Tear it up, stir it up
Make it up, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Are you ready baby?
Are you ready for love?
Oh, yeah
Oh, are you ready for me?
Oh, yeah
I love you so near, I love you so far
I gotta tell you baby you're driving me ga ga3Embed
