A Kind of Magic (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic

One dream, one soul, one prize
One goal, one golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light (Hey!)
That shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic
The memories inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
The waiting seems eternity, yeah
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
It's a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
Hey

It's a kind of magic
A little bit of magic, give it to me!

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is a kind of magic (Yeah)
There can be only one one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done (Done)

Hey!
A little bit of magic, everyone
Magic, magic, magic, magic

Yeah, yeah

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon, will soon be done
Will soon be done
