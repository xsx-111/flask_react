In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics

It's so easy, but I can’t do it
So risky, but I got to chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that’s all you want to talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods (Sing it)
Woah, woah, la-la-la, woah
Woah, woah, la-la
Wah wah ooh
I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Woah, woah, la-la-la, woah
Woah, woah, la-la
Wah wah ooh
I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Woah, woah, la-la-la, woah
Woah, woah, la-la
Wah wah ooh
I'm no fool
It’s in the lap of the Gods
Woah, woah, la-la-la, woah
Woah, woah, la-la
Wah wah ooh
I’m no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
