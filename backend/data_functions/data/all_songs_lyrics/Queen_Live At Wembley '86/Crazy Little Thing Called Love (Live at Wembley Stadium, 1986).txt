Crazy Little Thing Called Love (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics

This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get ’round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (This thing)
Called love (Called love)
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n’ roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat
{Break}

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love


I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie!)
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Take it, take it

Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, uh-huh
Crazy little thing called love, uh0huh
Crazy little thing called love, alright


Thank you, good night!
