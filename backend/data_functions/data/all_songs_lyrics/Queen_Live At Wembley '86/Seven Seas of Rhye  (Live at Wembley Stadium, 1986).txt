Seven Seas of Rhye  (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics

Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Yeah, yeah

Fear me you lords and privy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Yeah, yeah

Sister, I live and lie for you
Mister, do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever, forever, forever3Embed
