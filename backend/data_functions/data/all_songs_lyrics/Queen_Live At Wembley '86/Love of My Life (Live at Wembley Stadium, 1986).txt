Love of My Life (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics
This is the point where the guitarist gets to speak, now and again
Today, I don't have much to say except thank you very much for coming, and uh... making this the hottest ticket this country's ever seen. We love ya'



Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me


Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me

Love of my life can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side, to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)
I still love you



Oh, hurry back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

(Love of my life)
Love of my life
Oooh, yeah
