Tie Your Mother Down (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics

Oooh yeah

Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right
I got my act all tight
It's got to be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
No way I'm going to lose out this time

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from you
Ain't your family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm going to make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Send your brother swimming with a brick
That's alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
She ain't no friend of mine
She ain't no friend of mine


Your momma and your daddy going to
Plague me until I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace loving guy
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big, big, big, big, big, big
Daddy out the door
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

All your love tonight
All your love tonight
All your love tonight
Hey!
All your love tonight
Give me those cymbals!


Hello again, my beauties!
Is it happening?
Is everything okay?
Wanna fool around?7Embed
