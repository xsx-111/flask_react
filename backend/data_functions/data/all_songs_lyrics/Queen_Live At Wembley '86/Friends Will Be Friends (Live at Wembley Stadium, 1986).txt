Friends Will Be Friends (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest
It's so easy love, 'cause you've got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand, friends will be friends
Right till the end

Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number

As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way
It's so easy now, 'cause you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand, friends will be friends
Right till the end2Embed
