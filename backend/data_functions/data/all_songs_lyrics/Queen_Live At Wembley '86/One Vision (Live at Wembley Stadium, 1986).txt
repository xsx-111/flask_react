One Vision (Live at Wembley Stadium, 1986) Lyrics

Ah


Hey!
One man, one goal, ha!
One mission
One heart, one soul
Just one solution
One flash of light
Yeah, one god, one vision

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision
Whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh
Give me one vision

No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you there’s no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one worldwide vision
One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision
Whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh
Whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah!

I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
(But a cold wind blows)
(And a dark rain falls)
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream, yeah

One vision!
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready!
There’s only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision

No hate, no fight
Just excitation
All through the night
It's a celebration
Whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-whoa-oh-oh yeah
One, one, one, one, one, one

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision

Give me one night (One night!)
Give me one hope (One hope!)
Just give me, ah
One man (One man)
One bar (One night)
One day, hey, hey
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Fried chicken!
Yeah!
Let's go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah2Embed
