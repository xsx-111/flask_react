Nostalgia LyricsYou sing about waking up in the morning
But you're never up before noon
You look completely different from those straights
Who walked around on the moon
The clothes you wear
Would suit an old times balloon
You're always nowhere
But you'll realize pretty soon
That all that you care
Isn't worth a twelve bar tune
You believe you're just one more flower
Among so many flowers that sprout
You just feel faintly proud when you hear they shout very loud:
"You're not allowed in here, get out!"
That's what rock'n'roll is all about
That's what rock'n'roll is all about
I mean, that's what rock'n'roll was all about1Embed
