Neolithic Man LyricsI'm in the silence that's suddenly heard
After the passing of a car
I'm in the silence that's suddenly heard
After the passing of a car
I'm in the silence that's suddenly heard
After the passing of a car
Spaces grow wide about me
Spaces grow wide about me
If you look from your window at the morning star
You won't see me
You won't see
You won't see me
You'll only see
You won't see me
You'll only
You won't see me
You'll only see
You won't see me
You'll only see that you can't see very far
You won't see me
You won't see
You won't see me
You'll only see
You won't see me
You'll only
You won't see me
You'll only see
You won't see me
You'll only
You won't see me
You'll only see
You won't see me
You'll only
You won't see me
You won't see
God spoke to me
From inside the newstone one day
You're my son
And my eyes swept the horizon
Away
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca
Quem tem vovó, pelanca só
Quem tem vovó, pelanca
You won't see me
You won't see
You won't see me
You won't see
You won't see me
You won't see
Spaces grow wide about meEmbed
