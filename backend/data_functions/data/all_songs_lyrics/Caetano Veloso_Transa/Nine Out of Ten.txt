Nine Out of Ten LyricsWalk down Portobello Road to the sound of reggae
I'm alive
The age of gold, yes the age of
The age of old
The age of gold
The age of music is past
I hear them talk as I walk, yes I hear them talk
I hear they say
Expect the final blast
Walk down Portobello Road to the sound of reggae
I'm alive
I'm alive and vivo
Muito vivo, vivo, vivo
Feel the sound of music banging in my belly
Know that one day I must die
I'm alive
I'm alive and vivo muito vivo, vivo, vivo
In the Electric Cinema or on the telly, telly, telly
Nine out of ten movie stars make me cry
I'm alive
And nine out of ten film stars make me cry
I'm aliveEmbed
