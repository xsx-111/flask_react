The Satanist LyricsI descended from the Mount Sinai
Unleashed the splendor upon a scoundrel mob
To shelter where no messianic light
Drove one single ray into the pulp ov life
Oh sweet Salome, I beckon thee:
Bring forth thy heinous offering
Without your love
So incomplete
Corrupt me with your dignity
I decompose in the rapture ov hells
Dissolve, divide, disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below
At faintest whim they would impale the sun
And thus the sheep in me became the wolf in man
I am the fly that flew forth from the ark
My thoughts like insects
Whoring wounds divine
Been bored with cosmos my dear old foe
This universe has never been enough
Compelled to liberate the spring ov life
When the levee breaks gush forth o' stream ov ice
I decompose in rapture ov hells
Dissolve, divide, disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below
I cast my halo from perdition’s clay
Behold my bliss profane
Born of a lie
Condemned to lurk
Live in denial
Yet coiled aflame
I am the great rebellion
'neath Milton’s tomb I dwell
An existence even sin would not pardon
No guilt, no reason, savior, or shame11Embed
