In the Absence ov Light LyricsEver since the Devil breathes
My steps never outweighed the gravity ov hell
So I keep praying for rain ov flaming rocks
To foster the symmetry ov worlds
I had a vision ov the impenetrable darkness
Never found on neither side ov the moon
It wields composure ov my soul
That comes as one with the odium below
Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and without

I throw out each flaw, any idea
I trust not any abstraction
I believe not in god nor mind
Enough with these gods
Give me a human
Let him be just like me, just like me
Dull, unripe, unfinished, not dark, and not bright
So that I may with him dance, play with him
With him fight, in front ov him pretend
Give him thanks, and him, rape
Fall in love with him, through him recreate myself
Grow through him, and sprouting this way
Wed myself, in the church ov man
I imagined the most ardent ray ov sun
Like vulture hovering above my neck
It burns with fever, deep within my soul
Erect in glory to sink into shame
Oh lord, whence came this doubt?
Thou doth know I am all, and everything
Let loose my shackles
Let chaos reign
Infecting moral arteries
Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and withoutEmbed
