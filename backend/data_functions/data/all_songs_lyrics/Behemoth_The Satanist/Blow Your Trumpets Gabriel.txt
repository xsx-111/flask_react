Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel Lyrics
I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes of Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve, dissolved by flame
Looked down on Son of God, snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets, Gabriel
As I beheld the bewilderment of Eden
Break the bread, and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den
Nations fall prey, hail my return (Hail, hail, hail)

Hosanna (Hosanna)
Tribe of Judah decimate
Hosanna (Hosanna)
Root of David eradicate
Hosanna (Hosanna)
Let wine of Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna (Hosanna)
May Sin of Gomorrah grace our hearts6Embed
