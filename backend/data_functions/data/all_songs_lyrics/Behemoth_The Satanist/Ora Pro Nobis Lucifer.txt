Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer LyricsVoice ov an aeon
Angelus Satani
Ora pro nobis Lucifer
You alone have suffered
The fall and torment ov shame
I'll smite heaven's golden pride
And never pity thee
Immaculate divine
Satan ov Elohim
None dare to stand in your way
Thou bow to none
Ov Eden's feculence
Conjure the serpent messenger
Savior world's decay
Concord in temptation
And in the fall ov Eve
For thine is the kingdom
And the power
For thine is the kingdom
And the glory
Forever
Scholar ov the unlight
Great volcano ov excrement
Rippling eager to erupt
Re-constellate the firmament
Behold the great accuser
A megalinga ov throbbing zeal
Raptor yearning to pierce
To rape the seventh seal
Destroyer ov cosmos
Implore the ungod
Implode the sun
There is none wronging the serpent's cult
Untouched and ignored
With the serpent's might
And the trumpets blow
In the shadow ov the horns
For thine is the kingdom
And the power
For thine is the kingdom
And the glory
Forever
Lightning that stabs the heavens
Thou quiver the mount Sinai
Split rocks on tablets ov covenant
Listen for the tempest's rasp
Azazel! Apolyon!
The black sun never sets
For it never rose
Habemus Satanas
The Caesar's wrath
Empire's fall
Petition the lord with fire
Santa Sede burns
Phallus Dei
Erect from pole to pole
Viva blasfemia
In coitus infinitus
Hear the universe scream
Bleeding from black holes
Whom horns caress
And whom God mourns5Embed
