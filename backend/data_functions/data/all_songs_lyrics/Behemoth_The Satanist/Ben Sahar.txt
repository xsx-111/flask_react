Ben Sahar LyricsThee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies
Hearken hosts on high
Fetch me your god
As my ambition prescribes
Challenge the sun
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount of congregation
Far toward the north
Thee I cast aside
Fetus divine
Agnus dei
Free ov thy lies
Hearken dogs ov Nazarene
Linger at St. Peterâ€™s door
Partake from the well ov nothingness
Bite the withered hand ov god
Ascend shall I unto the heavens
Exalt my throne above his celestial display
Sit shall I upon that mount ov congregation
Far toward the north
Boreal hell beneath my feet
Blistering Eden above
With prayer on lips
With freedom bequeathed
Through fire we walk
With fire in hearts20Embed
