Messe Noire LyricsI believe in Satan
Who rend both heavens and earth
And in the Antichrist
His dearly misbegotten
The anguish ov our future
A bastard spawned from lie
Born ov a harlot nun
Reign high in luxury
Aloft the kings ov man
I use words sharp as a sword
To rake saints ’shins bestrewn
Three days risen, the grand deceiver
I bless the world with ire and woe
So, can you hoard host like Zion’s coin
Belie progeny ov your pain?
Yahweh(YWHW) thou sayeth unto me
Thou, disrupter, imbalance my creations!
Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation
I burnt in rapture, wafted ash about…
Became the law above all laws
In asymmetry ov the horns
I cut loose the cord ov life
Depart celestial source
Rub mould in holy pages
Let woodworms eat the cross
I prayed I’d die in you oh Lord
I pray you’d die in me!
Who shall crucify the last prophets
And have them wilt on splintered stems?
Who shall churn hells across the earth
And reascend to seat himself
At the left hand ov Satan
Be gaoler ov the living
And ov the dead
As it was in the beginning
Now and shall ever be
World without end
