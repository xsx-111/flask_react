Furor Divinus LyricsVeto! I vomited forth
From a throat choked by rope
As lunatic mob
Shackled maimed feet
Tore asunder both wings
Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity
Bleed dry of tears
Weep with blood
Leave to atrophy
I sought reprisal high and low
I spew forth plagues to taint their soil
I crept under the shadow of purity
In my hour of pious wane
I turned to boundless catechism
Behold the anathema of benediction
Sacrilege in Gethsemane manifest
Furor Divinus!
Anointed sin became flesh
Emerge the accuser of all
Hark the universe cries forlorn
Bleeds from black lungs of hell
Deflowered by the horns
And so I reversed the wheel of my fortune
Strike blind the eye of the lion
With every breath stolen from their lips
I raped and raped and raped the daughters of Zion
Raise the dagger Abraham
And slit the throat of thy only son
Reverse the history of man
Fuck and reset the world
Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity
Bleed dry of tears
Weep with blood
Leave my cross to atrophy5Embed
