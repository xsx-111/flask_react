Amen LyricsHail Mary, full ov disgrace
The Lord has fornicated with thee
Cursed art thou among men
And possessed
Cunning as shroud ov Turin
On the autopsy ov god
Damnata Virgo Maria
Credo undone
Bitch ov a sibylline vulva
Usurpress and liar
Centuries wept because ov thee
Where art thou now in the hour ov trial?
Cunning as shroud ov Turin
On the autopsy ov god
Creatio ex nihilo
Credo undone
Wretched is the fruit ov thy womb, Babylon!
Holy mother, mother ov god
Pray for us not, the sinners
Now and at the hour ov our death
