Kentucky LyricsKentucky
You are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky
I miss your laurel and your redbud trees
When I die
I want to rest upon a graceful mountain so high
For that is
Where God will look for me
Kentucky
I miss the old folks singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky
I miss the hound dogs chasinâ€™ (Rac)coon
I know that
My mother, dad and sweetheart are waiting for me
Kentucky
I will be coming soon
