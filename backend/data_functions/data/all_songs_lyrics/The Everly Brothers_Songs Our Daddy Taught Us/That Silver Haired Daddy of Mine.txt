That Silver Haired Daddy of Mine LyricsIn a vine covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered my sorrows
Tis that silver haired daddy of mine
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own, if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine
I know it's too late dear old daddy
To repay for those sorrows and cares
Though dear mother is waiting in heaven
Just to comfort, and solace you there
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own, if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mineEmbed
