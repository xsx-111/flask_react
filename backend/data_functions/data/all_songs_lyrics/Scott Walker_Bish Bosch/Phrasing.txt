Phrasing Lyrics
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone

'Neath a protein moon
In a protein sky
Running protein fields
With my protein eye

There's a protein song
Howling through the meat
Driving protein bods
From my protein street

Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
From the south, the Klan sends roses
Lymph-lacquered nails hover in waifed autumn sun
For dragging down the back of summer
From the east come killer poses
Khrushchev's shoe beats a black tattoo
In the middle of the day
From the north flow floats with quivering virgins
Fresh from frozen catacombs
Did ya spot the die-cut crosses?
Did ya?
Did ya?

Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone
Pain is not alone

'Neath a protein moon
In a protein sky
Running protein fields
With my protein eye

Here's to a lousy life
Here's to a lousy life
Here's to a lousy life
Here's to a lousy lifeEmbed
