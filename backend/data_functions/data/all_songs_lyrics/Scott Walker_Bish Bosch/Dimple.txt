Dimple Lyrics
November in July
Eyes glistening in darkness like freshly crushed flies
Fourteen bones held together by avian phlegm
When the whistling has ended I won't stale again
Slurry soul, unbearable clink
Fraying through tartared chink
Took the Dorgi, left the dent
Frozen fast in the sagging night
4/4 of silence, 5/4 of shame
When the sneezings subsided
I won't stare again

Ink-a-dink-a-dink
(Hej do, hej do)
A-dink-a-dink-a-dink-a-doo
(Hej do, hej do)

Jutland is crooning narcrotic Lorilies
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)
Awaiting command
Its huge snout wedged between my thighs
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)
Ink-a-dink-a-dink
(Hej do, hej do)
A-dink-a-dink-a-dink-a-doo
(Hej do, hej do)

Jutland is hvining while stars fall in thuds
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)
Flattening the cheek, like soft muffled scuds
(Ingen, ingenting, ingen, ingenting)

Tongues lick the lead Lego
They won't be denied
If you're listening to this
You must have survived
My only pige passed your only dreng
In Jutland's sheer city
(Farvel, farvel)

November in July
Apropolis lip to where acid-fast fly
Creepy and shiny guanine restrain
While out lifting scalp, I will not glare again
Took the shilling, ditched the score
Frozen fast in the lowering night
In the lowering left-testicle night1Embed
