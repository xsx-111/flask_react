Epizootics! Lyrics
Maman Neigho was frightened by Hawaiians
When all the veins ran out
When too much bone structure went missing
She thumbed the galleon Cacafuego
Forsook the eyebrows climbing
Into greasy black hairlines
Narcrotic leis yanked down around the melianomed ankles
Their putrid petals dropping
Erasing the white shoes
Like a face being eaten by a jungle
Slabs of steam tables
Whiffing of onions and roses
Haunted Jacuzzis churning
All night the native bods squealing B-flat
Like choirs of pigs
Seeking revenge for stolen insulin

Blip boost bust brother
That's how we copped a final
Reached this city without sound
Everywhere you turn
Bunkers of rubber hoses pronging up off the city's floor
Chirp chime clambaked cups
Don't step on that rotting tartare
Just might bust your conk
Might lay your racket
Early black ickaroo
It's dense, tense
Unseen through, pound for pound
All the people, on the corners
Pushing each other around
Humping like buggers
Touching like muggers
Pushing each other around

Adipocere in a zoot
Sloshing karat
Ballooning down the street
Thousand kilos simpy
Forty stone send
Tips his skypiece
Come to weigh me up
But I'm toned
Gut bucket
Ground grippers ready to trilly
Layin' down iron togged to the bricks

Shhh...
Let's add a little shade
Try something apart from the hogshair
While Pope Julius affects his red slippers
Let Michelangelo tip-toe around
In his dogskin boots
Shhh...
The powder on a chalky bosom rises
And hangs in the air
Clouds crawling through protracted blue
Like souls of insects
From threshing haze
The scent of spider lilies
Sam P's bagged decapitation
Rotates to the ocean floor
It's nostrils are twitching and sniffing

Gabriel's gravy
Got your glasses on gate
There's some mezz glimmers
A gammon V8
Twisters in the slammer
Frisking their whiskers
Till peola dim
On the chime of black

It's dense, tense
Unseen through, pound for pound
Scratch and Jesus, on the corner
Pushing each other around
Shoving like sluggers
Touching like muggers
Pushing each other around
Snapping their caps
Slidin' their jibs
Lampin' the brees
Drapin' the trees
Oops, pardon the elbow
Let's just shift you over here
Sorry, I'm so clumsy
Take that accidentally in the bollocks, for a start
Seven brights jumped in port
Reached this city without sound
Kopasetic, on the corners
Pushing each other around
Everybody on the corners
Pushing each other around
Joe below, hincty dicty
Slipped the pounders fews and two
Knock me, boot me
Down in the land of darkness

Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flowerEmbed
