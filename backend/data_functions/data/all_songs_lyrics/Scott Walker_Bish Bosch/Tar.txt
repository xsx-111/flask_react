Tar Lyrics
Flat nose whistle goes up ahead
Up ahead on the El Greco grunt

God creates man and then animals
Bilge!
God creates animals and then man
Jackaroo in the slew
Let its tinnitustic needles sew back shadow

She holds a baby made of towels all up ahead
Up ahead on the baleen bronchial

Jacob's offspring in Egypt totalled seventy
Hogwash!
Jacob's offspring in Egypt totalled seventy five
Contritio/Attritio
Let the leashes strain sustain those jaw-joints surging

Aw-shucks, aw-gee
The Porter sticks with the Porter's dreams
Shoot to a wing-tip pawing the ground
I wouldn't trust him
Not to dance a drachma across his knuckles
Twenty-seven inches from heel to heel
Lardie, Lardie, Lardie
While every skin is raised
While every eye was grazed
Thrushy-tongue lolling up ahead
Up ahead on the sarcomere stump

The women came to the tomb at dawn
Booty chatter!
The women came when the sun had risen
Laps/Relapse
Let this throat's Colombian necktie choke that Franglais

Flat nose whistle goes up ahead
Up ahead on the Pilates punk

The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree
GTFO
The righteous shall perish and no man layeth it to heart
I swerved away into the dark

Forty-five inches from heel to heel
Forty-five inches from heel to heel
Forty-five inches from heel to heel
There but for the grace of God goes GodEmbed
