Pilgrim Lyrics
Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya
Room full of mice, room full of mice
Room full of mice, room full of mice
Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya
Room full of mice, room full of mice
Room full of mice, room full of mice

Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw
Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw
Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw
Staring into their eyes just before they burst

Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya
Room full of mice, room full of mice
Room full of mice, room full of mice
Heya, heya, heya, heya
Heya, heya, heya, heya
Room full of mice, room full of mice
Room full of mice, room full of mice
No ear, two tails, one eye, three toes
No ear, two tails, one eye, three toes
No ear, two tails, one eye, three toesEmbed
