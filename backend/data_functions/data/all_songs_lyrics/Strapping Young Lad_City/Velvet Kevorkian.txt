Velvet Kevorkian LyricsCan you believe this shit, people?
All I need is this city and this mind, and I will get by!
Fuck sleep, fuck all of you!
Yes... yes!
But we can never look back because we'll never get a second chance
I like people who can take the pressure!
Are you listening? Are you? Fuck you!
A new time has come, ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls... welcome the fuck home!Embed
