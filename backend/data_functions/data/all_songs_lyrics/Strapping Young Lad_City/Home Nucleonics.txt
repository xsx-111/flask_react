Home Nucleonics Lyrics"The beat starts here"

Hey, you failed, like God, in me!
Feasting, like dogs, you fuck, get out my way!
I warned you...
Hey, the fools, shall not be entertained!
Feasting, like gods, you fuck, get out my way!
I Warned You...
Fuck you! Stupid! Human! Beings!
Technology will be the second coming!
And it will hit us while we're looking for a man!
I Warned You!
Tech-No-Lo-Gy!
Hating, Burning, Waiting, Falling
Fucking, Twisting, Human Cancer
Fuck Your Bullshit America
Hey, you failed, like God, and me!
Feasting, like dogs, you fucks are in my way!
I warned you!Embed
