Spirituality LyricsI'm right here where you left me, experimenting
Bored out of my fucking mind...
Please give me a sign, please show me a sign
Please show me that you're alive
There's got to be
Another way
...Another place for me
Please, help me please...
You'll never be what you try to be if you want to be it
God help the king of nothing
It's getting late
I'm getting old
And every night I just sleep, we never talk
And every night, I look to the sky
And I pray to God they'll hear me...
And if that's all there is
...if this is it
Won't... Won't someone tell me
(help me)
'Cause I'm so fucking sick of all you sick, stupid people
(ooh-oh)Embed
