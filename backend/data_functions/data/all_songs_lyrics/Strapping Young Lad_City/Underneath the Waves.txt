Underneath the Waves LyricsOn And On, It's On And On
On And On, It's On And On
No One Knows Why, No One Knows Why
A New Time, New Ways
New Thought, New Age
On And On, It's On And On
On And On, It's On And On
Say Goodbye! Say Goodbye! Say Goodbye! Say Goodbye!
No One Knows Why, No One All A
New Time, New Ways, New Thought, New Age
I'm Tired Of Waiting
I'm Tired Of Fighting
I'm Tired Of Waiting For Fucking Nothing
I'm Sick Of Lying
I'm Sick Of Trying
I'm Tired Of Waiting For Fucking Nothing
Tired Of Hating, Bored Of Dying
Tired Of Waking From The Dreams Of Morning
Sick Of Trying, Sick Of Whining
Tired Of Waking From The Dreams Of Morning
I'm Tired Of Waiting
I'm Tired Of Fighting
I'm Tired Of Waiting For Fucking Nothing
I'm Sick Of Lying
I'm Sick Of Trying
I'm Tired Of Waiting For Fucking Nothing
They're Underneath The Waves
They're Underneath The Waves
Underneath The Fucking Waves
They're Underneath The WavesEmbed
