Centipede LyricsSo what man?
So what?
It leaves me too low...
And it pushes me out
It leaves me behind
...all of my life
...all of my days
Your woman...
So what?
She leaves me in bed
And pushes me down
It leaves me behind
...all of my life
...all of my days
All that I'm going through
Your legs when these would do
...know when it's over
This "no one" left no one behind
Centipede
All of my life
All of my days
All that I'm going through
Your legs when these would do
Know when it's over
This "no one" left no one
This no one let no one
What you need is I, centipedeEmbed
