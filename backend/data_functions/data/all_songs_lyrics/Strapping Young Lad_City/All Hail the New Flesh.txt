All Hail the New Flesh LyricsHey man, I'm gonna fuck this shit up
No fear, no compromise -- I want it all
I will never be afraid
I'll die for what I believe
All of you assholes can stay rotting here
I do not care -- I will not be there
I have got to save myself
Don't tell me there's no-one else
And all you are is all you are
I'm so sorry for you -- sorry
So all hail the new flesh
'Cause it suits me fine
Just get away, you motherfuck
And we'll be back if you come
For what this means to me, you piece of shit
I'll see you pigs in hell
I want it all
I want it all, motherfucker
And all you are is all you are
I'm so sorry for you -- sorry
So all hail the new flesh
'Cause it suits me fine1Embed
