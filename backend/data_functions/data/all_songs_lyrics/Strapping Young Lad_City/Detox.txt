Detox LyricsPlay that stupid piece of shit!
(repeated:) Hey! You mo'!
I’ve got a feeling
With the wrong people
And I can't control my thoughts
I wish that I could sleep
And just get this over with
This is only high school bullshit
I was warned
Absolutely numb
No good around people
Everyone knows and watches me
How did I get here tonight?
What am I doing here?
How did I reach this state?
How did I lose my sight?
I’m lost
I’m freezing
And everybody knows
Everyone's watching
So here's
All my hopes and aspirations
Nothing but puke
God, I'm so lonely
“The human brain
An unbelievable complex of nerve cells
That turn sound vibrations into pleasure
Meanwhile the package of blood
One step at a time
Will continue to be independently
Even after it has been removed from the body”
I feel so alone (thought I’d try…)
Wait for… (thought I’d feel…)
Me!
How could I be such a stupid bastard?
Ah, you dumb bugger!

I just want to feel
I was warned
Absolutely numb
No good around people
Everyone knows and watches me1Embed
