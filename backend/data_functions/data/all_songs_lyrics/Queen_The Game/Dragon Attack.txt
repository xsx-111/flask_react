Dragon Attack Lyrics
Ooh, yeah
Ha, baby

Take me to the room
Where the red's all red
Take me out of my head
Is what I said, yeah, ow!
Hey, take me to the room
Where the green's all green
And from what I've seen
It's hot, it's-a mean, ay

I'm gonna use my stack
It's gotta be Mack
Gonna get me on the track
Got a dragon on my back

Take me to the room
Where the beat's all round
Gonna eat that sound
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take me to the room
Where the black's all white
And the white's all black
Take me back to the shack (shack)
She don't take no prisoners
She gonna give me the business
Got a dragon on my back
Hey, it's a dragon attack

Get down
Nice and slow
Hey, hey!
Alright, yeah!

Low down, she don't take no prisoners
Go down, gonna give me the business
No time, yeah chained to the rack!
Showtime, got a dragon on my back
Showdown, go find another customer
Slow down, I got to make my way
Oh, on my way, yeah
On my way, hey, alright4Embed
