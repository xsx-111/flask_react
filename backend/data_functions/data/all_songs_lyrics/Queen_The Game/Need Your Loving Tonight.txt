Need Your Loving Tonight Lyrics
Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey

No, I'll never look back in anger
No, I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much

I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

I don't wanna feel like a stranger, no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines

I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

I must be strong so she won't know
How much I miss her
I only hope as time
Goes on, I'll forget her
My body's aching, can't sleep at night
I'm too exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love
Love, love, love her
Come on baby, let's get together
I'll love you, baby, I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard, to stay away
What made you change, what did I say?

Ooh, I need your loving tonight
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving, baby, tonight
(Hit me)


Ooh, I need your loving tonight

No, I'll never, look back in anger
No, I'll never, find me an answer
Gave me no warning, how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget

Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving tonight7Embed
