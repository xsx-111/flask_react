Sail Away Sweet Sister Lyrics
Hey, little babe, you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
Ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way?

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you

Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
Ooh, you know I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free, yeah
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down
My friend, sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again

Hot child don't you know
You're young?
You've got your whole life
Ahead of you
Ooh aah, you can throw
It away too soon
Way too soon, yeah

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
Gonna love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you21Embed
