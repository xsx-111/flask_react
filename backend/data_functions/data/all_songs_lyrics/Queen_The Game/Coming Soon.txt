Coming Soon Lyrics
I get some headaches
When I hit the heights
Like in the morning
After crazy nights, yeah
Like some mother-in-law
In her nylon tights

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

You take them, the same old babies
With the same old toys
The neighbors screaming
When the noise annoys
Somebody nagging you
When you are out with the boys

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon. coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks
They're, they're
They're, tonight

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks2Embed
