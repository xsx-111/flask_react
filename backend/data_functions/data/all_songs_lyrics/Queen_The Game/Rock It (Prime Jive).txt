Rock It (Prime Jive) Lyrics
When I hear
That rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it is real rock and roll
Oh, rock and roll
When I hear
That rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it is real rock and roll
Oh, rock and roll
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You really think they like
To rock in space?
Well, I don't know, what do you know?
What do you hear
On the radio?
Coming through the air

I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I am alright, alright
Hey, c'mon baby, said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit
And come along with me
I said c'mon baby down
Come and rock with me
I said yeah

What do you do
To get to feel alive?
You go downtown
And get some of that prime jive

I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I am alright, alright

Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit
And come along with me
I said c'mon baby down
Come and rock with me
I said yeah
We're gonna rock it

Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit
And come along with me
I said c'mon baby down
Come and rock with me
I said yeah

We're gonna rock it
Ow, tonight
We want some prime jive
We want some prime jive
We are going to rock it tonight
Come on honey
Get some of that prime jive
Get some of that, get, get down
Come on honey
We are going to rock it tonight5Embed
