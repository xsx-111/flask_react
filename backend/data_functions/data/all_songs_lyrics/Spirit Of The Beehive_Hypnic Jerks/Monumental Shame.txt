Monumental Shame Lyrics

Three, four

Second place is only right
Sending love to you each night
You won the race, you did survive
Flickering into the holy light

Mouth the words you couldn't say
Your last regards, your will, whatever
Maybe I was young and crazy
Said "do you want to see the grave?"

Seal the image in your brain
Your stone's a monumental shame
Seal the image in your brain
Your stone's a monumental shameEmbed
