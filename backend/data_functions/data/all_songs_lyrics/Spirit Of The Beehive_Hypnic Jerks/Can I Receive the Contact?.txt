Can I Receive the Contact? Lyrics109 degrees in the shade
Draw the curtains and decease
It's okay in M.I.A
Petty piece of shit that I am
In Minnesota next to the van
I tried to understand
Everything is right where it should be
I don't need you and you don't need me
All is well
Burning up and setting ablaze
You're in a perfect unified haze
I've seen enough

Stop! That will be enough of that
Do you hear me? I said that will be enough of that
Stop! Stop!
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I receive the contact?
Can I?Embed
