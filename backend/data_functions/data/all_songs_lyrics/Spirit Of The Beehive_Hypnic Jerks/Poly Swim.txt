Poly Swim LyricsWater falls to my feet
Waiting for him on a back street
Static, heavy breathing
I'm sick, wanton, always
Chasing some new pleasure
(This will only bring you pain
The design to meant to stay the same)
I wanna take you to the party
(Marry me and weâ€™ll forget them all)
Light are your eyes that shine down on me
(Live the lie inside the ivory hall)
The car alarms outside your window
(Down the "every move we make" I stall)
My shaking hands that move down so slow
(Holding hands til fingers break and fall)
This will only bring you down
Maybe only silence is a boring soundEmbed
