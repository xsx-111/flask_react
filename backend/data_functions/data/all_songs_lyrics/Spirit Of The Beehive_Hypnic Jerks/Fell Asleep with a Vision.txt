Fell Asleep with a Vision LyricsI fell asleep with a vision
And I almost pulled it through
It was of progress but the audacity
I can't move
There was enough to commission them
Not a cent would go unused
A momentary distraction from our satanic youth
I'll peak on the light post
You go on and just
Just spike the vision
I'll put out of everything
And focus on it
Till the images blurEmbed
