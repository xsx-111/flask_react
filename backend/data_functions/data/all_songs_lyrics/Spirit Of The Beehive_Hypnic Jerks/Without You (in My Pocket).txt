Without You (in My Pocket) LyricsHow could I be so unlucky?
I was young
I had fun but I was in a tailspin
Come apart
A sweetheart with no future

Now that it's mine, the last time that I left here
(I can see the message forming at the door)
Speech so slurred and you turned to find nothing
(I don't feel compassion for you anymore)
Wash out my mouth, no more doubt, no more pacing
(When the audience applauses I can feel the hate)
Now that I know you won't go, I can die here
(I can feel the heat that the record made)
(Selling out MSG)
(Sell more and see audiences forming out in the street)
(When the mind is not working efficiently)
Kept you in my brain
Echoes back your name in the night
Paralyzed
(We sleep in the day)
(Fuck in the night)
(Smoke in the pool)
(What would I do without you in my pocket?)Embed
