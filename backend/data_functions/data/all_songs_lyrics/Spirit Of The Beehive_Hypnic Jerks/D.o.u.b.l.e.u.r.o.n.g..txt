D.o.u.b.l.e.u.r.o.n.g. Lyrics
Delicate was all this from the start
So easy to embarrass me in cars
In backseats and depart
Down the alley where the street is cracked
You've seen me make a funny face and go
A trail of you does show
When you took the posters off the wall
And boxed them up and didn't save them all
You couldn't even call
I submit this is the real me
I'm in someone else's head that's why it's wrong
I'm saying things all wrong
I'm doing things all wrong
Now everything is wrong
Now everything is wrong
Now everything is wrong
(d.o.u.b.l.e.u.r.o.n.g.)
I see no distraction
The wrong is always there
(d.o.u.b.l.e.u.r.o.n.g.)
I see no commitment
The wrong can be repaired
(d.o.u.b.l.e.u.r.o.n.g.)
I see no distraction
The wrong is always there
(d.o.u.b.l.e.u.r.o.n.g.)
I see no commitment
The wrong can be repaired
(d.o.u.b.l.e.u.r.o.n.g.)
I see no distinction
The wrong is all we haveEmbed
