Mantra Is Repeated Lyrics

Society made him
A mantra is repeated at length
And echoes for a million years until another guy
Comes to fuck it up
It's perfect
You hate it
That side was well explained
The mantra does not remain the same
It hears itself and covers up

He says "It's right on track"
He says "It's right on track"
The words do not complete the act at all
He says "It's right on track"
He says "It's right on track"
The words do not complete the act at all

The TV is not on
We all need television
But I can't go to work 'cause baby I'm too tired
I sit on the prospect
Let it not all affect me
I can't make it work but I believe that I tried
He says "It's coming back"
He says "It's coming back"
The words I don't believe at all
He says "It's coming back"
He says "It's coming back"
The words I don't believe at all

He says "It's coming back"
He says "It's coming back"
The words I don't believe at allEmbed
