Brando Lyrics
You told me to skip school
To go with you to the movies
You knew you were uncool
But you thought you could fool me
They play oldies in the afternoon
For the elderly and me and you
Fred and Ginger, black and white
I watch you watch It's a Wonderful Life

You called me cerebral
I didn't know what you meant
But now I do, would it have killed you
To call me pretty instead?
I'm in a second-story window
And you're yelling at me, "Stella!"
And I'm laughing 'cause you think you're Brando
But you'll never come close

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did
You say, "Here's lookin' at you, kid"
Thinking I wouldn't understand the reference
You admit, you think we're fated
I'll be lucky if I'm your third wife
That's only something you would say in the car
We've been breathing the same air for too long
If the snow wasn't coming down so hard
I would open the door and walk home
It's only a couple miles
What could go wrong
If I hitch a ride with a guy in a pickup
Who doesn't know left from right from wrong?

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did
All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did3Embed
