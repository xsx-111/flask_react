Hot & Heavy Lyrics
Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

Led me to the floor even though I'm not a dancer
Asked me all the questions that your parents wouldn't answer
How could I deny a diamond in the rough?
You let me in your world until you had enough
You knew that I wanted you to bend the rules
How did I believe I had a hold on you?
You were always stronger than people suspected
Underestimated and overprotected
When I went away, it was the only option
Couldn't trust myself to proceed with caution
The most that I could give to you was nothing at all
The best that I could offer was to miss your calls

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start
And it happens over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
I wish I was over it, over it, over it, over it

A hidden gem, my own goldmine
You had the wide and wild eyes
You were a secret to yourself
You couldn't keep from anyone else
Now you're the biggest, brightest flame
You are a fire that can't be tamed
You're better than ever, but I knew you when
It's bittersweet to see you again2Embed
