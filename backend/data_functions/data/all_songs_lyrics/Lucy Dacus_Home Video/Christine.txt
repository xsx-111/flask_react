Christine Lyrics
You're falling asleep
On my shoulder in the back of your boyfriend's car
We're coming home
From a sermon saying how bent and evil we are
I try to imagine what you're dreaming
You're muttering nonsense between steady breathing
I have to wake you up to get out
Your man waves from the end of the drive 'til I'm in the house

He can be nice, sometimes
Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind
All in all, nobody's perfect
Therе may be better, but you don't feel worth it
That's whеre we disagree

You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
Maybe they'll grow up and never make the same mistakes
Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another
I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother

But if you get married, I'd object
Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
I'd rather lose my dignity
Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy4Embed
