First Time Lyrics
Broke into the screened-in porch
Now I'm crawling through the dog door
I may let you see me on my knees
But you'll never see me on all fours
Drooling on the tile
I'm a starfish on the kitchen floor
Catch my breath to breathe your name
I am just the fool you took me for, uh-huh

You can't feel it for the first time a second time
You can't feel it for the first time a second time

You gave me your hands
'Cause you didn't know what to do with them
And I showed you the way
Even though I'd never been
Where did we go right?
I think about it all the time
If I had paid closer attеntion
Maybe I could take us back to therе and then

But you can't feel it for the first time a second time
You can't feel it for the first time a second time
I can't go back to who I was before I met you
I can't undo what I've done, and I wouldn't want to
I wouldn't want to
I wouldn't want to
Sneaking out of the house
I must be out of my mind
I'm running out of excuses
We're running out of time
You say the love will come and go
We'll learn to ride the ebb and flow
You always leave before the light
Come back same time and place the next night

And how will I know
If history repeats itself?
How will I know
When it's gonna come back around?
How will I know?
Has my face changed, baby?
How will I know?
I'll stay ready for you to take me, take me, take me
Take meEmbed
