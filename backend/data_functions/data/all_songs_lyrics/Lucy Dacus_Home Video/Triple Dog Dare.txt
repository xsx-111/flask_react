Triple Dog Dare Lyrics
I'm not tired yet
We still got a lot to figure out
Like what was the end of the movie about, anyways?
You're yawning on your couch
I wonder if I overstayed my welcome
Until you asked me if I'd like to take a walk
We're going to the five and dime
The only open place at this time of night
You're dancing in the aisle 'cause the radio
Is singing you a song you know
And the kid at the counter is gawking at your grace
I can tell what he's thinking by the look on his face
It's not his fault, I'm sure I look thе same
It's what you do, but it's not you I blame

Your mama read my palm
Shе wouldn't tell me what it was she saw
But after that, you weren't allowed to spend the night
I'm staring at my hands
Red, ruddy skin, I don't understand
How did they betray me? What did I do?
I never touched you how I wanted to
What can I say to your mom to let you come outside?
You know I'll be seeking if you run and hide
If the door were to open, would you walk through the frame?
If you're too afraid, it won't be you I blame
You passed a note in class
Told me to meet you at the overpass
Your lip was trembling when you said that we are cursed
You're trying not to cry
When you tell me you're afraid that we may die
I said "So what? Everybody's scared of that"
I want you to tell me that you miss me
Want you to hold and hurt and kiss me
I wanna run away and live on your family's boat
It's a triple dog dare, you're a chicken if you don't
I can fish for our food and you know how to start a flame
If you don't get out now, you'll only have yourself to blame

You said, "You have me there
If it's a triple dog dare"
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
They put our faces on the milk jugs
Missing children 'til they gave up
Your mama was right, and through the grief
Can't fight the feeling of relief
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now5Embed
