Partner In Crime Lyrics
When I asked you to coffee
Could you tell I don't drink it?
When I got to the café
Could you tell what I was thinking?
My heart's on my sleeve, it's embarrassing
The pulpy thing, beating

When you asked my age, I lied
I saw relief dawn on your eyes
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own

Knee-deep in the city that never sleeps
I lay down in the middle of the street
Lamplight like parallel suns
Crowding out the early morning stars
Concrete holding heat from the daytime
Picking petals to see if you will be mine

Do you lovе me? Do you love me not?
Do you lovе me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
You were my partner in crime
It was a welcome waste of time
Eating cherries on the bridge, feet dangling
Throwing the pits and stems into the racing current below
I get vertigo looking down and looking in

Drop me off at the curb by my curfew
Around the corner so nobody sees you
You drop a hint that you got a girlfriend
I tried my best not to take it
I wanna run my fingers through you
You say nobody understands you like I do

But do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?
Do you love me? Do you love me not?Embed
