After All LyricsPlease trip them gently, they don't like to fall
Oh by jingo
There's no room for anger, we're all very small
Oh by jingo
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts
From the skies, from paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them, they're just taller children
That's all
After all
Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown
Oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down
Oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children
That's all
After all
I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred
We're nobody's children
At all
After all
Live till your rebirth and do what you will
Oh by jingo
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill
Oh by jingo

After all, after all1Embed
