Mr. Grieves Lyrics
Hope everything is all right
Hope everything is all right

What's that floating in the water?
Oh, Neptuna's only daughter
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Do you have another opinion? 
You can cry, you can mope
But can you swing from a good good rope?
Oh, I believe in Mr. Grieves 


Got fallen, got frozen
Got finally up to the finally dozing
I believe in Mr. Grieves Embed
