Blind Lyrics
I seen a girl
With a guy
Her hair like yours
From what I remember
He took her hand
And smiled her name
Her face like yours
She smiled the same
From what I remember

Been so long since last December

She walked your walk
She talked like you
She shimmered strong
She shined right through
From what I remember
I said I
I said I, seen a girl
With a guy
So who I seen?
So who am I?
Now I can't remember
Been so long since last December
It's been so long since last December

So I'm sending
Open letter to the perfect girlfriend
I'm still, mighty, tiny
Hoping that you'd be my little godsend
Cause right now, I'll take any, and blindly, and
Before I find another noose to fit us
Before we choose another hand to hit us

Let us ask each other
What's the difference?
Cause if you save yourself
I'll save you all the time
Open letter to the legions leering
Oh, are we entertained yet?
Why don't you cast your gaze into the moonlit clearing?

Cause my love
My love is a sucker bet
Before we find another noose to fit us
From what I remember
Before we choose another hand to hit us
Let us ask each other
What's the problem?
Why don't you save yourself
I'll save you all the time
Because if you save yourself
I'll save you all the time
I was struck blind
Save yourself, I'll save you all the time
I was struck blind
Save yourself, I'll save you all the time Embed
