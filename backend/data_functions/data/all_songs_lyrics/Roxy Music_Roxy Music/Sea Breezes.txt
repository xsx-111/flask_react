Sea Breezes LyricsI've been thinking now for a long time
How to go my own separate way
It's a shame to think about yesterday
It's a shame, a shame, it's a shame
(Chorus)
We've been running round in our present state
Hoping help will come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes in love
In love, in love
Now that we are lonely
Life seems to get hard
Alone what a word lonely
Alone it makes me cry
Thought-train set in motion
Wheels in and around
Express our emotion
Tracks up then it cracks down
(Chorus)
We've been running round in our present state
Hoping help will come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes in love
In love, in love1Embed
