Ladytron LyricsYou've got me girl on the run around, run around
Got me all around town
You've got me girl on the run around
And it's getting me down, getting me down
Lady if you want to find a lover then you look no further
For I'm gonna be your only
Searching at the start of the season and my only reason
Is that I'll get to you
I'll find some way of connection, hiding my intention
Then I'll move up close to you
I'll use you and I'll confuse you and then I'll lose you
Still you won't suspect meEmbed
