Re-Make/Re-Model LyricsI tried but I could not find a way
Looking back all I did was look away
 Next time is the best time we all know 
But if there is no next time where to go, go?
Go, go! Go, go! Go, go! Go, go!
She's the sweetest queen I've ever seen
 (CPL593H) 
See here she comes, see what I mean?
(CPL593H)
I could talk talk talk, talk myself to death
But I believe I would only waste my breath
Ooh, show me
I tried but I could not find a way
Looking back all I did was look away
 Next time is the best time we all know 
But if there is no next time where to go, go?
Go, go! Go, go! Go, go! Go, go!
She's the sweetest queen I've ever seen
 (CPL593H) 
See here she comes, see what I mean?
(CPL593H)
I could talk talk talk, talk myself to death
But I believe I would only waste my breath1Embed
