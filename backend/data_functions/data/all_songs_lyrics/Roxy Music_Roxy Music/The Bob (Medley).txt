The Bob (Medley) LyricsI dreamed last night about your face
Your star shone all night
Over the moon it shone brighter
Star shining so bright
You were so pure not for this world
So gentle and light
How could I hear their stories?
They told me not right
Too many times beautiful
Too many times sad
Too many times wonderful
Too bad

"But when the party was over, and all was quiet and still
We walked together in moonlight and looked down over the calm lake
Hand in hand, the stars in our eyes."
So in my dream you still loved me
Gave time reason last night
But this was only life's story
Made simple that's rightEmbed
