Virginia Plain Lyrics
Make me a deal and make it straight
All signed and sealed, I'll take it
To Robert E. Lee I'll show it
I hope and pray he don't blow it, 'cause
We've been around a long time
Just try try try try tryin' to make make the big time

Take me on a roller coaster
Take me for an airplane ride
Take me for a six day wonder
But don't you throw don't you throw my pride aside besides
What's real and make believe?
Baby Jane's in Acapulco, we are flying down to Rio

Throw me a line, I'm sinking fast
Clutching at straws, can't make it
Havana sound we're trying
A hard edge, a hipster jiving, ohh
Last picture show's down the drive-in
You're so sheer, you're so chic, teenage rebel of the week

Flavours of the mountain streamline
Midnight blue casino floors
Dance the Cha-Cha through till sunrise
Opens up exclusive doors, oh wow!
Just like flamingoes look the same
So me and you, just we two, got to search for something new
Far beyond the pale horizon
Some place near the desert strand
And where my Studebaker takes me
That's where I'll make my stand, but wait!
Can't you see her Holzer mane?
What's her name?
