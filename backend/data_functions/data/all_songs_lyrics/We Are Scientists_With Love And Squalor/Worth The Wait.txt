Worth The Wait LyricsIf I had one shread of common sense I would have already left
Don't ask how long I've been waiting here, yeah you can probably guess
Tracing the arc of the hour hand, this clock's incredibly slow
You ask how long I've been waiting here, I think you already know
Cause I've been hanging out and counting down the time that I've been wasting
I've been holding on for way too long, you're always worth the wait though I guess
Measuring time by the bottle, and I've had more than a few
I'm standing up to get outta here, I'm standing up for myself now and this is long overdue
There ain't no two ways about it, I can't keep letting this go
You ask how long I've been waiting here, I think you already know
Cause I've been hanging out and counting down the time that I've been wasting
I've been holding on for way too long, you're always worth the wait though
And a promise ain't a promise if you know you're gonna break it
I've been holding on for way too long, you're always worth the wait though I guess
Well I keep hanging out and counting down the time that I've been wasting
I've been holding on for way too long, you're always worth the wait though
And a promise ain't a promise if you know you're gonna break it
I've been holding on for way too long, you're always worth the wait though I guessEmbed
