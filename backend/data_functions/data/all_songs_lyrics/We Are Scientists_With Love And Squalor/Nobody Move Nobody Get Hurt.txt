Nobody Move Nobody Get Hurt LyricsThe day you move I'm probably going to explode
It's true, I'm probably going to explode
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
You'll pray for proof; I'm probably making this up
It's true, I'm probably making this up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Because my body is your body
I won't tell anybody
If you want to use my body
Go for it, yeah
My body is your body
I won't tell anybody
If you want to use my body
Go for it, yeah
Go for it, yeah
If no one moves, then nobody's going to get hurt
Don't move 'cause nobody wants to get hurt
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
You'll pray for proof; I'm probably making this up
It's true, I'm probably making this up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Because my body is your body
I won't tell anybody
If you want to use my body
Go for it, yeah
My body is your body
I won't tell anybody
If you want to use my body
Go for it, yeah
Go for it, yeah
Because my body is your body
I won't tell anybody
If you want to use my body
Go for it, yeah
My body is your body
And I'm not just anybody
If you want to use my body
Go for it, yeah
Go for it, yeah2Embed
