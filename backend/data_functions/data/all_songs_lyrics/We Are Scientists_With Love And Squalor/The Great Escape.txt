The Great Escape Lyrics
Making my escape
Making my escape
Tell myself that everything's in shape
Everything's in shape
But me
How long can this take?
How long can this take?
Tell myself that everything is great
Everything is great
Well, how am I doin'?

I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
While everything is adding up, up, up
Everything is adding up, up, up

Breaking both my hands
Breaking both my hands
Telling me to take it like a man
Take it like a man
I can't
I don't understand
I don't understand
Please repeat whatever you just said
Nothing's making sense
Well, how am I doin'?

I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
While everything is adding up, up, up
Everything is adding up, up, up

They're breaking both my hands
They're breaking both my hands
They're telling me to take it like a man
Take it like a man
Well fuck that
I don't understand
Said I don't understand
Said please repeat whatever you just said
'Cause nothing's making sense
Well, how am I doin'?
I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
I got a great idea
I'm gonna wait right here
While everything is adding up, up, up
Everything is adding up, up, up1Embed
