Textbook LyricsFalling over backwards for you
Fawning over everybody else
I put myself in that position
Every single time I have the chance
I know it's not my business
To be digging up these things
I should have known
Twenty years of bad decisions
Haven't taught me much at all
Separate events you're making
Everyone pretend it's not your fault
And all of this offense you're taking
Doesn't really bother me at all
Twist my arm, 'cause that's the way you think you're gonna work this whole thing out
You know you own my body, but don't think that you control my mouth
Having every question answered
Isn't gonna help at all
Having every question answered
Isn't gonna help at all
Having every question answered
Isn't gonna help at all
Having every question answered
Doesn't help
When you're not supposed to know
You're not supposed to know
You're not supposed to know
Anything
Another textbook situation
Everything I think I know I've read
What's the point of medication?
Only makes me wish that I were dead
It's pretty clear the truth I mean
It's written here on every single page
I'm smitten but not stupid
I can read it all over your face
Having every question answered
Isn't gonna help at all
Having every question answered
Isn't gonna help at all
Having every question answered
Isn't gonna help at all
Having every question answered
Doesn't help
When you're not supposed to know
You're not supposed to know
You're not supposed to know
Anything
You're not supposed to know
