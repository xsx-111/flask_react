Lousy Reputation Lyrics
Why do I keep finding myself so surprised?
The qualities you openly have advertised
A bigger man might not feel quite so compromised
But I've never been a saint and I won't start tonight

It's burning me up, I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me off
I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me

I've heard some things I guess it's better not to know
It's pretty bad as far as first impressions go
A bigger man could probably get past it all
Oh the problem here is that I just won't grow up, so what

It's burning me up, I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me off
I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me-

Off, off, off
Off, off, off
Off, off, off
Off, off, off
It's burning me up, I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me off
I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me off
I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me off
I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me offEmbed
