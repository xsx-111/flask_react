Callbacks LyricsI guess that I should probably leave right now
'Cause I'm already kinda sweaty and freakin' out
I gotta time-bomb headache that's ticking down
I guess that everything is better when I'm not around
It's all outta context
There's nothing I'm into
Call it a complex
It's really quite simple
I'm tired of these hang-ups
I wish someone would call me back
How 'bout it?
Well my tongue is tired and I'm seeing stars
I got a million ugly words for what you are
I gotta busted back and a broken heart
I guess everything is better wherever you are
It's all outta context
There's nothing I'm into
Call it a complex
It's really quite simple
I'm tired of these hang-ups
I wish someone would call me back
How 'bout it?
It's all about context
There's nothing I'm into
Call it a complex
It's really quite simple
I'm tired of these hang ups
I wish someone would call me back
I said that I'm so sorry to bring you down
I guess that everything's better when I'm not around
I'm so sorry to bring you down
I guess that everything's better when I'm not around
And I'm so sorry to bring you down
I guess that everything's better when I'm not aroundEmbed
