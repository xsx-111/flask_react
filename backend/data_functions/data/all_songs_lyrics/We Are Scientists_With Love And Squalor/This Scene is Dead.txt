This Scene is Dead Lyrics
This scene is dead but I'm still restless
An hour or so until last call, I guess
I shouldn't even be here, much less
Drinking myself into excess
I'm not going home until I'm done

Come on, get gone
Come on, get gone
Come on, you can't go home
The night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been fun

Well, everything's another excuse
To keep from doing what I want to
Like, I would really love to kiss you
But I guess I'm in no condition
I'm not going home with no one

Come on, get gone
Come on, get gone
Come on, you can't go home
The night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been fun
I said that's it
I'm not going home with no one
I'm not going home with no one
I'm not going home with no one

Come on, get gone
Come on, get gone
Come on, you can't go home
The night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been fun
You can't go home, the night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been fun1Embed
