Inaction Lyrics
Call on the fates, this'll take a second
While I fall on my face, like everyone else
And we can talk all we want, but all I can say
Is that I'm sorry, yeah I'm sorry
But I'm never gonna do it again

Counting on my relevant friends
When this keeps coming up again and again
If everybody knows how it's gonna end
Why doesn't someone stop me?
Because I'm sick of waking up on your floor
For the sixth or seventh night in a row
I'm lying next to you in all of my clothes
Someone stop me

It's hard to rely on the rhythm section
When they're all packing up and they're heading for the exit
Yeah, we're all about the same, a bunch of slaves to fashion
Who are tall, dark and scared and just praying for some action
How am I supposed to know what makes this happen?
(How am I supposed to know what makes this happen?)
How am I supposed to know what makes this happen?
(How am I supposed to know what makes this happen?)
I'm counting on my relevant friends (inaction)
Cause this keeps coming up again and again (inaction)
If everybody knows how it's gonna end (inaction)
Why doesn't someone stop me? (inaction)
Because I'm sick of waking up on your floor (inaction)
For the sixth or seventh night in a row (inaction)
I'm lying next to you in all of my clothes
Someone stop me
I can't keep counting on my relevant friends (inaction)
Cause this keeps coming up again and again (inaction)
If everybody knows how its gonna end (inaction)
Why doesn't someone stop me? (inaction)
Because I'm sick of waking up on your floor (inaction)
For the sixth or seventh night in a row (inaction)
I'm lying next to you in all of my clothes
Someone stop me1Embed
