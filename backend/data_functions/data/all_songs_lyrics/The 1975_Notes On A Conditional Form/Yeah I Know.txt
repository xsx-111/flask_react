Yeah I Know Lyrics
Pick a card
Yeah, I know
Time feels like it's changed, I don't feel the same
Live on Mars
Fuck it up
Emas eht leef t'nod I, degnahc s'ti ekil sleef emiT

Stop the tube
Kick the head

(Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit)
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit

Pick a card
Yeah, I know
Time feels like it's changed, I don't feel the same
Try your best
Yeah, I know
Emas eht leef t'nod I-I-I ,--s'ti ekil sleef emiT
(Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit)

Hit that shit, go hit that shit
Hit that shit, go hit that shit
