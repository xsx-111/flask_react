Nothing Revealed / Everything Denied Lyrics
Life feels like a lie, I need something to be true
Is there anybody out there?
Life feels like there's something missing, maybe it's you
Is there anybody out there?

I never fucked in a car, I was lying
I do it on my bed, lying down, not trying
Apathy for me is an issue, you see
I just talk about the things upsetting me
And I get somewhere, I don't like it
Get somewhere, change my mind, eh
Get somewhere but don't find it
I don't find what I'm looking for

Yes, and if they catch you slippin'
Trippin' over your fibbing and elicit
A ribbing over how they think you should be livin'
That's life, kind of, maybe take some time off
You can't live in denial of setting it right
Because if nothing is revealed, everything denied
Learn up yourself before you talk it
They need to see you walk it
You don't fuck with your poor fans
You need the rich ones to expand your floor plans
You can't figure out a heart, you were lying
You're doin' in my head with your non-stop trying
Never gettin' sleep and forgettin' to eat
I pretend that all these things agree with me
And I get somewhere but don't like it
Get somewhere, change my mind, eh
Get somewhere but don't find it (Find it, find it, find it)
I don't find what I'm looking for

Life feels like a lie, I need something to be true
Is there anybody out there?
Life feels like there's something missing, maybe it's you
Is there anybody out there?

Life feels like a lie, I need something to be true
Is there anybody out there?
Life feels like there's something missing, maybe it's you
Is there anybody out there? (Out there)12Embed
