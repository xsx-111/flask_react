Then Because She Goes Lyrics
You are mine, I’ve been drowning in you
You fracture light again
Beautiful, please don't cry, I love you
When you leave, I cry on the inside

I wake up, love you, so I love you, so I say I love you, love you, love you
Cry
I wake up, love you, love you, love you, love you
We're supposed to leave by half-past eight
You wait for a bit

Pissed again, I've been dying to meet you
You fracture light again (I love you)
I love you, oh, I love you
When you leave, I cry on the inside

Oh, so I love this, I love you, so love you, love you, love you, love you
Cry
I will love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
We're supposed to leave by half-past eight
Will you stay or wait?4Embed
