Roadkill Lyrics
Well, I touch down and run to my connection
Man in the gift shop called me a fag
I feel up my tucked-up erection
There's a pressure all over my head
And I know this is how I get paid, but
It's not really how I wanna get laid, so
Hundred forty when I last got weighed
And I'm gonna lose more by Saturday

And they're playing your song on the radio station
Mugging me off all across the nation
If you don't eat, then you'll never grow
I should've learnt that quite a while ago
I know it gets hard sometimes
Making out with people that you don't like
I know you don't feel alright
But you look just fine to me

Well, I pissed myself on a Texan intersection
With George spilling things all over his bag
And I took shit for being quiet during the election
And maybe that's fair, but I'm a busy guy
I get stoned and go where I get paid, but
It's not really how babies get made, so
I'll take a minute when I think I won't die from stopping
Oh, I'm just a busy guy
And they're playing your song on the radio station
Mugging me off all across the nation
If you don't shoot, then you'll never know
You should've learnt that quite a while ago
I know it gets hard sometimes
Taking out your shit on the ones you like
You know, I didn't feel alright
Until you spoke to me

You, I've been waiting for you
My whole life, waiting for you
I've been waiting for you

Well, I'm gonna get a gun but it's for my protection
Or maybe I'll get myself a fun knife8Embed
