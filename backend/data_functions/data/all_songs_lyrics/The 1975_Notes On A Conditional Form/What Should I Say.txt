What Should I Say Lyrics
They're calling out your name
Must have been something you were saying
They're calling out your name
What should I say?
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
They're calling out your name
Must have been something you changed
They're calling out your name
What should I say? What should I say?

(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
What should I say?
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)

What did you say?
Tell 'em that all the people made me
What did you say?
Tell 'em that Ambien makes me crazy
What did you say?
Tell 'em again, tell 'em that thing that you told me
What should I say? What should I say?
What should I say? What should I say?
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
What should I say?

They're calling out your name (Out your name)
Must have been something you were saying
(Must have been something you were saying)
They're calling out your name (Out your name)
What should I say? (What should I say?)
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
Disorder, hate, and fame (And fame)
Making sure that people won't change
Disorder, hate, and fame
What should I say? What should I say?

What should I say?
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
What should I say?

What should I say?
What should I say?8Embed
