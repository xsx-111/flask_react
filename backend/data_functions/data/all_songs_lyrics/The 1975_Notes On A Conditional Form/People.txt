People Lyrics
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's Monday morning and we've only got a thousand of them left
Well, I know it feels pointless and you don't have any money
We're all just gonna try our fucking best
Well, my generation wanna fuck Barack Obama
Living in a sauna with legal marijuana

Well, girls, food, gear
I don't like going outside, so bring me everything here
(Hey, woo, yeah, that's right)

People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We are appalling and we need to stop just watching shit in bed
And I know it sounds boring and we like things that are funny
But we need to get this in our fucking heads
The economy's a goner, republic's a banana, ignore it if you wanna

Fuck it, I'm just gonna get girls, food, gear
I don't like going outside, so bring me everything here
(Hey, woo, yeah)

People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids31Embed
