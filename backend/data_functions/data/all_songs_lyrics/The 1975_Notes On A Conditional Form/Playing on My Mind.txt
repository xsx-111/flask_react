Playing on My Mind Lyrics
Will I live and die in a band?
My consciousness controls my hand
She can't swim very well
(No, but you wouldn’t be able to tell)
Let's find something to watch, then watch our phones for half the time
When we go for food, you have yours and I'll have mine
It says, "Don’t take these pills if you've been drinking any wine"
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
These things, they have been playing on my mind

I think I've seen the side of every road
They all lead somewhere, I've been told
Will I get divorced when I'm old?
(Oh, why am I always cold?)
And I met one of your friends, and it was dead nice
He was fine, but he said
"Things that interest me exist outside of space and time"
Now, I know I should've left it, but who says that? What a sigh
It all kicked off and it's been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind

I think it's strange that I still call you
When I’ve got nothing to say
The truth is that I still adore you
And nothing really matters anyway
But I won’t get clothes online 'cause I get worried about the fit
But that rule don’t apply concerning my relationships
See, I keep getting this stuff wrong, take me out, put me on
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind
Oh, it's all been just playing on my mind11Embed
