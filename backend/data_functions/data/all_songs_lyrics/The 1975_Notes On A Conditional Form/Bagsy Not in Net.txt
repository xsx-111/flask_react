Bagsy Not in Net Lyrics
This feeling, it's something when you call me
I'm dealing in death and being lonely
Try it, don't like it
And leaving you here is the thing that I fear, so I fight it

Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?

I'm reeling, I know that I'm appalling
But this feeling, it could be our calling
Not dying, no, just lying
Seeing you here is the moment it's clear 'cause I'm crying

Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?5Embed
