Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America Lyrics
I'm in love with Jesus Christ
He's so nice
I'm in love, I'll say it twice
I'm in love (I'm in love)

I'm in love, but I'm feeling low
For I am just a footprint in the snow
I'm in love with a boy I know
But that's a feeling I can never show

Fortunately, I believe, lucky me
I'm searching for planes in the sea, and that's irony
Soil just needs water to be, and a seed
So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves?

Ooh
Ooh

I'm in love with the girl next door
Her name's Claire
Nice when she comes 'round to call
Then masturbate the second she's not there
Fortunately, I believe, lucky me
Searching for planes in the sea, and that's irony
Soil just needs water to be, and a seed
So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves?

Ooh
