Tonight (I Wish I Was Your Boy) Lyrics
I tell you I can visualise it all
Too real it all seems
But once again, runnin' away with me
Once again‚ runnin' away with me
This couldn't be a dream
Runnin' away with me
Runnin' away with me

And I stop myself for a minute
See if my heart's still in it
Say a few things just to win it
Funny how it works out‚ innit?

And I told her‚ "Some things have their time
How can I be yours if you're not mine?"
She said, "They should take this pain
And give it a name"

Tonight, I wish I was your boy
(Run away from me‚ run away from me)
I (Run away from me, run away from me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me‚ run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)
Give yourself a new name
Change your voice on the train
Have her complain about your fame
Tell me that it's all a rigged game

She told me, "Some things just take time
How can you be sure if you won't try?"
She said, "I guess I'll take this pain
Instead of your name"

Tonight, I wish I was your boy
(Run away from me, run away from me)
I (Run away from me, run away from me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)

And it's been replaying on my mind
Unfortunately, I've been to this place in my life
Far too many times
Sunday's nearly over, so I'll just lie awake
Tonight, I wish I was your boy, I
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
And tonight, I wish I was your boy
(Run away from me, run away from me)
I (Run away from me, run away from me, runnin' away with me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me, runnin' away with me)

Runnin' away with me
Runnin' away with me11Embed
