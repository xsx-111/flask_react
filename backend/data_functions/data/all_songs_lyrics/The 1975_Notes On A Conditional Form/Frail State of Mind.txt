Frail State of Mind Lyrics
(Frail state of mind)
(Frail state of mind)

Go outside?
Seems unlikely
I'm sorry that I missed your call (Missed your call)
I watched it ring (Ring)
"Don't waste their time"
I've always got a (Frail state of mind)

"Oh, boy, don't cry"
I'm sorry, but I
I always get this way sometimes (Way sometimes)
Oh, I'll just leave
I'll save you time
I'm sorry 'bout my (Frail state of mind)

(Frail state of mind)

"Stay at mine
You might just like it
Might stop you being miserable" (Miserable)
Nah, I'm alright
Nah, trust I'm fine
Just dealing with a (Frail state of mind)
"Oh, don't be shy"
I'm sorry, but I
I always get this way sometimes (Way sometimes)
You lot just leave
I'll stay behind
I'm sorry 'bout my (Frail state of mind)

(Frail state of mind)
(Frail state of mind)
(Frail state of mind)
(Frail state of mind)

Oh, what's the vibe?
I wouldn't know, I
I'm normally in bed at this time (Bed at this time)
You guys, go do your thing
And I'll just leave at nine
Don't wanna bore you with my frail state of mind
"Oh, winner, winner, that's your biggest lie
I'm sure that you're fine"
I haven't told a lie in quite some time (Quite some time)
"You know we'll leave if you keep lying
Don't lie behind your (Frail state of mind)"
(Frail state of mind)
(Frail state of mind)
(Frail state of mind)
(Frail state of mind)15Embed
