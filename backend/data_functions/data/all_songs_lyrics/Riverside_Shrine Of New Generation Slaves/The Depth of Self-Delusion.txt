The Depth of Self-Delusion Lyrics
I could be foreign forever to your otherland
I could be foreign forevermore to your promiseland
One life was great, but another…
No, I don't want to live on the edge
I won't follow you
I found my own
I will stay

I could be foreign forever to your hastenland
I could be foreign forevermore to your neverland
One little brick, then another
And I will build that wall anyway
You can find me there
Rested and calm, without mask
This is where I will stay

Look around where we are who we are
What we always want
Twenty-four, seven, three sixty-five
Sometimes little more
I was chasing your shadow
Not knowing I'd become your slave
I could be foreign forever to your otherland
I could be foreign forevermore to your promiseland
One life was great, but another…
No, I don't want to live on the edge
I won't follow you
I found my own
I will stay
I could stay forevermore

I've said a farewell to never-ending smiles
I did not look good in red
From my place, I can finally see
How much of this shade I called myself was me
And what was left behind

I could be foreign forever to your otherland
I could be foreign forevermore to your promiseland
One life was great, but another…
No, I don't want to live on the edge
I won't follow you
I found my own
I will stay
I could stay forevermore
I've said a farewell to never-ending smiles
From my place, I can finally see
How much of this shade was me
And what was left behindEmbed
