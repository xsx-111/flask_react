Celebrity Touch LyricsI can't afford to be silent
I can't afford to lose my stand
What matters is to be in view
I'm seen therefore I am
I can satisfy my hunger
I can satisfy my thirst
What about the feeling of importance
Now I've got my chance
This is just what I need to be in everyone's eyes
To be hard-wired to all brains and control all their minds, oh
In the center of attention
TV, glossy magazines
My private life is public
I sell everything
Days are getting shorter
They'll forget about me soon
So I jump on the bandwagon
With no taboos
This is just what I need to be in everyone's eyes
To be hard-wired to all brains and control all their minds, oh
But what if we start to talk, not only say out loud
What if we sift the babble from what really counts
What if we disappear, go deeply underground
What if we hide away from being stupified
You and I
Thousand eyes
You and I
Thousand eyes
This is just what I need to be in everyone's eyes
To be hard-wired to all brains and control all their minds, oh
But what if we start to talk, not only say out loud
What if we sift the babble from what really counts
What if we disappear, go deeply underground
What if we hide away from being stupified
You and I
Thousand eyes
You and IEmbed
