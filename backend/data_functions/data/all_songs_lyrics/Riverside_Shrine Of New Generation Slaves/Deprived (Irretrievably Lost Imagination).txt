Deprived (Irretrievably Lost Imagination) LyricsI live surrounded by
Cherished memories
I have a weakness for
Collecting them alphabetize
As far as I recall
My childish rituals
Icons of that world
Always filled my shelves and heart
Now I shelter from the rain
Hole up in my cage
You don't have to think too much today
They filled in for your brain
Curled up
Deprived
Curled up
Deprived
I shut
Away
In a world of synonyms
And handwritten notes
My own puppet performances
Endless bedtime stories
I could touch the moon
And switch off the sun
I could have my dreams
And dream about better times
Now I shelter from the rain
Hole up in my cage
You don't have to think too much today
They filled in for your brain
Curled up
Deprived
Curled up
Deprived
I shut
Away
Curled up
Deprived
Curled up
Deprived
I shut
Away
Please don't call my nameEmbed
