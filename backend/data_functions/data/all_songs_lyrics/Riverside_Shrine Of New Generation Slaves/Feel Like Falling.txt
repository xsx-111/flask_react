Feel Like Falling LyricsDay outside grows black
I lie faceup in my shell
Squeeze my eyes shut and feel like falling into blank space
Had allowed that life to drift
For I've chosen a different trail
When light fades
I feel like falling into blank space
So you realized, ingested real life
Grew up in the time of pushing through the crowds
So you realized, chose unreal life
Settled in the mobile handy pocket size
Want to be your light
Illuminate your smiles
Want to be your cure
Bridge between self and us
Want to be your prayer
Wipe the tears from your eyes
But I turned my back
Could have been a tree of dawn
Rooted deeply in the ground
Bearing fruits far away from falling into blank space
But I took refuge from myself
In the crowded solitude
Now I dash and feel like falling into blank space
Want to be your light
Illuminate your smiles
Want to be your cure
Bridge between self and us
Want to be your prayer
Wipe the tears from your eyes
But I turned my back
Got lost insideEmbed
