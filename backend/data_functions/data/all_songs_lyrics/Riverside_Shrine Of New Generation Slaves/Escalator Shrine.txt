Escalator Shrine LyricsWe are escalator walkers
In the brand-new temple
Came to reshape identities
Shed our skins
Be reborn and feel the same
Feel the same: that no one here is real
We are moving standees
In the shrine of choices
Incarcerated between floors
Of hope and disappointment
We feel the same
Feel the same: no one here is real
We feel the same
Feel the same: that nothing here is still
We are stairway drifters
Made of cyber paper
Google boys and Wiki girls
Children of the self-care
We come to pray every single training day
Looking for a chance to survive
Buying reduced price illusions
Floating into another light
Melting into another lonely crowd
We feel the same
Feel the same: that no one here is real
We feel the same
Feel the same: that nothing here is still
Used to have our love
And now - Disposable needs
Used to have our souls
And now - Refined new skins
Take - Use - Throw away - Forget
Dragging our feet
Tired and deceived
Slowly moving on
Bracing shaky legs
Against all those wasted years
We roll the boulders of sins
Up a hill of new days
Up - Up a hill of new days
In the arms of the setting sun
Our burdens cast shadows over fiery ground
Catching final rays
We try to reach the journey’s end
Before the sun will die
We sense we’re almost there, (We sense we’re almost there)
But the night comes too soon (The night comes to soon)
And we crawl in the dark, (We crawl in the dark - x2)
Not ready to face up (Not ready to face up)
To unknowing lies (To unknowing lies)
We ache to go back (Ache to go back - x2)
But we can’t stop
But we can't stop
So we walk ahead
So we walk ahead
But we can’t stop
But we can't stop
So we walk ahead
So we walk ahead
Walk ahead2Embed
