New Generation Slave LyricsInto this world I came
Filled with fear, crying all the time
I guess my birth left a great scar
On my heart and mind
Now I hand-pick cotton and struggle to sing
"I am happy and I do what I like"
But my voice breaks, and I start to hate
My singing and simply everyone
Mama told me be good
Work hard, and love Mr. God
Every Sunday, I lie
Trying to realize why
Ain't nothing more to say, Your Honor
Don't look at me like that
The truth is, I am a free man
But I can't enjoy my life
I came to a standstill
With lies and hopes inside my head
Always seemed too late to turn
And too soon to understand
No, I don't have a stomachache
It's just my face
I got stuck, I ran aground
I got used to spewing bile
I wonder whether all those years
Hadn't been a waste of time
So how am I doing?
Oh, I can complain
Smoke too many cigarettes
But I don't care
Into this world I came
Filled with fear, crying all the timeEmbed
