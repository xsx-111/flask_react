Coda LyricsNight outside grows white
I lie faceup in my shell
Open my eyes
Don't feel like falling into blank space
Had allowed that life to drift
For I've chosen different trail
When darkness fades
Don't feel like falling into blank space
Want to be your light
Illuminate your smiles
Want to be your cure
Bridge between self and us
Want to be your prayer
Wipe the tears from your eyes
When the night returns
I won't collapse
I am set to riseEmbed
