Parchman Farm LyricsMy man's over there on Parchman Farm
Sittin' there on Parchman Farm
My man's sittin' there on Parchman Farm
He ain't never done nobody no harm
Puttin' that cotton in eleven foot sack
Puttin' that cotton in eleven foot sack
Puttin' that cotton in eleven foot sack
With a twelve gauge shotgun at his back
He's sittin' over there on number nine
Sittin' over there on number nine
Sittin' over there on number nine
And all he ever did was drink his wine
Well, he's gonna be there for the rest of his life
He's gonna be there for the rest of his life
Well, he's gonna be there for the rest of his life
And all he ever did was shoot his wifeEmbed
