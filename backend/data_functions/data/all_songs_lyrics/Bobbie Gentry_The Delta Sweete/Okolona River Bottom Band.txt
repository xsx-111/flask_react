Okolona River Bottom Band LyricsLa-la-la, la-la
Oh, hey-hey-hey
La-la-la, la-la
Every year 'bout this time local gentry
Have a meetin' in Chickasaw land
They all come to judge each and every entry
That wants to try out for the Okolona band
All the way from the Kosciusko
Up from Biloxi shore
All in all there's not a half-grown man
That wouldn't like to be
In the Okolona River Bottom Band
La-la-la, la-la
Oh, hey-hey-hey
La-la-la, la-la
The semi-annual
Come as you can-ual
Five man band-ual
Okolona River Bottom Band
La-la-la, la-la
Oh, hey-hey-hey
La-la-la, la-la
The backwood majority
No hold barr-edy
Come as you are-edy
Okolona River Bottom Band
La-la-la, la-la
All the way from Kosciusko
Up from Biloxi shore
All in all there's not a half-grown man
Who wouldn't like to be
In the Okolona River Bottom Band
La-la-la, la-la
See, I told you so-ciety
Green apple pie-ety
Delta variety
Okolona River Bottom Band
La-la-la, la-la
Oh, hey-hey-hey
La-la-la, la-la
(I gave you my dog)
Oh, I got a dog
(You, you got a friend?)
Don't I?
(That's the end)
AmenEmbed
