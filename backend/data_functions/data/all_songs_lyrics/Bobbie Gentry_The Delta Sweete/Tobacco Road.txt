Tobacco Road LyricsI was born in a bunk
Mother died and my Daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
Grew up in a dusty shack
And all I had was a-hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road
I'm gonna leave and get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money, get rich and old
Bring it back to Tobacco Road
Bring dynamite and a crane
And blow it up, start all over again
Build a town be proud to show
Give the name Tobacco Road
But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Oh, I despise and disapprove it
But I love it 'cause it's homeEmbed
