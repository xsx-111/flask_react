Big Boss Man LyricsBig boss man
Can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man
Can't you hear me when I call?
Oh, you ain't so big
You're just tall, that's all
You got me workin', boss man
Workin' 'round the clock
I want me a drink of water
You just won't let me stop
You, big boss man
Can't you hear me when I call?
Oh, you ain't so big
You're just tall, that's all
Gonna get myself a boss man
One gonna treat me right
Work me hard in the daytime
But I'll sure rest easy at night
Big boss man
Can't you hear me when I call?
Oh, you ain't so big
You're just tall, that's allEmbed
