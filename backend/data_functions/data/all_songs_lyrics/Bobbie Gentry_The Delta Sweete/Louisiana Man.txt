Louisiana Man LyricsAt first Mom an' Poppa called their little girl, Lady
They raised her on the banks of a river bed
A house boat tied to a big, tall tree
A home for my Poppa an' my Momma and me
The clock strikes three Poppa jumps to his feet
Already Momma's cookin' Poppa somethin' to eat
At half-past Poppa he's a-ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou
He's got fishin' line strung across the Louisiana River
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's settin' his traps catchin' anythin' he can
He's gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana man
Muskrat hides hangin' by the dozen
Even got a little bitty muskrat cousin
Got 'em out dryin' in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow Poppa's gonna turn 'em into mon'
They call Momma Rita and my Daddy Jack
My little baby brother on the floor that's Mac
Rhett and Lynn are the family twins
Big brother Eddie's on the bayou fishin'
On the river floats Poppa's great big boat
That's how me and Poppa get in to town
It takes every bit of a night and day
To even reach a place where the people will stay
Oh, I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my Poppa takes the furs to town
Poppa done promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show
I saw the cowboys and injuns for the first time then
I told my Poppa "Gotta go again"
Poppa says "Hon', we got lines to run
We'll have to come again 'cause there's work to be done"
He's got fishin' line strung across the Louisiana River
Got a catch a big fish for us to eat
He's settin' his traps catchin' anythin' he can
Gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana manEmbed
