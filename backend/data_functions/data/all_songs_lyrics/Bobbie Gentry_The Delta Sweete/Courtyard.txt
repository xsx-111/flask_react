Courtyard LyricsSaid he'd build me a courtyard
He promised he would
And spend time in my courtyard
Whenever he could
In the corner, a tall tree
So shady and cool
And a white marble fountain
In a clear sparkling pool
A lovely stone courtyard
With a lacy iron gate
And a bountiful garden
Where I could wait
Yes, he built me a courtyard
Like he promised he would
And I know that he'd come to my side
He would if he could
Patterns on a courtyard floor
Illusions of all I'm living forEmbed
