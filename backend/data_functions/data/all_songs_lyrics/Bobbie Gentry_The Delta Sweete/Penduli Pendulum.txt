Penduli Pendulum LyricsPenduli, pendulum
Swing around, beat the drum
In July I'll deny
The illusion
I'll be gone, beat the drum
There I go, here I come
And goodbye means good try
No conclusion
Pendulum like perfect rhyme
Always in predicted time
Penduli, when will I learn
Departure means a sure return?
Slice the pie, leave a crumb
What have I now become
When the lie is just some
Sad inducement?
Stifled cry will become
Just a sigh, so hum-drum
When goodbye serves as my
One amusementEmbed
