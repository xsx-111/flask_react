Sermon LyricsLet me set the mood, set the situation
Imagine that you're sittin' in the congregation
Hey, he's talkin' 'bout Judgment Day
If you listen real close, hear what he say
You may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
May run on for a long time
But let me tell you God Almighty's gonna cut you down
Go 'n' tell that long-term liar
Go 'n' tell that midnight rider
Tell the gambler, rambler, backbiter
Tell him God Almighty gonna cut him down
Great God Almighty, let me tell you my need
Yes, my head's been wet with the midnight deed
I been down on my bended knee
Talkin' to the man from Galilee
My God spoke, spoke so sweet
I thought I heard the shufflin' of angel feet
He put one hand on my head
Great God Almighty let me tell you what he said
You may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
May run on for a long time
Let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down
You may throw the rock, hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But sure as God made the day and night
What you do in the dark will be brought to light
You may run and hide, slip and slide
Try to take the mote from your neighbor's eye
But sure as the Lord made the rich and poor
What you reap, my brother, is what you sow
You may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
But let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down
Some people go to church just to signify
They try to make a date with their neighbor's wife
But let me tell you, brother, just as sure as your born
Better leave that woman, better leave her alone
One of these days just mark my words
You think that your brother's gone off to work
You'll walk up and knock on the door
That's all, brother, there ain't no more
(Swing low, sweet chariot)
You may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
May run on for a long time
But let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down
Go 'n' tell that midnight rider
Go 'n' tell that long-term liar
Tell the rambler, gambler, backbiter
Tell him God Almighty gonna cut him down
AmenEmbed
