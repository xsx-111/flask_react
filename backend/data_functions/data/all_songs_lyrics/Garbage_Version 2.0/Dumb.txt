Dumb Lyrics

I never claimed to be your saviour
I said I had a dirty mouth
Stop analysing my behaviour
If you're too dumb to work it out
I've got to keep myself together
You know I hate to disappoint
A masochistic lamb to slaughter
Maybe you miss the point?

I'm feeling small
I'm climbing the walls
I don't let it show

Now that you know what you know
I bet you wish you could let it go
You'll never come sucking your thumb
Better off dumb

Maybe I could write a letter
To help me with my self-esteem
You should get to know me better
No one's ever what they seem
I'm feeling small
I'm climbing the walls
I don't let it show

Now that you know what you know
I bet you wish you could let it go
You'll never come sucking your thumb
Better off dumb

You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you need from me
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you think of me

Now that you know what you know
I bet you wish you could let it go
You'll never come sucking your thumb
Better off dumb
Now that you know what you know
You're going to reap what you sow
Nothing will come sucking your thumb
Better off dumb
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you need from me
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what you think of me
You still don't know what I think of me
You still don't know what you think of me4Embed
