Temptation Waits Lyrics
I'll tell you something
I am a wolf but
I like to wear sheep's clothing
I am a bonfire
I am a vampire
I'm waiting for my momentYou come on like a drug
I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you
For a little more
And there's so much at stake
I can't afford to waste
I never needed anybody
Like this beforeTemptation waits
It's in our fate
Can't stay
Much longer
Temptation waits
I want to stay
Closer
And stronger
I'll tell you something
I am a demon
Some say my biggest weakness
I have my reasons
Call it my defense
Be careful what you're wishingYou come on like a drug
I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you
For a little more
And there's so much at stake
I can't afford to waste
I never needed anybody
Like this beforeTemptation waits
It's in our fate
Can't stay
Much longer
Temptation waits
I want to stay
Closer
And stronger
You are a secret
A new possession
I like to keep you guessingYou come on like a drug
I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you
For a little more
And there's so much at stake
I can't afford to waste
I never needed anybody
Like this beforeTemptation waits
It's in our fate
Can't stay
Much longer
Temptation waits
Temptation waits

When I'm not sure what I'm living for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
When I'm not sure what I'm living for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for
(When I'm not sure who I am)
When I'm not sure what I'm living for
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for
When I'm not sure what I'm living for4Embed
