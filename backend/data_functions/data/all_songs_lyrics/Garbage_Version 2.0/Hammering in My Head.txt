Hammering in My Head Lyrics
I'm stressed but you're freestyle
I'm overworked but I'm undersexed
I must be made of concrete
I signed my name across your chest
Give out the same old answers
I trot them out for the relatives
Company tried and tested
I use the ones that I love the best

Like an animal, you're moving over me
Like an animal, you're moving over me

When did I get perverted?
I can't remember your name
I'm growing introverted
You touch my hand and it's not the same
This was so unexpected
I never thought I'd get caught
Play boomerang with your demons
Shoot to kill and you'll pop them off, bang! Bang!

Like an animal, you're moving over me
Like an animal, you're moving over me
You should be sleeping, my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
You should be sleeping, my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
You should be sleeping, my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
You should be sleeping, my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I knew you were mine for the taking
I knew you were mine for the taking
I knew you were mine for the taking
When I walked in the room
I knew you were mine for the taking
I knew you were mine for the taking
Your eyes light up
When I walk in the room
A hammering in my head don't stop
In the bullet train from Tokyo to Los Angeles
I'm leaving you behind a flash in the pan
A storm in a teacup
A needle in a haystack
A prize for the winning
A dead for the raising
A catch for the chasing
A jewel for the choosing
A man for the making in this blistering heat
Sweat it all out
Sweat it all out
With your bedroom eyes and your baby pouts
Sweat it all out
In our electric storms and our shifting sands
Our candy jars and our sticky hands
Sweat it all out
Sweat it all out
Sweat it all out
Sweat it all out
Sweat it all out
Sweat it all out

Don't forget what I wrote you then
And don't forget what I told you then
And don't forget I that I'm meant to win
And don't forget your Ventolin
So a hammering in my head don't stop
In the bullet train from Tokyo to Los Angeles3Embed
