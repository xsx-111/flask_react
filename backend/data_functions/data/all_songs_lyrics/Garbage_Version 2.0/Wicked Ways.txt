Wicked Ways Lyrics
I tried hard to mend my wicked ways
I acted like a lunatic for years
Lord knows I try to be good
I'd keep my promises if only I could
You count your blessings that I can't rely on you

And I tried, and I tried, and I tried, and I tried

Clutch your pictures of the Pope
Pray to God for love and hope
Bring the Virgin home for luck
Bolt the door down, keep it shut

I've done things I never thought I'd do
Sure it helps to lose myself in you
A little time and I'll be alright
C'mon sugar, let's go out tonight
Forgive your trespasses and all that we've been through

Oh, I tried, and I tried, and I tried, and I tried
And I tried, and I tried, and I tried, and I tried
Clutch your pictures of the Pope
Pray to God for love and hope
Bring the Virgin home for luck
Bolt the door down, keep it shut

That sinking feeling
When you are leaving
All I believed in
Walks out the door

I tried hard to mend my wicked ways
The damage's done, there's nothing left to save

Oh, I tried
And I tried, and I tried
And I tried, and I tried, and I tried, and I tried

Clutch your pictures of the Pope
(Just like I told you)
Pray to God for love and hope
(Just like I warned you)
Bring the Virgin home for luck
(Just like I told you)
Bolt the door down, keep it shut
(Just like I warned you)1Embed
