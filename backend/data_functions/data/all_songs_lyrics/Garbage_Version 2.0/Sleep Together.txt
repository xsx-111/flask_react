Sleep Together Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you crawling up a mountain
Hanging 'round my neck
I got you twisted round my finger
Crawling 'round my legs

The emptiness, the craziness
Satisfy this hungriness
Darling, how would it feel?

If we sleep together
Will you like me better?
If we come together
We'll go down forever
If we sleep together
Will I like you better?
If we come together
Prove it now or never
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Make me a pretty person
Make me feel like I belong
Make me hard and make me happy
Make me beautiful

The emptiness, the craziness
Satisfy this hungriness
Darling, how would it feel?

If we sleep together
Will you like me better?
If we come together
We'll go down forever
If we sleep together
Will I like you better?
If we come together
Prove it now or never
If we sleep together
Nothing satisfies me, baby!
If we sleep together
I'll wear something pretty, baby!
If we sleep together
Give me what I crave now, baby!
If we sleep together
Save the rest for later, baby!
If we sleep together
You will drive me crazy, baby!
If we sleep together
I save it all for you, my baby!
If we sleep together
If we sleep together3Embed
