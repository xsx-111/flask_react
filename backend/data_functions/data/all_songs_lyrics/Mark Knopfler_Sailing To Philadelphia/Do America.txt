Do America LyricsWell I have been it every since I was a kid at school
Now they love me in Newcastle and in Liverpool
I am as hard as a pistol I can't do no wrong
I've been in Birmingham and Bristol to play my song
Take the 777 to the USA
Gonna party all night and gonna sleep all day
Seen the New York City cause I never been
New York City in a limousine
Gonna do America do do America
Do America do do America now
Take the 777 over to LA
Gonna party all night and gonna sleep all day
Wake up and try to ??? I get the coolest girl in town
Do america do do america
Do America do do America now
Now the people go nah nah
Another people go wah wah
Another people go gah gah when I
Do America do do America
Do America do do America
Do America do do America
Do America do do America now
Backstage passes for the food and booze
Sunglasses from the interviews
Statue of liberty
Everybody looking at me
Do America do do America
Do America do do America now
Do America do do America
Do America do do America now
Do America do do America
