Prairie Wedding LyricsWe only knew each other by letter
I went to meet her off the train
When the smoke had cleared and the dust was still
She was standing there and speaking my name
I guarantee she looked like an angel
I couldn't think of what I should say
But when Adam saw Eve in the garden
I believe he felt the selfsame way
I handed her up on the wagon
And I loaded up her trunk behind
She was sitting up there with the gold in her hair
And I tried to get a hold of my mind
Think that you could love me Mary
Think we got a chance of a life
Do you think that you could love me Mary?
Now you are to be my wife
We finally headed out of the station
And we drove up the home trail
And when we came to the farm she laid a hand on my arm
I thought my resolution would fail
And I froze as she stepped in the doorway
Stood there as still as could be
I said I know it ain't much, it needs a woman's touch
Lord she turned around and looked at me
Do you think that you could love me Mary?
Think we got a chance of a life
Do you think that you could love me Mary?
Now you are to be my wife
We had a prairie wedding
There was a preacher and a neighbour or two
I gave my golden thing a gold wedding ring
And the both of us said I do
And when the sun's going down on the prairie
And the gold in her hair is aflame
I say do you really love me Mary
And I hold her and I whisper her name
Do you think that you could love me Mary?
Think we got a chance of a life
Now you are to be my wife
Do you think that you could love me Mary?Embed
