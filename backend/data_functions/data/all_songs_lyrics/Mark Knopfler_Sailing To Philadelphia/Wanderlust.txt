Wanderlust LyricsBig black cloud
On a yellow plain
Sure enough it
Looks like rain
Packin' up all our
Faith and trust
Me and the wanderlust
Open window
Empty bed and chair
Who's that callin'
Ain't nobody there
I look behind me
And I see there's just
Me and the wanderlust
Dead of night
I had a dream
Sky was bright yes and the
Fields were green
I was down the road
In a cloud of dust
Me and the wanderlust
And I'm on the egde
Of an endless fall
Sure enough
He's come to call
Got to go now
Get on that bus
Me and the wanderlustEmbed
