Silvertown Blues Lyrics
On Silvertown Way, the cranes stand high
Quiet and gray against the still of the sky
They won't quit and lay down though the action has died
They watch the new game in town on the Blackwall side
From the poisonous drains a vision appears
New circle of cranes, a new reason to be here
A big silver dome rising up into the dawn
Above the church and the homes were all the silver is gone, gone, gone

If I'd a bucket of gold, what would I do?
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues

Going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown

A silver dawn steals over the docks
A truck with no wheels up on cinderblocks
Men with no dreams around a fire in a drum
Scrap metal schemes are rusted over and done, done, done
If I'd a bucket of gold, silver would do
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues

And I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown

When you're standing on thin and dangerous ice
You can knock and walk in for Citizens' Advice
They'll tell you the where you can turn, the way you can go
There's nothing they can tell me I don't already know

If I'd a bucket of gold, silver would do
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues (Silvertown blues)

And I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
From the Canning Town train I saw a billboard high
There's a big silver plane rising up into the sky
And I can make out the words: "Seven flights every day"
Says six of those birds are bound for JFK

If I'd a bucket of gold, silver would do
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues (Silvertown blues)

I said I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
