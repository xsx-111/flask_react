Only the Strong Survive LyricsWhen you're always chasing rainbows
And you might not know which way the wind blows
You say your lucky day is comin'
Until that day you're just slummin'
So you wait and you wait but the signal don't change
Watching TV daily there is no sign
You read your horoscope
But ahh, it would appear there is no hope
So what?
Who cares?
Gotta put a handle
On your fear
A man comes
And a man goes
And he always leaves alone
Only the strong survive
You better wake up from that fantasy
It's time to open your eyes
Don't be afraid to see what you might see
The years roll by and the boy feels cheated
He fights back hard, his youth's retreated
He lets his hair grow, gets a sports car
But he knows that won't go so far
It's too bad
It's real sad
You lost the best thing
You ever had
You had some hope
And you had the youth
But now you'll never
Know the truth
Only the strong survive
You better wake up from that fantasy
I think it's time to open your eyes
Don't be afraid to see what you might see
Only the strong survive
Don't ever let it get you down
Oh, I can't sympathize
If you expect to stick around
So what?
Who cares?
Better put a handle
On your fear
A man comes
And a man goes
And he always leaves alone
Only the strong survive
You better wake up from that fantasy
I think it's time you opened your eyes
Don't be afraid to see what you might see
Only the strong survive
Don't ever let it get you down
I think it's time to open your eyes
If you expect to stick around
Only the strong survive
You better wake up from that fantasy
I think it's time that you opened your eyes
Don't be afraid to see what you might seeEmbed
