Be Mine Tonight LyricsWell the very first time that I saw you there
You know I couldn't believe my eyes
I thought I was the winner of the Price is Right
And they let me keep every prize
I've never been famous as a ladies man
I'm not known as a crazy guy
In fact I've never made the papers over nothin' at all
I think it's time somebody gave me a try
Baby, be mine tonight
And this ol' world will turn out alright
Just to find you took a whole lifetime
I could lose you in a minute's time
Be mine tonight--baby, be mine tonight
Be mine tonight--baby, be mine tonight
I don't know if you've ever been in love before
But I think this is my very first time
I wish someone could tell me what my next move is
I'm afraid I'm falling way behind
I know you've been around about as much as I have
When the lights go out we'll see
You can further your education all your life
Honey, just don't make a fool out of me
Baby, be mine tonight
And this ol' world will turn out alright
Just to find you took a whole lifetime
I could lose you in a minute's time
Be mine tonight--baby, be mine tonight
Be mine tonight--baby, be mine tonight
I've been left alone
I've been on the streets so long
I feel like I'm falling
Or sinking in quicksand
Throw me out a line
Be a special friend of mine
I would love to take you home
If I only had a home
Baby, be mine tonight
And this ol' world will turn out alright
Just to find you took a whole lifetime
I could lose you in a minute's time
Be mine tonight--baby, be mine tonight
Be mine tonight--baby, be mine tonightEmbed
