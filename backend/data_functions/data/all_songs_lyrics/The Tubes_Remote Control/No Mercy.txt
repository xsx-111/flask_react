No Mercy LyricsWell it's a shame when you got nobody
And it's a drag when you got no friends
But it's a worse when you get no mercy
And you're startin' all over again
And back in my own world
Nobody bugs me
But down on the shop floor
They show me no mercy
I've been down to the railway station
I've been over to the taxi stand
I've been standing in the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel
But I've never seen a helpin' hand
I'm lookin' for someone
Not out to get me
I'm keepin' my guard up
Expectin' no mercy
No mercy
No pity
There's no mercy for me
No sympathy
They say it's just like a gentle rainfall
But it ain't never rained on me
And back in my own world
Nobody bugs me
But down on the shop floor
They show me no mercy
No mercy
No pity
There's no mercy for me
No sympathyEmbed
