I Want It All Now LyricsWhat's on the other side of the wall
Seems like my world has gotten so small
Where are the friends who don't ever call
Is there an answer to these questions at all
When will they come and open the door
I can't hold out anymore
I just can't wait to have it all now
Just take it one thing at a time
I want it all now
You'll have to learn to wait in line
I'll get it some way, somehow
I want it all now
All now
I saw somebody get married today
Saw people crying as they drove away
Old ladies laughing and children at play
I ask for love but they don't hear what I say
I want to feel what everyone feels
What will tomorrow reveal
I just can't wait to have it all now
Just take it one thing at a time
I want it all now
You'll have to learn to wait in line
I'll get it some way, somehow
I want it all now
All now
What is it like to kiss a real girl
To think you're in love and get married to her
Have lots of children and grow fat and old
And die like a fish on the end of a pole
Walking down the main street
Looking at the people
Shopping at the marketplace
Standing on the corner
Praying in the temple
Dancing at the disco
Working at the factory
Party on the weekend
I just can't wait to have it all now
I want it all now
I just can't wait to have it all now
Just take it one thing at a time
I want it all now
You'll have to learn to wait in line
I'll get it some way, somehow
I want it all now
All nowEmbed
