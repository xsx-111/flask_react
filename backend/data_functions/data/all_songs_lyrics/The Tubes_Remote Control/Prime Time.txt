Prime Time LyricsCome fly with me
What are you waiting for
Come fly with me
Don't waste a minute more
I'll give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for you
Give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for you
I'm waiting here
For no one else but you
Come closer dear
That's all you have to do
I'll give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for you
Give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for you
Don't be shy
I would never hurt you
I have had my eye on you
For such a long, long time
You know I'm always here
If you should need me
If you want a drink or two
I'm the one you should see
Go anywhere
Still you can call on me
And I'll be there
Just say the word and see
I'll give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for you
Give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for you
I've waited here
For no one else but you
Come closer dear
That's all you have to do
I'll give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for you
Give you my prime time
I'm saving my prime time for youEmbed
