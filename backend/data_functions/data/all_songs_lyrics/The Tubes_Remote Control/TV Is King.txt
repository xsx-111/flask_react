TV Is King LyricsI wish I was the man
With the mechanical heart
I'd conquer all my enemies alone
I'd tear the guys apart
Then scatter the pieces
I wish I was the man in the soundproof booth
I wish I had a chance
To stump the band or maybe tell truth
And maybe I could win a color television
I really love my, television
I love to sit by, television
Can't live without my, television
TV is king, you're my everything
I wish I had the girl with the bouncy hair
We'd ride off in a brand new car
Or fly a plane somewhere
Like probably Jamaica
I brush my teeth, shampoo my hair
And shave my face
Apply the necessary aerosol
In the appropriate place
And we'll spend the night
Together watching television
I can't turn off my, television
Don't really know why, television
I understand my, television
You got your works in a drawer
And your color's on track
You have to break away
But you always come back
You make a hundred changes
But you're always the same
You make me so excited
And you make me so lame
You're just a tube full of gas
And a box full of tin
But you show me your charms
And I want to jump in
Oh, if only your chassis
Was covered with skin
'Cause TV you're my everything
I really love my, television
I love to sit by, television
Can't live without my, television
I can't turn off my, television
Don't really know why, television
I understand my, television
I really love my, television
TV is king, you're my everything
