Turn Me On LyricsTurn me on 'cause I need it now
Turn me on 'cause I don't know how
Pick me up and shake me
Tune me in and take me
Lights are bright and the music's loud
Let me know what I need to know
Make me go where I want to go
Let me stand and wonder
Let me feel the thunder
See the lightning and the picture show
(Put your hand on the power)
Turn me on again and again
Say you're always gonna be my friend
Love me like you mean it
Make a mess and clean it
Don't you stop 'til I tell you when
Got a feeling something's taken hold
'Cause I'm flying by remote control
No misunderstanding
Before I make a landing
I'll lose my mind and I'll trade my soul
Put your hand on the power
When I look you in the eye
Then it's everything I need
(When I look you in the eye, when I look you in the eye)
Let me look you in the eye
'til the spell comes over me
(Turn me on)
Making the colors bright
(Turn me on)
Making it go all night
(Turn me on)
Giving me louder sound
(Turn me on)
Making it spin around
(Turn me on)
Sing and dance for me
(Turn me on)
Keeping me company
(Turn me on)
Making it fast and hot
(Turn me on)
Give me a different shot
(Put your hand on the power and)
(Turn me on)
Making the colors bright
(Turn me on)
Making it go all night
(Turn me on)
Giving me louder sound
(Turn me on)
Making it spin around
(Turn me on)
Sing and dance for me
(Turn me on)
Keeping me company
(Turn me on)
Making it fast and hot
(Turn me on)
Give me a different shot
(Put your hand on the power, why don't you turn me on)Embed
