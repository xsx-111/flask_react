Sweet Georgia Brown LyricsWell let me tell you well no chick made
Could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat
Has sweet Georgia Brown
Fella's sigh, and even cry
For sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why
You know I don't lie
It's been said
She knocks them dead
In any old town
Since she came right
It's a shame
How she brings them downEmbed
