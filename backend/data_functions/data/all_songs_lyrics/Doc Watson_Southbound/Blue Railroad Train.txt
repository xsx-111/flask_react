Blue Railroad Train LyricsBlue railroad train
I'm goin' down the railroad track
It makes me feel so doggone blue
To listen to that old smokestack
Drivers a-rollin' on
Leavin' me here behind
Give me back them good old days
And let me ramble down the line
Blue railroad train
Leavin' me here alone
You're treatin' me good, you're treatin' me bad
You're makin' me think of home
I hear that lonesome train
And love to hear the whistle blow
She's takin' the sun and leavin' the rain
And makin' me wanna go
I've got the blues
Longin' for her company
It's many miles from where I am
To the only one for me
It's so lonesome here
Waitin' for the manifest
I hope that engineer is kind
Enough to let me be his guest
Blue railroad train
A good old pal to me
Takes me everywhere I wanna go
Get my transportation freeEmbed
