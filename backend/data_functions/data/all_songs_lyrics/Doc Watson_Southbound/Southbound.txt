Southbound Lyrics
I've been here a month or more, stuck in this old city
People that have to call it home, they're the ones I pity
Lord, I'm homesick
Blues are the only songs I ever seem to pick
I get out and walk the street 'til I get blisters on my feet
I'm southbound

I'm all right 'til late at night, I'm sitting by my window
I count sheep but I can't sleep for listening to that train blow
I begin to pine
When I hear that great big old engine rolling down the line
I'm going back and spending some time where I can have fun when I ain't got a dime
I'm southbound

Southbound, she's a burnin' the ground and I don't mean maybe
Sure am glad I caught this train, I wanna see my baby
Lord, I'm lonesome
Long to see those hills that I come from
Listen to the engine rattle and roar, taking me back home once more
I'm southboundEmbed
