Better Than You Lyrics

I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

Sit here, now look in the mirror
Something's wrong, your face is distorted
Feel the flow, there's blood in your body
And you can see clearly every heartbeat you make
Close your eyes, touch your mouth in the mirror
That's the wound that is made where the past meets the future

I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

And I can see clearly through this veil of reality
And I can remember the feel of your skin
No, you never knew me and you never will
When nothing's there, nothing is concealed
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)
Yes, we're better than you (We're better than you)
We're better than you are (We're better than you are)1Embed
