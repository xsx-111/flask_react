Song for Dead Time Lyrics
Now the past is untrue, and this breath is a lie
And the sun is an emptiness that burns through the sky
And this ground, it will slide down, down into the sea
And when this body dies, no man will breathe
One word of ignorance for me, oh

So bury your trust beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to consume

Now the earth bleeds cold water in my open hands
But their bodies bleed poison and they swallow the sand
And we'll walk to the river, where we will die of a thirst
And my fate, it's no question, every fool, he is broken
Beneath the same holy curse, oh

So bury your love beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to burn to sand3Embed
