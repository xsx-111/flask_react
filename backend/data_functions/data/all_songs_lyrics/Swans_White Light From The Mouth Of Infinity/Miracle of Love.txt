Miracle of Love Lyrics
She holds a key to the room down there
And I, I will follow, but I'll never fall in
Yeah, we'll suffer for nothing and we'll never forgive
God said to no one to do what he did

One second in your presence is a miracle of love
One second denied is a miracle of love

The young man is weakness in a lover's disguise
The woman is strong in her warm bed of lies
How will they hold what they can never perceive?
And how do they love what they fail to deceive?

One second in your memory is a miracle of lies
One heartbeat in your body is a miracle of love
White light on a black sky is a miracle from above
One lonely moment in your arms is the miracle of loveEmbed
