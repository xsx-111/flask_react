Why Are We Alive? Lyrics

Now I'm not a man
And I don't feel love
And I don't see anything
Coming down from above
But this world spins slowly
And I see a light
Rising up from behind the horizon
Up into the clear, black, sky
But I don't see you in my line of sight
In fact, I can't remember why we are alive

Na na na na na, why are we alive?
Na na na na na, why are we alive?


Na na na na na, why are we alive?
Na na na na na, why are we?Embed
