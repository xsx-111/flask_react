You Know Nothing Lyrics
And nothing is written in the book
Reality is made by you
And every lie that you pursue
Eventually turns true
And I was told that your eyes
Would shine a light up into space
And infinity would then consume
This ordinary place

You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all

I saw you standing in the fire
Beneath a crimson moon
The ocean whispered on the shore
And echoed in the ruins
Inside your body is a clear blue light
And time was made from this
Your shadow swallows everything it feels
You punish us with bliss
You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all1Embed
