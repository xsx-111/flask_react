When She Breathes Lyrics
When she comes here, then we'll see
Then we'll know, then we'll breathe
In her shadow, the sun was born
In her shadow, a new world will form

When she breathes, when she breathes
When she imagines that she breathes in me

When she breathes, when she thinks it once
In the field, steel grass will grow
And from Heaven, she'll rain down the sun
And turn the living into sand
And we breathe her holy air
And we walk this poison place
Made from an emptiness where time was never
Dreamed by one mind so sad as mine

When she breathes, when she breathes
When she thinks it once, when she breathes in meEmbed
