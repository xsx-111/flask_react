The Most Unfortunate Lie Lyrics
Someone was here before me
And they took the possibility away
And without any control or freedom
The elements were laid down in this way
And so my mind is slowly devoured
By the ideas to which it subscribes
And in the end, I'm left with nothing
Except the memory of believing my own lies

And where are you now
My most unfortunate lie?

The light shows my face in the mirror
And my hand as it reaches to touch
The evidence of pain and delusion
And a mind which was never clear enough
I saw the sun rise in an ancient desert
Where this moment was first foretold
And the black water was thick as blood
And my hands, they were full of gold

And where are you now
The most lethal, all-consuming lie I ever told?
And where are you now
My unfortunate, irreversible lie?Embed
