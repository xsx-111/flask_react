Power and Sacrifice Lyrics
I want power, because it feels good
I want power, I'll wash America with blood
I want power, a clear blue light in the sky
I feel power, running through my veins and out my eyes
And into empty, godforsaken minds without reality

I feel power, I feel a sacrifice
I am dead to right or wrong
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

I want power, just like our father knew
I want power, I'll put my hands in you
I want power, though the Earth is lost and spinning
I feel power, buried in the ground
Where twenty million died like heroes
Stealing this same power that I'm feeling

I feel power, I feel a sacrifice
Now my blood is feeling clean
And I feel the power burning
Like a spear inside of me
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I feel good, I feel right, I feel a sacrifice, I am right
I am right, I am right
I am right, I am right
I feel good, I feel right, I am right, I am right2Embed
