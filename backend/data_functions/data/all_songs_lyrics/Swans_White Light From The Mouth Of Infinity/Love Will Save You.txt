Love Will Save You Lyrics
Love will save you
When the ocean splits itself in two
Love will save you
When the cold wind blows right through you
And love will save you
When the poison eats the precious air
And love will save you
From the snake that crawls around down there

But it won't save me

Now love will save you
From the evil and the greed of ignorant men
And love will save you
From the guilt you feel when you betray your only friend
And love will save you
From yourself when you lose control
And love will save you
From all the lies your lover told you

But it won't save me
And love will save you
From the truth when you think you're free
And love will save you
From the cold light of boring reality
And love will save you
From the corruption of your lazy-minded soul
And love will save you
From your selfish and distorted goals

But it won't save...

Love will save you
From the black night and the lightning and the ghost
And love will save you
From your misery, then tie you to the bloody post
And love will save you
From the hands that pull you down beneath the sea
And love may save all you people
But it will never, never save me

No, it won't save
