Will We Survive Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five, six

I'll drink the moonlight from your hands
I'll swim an ocean filled with sorrow
No, lover, please don't go
We can crucify tomorrow
Let the sunlight feed the air
Let it fill our lungs with lies
We'll be memorized by shadows
But our loneliness will survive

Na, na na na, na
Na, na na na, na
Na, na na na, na
Will we survive?

Now the sugar in your soft voice
Makes the sweetness in your weeping
And the black rose that you swallowed
Feeds the solitude you're dreaming
No, I'll never taste your tears again
In the darkness that we're breathing in
Now the sun will kill the garden
In a universe that's bleeding
Na, na na na, na
Na, na na na, na
Na, na na na, na
Will we survive?2Embed
