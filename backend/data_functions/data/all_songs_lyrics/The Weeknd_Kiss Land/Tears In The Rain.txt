Tears In The Rain Lyrics
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)

When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain)
So now that she's gone (Oh, no)
Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (Alone you've become)
They all feel the same

I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh, yeah

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
They all feel the same (Ooh)
Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one could love me)
It's pointless (No one's gonna love me)
Like tears in the rain (No one can love no more)
So now that she's gone (Oh, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (I'm not gonna show the world, oh, how alone I've become, oh)
They all feel the same (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Adjust to the fame (Ohh, adjust to the fame, I ain't tryin' to be alone, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one's gonna love you no more)
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
So now that she's gone (Ooh, baby, no one's gonna love me no more)
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (No one's gonna love me, no, woah, yeah)

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away102Embed
