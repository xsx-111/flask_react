Darkness at the Door Lyrics
This is our corner of the planet
It's the straight edges we inhabit
We ignore the darkness at the door
Turn the lights out if you hear me
Stop your screaming, just speak clearly
The lonely and the righteous
I just need friends and nothing more

This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet me
This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet me

It's the first sign of an affliction
Familiarity of an addiction
That old friend's a welcome sight
I like it when I see him
He covers up the world we live in
Lights a firework in my pocket
Some friends are worth the fight

This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet me
This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet me
Never lonely, never lonely, never lonely in town
Darkness at the door to greet me
Never lonely, never lonely, never lonely in town
Darkness at the door to greet me
Never lonely, never lonely, never lonely in town
Darkness at the door to greet me
Never lonely, never lonely, never lonely in town
Darkness at the door

I must manage expectations
My idols are revelations
I hope I never meet them
This is our corner of the planet
It's the straight edges we inhabit
Just friends and nothing more
Become the darkness at the door

This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet me
This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet me
This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet me
This old town still gets out of line
Darkness at the door to greet meEmbed
