Counting Spooks Lyrics
You know it's gonna hurt
Sore feet dragged through the dirt
Hit me right here
The lazy way we love
Good times we're dreaming of
Hit me right here

It's getting late
The skyline's a state
This city's tired like we are
We're holding it together
Counting spooks together
I'm just so tired of numbers

Night vision on
Get the missionaries home
Hit me right here
You know where I start
And you know where I end
Hit me right here

It's getting late
The skyline's a state
This city's tired like we are
We're holding it together
Counting spooks forever
I'm just so tired of numbers
Though it's getting late
The skyline's a state
And this city's tired like we are
We're holding it together
Counting spooks together
I'm just so tired of numbers

Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding, holding, holding
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding it together
Holding, holding, holdingEmbed
