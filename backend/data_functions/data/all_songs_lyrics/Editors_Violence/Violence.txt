Violence Lyrics
One more waster digging holes
Down where the streets are paved with souls
It makes it harder to join the dots
The river gets wider in front of us
The last train will pull you through
At night the war still comes to you
It makes it harder to join the dots
The river gets wider in front of us

Baby we're nothing but violence
Desperate, so desperate and fearless
Mess me around 'til my heart breaks
I just need to feel it
Baby we're nothing but violence
Desperate, so desperate and fearless
Desperate and fearless

Oh, violence
Oh, violence
Oh, violence
Oh, violence
One more waster digging holes
Down where the streets are paved with souls
The last train will pull you through
At night the war still comes to you
It makes it harder to join the dots
The river gets wider in front of us
It makes it harder to join the dots
The river gets wider in front of us

Baby we're nothing but violence
Desperate, so desperate and fearless
Mess me around 'til my heart breaks
I just need to feel it
Baby we're nothing but violence
Desperate, so desperate and fearless
Desperate and fearless

Oh, violence
Oh, violence
Oh, violence
Oh, violence
Oh, violence
Oh, violence
