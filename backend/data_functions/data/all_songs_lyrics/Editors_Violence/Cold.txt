Cold Lyrics
You were waiting for an answer
It was the hardest thing to hear
So strung out eclipsed by shivers
Molleycoddled and sincere

It's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
Stay with me and
Be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

But don't you be so cold

You were waiting for elation
Like it would fall out of the sky
Maybe time's the greatest healer
But baby everything will die

It's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
Stay with me and
Be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

But don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
It's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
Stay with me and
Be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

But don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold
Don't you be so cold1Embed
