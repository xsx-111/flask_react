Belong Lyrics
In this room
A wilderness
You're the calm
In that dress
Circling birds
Spits of rain
Rest your head
On the windowpane

Here's our love
It breaths and dreams
This wilderness
These kings and queens
In this room
Our sheltered hole
Our skin's alive
I wear your soul

Never belong to anyone else but me
(Never belong to 'em, never belong to 'em)
Never belong to anyone else but me
(Never belong to 'em, never belong to 'em)
Never belong to anyone else but me
(Never belong to 'em, never belong to 'em)
Never belong to, never belong to, never belong
Welcome home
How long's it been?
I know that face
From that dream
A wilderness
Beyond those walls
A poignant pause
As a picture falls

Never belong to anyone else but me
(Never belong to 'em, never belong to 'em)
Never belong to anyone else but me
(Never belong to 'em, never belong to 'em)
Never belong to anyone else but me
(Never belong to 'em, never belong to 'em)
Never belong to, never belong to, never belong

Welcome home
How long's it been?
A wilderness is in me
A wilderness is in me

Welcome home
How long's it been?
A wilderness is in me
A wilderness is in me
Welcome home
How long's it been?
A wilderness is in me
A wilderness is in me1Embed
