Magazine Lyrics
Right this way
The room's full to burst
Whatever you say
Gotta quench that thirst

I got a little secret for you
It's in a magazine
You got an image to keep safe
Bitten nails stay clean, yeah

Now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Top of a hit list, gag a witness
It takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
Just talk the loudest with a clenched fist

Flash your winning smile
Let your eyes work the room
These people are here for you
You're the bride, you're the groom

I got a little secret for you
It's in a magazine
You got an image to keep safe
Bitten nails stay clean, yeah
Now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Top of a hit list, gag a witness
It takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
Just talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Yeah, you talk the loudest


Now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Top of a hit list, gag a witness
It takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
Now talk the loudest, you're making them sing, you're making them sing

It don't mean a thing, it don't mean a thing
You're making them sing, you're making them sing
It don't mean a thing, it don't mean a thing
You're making them sing, you're making them sing
It don't mean a thing, it don't mean a, don't mean a, don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing3Embed
