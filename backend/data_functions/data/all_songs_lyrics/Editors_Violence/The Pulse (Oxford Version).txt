The Pulse (Oxford Version) Lyrics
How do I dodge the dirty looks?
You remember the path we took
People embrace the same old things
Throw it away
Let's make pretend

You accomplish and you destroy
If you want the end, then I'm your boy
People embrace the same ideas
Throw it away
Let's make pretend

How can I frame the things we've said
And navigate night to a dawn pristine?
People embrace the same ideas
Throw it away
Let's make pretend

Little heart and soul
Little space and time
Little love and peace
Little crack on the mind
In the wind is the light
In the wind is the pulse
I'm a war machine
It's the same idea
Over and over again
The storm is here
It's the same idea
Over and over again
The storm is here
The storm is here
The storm is here

Little heart and soul
Little space and time
Little love and peace
Little crack on the mind
In the wind is the light
In the wind is the pulse
Oh, little heart and soul
Little space and time
Little love and peace
Little crack on the mind
In the wind is the light
In the wind is the pulse
I'm a war machine
I'm a war machine
It's the same idea
Over and over again
The storm is here
It's the same idea
Over and over again
The storm is here
The storm is
It'll hurt you, baby
It'll hurt
Oh, It'll hurt you, baby
It'll hurt
It'll hurt you, baby
It'll hurt
Oh, It'll hurt you, baby
It'll hurtEmbed
