When We Were Angels Lyrics
Come a little bit closer
You've got something, I say
Come a little bit closer
Led my mind astray
Look through my eyes, now, I want you to sing
Toast that I'm eyes and what this could have been

When we were angels we ran the place
When there were wolves we were part of the chase
When does the pressure become a crack?
When we were angels we had wings on our backs

Walk a little bit smaller
You've been dragging me down
Morning mister
Look through my eyes, now, I want you to sing
I wish it was tomorrow when the angels have been

When we were angels we ran the place
When there were wolves we were part of the chase
When does the pressure become a crack?
When we were angels we had wings on our backs
When we were angels we ran the place
When we were angels we ran the place
When we were angels we ran the place
When we were angels we ran the place
When we were angels we ran the place
When we were angels we ran the place
When we were angels we ran the place

When we were angels we ran the place
When there were wolves we were part of the chase
When does the pressure become a crack?
When we were angels we had wings on our backs
We had wings on our backs
We had wings on our backsEmbed
