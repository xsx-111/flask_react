When My Love Comes Down Lyrics
When my love comes down to meet you
When my love comes down to meet you again
When my love comes down to meet you
When my love comes down to meet you again

Your mouth is a hologram made of spiders bones
Your fingers little soldiers drumming on their way back home
I thought I saw a thundercloud on the avenue
Lightning rattled though the streets, yeah, that little storm was you

When my love comes down to meet you
When my love comes down to meet you again
When my love comes down to meet you
When my love comes down to meet you again

Your skin is like the falling snow, your hair is like the rising sun
Your tongue is like Kalashnikov or some other foreign gun
I see you standing there way down upon the street
You're marching victorious with your banners of defeat

Oh, when my love comes down to meet you
Oh, when my love comes down to meet you again
Oh, when my love comes down to meet you
Oh, when my love comes down to meet you again
When my love comes down to meet you
When my love comes down to meet you again
Oh, when my love comes down to meet you
Oh, when my love comes down to meet you againEmbed
