Depth Charge Ethel Lyrics
Come on, Jim

I entered the room and the canned laughter
Ethel was angled across some dude's knee
I offered to clothe her to feed and to bath her
If she'd just give me a little exclusivity

Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is something special
Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is special to me
Yeah

Ethel is a woman that a river runs through
She is famous throughout the land
People come and bathe in her, yeah, you know, I do
But lately its been getting right out of hand

Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is something special
Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is something special to me

To kiss Ethel is like drinking the stars
To not kiss her can make you come unglued
So if you want a piece of her you better get in there fast
Right now there is a ticket box and a queue
Depth Charge Ethel is something special
Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is something special to me

Depth Charge Ethel thinks we should all just take a chance
We should all love one another, it could be special
I'm in the back of a taxicab with ants in my pants
I can't sit still, I know there gonna send me
I know there gonna send me

Depth Charge Ethel, boy she's something special
Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is something special
Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is heavy metal
Yeah, heavy metal
Yeah, Depth Charge Ethel is something special to meEmbed
