Get It On Lyrics
I've gotta get up to get down and start all over again
Head on down to the basement and shout
Kick those white mice and black dogs out
Kick those white mice and baboons out
Kick those baboons and other motherfuckers out

And get it on get it on
On the day that you got born

They had to dig him from the ground
They chipped him from the frozen snow
They dug his monkey fingers
But he had no where to go
They dug his pink hair curlers
They dug his sequined gown
They dug his Stratocaster
They dug his pornographic crown

He's got some words of wisdom!
I got some words of wisdom!
He's got some words of wisdom!
I got some words of wisdom!
Get it on!
Get it on!
On the day that
You got born!

He crawled out of the ooze
He defied evolution
He had green flippers and sang the blues
He caused a revolution
He got in the British weeklies
He got in the dailies too
He drank panther piss and fucked the girls you're probably married to

He's got some words of wisdom!
I got some words of wisdom!
He's got some words of wisdom!
I got some words of wisdom!

Get it on!
Get it on!
On the day that
You got born!
You gotta do The Vaughan (do The Vaughan!)
Yeah, papa's down (papa's down!)
Sweets is sweet (sweets is sweet!)
Tex is on (tex is on!)

Then one day he went away
His neighbour claimed he'd shot him
If he hadn't of disappeared
The Taxman would have got him
Yeah but before I leave
I call out from the storm
For those who gave their lives
So we could get it on!

Get it on!
Get it on!
On the day that
You got born!
Get it on!
Get it on!
Get it on!
Get it on!Embed
