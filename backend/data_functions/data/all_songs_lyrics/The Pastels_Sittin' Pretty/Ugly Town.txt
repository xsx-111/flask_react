Ugly Town Lyrics
I was talking with the guardian angels
And they said it's not the way it seems
'Cause they work long hours
And they have bad dreams

You've got an eye for 
And just a little too much time
And though I try
I can't make you mine

Good times in an ugly town
One way streets they take you down
Your white dress is drying in the bathroom
My interest is dying of thirst

Your mother only had one daughter
I think I know the reason why
Angels on high
You can make them cryEmbed
