Holy Moly Lyrics
Holy Moly stoops so low
Movin' in before you know
She wears a cross all around her chest
Takes her  in her best
Strangest thing's her center part
The strangest thing's her magic lantern
She runs it up so bright
Shining red lights in her night

Holy Moly
Holy Moly
Holy Moly
Holy Moly
She goes out quickly
Comes back slowly
Holy Moly

Holy Moly, sweet serene
Her favourite group's The Vaselines
They know her, they watch her
They love her but they wouldn't touch her
She doesn't care, she thinks that's cool
And Holy Moly's no one's tool
She drops down to her knees
Saying, "Holy Father, give me a piece"
Holy Moly
Holy Moly
Holy Moly
Holy Moly
Oh, she goes out quickly
Comes back slowly
Holy Moly

Holy Moly's got a second sense
That always takes her to the incense
She wears a cross all around her chest
Takes her  in her best
Holy Moly, glory glory
Hallelujah, there she goes
She takes it on the nose
Says, "With a girl like me, "

When she smiles
You know she's gonna push you that extra mile

Holy Moly
Holy Moly
Holy Moly
Holy Moly
She goes out quickly
Comes back slowly
Holy MolyEmbed
