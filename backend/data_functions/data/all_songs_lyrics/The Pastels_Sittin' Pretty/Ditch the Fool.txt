Ditch the Fool LyricsOh babe, I can't believe
You'd even consider him for me
I'm hurt, I'm sure I'll recover
Just don't take him for your lover
I know he's new to you, but
He's only passin' through, now
I'm a kind and, I'm not cruel
But baby, please ditch the fool
This guy upstaging me
It really sucks, you've got to see
He's so slow, and he's no big show
Unoriginal from his head to his toe
What I'm saying is, he ain't a clue
Well, he tries so hard but, I ain't fooled
See, I'm a kind and, I'm not cruel
But baby, please ditch the fool
Take these legs and use them to walk
And that pretty head, use it to think
And tell the guy to go take a walk
And with these words just make him feel small
You don't need him and you can't help him
And it's not a problem, say it's not a problem
See, I'm a kind and, I'm not cruel
But baby, please ditch the fool
Swear I love you, 'til the death
Swear I love you, 'til the death
I swear I love you 'til the death
Swear I love you, 'til there's nothing left
Swear I love you, 'til the death
I swear I love you 'til the death
I swear I love you 'til the deathEmbed
