Sit on It Mother Lyrics
I know some girls from 'round my way
Burr me up with their evil stares
They’re jokers but I'm not laughing
Only mention it in the passin'
I don’t want hit but open your gate
And let me get to the bottom of it

Laura love to get put into orbit
Just to get her an astronaut
She keeps her head in her pocket
She's saving up for a big blue rocket
She's always one planet ahead
Looks real cute in her pink spacesuit
Hope she gets that astronaut

I know a girl from NYC
Walked on out on her baby
Hitched a ride with her lover
A chic gig mama, female trucker
They're close like a pair of crows
And I don't need any more of those

Traded a pal from Rocky Springs
Has a certain way with things
She's free wheelin', open deal
S-S-Say it once and once with feeling
Sit on it mother, I ain't no witch
You’re hooking me up to a fever pitch, now
Some girls are quite obscure, and
Some boys don’t get the truth
They see each smile as an emblem
A promise of sex on a sunny day
And they're trying to make a connection
But don’t look up when the sun comes down
Don't look up when the sun comes down
Don't look up when the sun comes down
Don't look up when the sun comes down
Don’t look up when the sun comes downEmbed
