Nothing to Be Done LyricsTake my hand and take my heart
I shiver when you're near
Deliver me from everything that drives me, oh my dear
Accelerate your pain
White knuckles on the wheel again
Shut your mouth, let's move on out of here
Just try and keep it light
Or someone may get hurt tonight
Don't talk that way, don't talk that way, don't talk that way
Hold it there a second
Let me dump this stupid pride
I'm ready for you sweet-heart
Now my mind is open wide
Shut up and make it count
Your concentration paramount
Remember what was meant to be this year
The past is a disaster
And the future's coming faster now
What do you say we go and get a beer?
Simply nothing to be done
Oh, tell me I'm the only one
Simply nothing to be done
Tell me I'm the only one
When I was young
I used to sing
I didn't care for anything
When I was young I used to sing
I didn't care for anything
Simply nothing to be done
Tell me I'm the only one2Embed
