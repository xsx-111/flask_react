Miracle on 42nd Street Lyrics
I know a bundle of humanity
She's about so high
I'm nearly driven to instantly
When she passes by
She's a sunny little honey but oh so hard to kiss
I'll try to over come her vanity
And then I'll tell her this

I'm young and healthy
And you've got charms
It would be a sin
Not to have you in my arms

I'm young and healthy
And so are you
When the moon is in the sky
Tell me what I am to do?Embed
