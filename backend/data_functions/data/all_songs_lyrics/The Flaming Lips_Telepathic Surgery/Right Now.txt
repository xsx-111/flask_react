Right Now Lyrics
The daylight rips at my naked thoughts
A hundred miles an hour
But I'm still lost right now
We think we know just who we are
But sometimes I think we've gone too far
Right now ... right now

In my head all my engines die
And it's scraping pieces out of the sky right now
Once I thought I had figured it out
In dream I knew what it was all about

My life and times are lying on the floor
I am never walking through there no more
And I'm walking down this highway
I don't know the year, I don't know the dayEmbed
