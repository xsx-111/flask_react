Hari-Krishna Stomp Wagon (Fuck Led Zeppelin) Lyrics
I got this can of gasoline, I think you know what I mean
I got it just for burning and it keeps the sirens turning
Turning down existence, it seems to burn all by itself

I wish that something would happen just so I'd get a reaction
From all these bucks I'm earning, it keeps the sirens turning
Turning down existence, it seems to burn all by itself
And we don't care

So I just keep on smiling while all the bad compiling
My teeth are white and burning, it keeps the sirens turning
Turning down existence, it seems to burn all by itselfEmbed
