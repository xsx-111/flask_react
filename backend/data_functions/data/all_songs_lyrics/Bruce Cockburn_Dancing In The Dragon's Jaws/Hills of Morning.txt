Hills of Morning Lyrics
Underneath the mask of the sulphur sky
A bunch of us were busy waiting
Watching the people looking ill at ease
Watching the fraying rope get closer to breaking

Women and men moved back and forth
In between effect and cause
And just beyond the range of normal sight
This glittering joker was dancing in the dragon's jaws

Let me be a little of your breath
Moving over the face of the deep
I want to be a particle of your light
Flowing over the hills of morning

The only sign you gave of who you were
When you first came walking down the road
Was the way the dust motes danced around
Your feet in a cloud of gold

But everything you see's not the way it seems
Tears can sing and joy shed tears
You can take the wisdom of this world
And give it to the ones who think it all ends here
Let me be a little of your breath
Moving over the face of the deep
I want to be a particle of your light
Flowing over the hills of morning
(Flowing) Flowing over the hills of morning
(Over the hills) Flowing over the hills of morningEmbed
