Wondering Where the Lions Are Lyrics
Sun's up, mmm hmm, looks okay
The world survives into another day
And I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

I had another dream about lions at the door
They weren't half as frightening as they were before
But I'm thinking 'bout eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

Walls windows trees, waves coming through
You be in me and I'll be in you
Together in eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

Up among the firs where it smells so sweet
Or down in the valley where the river used to be
I got my mind on eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

And I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are, uh huh
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Mmm, wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Uh huh
Uh huh
Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake
Thousand-year-old petroglyphs doing a double take
Pointing a finger at eternity
I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy

Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun
Polished and precise like the brain behind the gun
(Should be!) They got me thinking about eternity
But some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

And I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are, uh huh
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Mmm, wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Oh oh
Oh
Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay
One of these days we're gonna sail away
Gonna sail into eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

And I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Oh, wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Ooh, I'm wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Oh, wondering where the lions are
(Wondering where the lions are)
Uh huh (Wondering where the lions are)
Uh huh (Wondering where the lions are)
Uh huh (Wondering where the lions are)
Oh (Wondering where the lions are)
Mmm (Wondering where the lions are)Embed
