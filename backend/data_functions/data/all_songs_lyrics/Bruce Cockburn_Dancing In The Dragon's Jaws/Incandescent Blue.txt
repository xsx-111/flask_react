Incandescent Blue Lyrics
I sneaked across the border, it was threatening rain
So I could stand in this tunnel, waiting for the roaring train
And watch those black kids working out kung fu moves
If you don't want to be the horses' hoofprints
You got to be the hooves

Hear that lonesome violin play
See the notes float up into the overcast
And change to white birds as they sail on through
And soar away free
Into incandescent blue

People getting ready behind all those rectangles of light
"Put on your grin mask, babe
You know we're steppin' out tonight, yeah"
You hear that sound, like hammers only small?
It's what the people's heads say
When they beat them against the wall

Hear that lonesome violin play
See the notes float up into the overcast
And change to white birds as they sail on through
And soar away free
Into incandescent blue
Concrete vortex sucks down the wind
It's howling like a blinded violin
Oh, tongues of fire, come and kiss my brow
If I ever needed you
Well I need you now

Hear that lonesome violin play
See the notes float up into the overcast
And change to white birds as they sail on through
And soar away free
Into incandescent blue1Embed
