One Big Family Lyrics
Get ready for the judge in me
He's coming over, get on your feet
All of my goodness is all I got for you
Have I shown you lately what my clan can do?
I own your arse now by rights, yeah

We got family
We got family
So when I call you up, get y'all in
We got family
We got family
So when I call you up, get y'all in

Get ready for the judge in me
He's coming over, get on your feet
All of my goodness is all I got for you
Have I shown you lately what my clan can do?
I own your arse now by rights, yeah

We got family
We got family
So when I call you up, get y'all in
We got family
We got family
So when I call you up, get y'all in
We got family
We got family
So when I call you up, get y'all inEmbed
