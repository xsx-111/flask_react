Retread Lyrics
My girl is just a retread
I lost her when I hit the brake
Our love hit science fiction levels
Now I'm bending 'cause I've made a mistake
Here I stand afraid
With no more to say

Now I feel so insecure
I can't save something I feel so much for
Won't you stay and leave a light for me?

Now I've found myself redeemed
'Cause no one's seen the bad in me
Or been where I've been
And not turned to leave

Now I feel so insecure
I can't save something I feel so much for
Won't you stay?

You know if you had a wing you'd be the last to know
You could fly
He strokes your hair to keep you down
Will you fight?
Let's see you fight
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
The good will out and I'll come clean
There's nothing in between
You and me, so let me go my wayEmbed
