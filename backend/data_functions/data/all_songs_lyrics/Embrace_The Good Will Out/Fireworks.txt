Fireworks Lyrics
I stretched over to reach you
I tried to meet you, I've been wrong
Now the fireworks in me are all gone
It's time I realized

My girl, you make all the smart moves
And you see through all my wrongs
When the fireworks in me are all wrong
Well, then I realized

And I don't need convincing
I've seen enough to want to try
And change things
You fell in love, I fell in line
I thought I'd found my place
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
Have I let you
I never let you down

I work all day and I won't fight
When it feels right and it's wrong
When the fireworks in me are all gone
Well, then I realized
And I won't need convincing
I've seen enough to want to try
And change things
You fell in love, I fell in line
I thought I'd found my place
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
Could I leave you?
I never let you downEmbed
