Higher Sights Lyrics
Silence is all that I have to say to you
Mountains like me and you don't hear the rules
About what we can or we can't do
I don't want to learn if learning lets you
Bring those eyes down with you

If you truly learn how to cover
You won't forget how it's done
Then you go and give me a bug I can't beat
Stuck with the wrong in us inside me
It takes its time, but when it breaks free
Break off those heels, twist till you leave

Then we'll dance, those plans we make
Won't last, they'll wear and fade
Like fools, too young to run out of time
We'll always set our sights high

If you truly learn how to cover
You won't forget how it's done
Then you go and give me a bug I can't beat
Stuck with the wrong in us inside me
It takes its time, but when it breaks free
Break off those heels, twist till you leave
Then we'll dance, those plans we make
Won't last, they'll wear and fade
Like fools, too young to run out of time
We'll lose our way
We'll dance, those plans we make
Won't last, they'll wear and fade
Like fools, too young to run out of time
We'll always set our sights too highEmbed
