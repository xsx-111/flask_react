Come Back to What You Know Lyrics
Come back to what you know
Take everything real slow
I wanna lose you but I can't let you go

Before you interfere
Let me make it loud and clear
That you got no more to prove, I'm the fool

So take it easy on yourself
There's nothing new about regretting how you felt
I'll never let you down
Or ever feel the way that I've been fearing now

I'm coming back to what you know won't mean a thing
Everything that you've done keeps you from me
Now I know that I need more time
Come back and let me see you're right
I'm coming back to what you know
'Cause I know that I need it now it's gone
Now I know that I need more time
Come back and let me see you're right
So hang on to what you got, keep it safe
Hang on to what you got, keep it safe from harm
You'll find there's nothing new that we can't leave behind

Come back to what you know
Take everything real slow
I wanna lose you but I got far too high to let go
Now the demon in me knows what I knew so long ago

I'm coming back to what you know won't mean a thing
Everything that you've done keeps you from me
Now I know that I need more time
Come back and let me see you're right
I'm coming back to what you know
'Cause I know that I need it now it's gone
Now I know that I need more time
Come back and let me see you're right

So hang on to what you got, keep it safe
Hang on to what you got, keep it safe from harm
We've got time
We got time
I'm coming back to what you know won't mean a thing
Everything that you've done keeps you from me
Now I know that I need more time
Come back and let me see you're right
I'm coming back to what you know
'Cause I know that I need it now it's gone
Now I know that I need more time
Come back and let me see you're right

Come back to what you know
Take everything real slow
I tried to lose you but I got far too close1Embed
