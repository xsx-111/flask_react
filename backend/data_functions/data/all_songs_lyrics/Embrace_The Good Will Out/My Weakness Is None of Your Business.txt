My Weakness Is None of Your Business Lyrics
Don't wanna let you down
I've been lucky, I was lost, now I'm found
You could be the first
In the universe who's glad they're watered down

That's why I get that shallow feeling that you like
I'll never learn that I can't win

Don't wanna make a row
You do and it's your loss, I'm around
I don't mind doing everything
Hallelujah, you're the one, come back now

Sometimes I get that shallow feeling that you like
That you're hurt don't change a thing

Because my weakness is none of your business
The bad will always collect to one big melting pot
And all my weakness is none of your business
Somehow it always collects to one big melting pot
La la la la la la la
This could be our time
This could be our time
This could be our timeEmbed
