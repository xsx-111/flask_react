The Last Gas LyricsIt's the way I feel, it's the way I feel
I'm in yer hand do as we planned
Show me the way you kneel
Don't you kneel, it's the way I feel
Hungry for thirst, full fit to burst give me a go at the wheel
'Cause I, I just don't know which way I should turn
Look around my friend leave them all behind
I'm gonna take a look at all the things I find
So take a bow leave me out
It's the way I feel, it's the way I feel
I'm in yer hand do as we planned
Show me the way you kneel
Don't you kneel, it's the way I feel
Hungry for thirst, full fit to burst give me, give me a go at the wheel
