I Want the World LyricsMaybe I talk like the man
Who hangs on the lowest rung
And I don't wanna be like the man
Who begs on the lowest gold
And when you run out of time
I fly high above your stones
Another walk down memory lane
Won't hide all the luck you've stole
Yeah, while you doubt me
You're so wise
You spread the word
If you're alive then why aren't you living
And I want the world
And I want the world
Maybe I talk like the man
Who hangs from the lowest rung
And I don't wanna be like the man
Who begs on the lowest gold
Yeah, don't you doubt me
If you're wise
Then spread the word
If you're alive then why aren't you living
And I want the world
And I want the world
And all the life I've had I've spent
Looking out for someone who knows
We won't come down
Cos I'm a million strong
And so's the light I've found
And all the life I've had I've spent
Looking out for someone who knows
We won't come down
Cos I'm a million strong
And so's the light I've foundEmbed
