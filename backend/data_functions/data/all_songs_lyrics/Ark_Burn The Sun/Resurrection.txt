Resurrection LyricsHigh On You
I Feel Love Again
There's No Pretending Here
It's Long Ago Since I've Had A Reason
So Strong And True
It's All Because Of You Girl
I Used To Be A Bird Of Prey
Crying To Be Heard
A Heavy Heart
Carrying The Weight Of Sorrow
Talking About It
You Were There Saving Me From Darkness
Life Has Never Been - Ever Seemed So Bright
Ooh On The Day You Came To Me
The Way That You Paralyze - No Disguise
I Realize The Power
Lost In A Sea Of Love
Don't Wake Me If I'm Dreaming
I Used To Be A Bird Of Prey
Crying To Be Heard
A Heavy Heart
Carrying The Weight Of Sorrow
Solitude And Broken Hearts
Living All Around Us
Centuries Of Asking "why The Wind Blows Here"
Search A Solution To Save Us From Pain
From Falling To Pieces
I Survived A War With Demons
And I've Erased The Past
It's A New Beginning.waking Up
Waking From My Sleep
I Feel Alive.and We're Gonna Dance
You Woke Me From My Sleep
I Feel Alive Baby
And We're Gonna Dance Tonight.it's Alright
I Used To Be A Bird Of Prey
Crying To Be Heard
A Heavy Heart
Carrying The Weight Of Sorrow
And The Piper Plays The Call
Come On. Come Marching OnEmbed
