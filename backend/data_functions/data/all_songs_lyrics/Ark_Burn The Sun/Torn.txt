Torn LyricsDo You Feel The Pressure Overpowering
A Universal Force
Asking You For More
Cutting To The Core
An Unspeakable Surrender
I'm Drifting On A Summer Wind
I Pray To God Here.i Pray To God
In Trance From The Very Beginning
Dancing On A Dream
Asking For More
Eyes Getting Soar
Under The Starlight
I'm Drifting On A Summer Wind
I Pray To God Here
Thrown To The Sun
No Warning Came
Visions Of Light So Clear
But I'm Torn
So Many People Falling Down
Frustrated Masses Crawl
The Blood Of The Earth
A Planted Seed
The Tolling Of Bells Revealed
I'm Drifting On A Summer Wind
I Pray To God Here
Thrown To The Sun
No Warning Came
Visions Of Light So Clear
