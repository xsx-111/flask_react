Noose LyricsWalked Through The Crowd
My Head Hung Low
Their Sending An Innocent Soul
As The Angels Circle Dragon Hill
And Satan Sets His Stage
It's A Sacrifice For The People
An Act Of Evil
No One To Hear You Cry
Only There To Watch You Die
Soon You'll Be Breathless
Dealt Is The Card Of The Hangman
No One To Hear You Cry
Only There To Watch You Die
Soon You'll Be Breathless
Dealt Is The Card Of The Hangman
I Stared Into The Crystal Full Of Prophecies
Human Characters In The Book Of Change
As The Angels Circle Dragon Hill
And Satan Sets His Stage
A Sacrifice For The People
An Act Of Evil
Pleading To The Stars
Deliver Me From Madness
No One To Hear You Cry
Only There To Watch You Die
Soon You'll Be Breathless
Dealt Is The Card Of The Hangman
No One To Hear You Cry
Only There To Watch You Die
Soon You'll Be Breathless
Dealt Is The Card Of The Hangman
We Are Moving Towards Time Untold
In For Infinity
Forever Endlessly
Building The Tower Of Knowledge And Power
No One To Hear You Cry
Only There To Watch You Die
Soon You'll Be Breathless
Dealt Is The Card Of The Hangman
No One To Hear Us Cry
There's No Time For You And I
Soon We'll Be Breathless
Dealt Is The Card For The Hangman
So Much For The Future
Flooded With Sorrow
Will We See Tomorrow
No One Will Hear You Cry
Only There To Watch You Die
Soon You'll Be Breathless
Dealt Is The Card Of The HangmanEmbed
