Burn the Sun LyricsEnigmas of mind
Space and time
The unexplained protected files
Portraits from the other side
Flying saucer shooting high
Tours through the solar system
A product of imagination
Closer than you realize
A science fiction reality
Trying to burn the sun
Flames getting higher
Playing with fire
Higher and we can't run
There's too many power games
Paranormal starbirth child
Fast as lightning beams the sky
A million miles passing by
Asteroid storms in the line of fire
A ride through the solar system
A product of imagination
Closer than you realize
A science fiction reality
Trying to burn the sun
Flames getting higher
Playing with fire
Higher and we can't run
There's too many power games
Trying to burn the sun
Flames getting higher
Playing with fire
Higher and we can't run
There's too many power games
Trying to burn the sun
Flames getting higher
Playing with fire
Higher and we can't run
There's too many power games
Trying to burn the sun
Flames getting higher
Playing with fire
Higher and we can't run
Too many power games
Trying to burn the sun
Higher and we can't run
There's too many power games
Too many power games
Burn the sunEmbed
