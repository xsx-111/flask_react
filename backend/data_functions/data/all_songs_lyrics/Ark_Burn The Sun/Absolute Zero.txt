Absolute Zero LyricsAs Above So Below
Forever And Always Existing
Chemical Elements
From Crush To The Core
Magnetic Disturbance
Particles From Solar Flare
Aurora Phenomena
Restart The Cycle
Planets Will Implode
Waiting For The Big Bang
Near Absolute Zero
So Cold It Burns
Iced Over Like Wise Men
A Cry For The Mid Day Sun
Electrical Conductors
Hundreds Of Years Freezing
Trigonometric Flight To The Sun
Fragments Of Galaxies On The Run
Escaping From The Eclipse Of Eternity
Waiting For The Big Bang
Near Absolute Zero
So Cold It Burns
Iced Over Like Wise Men
A Cry From The Midnight Sun
A Universe Not Without End
But With An Infinite Number Of Endings
And Beginnings
Fragments Becoming Galaxies.created
Destroyed And Recreated
Near Absolute Zero
So Cold It Burns
Iced Over Like Wise Men
A Cry For The Mid Day Sun
Near Absolute Zero
So Cold It Burns
Iced Over Like Wise Men
A Cry For The Morning SunEmbed
