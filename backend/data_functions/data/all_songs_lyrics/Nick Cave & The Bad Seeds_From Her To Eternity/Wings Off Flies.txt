Wings Off Flies Lyrics
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not

We-e-ll, ah've spent seven days and seven nights
Tryin' to get sunk in this brine
Don't turn on ya water-wings
Cause ah got me a set of water-works, right?!
Insects suicide against the window
And my heart goes out to those lil flies
There's a buzzin' in my ear
But it's more of her black-mail, Ham Shakespeare plus lies
Wings off Flies, She loves me, she loves me not
O o o o oh she loves me not!!

Lord, Ah've discovered the recipe of Heaven
Ya git solitude and ya mix with sanctuary and silence
Then bake it!
Listen, I plead guilty to misanthropy
So hang me! Ah'd appreciate it!!
Witness her gate-crash my tiny hell
With some obscene tête à tête
If ya wanna talk to me about Love'n'Pain
Consult my ulcer, it'd be happy to co-operate
Wings off Flies, she loves me, loves me not
Uh hey, Joe! Another outta do the job
Time to drown our lil fire, ya can keep the ashes
Now bye bye, bye, bye, see ya in a pigs eye!
Ah will be one, in need of no-one
In this, my deepest dive...
Fill'er up, Joe...
Hey! Ah am obliged! Ah am obliged!
Wings off Flies, She loves me, she loves me not
Wings off Flies etc... ad infinitum

Welcome the solitary flyer ya
See it land on the rim of my glass
It's going around and around and around
Look I just don't have the heart to hurt a fly
I grabbed it in my paw
Snatched it up
And then I held it to my ear could hear it scream
Could hear it scream and scream and scream
Till it screamed not...
Hey Joe, ya know anything about this scream?1Embed
