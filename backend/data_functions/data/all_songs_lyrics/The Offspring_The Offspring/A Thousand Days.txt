A Thousand Days Lyrics
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you
I'll tell you no lies, when all is said and done
Does it really matter who's wrong or right?
Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain
Why hurt one other again and again
See while I'm bleeding I still, still reach for you

Thousand days, thousand days
Have passed away
Thousand days, thousand days
Were captured in her eyes

Your eyes are open now but you know
It's still hard to see inside
When the action and the intention are two separated things
Now I somehow wish I could explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
Like someone's dying breath I still, still reach for you


Forever we've been
Trapped by our hearts
Trapped by our minds
So I'd like to leave
I'd like to win at love
But I just can't let it go
And I just can't watch it slipping away
And I just can't let it go
And I just can't stand another minute
May be now someday our shattered lives
Will mend themselves again
Every now a million miles away, I still reach for you
And though I somehow know, I can't explain
Why we hurt one other again and again
Like someone's dying breath I still, still reach for you
Thousand days, thousand days
Aaa, aaa, ooo, aaa
Thousand days, thousand daysEmbed
