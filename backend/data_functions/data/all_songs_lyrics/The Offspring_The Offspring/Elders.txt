Elders Lyrics
When we were younger, there always seemed like some
Some perfect mold we were supposed to be
But now we're growing up and I see it's just not that way
Now I feel like someone's lied to me

’Cause I've been true, made good for you
And now I feel used, I'm asking you:
How does it feel, how does it feel
How does it feel, how does it feel to be like you?

Tell me now, elders, what were your reasons for
Making it seem like you were so much more?
If you want to feel good because of our accomplishments
Why the fuck don't you just do it yourself?

’Cause, man, I've tried, man, I've tried
While you just lied, so now just tell me:
How does it feel, how does it feel
How does it feel, how does it feel to be like you?

’Cause I've been true, made good for you
And now I feel used, I'm asking you:
How does it feel, how does it feel
How does it feel, how does it feel to be like you?
Look at all the families now who don't talk and don't trust
Because of the way that things have been done
When will you finally learn to leave out the bullshit
And just be straight with us?Embed
