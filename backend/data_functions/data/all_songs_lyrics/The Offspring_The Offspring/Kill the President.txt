Kill the President Lyrics
In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

Kill the President, voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy

In a world without leaders
Who'd make people starve?
The world that we're saving
Will always be ours
Everyone says, "Well, maybe I'll make a difference"
Thinking they've got plenty of time
But you're squeezed a little tighter everyday
Punished before you can commit a crime

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours
Kill the President, voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy

America, all of your enemies
Come from within but you lash out
So it is seen like some frightened child
In an angry world or the fall of Rome
Your demise comes from your own, your own hands

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

Kill the President, voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy

Kill the President, kill the President
Kill the President, kill the President
Kill the President, kill the President now!Embed
