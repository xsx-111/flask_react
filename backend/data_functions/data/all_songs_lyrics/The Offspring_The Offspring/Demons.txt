Demons Lyrics
Clouds pass over the moon
Like an eye that shows impending doom
Tension in this misty air
Souls pass into the room
Drawn in by a lost memory
You will join them in the moonlight

You are my offering
Your soul transcends the centuries of pain
Your misery in life
Is your ecstasy in death

Time passes like the wind
As we race to beat days dusky grin
The mornings just a moment away
Your body glistens in candlelight
As we all look on in fiendish delight
The ritual is just beginning

Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
As virgins and spectress sing
This madness will never cease
In the dead of night
You will follow in the footsteps of many others
Who have come before
I will show you at the altar
Your Aztec eyes, Egyptian hair
Your beauty bestowed upon my lair
I've loved you before in other lives
But you've never meant as much to me
Never meant as much to me as now
In this night of sacrifice
Where blood is spilt
That will never spill again
But in your linen robes
We want you now
You could never ask for more than


Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
This madness will never ceaseEmbed
