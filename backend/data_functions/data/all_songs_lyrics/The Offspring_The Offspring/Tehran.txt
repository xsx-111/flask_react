Tehran Lyrics
In your plane the blue sky
You roam again
Words that echo in your mind
Make your heart beat faster
This is no Vietnam
We will win in Iran

The President said "Let it ride, ride"
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

Warrior, the time bombs
About to go
What will you feel
You ever wonder?
If the man that's in your sights
Ever kissed his girl goodbye

The Captain said "Kill or die, die"
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran
Great Satan
Great Satan
Great Satan
(Our flags are burning)
Great Satan
(Our flags are burning)
Great Satan
(Our flags are burning)
(Aah)
Great Satan
(Our flags will burning)
(Aah)

Soon, America may find its young men in the sand
Where the casualty is just a number in Iran

The President said, "Let it ride, ride"
You will be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran
In Tehran
In TehranEmbed
