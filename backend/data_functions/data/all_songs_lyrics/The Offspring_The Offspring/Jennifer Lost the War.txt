Jennifer Lost the War Lyrics
Jennifer lost the war today
They'll find her burned and raped
Through it all, she must have wondered
"What have I done?"
But nobody really cares today
The world's a busy place
Guess she must have really sinned, now
Really sinned, now

I guess we're all just soldiers
But she was only six years old
Left to die by strangers
Her family waits
And if we're all just soldiers
Is it so wrong to be afraid?
Jennifer lost the war

Phoebe lost the war today
There must be some mistake
Say it happens all the time
And it's said and done
And Little Miss 1565
Your soul remains unclaimed
Guess you must have really sinned, now
Really sinned, now
Morality won't help her
When she lies silent in a morgue
And all our sorrows, well, just
Don't count at all
But will the morning headlines
Even say that it's a shame?
What are we heading for?
Jennifer lost the war

Seen it all before
Silent on the ground
As he's walking away
And I wonder how many more
Everybody'll take it
Like they've nothing to say
Jennifer lost, lost, lost, lost the war, now

I guess we're all just soldiers
But she was only six years old
Left to die by strangers
Her family waits
And will the morning headlines
Even say that it's a shame?
What are we heading for?2Embed
