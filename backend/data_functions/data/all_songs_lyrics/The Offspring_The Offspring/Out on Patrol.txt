Out on Patrol Lyrics
Look at you, soldier boy, now
With that big gun in your little hand
As you patrol this foreign land
Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet

Hey, hey, whoa
Now do you see the light?
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now?
What culmination to your speck of life?
Your moment in time

As you sit here all alone
Will your buddies come and save your life?
But as the enemy appears
See your life flash before your eyes

Hey, hey, whoa
Now do you see the light?
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now?
What culmination to your speck of life?
Your moment in time
Hey, hey, whoa
Now do you see the light?
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now?
What culmination to your speck of life?
Your moment in time

It's your life
It's your life
It's your life
(Ohh, ohh, ohh)
It's your life
It's your life
It's your life
(Ohh, ohh, ohh)
