Crossroads Lyrics
Time has washed away and now I may wonder
How did it all slip by?
â€™Cause I always thought we had forever
Future calls to me to take me away from things
I don't want to leave behind
Like I'm slipping away
I can't hold on
 x2
Find that path alone
Crossroads lead me away
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home
Through it all my mind still wanders
To the one who touched my soul
Though her road leads away
She's still my
True love
I could believe
Say it again, again, again
Will is not enough when all those
Lost days stand in the way
She was all my hopes and dreams, my
Whole world
I could believe
Been a long time, won't be again
I still want to know
Want to know
Who can see for me
Crossroads tell me

Now you'll have to trade
Your past away
And find another day
So is change a friend or an enemy
Through what comes to pass
I'll find my way
I've seen it all before
But is the best you can be
The best thing to be

Some people say
You're just wasting time
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's homeEmbed
