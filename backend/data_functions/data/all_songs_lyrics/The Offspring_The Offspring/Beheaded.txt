Beheaded Lyrics
Mommy doesn't have a head anymore
Keep it underneath my bed on the floor
Well that's alright, man that's ok
She never really used her head anyway
Daddy called me a silly boar
Bet he won't say that anymore
Because the way his body is severed in two
His vocal cords are going to be hard to use

Beheaded
Watch you squirt like a garden hose
Beheaded
Bloody mess all over my clothes

Watch my girlfriend come to the door
Chop off her head, she falls to the floor
Well watching my baby's jugular blow
Really makes my motor go
Wrap a towel round the bloody stump
Take my baby's body to the city dump
Then wipe the mess off the bloody axe
Scoop all the heads into my burlap sack
Beheaded
Watch you squirt like a garden hose
Beheaded
Bloody mess all over my clothes

All my collection
Adorns my room on bamboo polls
Used to be a little
But a little got more and more
Now I'm craving yours
Night brings bad dreams
Bad dreams and guillotines
Night brings bad dreams
Bad dreams and guillotines
Off with her head

Find another victim for my machine
Put them in a home made guillotine
Ah blade falls, gonna need a casket
Watch your head plop in a wicker basket
Leave the house at a quarter to four
Come back with sixteen or more
Because the more I walk, the more I see
I got a funny feeling coming over me
Beheaded
Watch you squirt like a garden hose
Beheaded
Bloody mess all over my clothesEmbed
