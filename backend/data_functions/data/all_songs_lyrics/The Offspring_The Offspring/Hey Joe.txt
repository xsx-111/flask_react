Hey Joe Lyrics
Hey Joe
Said where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe
Said where you going with that gun in your hand?
He said "I'm going to shoot my old lady down
I caught her messing around with another man"
He said "I'm going to shoot my old lady down
You know I caught her messing around on me"

Hey Joe
I heard that you shot your old lady down
Hey Joe
I heard that you caught your lady fucking some other guy
And you shot her down
"Well, uh, you know I guess that's true and all
I guess you can say I shot her, yeah!
Well yes I did, I said I did, I shot her down
Say yes I did, I said I did, I shot her down to the ground"

So, hey Joe
Where you going to run to now?
Said where you gonna go to? Where you gonna run?
Where you gonna hide?
"Well I said I'm going way down south to Mexico, hey
No one's gonna put a noose around me
I said I'm going way down south to Mexico, hey
Where I can be free, yayayayaya"
