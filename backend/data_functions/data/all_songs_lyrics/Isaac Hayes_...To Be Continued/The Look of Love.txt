The Look of Love LyricsThe look of love is in your eyes
The look your heart can't disguise
The look of love is saying so much more
Than words could ever say, yeah
A look my heart has heard
My, my takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I've waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
The look of love
Oh, it's on your face
Oh, mama that look time can't erase
Be mine tonight
And let this be
The start of so many
Groovy nights like this, yeah
Let's take a lover's vow
And seal this thing with a kiss
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Oh no
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
The look of love
Don't go
I love you
Oh, baby
The look of love
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
