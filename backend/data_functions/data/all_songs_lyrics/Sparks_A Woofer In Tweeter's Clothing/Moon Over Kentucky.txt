Moon Over Kentucky LyricsI heard somewhere that they're stamping, trampling all upon you
Your pocked face remains impassive though I know it hurts you
Moon over Kentucky
Take me with you
Full moon over Kentucky
Leave this mooring and seek some new rendezvous
Cut your ties with this possessive mother, she'll destroy you
Cut your ties and find another one who will respect you
Moon over Kentucky
Take me with you
Full moon over Kentucky
Leave this mooring and seek some new rendezvous
You've been waiting for your first encounter, what a letdown
I'm just finishing my first encounter, what a letdown
Moon over Kentucky
Take me with you
Full moon over Kentucky
Leave this mooring and seek some new rendezvousEmbed
