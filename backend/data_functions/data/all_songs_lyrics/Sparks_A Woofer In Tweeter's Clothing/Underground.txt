Underground LyricsWhy don't you please go with me underground
Down under seas, you and me underground
Once I dreamed I was on a basement tape
Took in just one take
Oh Lord, we gained our world distribution by relevant means
Jazz folk-rock fusion appealed to the teens
Why don't ya please go with me underground
Where love is free and super-groups can be found
Take the plunge now deep into the earth
Where heavy sets do lurk
Oh you and I and mystery follows close at our heels
Whispering secrets and travelling concealed
Down under cities and the roots of the trees
Oh how I love you in times such as these
We shall sail off over rainbows till we spy the lands that come together
Smiles will greet us, heads will turn to meet us as we make the scene, as we would make the scene
Oh won't you please go with me underground
Oh won't you please go with me underground
Oh won't you please pleaseEmbed
