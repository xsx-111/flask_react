Do Re Mi Lyrics
Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a smiling drop of sun
Mi, the name I call myself
Fa's a long long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Ti's a drink I have with my bread
Which would bring us back to Do

Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a smiling drop of sun
Mi, the name I call myself
Fa's a long long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Ti's a drink I have with my bread
Which would bring us back to Do

Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a smiling drop of sun
Mi, the name I call myself
Fa's a long long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Ti's a drink I have with my bread
Which would bring us back to Do
(Spoken)
Oh yeah

Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a smiling drop of sun
Mi, the name I call myself
Fa's a long long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Ti's a drink I have with my bread
Which would bring us back to Do

Which would bring us back to Do
Which would bring us back to DoEmbed
