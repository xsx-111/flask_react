Nothing Is Sacred LyricsNOTHING...no nothing, IS...is, SACRED ...no sacred, ANY MORE
Adding some of this to some of that Madame Science wins again
We are now forever people, we'll outlive our will to live
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
I remember when I needed you several billion years ago
If you'll hang on just a trifle more I might need you once again
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
I am sure you will appreciate your new found leisure time
I am sure we will appreciate our new found leisure time
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
Well, if you have the money I've got time
And if you know a honey I've got time
If you have the money I've got time
And if you know a honey I've got time
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more
Nothing is sacred any more...Embed
