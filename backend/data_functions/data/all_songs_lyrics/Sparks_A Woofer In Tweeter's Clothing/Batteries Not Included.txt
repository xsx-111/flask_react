Batteries Not Included LyricsI brought it home and I opened it up
And a smile came to my face for the first time in a while
Yes a smile came to my face for the first time in a while
I turned it on
But nothing happened when I did
Nothing happened at all
I kicked it down the stairs
I threw it at the wall
Hey kid, batteries not includedEmbed
