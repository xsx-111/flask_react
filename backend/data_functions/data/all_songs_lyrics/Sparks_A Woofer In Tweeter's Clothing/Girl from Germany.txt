Girl from Germany LyricsHow I wished my folks were gracious hosts and not dismayed
But wit and wisdom take a backseat girl when you're that afraid
Oh no, bring her home and the folks look ill
My word, they can't forget, they never will
They can hear the storm troops on our lawn when I show her in
And the Fuhrer is alive and well in our panelled den
Oh no, bring her home and the folks look ill
My word, they can't forget that war, what a war
My word, she's from Germany
Well, it's the same old country but the people have changed
My word... Germany
With its splendid castles and its fine cuisine
Well, the car I drive is parked outside, it's German-made
They resent that less than the people who are German-made
Oh no, bring her home and the folks look ill
My word, they can't forget that war, what a war, some war
My word... Germany
Well, it's the same old country but the people have changed
My word... Germany
With its splendid castles and its fine cuisine, its lovely German women
And its wonderful rivers that do flow from her hills
My word, she's from Germany
Well, it's the same old country but the people have changed
My word, she's from Germany
With its splendid castles and its fine cuisine
My word, she's from Germany
Well, it's the same old country but the people have changed
My word, she's from Germany
With its splendid castles and its fine cuisine
My word, she's from Germany
Well, it's the same old country but the people have changed
My word, she's from Germany
With its splendid castles, its fine cuisine
Its lovely German women and you and me!Embed
