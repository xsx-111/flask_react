Angus Desire LyricsSee private parts in public school
They look so odd, try something else
Unnatural acts, consent implied
No one objects to Angus Desire
No interviews please, no interviews please
Life's not so free for stockyard femme fatale
Nor is my life carefree and serene
All this comes free with Angus Desire
Summer heat ebbs, romance denied
It's back to school, that good-old college try
Why don't you stay with your own kind
Let's not admire Angus Desire
(Angus in the summer waltzing with her friends)Embed
