Ka-boom Ka-boom Lyrics
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom

We're a death-marching band, Peter Pan off the wagon
Entertain but never trust anyone sober
We're tasteless but taste good, my (S)top Hat's top hat(ed)
Unsafe cheerleaders with porn poms and pipe bombs

I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth
I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
Don't say "No", just say "Now"

I like a big car 'cause I'm a big star
I make a big rock and roll hits
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore
I am, I am, I am so yours

Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
I'd like to la la la la love you
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
I'd like to la la la la love you
I'm the leader of the club and I've shrugged off my mouse ears
We fly No-Class Dumbo jets and drive hardcore-vettes
We fight war with drugs and our sex always formal
We wear lawsuits when we get high, high, high

I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth
I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
Don't say no, just say now

I like a big car 'cause I'm a big star
I make a big rock and roll hits
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore
I am, I am, I am so yours

Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
I'd like to la la la la love you
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom
I'd like to la la la la love you
"Inhale exhale, let's all hail" (Hail! Hail! Hail!)
It's a depraved new world (Hail! Hail! Hail!)
"Inhale exhale, let's all hail" (Hail! Hail! Hail!)
It's a depraved new world, after all (Hail! Hail! Hail!)

I like a big car 'cause I'm a big star
I make a big rock and roll hits
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore
I am, I am, I am so yours
I am a big car and I'm a strip bar
Call it fake, I call it "good as it gets"
Nothing in this world is for real
Except you are for me and I am so yours

Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom1Embed
