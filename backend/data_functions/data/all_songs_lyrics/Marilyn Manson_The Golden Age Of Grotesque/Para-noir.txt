Para-noir Lyrics
I'd fuck you because you are famous
I'd fuck you for your money
I'd fuck you to control you
I'd fuck you so someday I can have half of everything you own
I'd fuck you to fuck you over
I'd fuck you until I find someone better
And fuck you in secret
I'd fuck you because I can't remember
If I'd already fucked you before
I'd fuck you out of boredom
I'd fuck you because I can't feel anything, anyways
I'd fuck you to make the pain go away

Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do
Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do

Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
I'd fuck you so I could feel something
Instead of nothing, at all
I'd fuck you because you are beautiful
I'd fuck you because you're my niggâ€‹er
I'd fuck you because I am your whore
I'd fuck you because you are a whore
I'd fuck you for fun
I'd fuck you for fun
I'd fuck you because I can
I'd fuck you so I have a place to stay
I'd fuck you so you will protect me

Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do
Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do

Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do

I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do

Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do
Hate you the way I do5Embed
