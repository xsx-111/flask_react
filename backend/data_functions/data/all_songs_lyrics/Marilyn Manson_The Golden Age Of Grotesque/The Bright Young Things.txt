The Bright Young Things Lyrics
We'll be the worms in your apple pie
Fake abuse for our bios, blacken our own eyes
Grass isn't greener on the other side
We set it on fire and we have no reason why

Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow
Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow

Good for nothing
But being everything that's bad, bad, bad
Good for nothing
But being everything that's bad, bad, bad

We know who we are and what we wanna say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things

Got my villain necktie and a mouth of hi-fi
So sharp, I'm bleeding from my Judas Hole
Arch Dandy no-goodnik and I'm headed for Crashville
Most monster with the groan box in the "Meat Show"
Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow
Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow

Good for nothing
But being everything that's bad, bad, bad
Good for nothing
But being everything that's bad, bad, bad

We know who we are and what we wanna say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things

Crashing the ether, we got the loudest stereotype
Even neophytes deep six your pro-life
We don't need to move a single prayer bone
We're so beautiful and damned, simply as a "still-life"!

Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause
Stop the song and remember what you used to be
Somebody that could fucking impress me
We know who we are and what we wanna say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things
We know who we are and what we wanna say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things

Good for nothing
But being everything that's bad, bad, bad
Good for nothing
But being everything that's bad2Embed
