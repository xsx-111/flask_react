Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth Lyrics
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

I am overground and out-selling it
Since God thinks I don't exist the beatings happen per minute
This is not blue-collar-white-corrective politics
I'm on a hate American style, kick

This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)
This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)

I'm on a campaign for pain
And when I get elected
I'll wipe the white off your house
The smile off your face
This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)
This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)

I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to be like anyone else
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to even be myself

I said, no, this isn't your song, we can't all get along
It's too hard to hold hands when your hand's a fist
My hate-pop won't ever stop, I'm fucking glad we're different
This is my hate American style, hit

Don't bring it, don't sing it
Use your fist and not your mouth
This is the black collar song (Hey!)
(Hey!) Put it in your middle finger and sing along
(Hey!) Use your fist and not your mouth (Hey!)
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)
This is the black collar song (Hey!)
(Hey!) Put it in your middle finger and sing along
(Hey!) Use your fist and not your mouth (Hey!)
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)
This is the black collar song (Hey!)
(Hey!) Put it in your middle finger and sing along
(Hey!) Use your fist and not your mouth (Hey!)
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)
This is the black collar song (Hey!)
(Hey!) Put it in your middle finger and sing along
(Hey!) Use your fist and not your mouth (Hey!)
(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)

I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to be like anyone else
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to even be myself5Embed
