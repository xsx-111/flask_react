Vodevil Lyrics
I wake up every day on the wrong side of the bed
I won't lay down on the floor like I'm the whore in your head
Call me a failure, pretender, sex-offender, infector
Say I killed all my friends and I deserve to be dead

Kiss, baby, kiss! Bang, baby, bang!
Suck, baby, suck, it's Vodevil
Kiss, baby, kiss! Bang, baby, bang!
Suck, baby, suck, it's Vodevil

This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!
This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!

I won't pull out, I just came, I want all of the blame
Your love is tin, faith is thin, no concept of pain, right to complain
All you fagazines, senile teens jaw me, black-ball me, deejay yourself away
Turn your back, it will be easier to stab

Kiss, baby, kiss! Bang, baby, bang!
Suck, baby, suck, it's Vodevil
Kiss, baby, kiss! Bang, baby, bang!
Suck, baby, suck, it's Vodevil
This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!
This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!

V.I.P, A.D.D, T.R.D, violent shiny hate crime
"Total Requested Dead", it's version point (less)
(Downloadable suicide)
The only ones left standing are the ones not demanding
This isn't a show, this is my fucking life
I'm not ashamed, you're entertained
But I'm not a puppet, I am a grenade
I'm not ashamed, you're entertained
But I'm not a puppet, I am a grenade

Kiss, baby, kiss! Bang, baby, bang!
Suck, baby, suck, it's Vodevil
Kiss, baby, kiss! Bang, baby, bang!
Suck, baby, suck, it's Vodevil

This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!
This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!
This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!
This isn't music, and we're not a band
We're five middle fingers on a motherfucking hand!3Embed
