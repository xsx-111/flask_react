This Is the New Shit Lyrics
Everything has been said before
There's nothing left to say, anymore
When it's all the same
You can ask for it by name

Babble babble, bitch bitch, rebel rebel, party party
Sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the "violence"
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in, everybody sing along
Babble babble, bitch bitch, rebel rebel, party party
Sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the "violence"
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in, everybody sing

Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it? (No!)
Do we want it? (Yeah!)
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Babble babble, bitch bitch, rebel rebel, party party
Sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the "violence"
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in, everybody sing along

Everything has been said before
Nothing left to say, anymore
When it's all the same
You can ask for it by name

Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it? (No!)
Do we want it? (Yeah!)
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

Now it's "You know who", I got the "You know what"
I stick it "You know where", you know why, you don't care
Now it's "You know who", I got the "You know what"
I stick it "You know where", you know why, you don't care
Now it's "You know who", I got the "You know what"
I stick it "You know where", you know why, you don't care
Now it's "You know who", I got the "You know what"
I stick it "You know where", you know why, you don't care
Babble babble, bitch bitch, rebel rebel, party party
Sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the "violence"
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in, everybody sing along

Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it? (No!)
Do we want it? (Yeah!)
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

So, let us entertain you
So, let us entertain you

So, let us entertain you
(Babble babble, bitch bitch, rebel rebel, party party
Sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the "violence"
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, everybody sing along)24Embed
