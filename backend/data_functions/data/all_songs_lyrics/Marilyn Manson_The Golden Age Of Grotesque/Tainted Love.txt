Tainted Love Lyrics
Sometimes, I feel I've got to run away
I've got to get away
From the pain you drive in the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

Once, I ran to you, now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I'll give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Tainted love (Oh-oh-oh)
Tainted love

Now, I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
Need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
Once, I ran to you, now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I'll give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Tainted love (Oh-oh-oh)
Tainted love

Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love

Once, I ran to you (I ran), now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I'll give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh-oh-oh)
Tainted love (Oh-oh-oh)
Tainted love (Oh-oh-oh)
