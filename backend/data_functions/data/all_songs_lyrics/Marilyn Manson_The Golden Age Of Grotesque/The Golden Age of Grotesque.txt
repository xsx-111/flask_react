The Golden Age of Grotesque Lyrics
All our monkeys have monkeys
We drive our deathcrush diamond Jaguar limousines
We're not fantastic motherfuckers
But we play them on TV

It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like
It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like

We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque

The devils are girls with Van Gogh's missing ear
You say what you want but filth is all that they hear
I've got the jigger to make all you bigger
Ladies und gentlemen
So drop your pissroom bait
And make sure you're not late
You tramps and lunatics
Here's a trick that's gonna make you click
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque

It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like
It's a "Dirty Word Reich," say what you like

So my Bon Mots, Hit-boy Tommy Trons
Rowdy rowdies, honey-fingered Goodbye Dolls
Hellzapoppin, open your Third Nostril
Put on your black face, and your God is gone

We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
We're the "Low Art Gloominati"
And we aim to depress
The "Scabaret Sacrilegends"
This is the Golden Age of Grotesque
We sing: la, la, la, la, la-la, la
We sing: la, la, la, la, la
We sing: la, la, la  la, la-la, la
We sing: la, la, la, la, la3Embed
