Better of Two Evils Lyrics
Haters call me "bitch", call me "faggot", call me "whitey"
But I'm something you can never be, hey!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Won't look prettier if I smile for the picture
Motherfuckers never liked me then
And they sure won't like me now
Don't try to drag me down in your clich√©
Your fake grin fits your faker face
I find all my pleasure in your misery, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'll step on you on my way up
I'll step on you on my way down
I'll step on you on my way up
I'll step on you on my way down

Haters call me "bitch", call me "faggot", call me "whitey"
But I am something that you'll never be, hey!
Haters call me "bitch", call me "faggot", call me "whitey"
But I am something that you'll never be, hey!
I'll be your scapegoat, I'll be your savior
I'm the better of two evils (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the better of two evils (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the better of two evils

I wanna hang all you cattle with your velvet rope
Motherfuckers step up and get into an orderly line
I'll show you how to make a muscle, takes less strength to grin
Than it does to spit on all you Paparazzinazi's, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'll step on you on my way up
I'll fuckin' step on you on my way down

Haters call me "bitch", call me "faggot", call me "whitey"
But I am something that you'll never be, hey!
Haters call me "bitch", call me "faggot", call me "whitey"
But I am something that you'll never be, hey!

I'll be your scapegoat, I'll be your savior
I'm the better of two evils (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the better of two evils (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the better of two evils
Don't try to lead me to temptation
Don't try to lead me to temptation
Don't try to lead me to temptation
I've been delivered and I already know the way
Hey!

Haters call me "bitch", call me "faggot", call me "whitey"
But I am something that you'll never be, hey!
Haters call me "bitch", call me "faggot", call me "whitey"
But I am something that you'll never be, hey!

I'll be your scapegoat, I'll be your savior
I'm the better of two evils (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the better of two evils (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the better of two evils (Yeah, yeah, yeah)4Embed
