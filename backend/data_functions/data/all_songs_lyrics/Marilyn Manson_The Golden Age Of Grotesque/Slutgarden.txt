Slutgarden Lyrics
I'll pretend that I want you for what is on the inside
But when I get inside I'll just want to get out
I'm your first and last deposit through sickness and in Hell
I'll never promise you a garden, you'll just water me down

I can't believe that you are for real
But I don't care as long as you're mine

When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)
When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)

I'm unsafe, I'm unsafe
I won't repent and so I memorize the words to the porno movies
It's the only thing I wanna believe
I memorize the words to the porno movies
This is a new religion to me

I'm a VCR funeral of dead-memory waste
And my smile's a chain-link fence that I have put up
I love the enemy, my love is the enemy
They say they don't want fame, but they get famous when we fuck
When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)
When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)

I'm unsafe, I'm unsafe
I won't repent and so I memorize the words to the porno movies
It's the only thing I wanna believe
I memorize the words to the porno movies
This is a new religion to me

I never believed the Devil was real
But God couldn't make someone filthy as you

When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)
When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)
When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)
When I said "We", you know I meant "Me"
And when I said "Sweet", I meant "Dirty" (Hey, hey)
You are the church, I am the steeple
When we fuck, we're all God's people
You are the church, I am the steeple
When we fuck, we're all God's people4Embed
