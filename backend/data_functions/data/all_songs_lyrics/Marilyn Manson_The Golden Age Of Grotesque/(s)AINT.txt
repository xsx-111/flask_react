(s)AINT Lyrics
I don't care if your world is ending today
Because I wasn't invited to it anyway
You said I tasted famous so I drew you a heart
But now I'm not an artist, I'm a fucking work of art

I've got an "F" and a "C" and I got a "K" too
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like "U"

You wanted perfect, you got your perfect
But now I'm too perfect for someone like you
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile
And you'll never be as perfect, whatever you do

What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"

I'm a bonetop, a death's head on a mopstick
You infected me, took diamonds, I took all your shit
Your "sell-by date" expired so you had to be sold
I'm a suffer-genius and vivi-sex symbol
You wanted perfect, you got your perfect
But now I'm too perfect for someone like you
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile
And you'll never be as perfect, whatever you do

What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"

I've got an "F" and a "C" and I got a "K" too
And the only thing that's missing is "U"
I've got an "F" and a "C" and I got a "K" too
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like "U"
I've got an "F" and a "C" and I got a "K" too
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like "U"

I am a dandy in the ghetto with a snow white smile
Super-ego bitch, I've been evil a while
I am a dandy in the ghetto with a snow white smile
Super-ego bitch, I've been evil a while
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the "S" because I am an "AIN'T"8Embed
