Moulinette LyricsEven in the dark
There's a light above in the sky
And even when it fades
On all of my breath and wait
At last
There will be sound above
At last
There will be glow far and wide
For the things of the past
Oh flesh will fill the thousand miles with wide
Dance with me, oh dance with all the noise that fills the sky
Blue and gold and fire and gold will never be uptight
Here a thousand days and thousand nights will pass us by
And even for the night
I will wait for this my love
To lie as the snow falls like destiny
At last
There will be sound above
At last
There will be glow far and wide
For the things of the past
Oh flesh will fill the thousand miles with wide
Dance with me, oh dance with all the noise that fills the sky
Blue and gold and fire and gold will never be uptight
Here a thousand days and thousand nights will pass us by
Blue and gold and fire and gold
Will never be in time
Dance with me, oh dance with me
Then lay me down to dieEmbed
