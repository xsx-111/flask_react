First We Kiss LyricsMy heart beats against the wardrobe
I hear the closing door
Beats against the window
Tell me how long, tell me how long
Feel it come from nowhere
Taking over me
Feel it come from nowhere
Tell me why, tell me why
First we'll kiss
Then you will lock the door, my dear
A perfect kiss
Just to remind what's between us
Tonight is here
Feel it come from nowhere
Taking over me
Feel it come from nowhere
Tell me why, tell me why
First we'll kiss
Then you will lock the door, my dear
A perfect kiss
Just to remind what's between us tonight
What's between us tonight, tonight
As I hear the closing door
Our face against the window
Our lips touch no more
And suddenly from up here
Everything's clear
The love we had between us tonight
Is hereEmbed
