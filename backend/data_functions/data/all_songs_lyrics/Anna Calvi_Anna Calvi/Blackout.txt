Blackout LyricsQuick, strike a flame cause the very last light is gone
I feel something coming as I'm running down the hall
Ooh

What is this darkness that's coming for my soul?
Should I fear you or should I just let go?
Ooh

Oh, blackout, (ooh)
I've gotta know where you're from
What are you trying to tell me, I don't know
Oh, blackout, (ooh)
Now this moment has come
Here in the dark, I could be anyone
I try and stand still but I feel you by my side
But even this moment is running out of time
Ooh

Oh, blackout, (ooh)
I've gotta know where you're from
What are you trying to tell me, I don't know
Oh, blackout, (ooh)
Now this moment has come
Here in the dark, I could be anyone
Ooh

Oh, blackout, (ooh)
Now this moment has come
What are you trying to tell me, I don't know
Oh, blackout, (ooh)
I won't fear where you're from
Cause here in the dark, I could be anyone
Don't leave, don't leave1Embed
