Suzanne & I LyricsSuzanne and I
Never will we be apart
Suzanne and I
Never will we be apart
But we hold, hold
Hold it down
Oh, we hold, hold
Hold it down
Cause the night calls me
When the wind leads behind the world
When the wind leads behind the world
But we hold, hold
Hold it down
Oh, we hold, hold
Hold it down
Cause the night calls for
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
We will rise
We hold, hold
Hold it down
Oh, we hold, hold
Hold it down
Oh, we hold, hold
Hold it down
Cause I'll never, ever, ever, ever be alone
Suzanne and I
Suzanne and I
