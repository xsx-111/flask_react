Morning Light LyricsMorning light
Morning light
Morning light
Morning light
All my life
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
I stand in the day for my feeling to rise
All my life
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
No lies in wait
Now thy day lies in wait
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Morning light
Morning light
Morning light
All my life
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
Farewell rise in the morning goodbye
Morning light
Morning light
Morning light
All my life
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
But you never be in love
Farewell rise in the morning goodbyeEmbed
