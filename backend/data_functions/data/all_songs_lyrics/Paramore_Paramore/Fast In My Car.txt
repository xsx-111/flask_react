Fast In My Car Lyrics
Been through the wringer a couple times
I came out callous and cruel
And my two friends know this very well
Because they went through it too
The three of us were initiates
We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal

Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, oh, oh-oh-oh
Tonight we want to have fun

No one's the same as they used to be
Much as we try to pretend
No one's as innocent as could be
We all fall short, we all sin
But now we aren't looking backward
We won't try raising the dead
We only see what's in front of us
We only see straight ahead
Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, oh, oh-oh-oh
Tonight we want to have fun


Get in my car and we'll drive around
We'll make believe we are free
Already proved we can tough it out
And we get along so sweetly

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, oh, oh-oh-oh
Tonight we want to have fun (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

We're driving fast in my car
We're driving fast in my car
And we're not looking for violence, oh, oh-oh-oh
We're driving fast in my car
And we want just to have fun12Embed
