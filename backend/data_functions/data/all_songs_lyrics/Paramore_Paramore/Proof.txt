Proof Lyrics
It's really hard
I can't cry in your arms 'cause you're not here
It's not your fault, and if it was, I wouldn't care
My heart is bigger than the distance in between us
I know it 'cause I feel it beating
So strong it'll knock you down
So strong, so strong

Over here
I can't count the miles away from where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling
Yeah, that’s what I always loved the most about you
You're so strong
Come and knock me down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
If I’m a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car
Drive it faster than I ever did before
Head out west until I finally reach the shore
And then I'll swim out to wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent down to the floor
Making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures
And pushing back on the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you know we won’t drown
You're so strong
The world can't keep us down, hey
Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
So do you love me? (Yeah)
All you got to do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
And I won't ever second guess
Now do you love me? (Yeah)
All you got to do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
Then you already proved it
Yeah, yeah, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There’s nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is
Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you13Embed
