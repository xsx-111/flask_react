Grow Up Lyrics
I told 'em all where to stick it
I left town with a dime to my name
Said I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game
Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
So I'll cry just a little then I'll dry my eyes
'Cause I'm not a little girl no more

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna to leave you behind

Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I won't ever understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care?
And lady, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream
And some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna to leave you behind

We get along for the most part
Me and reality, the light and the dark
We live alone, two different worlds
Me in a fantasy, you in your memories
But we get along
We get along (For the most part)
We get along (Yeah, for the most part)
We get along (For the most part)
We get along
We get along, we get along

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (Leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (Leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes (We grow up and never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna to leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes (We grow up and never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
