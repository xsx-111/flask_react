(One of Those) Crazy Girls Lyrics
Now when you say you wanna slow down
Does it mean you wanna slow dance?
Maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
On our romance
What do you mean I got it backwards?
You know we're gonna be forever
Why are you telling me goodbye?
Aren't you gonna stay the night?

Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Now I walk under a pink sky (ooh)
Lovers float along and pass me by
I pour my heart out to your voice mail
Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town
And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me
If you don't answer I'll just use the key that I copied
'Cause I really need to see you
If you're not here when I break in
I'm gonna go through your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim
I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again

Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times


I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls

Hey baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times
Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls20Embed
