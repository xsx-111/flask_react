Interlude: Holiday Lyrics
(Mhh)

Now I can move on to facing
Big girl problems
No more high school drama
Graduated with honors
And I'm drinking coffee while I
Read the paper
I've been saving money
Eating only top ramen

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Now I get a holiday
Wherever I go I might stay
I don't plan on coming back
Ever if I can help it
Now I get a holiday
I think I'll stay
Holiday, think I'll stay
Now I get a holiday8Embed
