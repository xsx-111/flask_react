Future Lyrics
Yeah
That's how you had it, yeah
Pretty sure
It is, it goes clapping a bit
Something just in that way
Alright, here we go
Gonna go an octave down this time

I'm writing the future
I'm writing it out, loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past now
So, I'm writing the future
I'm leaving a key here
Something won't always be missing
You won't always feel emptier

Ah-ah, mm-mm
Ah-ah-ah-ah, mm-mm

Just think of the future
And think of your dreams
You'll get away from here
You'll get away eventually
So, just think of the future
Think of a new life
And don't get lost in the memories
Keep your eyes on a new prize
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
