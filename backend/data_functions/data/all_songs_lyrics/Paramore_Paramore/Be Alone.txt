Be Alone Lyrics
So what if I don't have a lot to talk about?
I shut my mouth and keep it locked until it counts
And what if I don't ever want to leave my house?
Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out

Alone

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

I'll make the journey down the hall back to my room
And kill more time, and let it rot inside its tomb (inside its tomb)
See, I ain't one to climb some social ladder too
Some Shangri-La that all the cool kids will abuse

Alone
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

(We could be alone together)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm a loner, I'm in love with you alone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Come be a loner, be in love with me alone
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely
You should be alone with me10Embed
