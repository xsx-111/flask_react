Part II Lyrics
What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile broken things
A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light, now
There's a tiny spark

Oh glory
Come and find me
Oh glory
Come and find meÂ 

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

Here

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind
Oh glory
You will find me

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

(I'll be lost until)
Like the moon we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
So if you let me I will catch fire
To let your glory and mercy shine21Embed
