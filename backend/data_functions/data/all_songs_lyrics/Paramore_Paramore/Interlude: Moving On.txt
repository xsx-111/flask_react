Interlude: Moving On Lyrics
Let 'em have their time
Sit back and let 'em shine
Let 'em rise and rise
'Cause one day they're gonna fall
Let 'em soak in the sun
Sit back and let 'em have their fun
Let 'em spill their guts
'Cause one day they're gonna slip on 'em

Well I could be angry
But you're not worth the fight
And besides I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and now I'm feeling alright
And besides I'm moving on

Let 'em play their songs
Let 'em say what's right and wrong
Let 'em do their thing
'Cause they'll never be you and me
We've got our own style
We've got a way of living life
If they can't get down
Well we don't need them around
Well I could be angry
But you’re not worth the fight
And besides I’m moving on
I've counted to ten and now I’m feeling alright
And besides I’m moving
Yes I’m moving
Besides I’m moving on10Embed
