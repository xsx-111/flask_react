Anklebiters Lyrics
Why do you care what people think?
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know, anklebiters
Ate up your personality
Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else

Fall in love with yourself

Because someday you’re gonna be the only one you’ve got
Someday you’re gonna be the only one you’ve got
Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you’re gonna be the only one you’ve got

What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect?
You know, anklebiters
Gave you a false perception
And why do I (C'mon, c'mon) defend your ignorance?
Oh, why do I (C'mon, c'mon) defend the state you're in?
You should fall in love with yourself
Oh, again
Fall in love with yourself

Because someday you’re gonna be the only one you’ve got
Someday you’re gonna be the only one you’ve got
Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you’re gonna be the only one you’ve got

Anklebiters! Anklebiters!
Someday you’re gonna be alone
Anklebiters! Anklebiters!
