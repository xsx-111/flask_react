Hate To See Your Heart Break Lyrics
There is not a single word
In the whole world
That could describe the hurt
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth
And ripping through the softest skin there ever was

How were you to know?
Oh, how were you to know?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

Love happens all the time
To people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery?
How were you to know?
Well, how were you to know-oh-oh?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

For all the air that's in your lungs
For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind your heart can heal

Oh, how were you to know? (How were you to know?)
Oh, how were you to know?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before18Embed
