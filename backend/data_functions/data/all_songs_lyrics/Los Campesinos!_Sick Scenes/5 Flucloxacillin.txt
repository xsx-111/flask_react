5 Flucloxacillin Lyrics
Five Flucloxacillin rattle in the pit of my purse
Among the ones and the twos, I never finished a course
Doctor said, "Don't drink on antibiotics"
Reply, "It doesn't matter, hangover's always chronic anyway"

A peloton of OAPs cycling up behind me
Shouting, "Step up your paces, we've got places to be"
A pile-on of OAPs crashing in my slipstream
I turn, "Shut up your faces, I'm not your domestique"

They say if they had got the victory
They'd act with so much more humility
They say if they had got the victory
Well, I guess we'll never know

Am I a piggy bank of obsolete currency?
An order of merit from country known for tyranny?
Another blister pack pops, but I still feel much the same
Thirty-one, and depression is a young man's game

Found a fiver screwed up inside a prescription receipt
From the salbutamol (No, a gift from the sertraline)
Hallowed be somnolence brought on by the tramadol
Damned be the knowledge that's it, now you have tried 'em all
A peloton of OAPs cycling up behind me
Shouting, "Step up your paces, we've got places to be"
A pile-on of OAPs crashing in my slipstream
I turn, "Shut up your faces, I'm not your domestique"

They say if they had got the victory
They'd act with so much more humility
They say if they had got the victory
Well, I guess we'll never know
Well, I guess we'll never know
Well, I guess we'll never know
Well, I guess we'll never knowEmbed
