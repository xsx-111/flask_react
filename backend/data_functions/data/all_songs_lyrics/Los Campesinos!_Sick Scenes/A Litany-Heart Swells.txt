A Litany/Heart Swells Lyrics
A stack of words in my throat, a trail of slime
Forehead on fruit machine, three bells will not chime
For lovers who line the beach, whom moon entertains
Theirs always waxing while our crescent wanes
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back

Outside a chicken shop, a ceiling of stars
A nostril of Diet Coke, I'm back in your arms
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
Now, I feel the misery in your breast and mine
Is one and the same and I feel close to fine

I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
Your hand is on the pen but you can't sign the pact
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back

Heart swells, ah-ah
Heart swells, ah-ah

I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
Your hand is on the pen but you can't sign the pact
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
Your hand is on the pen but you can't sign the pact
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls backEmbed
