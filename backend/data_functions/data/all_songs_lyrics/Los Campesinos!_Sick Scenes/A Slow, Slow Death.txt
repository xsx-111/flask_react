A Slow, Slow Death Lyrics
We felt a chill from the breeze move in from the east
London pat its own back
Those with the means for the megaphone
Will always provide us the soundtrack
I started to diarise the coming of flies
When gloom is descending
So when it's back 'round again
I know it's a false start and not an ending

Some days I struggle to move
In elephant shoes, unwilling commuter
Anxiety in my chest, heart under duress
Taps out of sharpshooter
Preoccupied now for days by nostalgia waves
I hated the first time
A gambler's fallacy: the more I repeat
I won't be the punchline

You on a lilo
Are an island of the Pacific
And then me, me, me, I am face down
In a puddle on the High Street
I got your initials inside a heart tattoo
We two in vermillion, we two a lovers' coup
I got your initials inside a heart tattoo
We two in vermillion, we two a lovers' coup
I know little (I know little)
But I promise (But I promise)
There's a slow, slow death if you want it
If you want it

In time I will have to lie
These memories are mine, not in fact my father's
A schoolboy hero replaced, domestic disgrace
A sad sack, a martyr
We here are common as dirt
Three lions on our shirt with high expectations
Absolve this land of a Queen
Who feasts while we wean a small, hopeless nation

You on a lilo
Are an island of the Pacific
And then me, me, I am face down
In a puddle on the High Street
I got your initials inside a heart tattoo
We two in vermillion, we two a lovers' coup
I got your initials inside a heart tattoo
We two in vermillion, we two a lovers' coup
I know little (I know little)
But I promise (But I promise)
There's a slow, slow death if you want it
Yeah, I want it1Embed
