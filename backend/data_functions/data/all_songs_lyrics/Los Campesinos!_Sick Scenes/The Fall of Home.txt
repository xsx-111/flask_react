The Fall of Home Lyrics
Parent pick-up from off the train
Empty High Street in pouring rain
Funeral for a family pup
Teenage pubs all boarded up

Left your home town for somewhere new
Don't be surprised now it's leaving you
Another weekday night alone
The rise of rent, the fall of home
The fall of home

Battery dies on your monthly call
Budget cut at your primary school
Another family friend fell sick
Gave the fascists a thousand ticks

Left your home town for somewhere new
Don't be surprised now it's leaving you
Another weekday night alone
The rise of rent, the fall of home
The fall of home

Left your home town for somewhere new
Don't be surprised now it's leaving you
Another weekday night alone
The rise of rent, the fall of home
Left your home town for somewhere new
Don't be surprised now it's leaving you
The fall of homeEmbed
