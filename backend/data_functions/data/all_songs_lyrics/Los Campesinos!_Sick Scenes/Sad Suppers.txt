Sad Suppers Lyrics
Don't call it a come-on
In spite if not because of whatever
If extent of my ambition
Is a lawn to mow, a charger to tether
Introed at the braggers' amnesty
"The greatest lover in the cloisters"
When the neutrals started cheering me
That is the moment that they lost us

Never once a miser with the misery
Clever compromise, I replant potted history
You can't eat from spinning plates
Can't lick clean the mess it makes
Seen all there is to be shown
Darling, I'm coming home
Still flutters pitter-patter
Feeling embittered, battered
Behold the once and future me
Sad suppers for the saudade

Frogmarch through the city
Ascend another synthetic summit
Until I see the route crows fly to you
Then I will want no part of it
Save your epiphanies for sea level
Save them for Broadsands
Save them for throwing out time at Scribes West
Save them for chucking up in your own hands
Never once a miser with the misery
Clever compromise, I replant potted history
You can't eat from spinning plates
Can't lick clean the mess it makes
Seen all there is to be shown
Darling, I'm coming home
Still flutters pitter-patter
Feeling embittered, battered
Behold the once and future me
Sad suppers for the saudadeEmbed
