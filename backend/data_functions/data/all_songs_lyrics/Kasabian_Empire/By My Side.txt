By My Side Lyrics
Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on by my side
Come on both sides

Step out of the shadows
Said the children to their saint
You create these zombies
Just to keep them from their fate
No communication as the masses
Cheat and steal
Stars and constellations
Now I notice who you are

Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on

No retaliation
Said the poets to his kid
Separate the idols
And commit your deadly sin
And all this put aside
Wanna finish what you start
I'll connect the numbers
You protect my heart
Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on by my side
Come on both sides

No communication
From the poets to his kin
Separate the idols
And commit your deadly sin
No communication
Wanna finish what you start
I'll connect the numbers
You protect my heart

Come on by my side
Come on both sides
Come on by my side
Come on both sidesEmbed
