Stuntman Lyrics
No map looking for the one I love
'Cause the one I love is here
And no map looking for the one who stands
'Cause he's arming me from fear

He got tuned into, to the other side
Lives spent digging holes to the, to the ones you hide

See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes, now

More cuts taken for the one in silence
Now he sits between my ears
His moves in madness, how I love the rush
'Cause you wipe away these tears

And we got taken in by, by a rush of blood
My train's leaving now, how I wish I could
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of your eyes, now
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
(So take it, take it!)
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
(So take it, take it!)Embed
