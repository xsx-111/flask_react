Last Trip (In Flight) Lyrics
I don't sit alone
'Cause I've got you
Makin' tracks through these woods
I'm gonna get my blues
Just holdin' snacks
Dropping these tabs
A hero comes

Aah (x7)

This is the last trip
Just want to get you on your own
(He's in flight)
Said, this is the last trip
Just want to get you on your own
(Drag the system down)

Now, I don't see no lights
I don't taste no spit
Silent flash, hear the bang
I'm gonna get my rush
(This feeling)
No going back (This feeling)
Holding hands (This feeling)
With you, the circus comes
This feeling, aah
(He's in flight)
This feeling, aah
This feeling, aah
(He's in flight)
This feeling, aah
This feeling

This is the last trip
Just want to get you on your own
(He's in flight)
Said, this is the last trip
Just want to get you on your own
(He's in flight)
 (x2)
This feeling, aah
This feeling, aah
This feeling, aah
This feeling, aahEmbed
