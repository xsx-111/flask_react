Apnoea Lyrics
Tick demons off
You've set demons free
Issue my heart
On the weekend line
Last man in town
Set your body down
I summon you
To the aftermath

Apnoea
Bearing down on me
Apnoea
Bearing down on me
Apnoea
Bearing down on me
Apnoea
Bearing down on me
Apnoea
Bearing down on me
Apnoea
Bearing down on me

Get your boots in, man
Get your boots in, girl
See the babies drive
See the system bail
She said it isn't me
I said it isn't you
She's made a home
In my partway
Apnoea
Apnoea
Get your boots in, girl
Apnoea
Get your boots in, man
Apnoea
Get your boots in, girlEmbed
