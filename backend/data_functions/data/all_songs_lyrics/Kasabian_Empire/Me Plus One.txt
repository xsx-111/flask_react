Me Plus One Lyrics
Too messed up, I should have followed you
Where'd you get that smile and that fine hair?
I get my kicks from your walkin'
I should have gone, I should have been there

You come and take me away
Like a little white rabbit from yesterday
Little things said, said and done
I should have shot myself on the run
I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
So come on

She comes back from the winter
Lookin' straight into my eyes
Now I'm standing like a lunatic
I bet you feel, I bet you taste good

You come and take me away
Like a little white rabbit from yesterday
Little things said, said and done
I should have shot myself on the run
I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
So come onEmbed
