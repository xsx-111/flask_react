British Legion Lyrics
See, see how she dances with that cigarette in her hand
And she, she romances, everybody, like she can
She brings the lie and catches me again
Life, seen some wonders
I played my stupid games with you
Sing to me like I know you can
What girl would I be?
And she knits a snare catches me again

I guess you know to keep on dancing
Looking though you care

We’re gonna make it through
We’re gonna make it through now
Cos we’re gonna make it through
Cos we’re gonna make it through now
And the circus leaves town
Cos we’re gonna make it through
Yeah, said we can make it through now
Yeah, we’re gonna make it through
I said we can make it though now
And the boys with their dreams
For the boys and their dreams
I know you can hear meEmbed
