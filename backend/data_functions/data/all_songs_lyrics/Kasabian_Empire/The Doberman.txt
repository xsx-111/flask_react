The Doberman Lyrics
Silence in the yard
Doberman's asleep
You'll never have to lay your head down here
Watch them disappear
The truth is

They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again

This beat on London's sky
Whiskey's almost dry
I smile 'cause I've already escaped
Just like to see how far I can take it

They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again

They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again
(This is how I like it)
La, la la la lalala
La, la la la lalala
La, la la la lalala
La, la la la lalala


Silence in the yard
Doberman's asleep
You'll never have to lay your head down here
Watch them disappearEmbed
