Gorgeous Lyrics
Your face, look at you, you're gorgeous, gorgeous
Your face, look at you, you're gorgeous, gorgeous
Your face, look at you, you're gorgeous, gorgeous
Your face, look at you, you're gorgeous, gorgeous

Confused, overanalyze
Bowthai and I always been categorised
Casual like nothing really matters, like
Mistakes I made, take a second try
Take bikes and ride till it won't ride
Burn it out, it's mad how time flies
In the fire, my life well highlights
Marley at the sports, phone box for a draw
Number one to my door, 16 go to Brook
Check Drew, go Farm where I first bun a zoot
Southfields, check Saab, get a bike, then we scoot
Toby Field, get a chase, then we off
Blackthorn I first got locked
Two zeds of cheese, never seen it before
Thought we had straps, five cars on us
Five man deep and we all in cuffs, like

Five man deep and we all in cuffs
Five man deep and we all in, all in
Five man deep and we all in cuffs
Five man deep and we all in, like
Five man deep and we all in cuffs
Five man deep and we all in, all in
Five man deep and we all in
Five man deep and we all in
Bob's shop, hot rocks in my joggers
Went boxing but I'm not no boxer
Northampton, yeah man, I'm a cobbler
A time in my life, manna went church
Air rifle for the pigeons on the verge
New Life flats, we were all flying birds
Moulton, got terrorised
When I went Spring Boroughs and the pub got turnt
Lewis, Demar, man, I miss my bros
Winged off bing tryna take their souls
Demar near dead, wouldn't let him out the cell
But I'm haps he's alive, he's alive and well
Shout out the people, I bump, no, for real
Shout out Jalil for the food, you ain't real
Know where I live, you know you get
You know you get, you know you get chill

Five man deep and we all in cuffs
Five man deep and we all in, all in
Five man deep and we all in cuffs
Five man deep and we all in, like
Five man deep and we all in cuffs
Five man deep and we all in, all in
Five man deep and we all in
Five man deep and we all in
Used to stash food at Amy's
Chill, have a spliff, walk Jasper
Lost a dog drunk on vodka
Responsibility another chapter
I'll do it plain-faced, so obvious
Oblivious to a consequence
Never anonymous, known in my postcode
Pit bike and a crossbow
You can get snookered at the cue club
Bangin' on the window
Doubled up now you're losin', fifth bet deep
I begs you don't get lured in
Never had a mortgage, buy my house outright
Been the same since Game Boys and stick fights
Stabilised push-bikes for your shineys
Jump off the push-bike, Tony jacked my Yu-Gi-Oh! cards
I'll allow him, he's a shook guy

There's like a memory of my stepdad when I was very young
He said to me that he got tickets to Liverpool, yeah
'Cause I used to love football, bruv
It was my dream and all this, the first time
And he's like, "I'll take you," and like, "Yeah, we've got tickets"
So on the way there, it's like, uh
Obviously, to Liverpool it's like a six-hour train or something
And he's like... oh, we're on the train
And I'm lookin' into my football magazine, like I'm mad young
And I was like, "Dad, I swear if, um, like this team's name's first
They're at their home ground
Like if it's like West Brom verse Liverpool, it's at West Brom, yeah?"
And he's like, "Nah, I don't know"
And I'm like, "Nah, it definitely is, yeah"
So then we had to hop off at West Brom, which was easier
But we got there bare early
So there we were, just gotta wait around
And I'm like, "Have you got a ticket?"
And he's, like, telling me, "Yeah," he's like, "Yeah, I've got tickets"
And then, bruv, this whole time, we're just looking for a tout
Like a ticket tout to buy tickets to the game
Like for hours, we missed the first half of it
And it was like, I always remember bein' so pissed that
'Cause it was like, man lied to me, innit, after everything
If he said to me, "I ain't got the tickets," I wouldn't have even bothered
Yeah, yeah, it's kinda like man built me up3Embed
