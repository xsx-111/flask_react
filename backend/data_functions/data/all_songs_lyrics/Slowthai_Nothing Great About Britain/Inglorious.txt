Inglorious Lyrics
See, you judge me on my appearance, face value, innit
Don't know about the tax bracket
But I know that I’m teabaggin' your favourite mug, hahaha
They say, "Gang shit"
I ain't about that gang shit
I’m a solo wolf, lone wolf, eating up that gang shit
Gang shit, the death of the gang
Till your dead and buried, seen

125, doin' up breeze (Doin' up breeze)
Way too, way too, way too, way too
Way too deep (Way too sweet)
Can't lace 95s (95s)
Can't kiss my feet
All they do is chat breeze (Breeze)
Right now I'm breezin' (Breeze)
Trainspottin', I got babies on my ceiling
I’m steady plottin’, now I'm copin’ 'cause I'm eatin' (Belly full)
Remember when they wouldn’t let me in
Now their wage is just a day's per-diem (Per-diem)
Way too, way too, way too, way too, way too sweet
From the fire rose a phoenix, where's the fire weed?
From the ash stems a leaf, that's representing T
And even when I die, I come back twice as legendary
Tears when I sit in the cemetery
Flashbacks, flippin' packs, it was ketamine, huh
Now I'm feeling hoarse
School of life, weren't no course
You're a tourist, only roll with the purist, Ace Ventura
Inglorious bastard (Bastard)
Phenomenal, abdominal (Phenominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah
Inglorious bastard (Bastard)
Phenomenal, abdominal (Phenominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah
Inglorious bastard
Phenomenal, abdominal (Abdominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah
Inglorious bastard (Bastard)
Phenomenal, abdominal (Abdominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah

Young boy with a hot head, I was on stage with the mash (Greaze)
Just in case somebody told me to suck my mum in the clash (Stupid)
Way too, way too, way too, way too gassed (Gassed)
Heard man talk about drip, rudeboy, what you know about splash?
What a beautiful murder, with a samurai sword, I slaughter (Shing)
What you mean, "what you mean"?
What you know about holy water?
I stood at the altar, fuck a tab
I do a whole sheet to myself, by myself
Now these big problems just looking much smaller, yeah
And it's just me, my laptop and my bank card (Charge)
I'm directing movies like Gaspar
I drive the wraith like it's Nascar (Eer)
I love the look on their faces
When they look in the whip and it's a black star
That's for all the jokes about the jam jar (Wasteman)
You talk about Sk Level, that's top floor
Will I ever come down? I'm not sure
Look in the bag, I got lots more (Mmm)
She said that I should take my shades off, I was like, "What for?"
Rich boy, got accounts off-shore
Everybody come in and close the door
Inglorious bastard (Bastard)
Phenomenal, abdominal (Phenominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah
Inglorious bastard (Bastard)
Phenomenal, abdominal (Phenominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah
Inglorious bastard
Phenomenal, abdominal (Abdominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah
Inglorious bastard (Bastard)
Phenomenal, abdominal (Abdominal)
Put a hole in an obstacle, yeah12Embed
