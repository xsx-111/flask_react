North Nights Lyrics
Madness
From a boy, been chased by badness (mad)
I was like rah, nah, nah
Suck your mum like your dad (your dad)
Back in the day when I jumped cab (skrr)
I got blacklisted, couldn’t get one from my gaff (from my home, hey)
But it’s calm, it’s cool, it’s cold, it’s nice (nice, nice, nice, nice)
When it snows I’m ghost, cause I’m dressed in white (ice)
Roll round my ends screaming "North Nights!" (double N, double N!)
Roll round my ends and they know slowthai
Slay
Every one knows about slay
When I roll in, everyone goes: “I know him”
Just cause he know my name
Bait
When I draw my Beyblade
It’s a twister, make you turn in your grave like a Rizla
Screw your face (slay)
Pain
Get jooked, complain of belly ache
No space, no caps, no one can imitate
No hoods, no hats, like who you booking mate?
Strange
Situations elevate
Breath stinks straight, in need of Colgate
Cah only get one life, no simulator
In the cold Northants gets tragic (tragic)
Nights in watching Cash In The Attic (ah!)
Smell the tree like cash in the attic (brrt, brrt)
Hate the wet weed but I just bag it
Theresa May wanna be like Branson
Making P from airplane traffic
Theresa May wanna be like Branson
Making P from airplane traffic
In the cold Northants gets tragic
Nights in watching Cash In The Attic
Smell the tree like cash in the attic
Hate the wet weed but I just bag it
Theresa May wanna be like Branson
Making P from airplane traffic
Theresa May wanna be like Branson
Making P from airplane traffic

Wouldn’t throw my shadow
Mewtwo, you man move like Spearow
Tunnel vision and this tunnel too narrow
Want beef but I’m moving cattle
Woah
Want war jump out the Bora
With an arrow, cross bow and a borer
I write novels like man was an author
And I pray this year is a scorcher
Woah
Pray this summer is a heater
Kick ball, school man like it’s FIFA
I’m in Thailand, bun Ibiza
Wiseman with a spliff Ribena
Woah
Slow it down the slow motion
Laugh at my pain I ain't joking
Blood from a stone, hands open
Blood on my hands for my bloods that are broken
Head too big, it’s swollen
Hot in the bits like Moulton
Negative life, stop moaning
Too many things I hold in
I ain't learnt till my legs start floating
Disconnect everyone I don’t like, Don Pérignon hype
Catch me in the club, I be selling Snow White
Impose yourself, you might get a goodbye
Pressurise me and get something in your eye
From a yout, the boy has been a savage
Rudeboy deal with the matter
Different planet like I came from Namek
My life they can’t understand it
From a yout, the boy has been a savage
Rudeboy deal with the matter
Different planet like I came from Namek
My life they can’t understand it, no
