Ladies Lyrics
Lions don't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep
Nothing seems real 'til it lands at your feet
We all pay bills, I've got gaps in my teeth
They never gave me luck, they're just gaps in my teeth
I smile a lot; why not?
Fine girls getting eyed up, it's best to keep your eyes shut
Too nice to keep my eyes off
That's fresh cake, hands off
Crush grapes and bake off
I always take days off, praying that it pays off
Stereotype me as a waster
See myself like a Baidar, never been a faker
Baby boy from the manger, east midlands popper
Pocker think I'm selling A-class
Went to see a doctor, he said my life was made up
What you do with no options?
Like a squirrel for an acorn, pulling out my hair
I ain't getting no cornrows
Searching for gold at the end of the rainbow
I'm at a yellow brick road, doing up angel
Tell her do it 'cus I say so
In Bagel King I ain't trying to get a Bagel, life of sin
Can you give the boy a halo?
Can you give the boy a bly?
I'm just tryna get by, always told me lies
Now they stood outside, pray I demise
I'm an eagle flying, through the breeze, they chat I glide
Like STEEZ, I'm T-sus Christ
Late night when I'm twice as nice
Like your girl's cooking that your mumsy niced
Like your girl's cooking that your mumsy niced
This one's for the ladies, 'cause they have our babies
And they drive us crazy, but they made us men
This one's for the ladies, 'cause they have our babies
And they drive us crazy, but they made us men

Thorn in my foot, no one helped me out
I'm not unpure, neither good, like that's not allowed
I tried talking to God, can you help me out?
Never got a response, only asked as a child
Been unsure on trial, I'm sure that I'll walk this aisle
Caught this flight, déjà vu, already lived this life
So the path that I'm on yeah, this one's mine
No more sleep, no more lines
No more breachin', no more fines
No more tag and no more nights
In on the curfew, early nights
No more jobseekers
No more team leaders, who ain't been leaders
No more swinging out fights
Everybody swinging out knives, like nobody dies
But it's scumbag season
I'll come back when no comeback needed
Man like lil' Joab squeezing
Prolly smoke more I'm leaning
8 year old's blow bags breathing
Nowadays cognac sipping
Back then? Scumpy sipping
Lambrini, never wore Cabrini
Gotta find my Avirex
They'll sell themselves short for flavors
I wouldn't sell myself out for a bill and acres
I want a wife that's gracious
Then we can get a yard that's big in Barbados
I appreciate queens 'cus they made us
I'll part the sea, what's your fragrance, tasting like Baileys
Put me in a spell like seance
Shelter when it's rainy, Bob Marley, what's your preference?
Yeah, this one's for the
Yeah, this one's for the
Yeah, this one's for the

This one's for the ladies, 'cause they have our babies
And they drive us crazy, but they made us men
This one's for the ladies, 'cause they have our babies
And they drive us crazy, but they made us men (Brrt)7Embed
