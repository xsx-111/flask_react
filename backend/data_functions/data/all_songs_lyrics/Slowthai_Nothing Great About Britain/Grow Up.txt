Grow Up Lyrics
Raised in Midlands, don't know the half of
Why you kipping? Move oz like Narcos
True, it’s chapping, trim at the barber's
Used to get a border, pack for a starter
Out of order, every bathroom
Weighing up scores, got half for a bastard
Pints and peanuts the life I chose
Mice in the speakers, chew holes in cones
One-fifty for a ninety-nine cone
Where's my change? Got changed on the road
Pop goes the weasel, gripping on your throat
Pow like Lethal just curry goat
Are what you eat, you must yam bare pussy
Believe what I see and I just see a pussy
Can’t try it with T 'cause T ain't a pussy
Used to slang B like a BB bullet
I was with Lloyd, unemployed, nonprofit
I was with Beau selling nose out a cottage
Cream, get the money, then the cream got clotted
Had to leave Lings 'cause Lings was the hottest
Deal with the drought, now trekkin' to Norwich
Farmers are coming, I link with the Brummys
Anorak, so I got no worries
Fingers in the air for my brothers on porridge
Apply the pressure like Uncle Bully
Just like you, fam, I used to get bullied
Till I dragged them down by a hoodie
Kicking and screaming like, "Go get your mummy"
Thought I was scummy, had to get money
Entrepreneur, sell wraps to a mummy
Always had a laugh when nothin' weren't funny
Hop out the dumps like my name's Bugs Bunny
Growing up too fast
Nothing don’t last
And you can’t move forward
If you're stuck in the past
Growing up too fast
Nothing don’t last
Said we can't move forward (Yo)
If we're stuck in the past

Raised in Small Heath like Tommy Shelby
Plus my south blood, nobody helped me
Chicken and chips every day ain't healthy
Ain’t had it hard if your mum and dad's wealthy
Back then fiends might ask for a fix
Right now it's fans askin' for a selfie
There I got a voice in my head and it tells me
To give a man a smile on his face from Chelsea
I used to buy a cheese, that was four one fours
Now I get the weed out when I'm on tours
Used to be fist fights, now they want swords
Volley a man's head with my Rockports
If we get pulled they find baseball bats
Tell the officer I brought man the wrong sports
Don't make 'em like me no more bredrins
Dem man are playin' and I'm like concourse
Can't get a ten deck so I get twenty
Tryna make the whole country smoke plenty
Can't tell a badman there's no entry
Bang, bang, bang 'til the whole place empty
Still thank God every day I can emcee
Just so nothing on the roads don't tempt me
I ain't met no one who lived to a century
I think smoking's fucked up my memory
Growing up too fast
Nothing don't last
And you can't move forward
If you're stuck in the past
Growing up too fast
Nothing don't last
Can't move forward
If we're stuck in the past

You looked up to me, you see
So why waste your life tryna grow up
When you can enjoy it every moment
You know what I'm sayin'?
Don't get old, be bold
Don't get told, be bold

Raised in Britain? No, you isn't
Soft like kitten, I'm tough like cement
Kitchen sievin', belly in Knotts
And nothin' ain't sitting right
Raised in Britain, no you isn't
Soft like kitten, I'm tough like cement
Kitchen sievin', belly in Knotts
Nothing ain't sitting rightEmbed
