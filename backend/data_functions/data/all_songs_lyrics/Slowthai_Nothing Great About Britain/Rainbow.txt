Rainbow Lyrics
Brown sugar never been so sweet, but vanilla ice cream is my favourite dish
Blacker the berry, the sweeter the drip - make a cheesecake, last bit, we can split it
Why you care what my pigment is?
Held me down, I was progressing
Reminded me that my skin tone's rich
L-O-L slowthai in fits
Primitive with your nasty ways
Kamikaze put me in a cage
Brown eyes and my shit ain’t blue
Exotic trip it's tropical too
What am I to do?
Won't hire me, then they hire you
Fire me but don’t fire you
Lock me up but unboxing you

Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don't rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don't rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don't rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don’t rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
Not white, not black either
Asian, Latina, not your nigga
Not your honkey or shopkeeper
Skin thick, I throw stones, break windows
Glass homes, break bones, we don’t shiver
Colourblind to see the light they grow blossom like roses
Brush my hand off, what's the motive?
You got dandruff on your clothing
Call me coon, I Looney Tune
Bust your nose with a silver spoon
Monkey noises, big baboon
White boy wasted in the zoo
Bones too dense to swim the lagoon
Loch Ness what-less innocent yout
Colourblind, swear we’re all blue
No difference between us two

Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don't rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don’t rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don't rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
Colours of the rainbow
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain though
Don't rub off and stain though
Stereotype cause my skin tone - UFO
When the colour's gone - colourblind
Red, white and blue
Union Jack united who?
When the colour's gone what am I to you?
In theory you're colourblind
Race just hysteria and when the colour's gone
Just the UFO, understand my logic
Colourblind, see obvious
When the colour's gone - colourblind
Red, white and blue
Union Jack united who?
When the colour's gone what am I to you?
In theory you're colourblind
Race just hysteria and when the colour's gone
Just the dotted light (understand?)
