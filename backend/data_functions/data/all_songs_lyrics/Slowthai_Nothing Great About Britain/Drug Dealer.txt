Drug Dealer Lyrics
Yo, that's that ye, blud (Yeah)
That's that fucking crack (slowthai)
This-that Kanye West shit, blud, turn you crazy
(Yeah) Nothing great about fucking Britain
Futuristic platinum five times, bitch!

Crack dealer, phone passed around, like ambika
Shotgun shells turn your face, pizza
Never shot guns, just a drug dealer, huh?
Just a drug dealer, got one song, it's called "Drug Dealer"
Nothing to say but, drug dealer
You're mediocre, like Kate and Peter

When I show you up, fisticuffs, sell you short
Pump you full of my angel 'till your lungs go pop and your skin turns blue
Impossible, kill an obstacle and make it possible, 'cause it's what I do
Teacher said, "What you gonna be, when you're older?"
"Drug dealer!", what else can I do?
Businessman, I know, I'm business, man
Minding my business, got business plans
Your foundations been built on sand
Sinkin' sand, now you're sinkin', man
Your chick, she was linkin', man
Before she linked you, she had things in hand
Call her your princess, man, but her only interest is linkin', man
I don't care what you think of, man, sold crack for a living, just how I'm livin'
'Cause' she sway, then I don't make a difference
I'm OT safe, you don't know me; safe
Nothing great about Britain is and it isn't
Rockport jeans, patterned memories
Same situation, the boy was given, yeah, the boy was given
Crack dealer, phone passed around, like Ambika
Shotgun shells turn your face, pizza
Never shot guns, just a drug dealer, huh?
Just a drug dealer, got one song, it's called "Drug Dealer"
Nothing to say but, drug dealer
You're mediocre, like Kate and Peter
Crack dealer, phone passed around, like Ambika
Shotgun shells turn your face, pizza
Never shot guns, just a drug dealer, huh?
Just a drug dealer, got one song, it's called "Drug Dealer"
Nothing to say, but drug dealer
You're mediocre, like Kate and Peter

Flying saucers turned cocaine
Battered fish to oysters, all upgrade
Council housed and violent, what we're gonna do today?
I was running from in trident, 'cause it's always the same
Didn't do no— (Never!), always get the blame
Lower class, but my class is so fucking flames (Flames)
Angry? Nah, I can't con-tain
Fucking punched the wall, 'till my fucking (Ahhh!)
Knuckles break, feel dumb, 'cause I'm feelin' pain
Travelled the country, hundreds of trains
Hundreds of lanes, hundreds of lanes
Hundreds of people that all act the same
Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to myself some things can't change
Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to myself something's gotta budge
Think to myself something's gotta go
Trust in slow he's the chosen one
Think to myself something's gotta go
Think to myself some things can't change
Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to mysel—, eh (Yeah)

Fuck it, man (slowthai, man)
Hahaha, fuck it! (slowthai, man)
Give a fuck about the last fucking chorus
Some time mine
We're gonna make a difference in this shit, man
Seriously man, this your future self-talking, man

Crack dealer, phone passed around, like Ambika
Shotgun shells turn your face, pizza
Never shot guns, just a drug dealer, huh?
Just a drug dealer, got one song, it's called "Drug Dealer"
Nothing to say, but drug dealer
You're mediocre, like Kate and Peter
