Missing Lyrics
Balcony, storeys high
High telling stories, this ain't story time
Same routine, getting boring, why?
You do the same thing then you compromise
Moral compass always points wrong
Like I'm on the North Pole tryna make it home
When in Rome, only drugs condoned
'Cause real men cry and thugs go home
Who am I? What I stand for?
Tell myself you need to be a man more
Man up, why you handcuffed? Lost from Pampers
Sandwich short of a picnic
Robbed for your pack lunch
Life in a bin bag, quickly get wrapped up
Treated like a rodent
Falling or just decomposing
No opinions, no emotions

Falling, thinking, I've been missing
No one's calling, no one ever listens
Only falling, when I'm missing
Miss falling, what you missing
Thinking, I've been missing
No one's calling, no one ever listens
Only falling, when I'm missing
Miss falling, tell me what you missing
Only enemy's between your eyes
Telepathy, they can't read your mind
Therapy and they tell you lies
They only want more, you ain't got no pies
Wiley catting, like a snake you bite
Vampires come and take a pint
Tightrope and I walk the line
On a line, said it's pure
Why you lost your spine?
Spineless, got grab it by the neck
The scruff gets rough, just a scuff on the leg
Need sense and a bump on the head
I need P, why you bump me instead?
Trust in me, you're my best friend
I don't know if you're alive or dead
Fine line, define my strengths
How far will you go if it's not arms length?

Falling, thinking, I've been missing
No one's calling, no one ever listens
Only falling, when I'm missing
Miss falling, what you missing
Thinking, I've been missing
No one's calling, no one ever listens
Only falling, when I'm missing
Miss fallingEmbed
