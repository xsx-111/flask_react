Toaster Lyrics
Not one for authority
Follow you, no follow me
Left foot forward bro be free
There are no rules, just societies
Society says Slowthai is a danger
Head top rearranger
No love for authorities
They took my bro and that's robbery
Did my thing no way could I cater
We can sort it out later
Roll about for that flavour
Nasty boy, it's my nature
Consequence bun a consequence
I'm a narcissist, see you later
Defending my team like Shawcross
Can't talk about steez rocking boot cuts
Shortcuts no confusion
I wouldn't do you if I was clueless
Hop a fence for that bunda
What I do for the music
No man can ever call me junior
Say that I'm moving stupid
I don't hit town, drown my sorrows in Sambuca to act like Cupid
Rather stay at home be zooted
It just ain't computing
That I ain't code in computer
Follow the leader til we get snookered
Wear my Zoomers you're wearing Pumas
Lean to the side, twelve from verrucas
I'm sat at home with my Gucci loafers
Cup of rose, lean on my sofa
Crumpets in my toaster
Bum parked on my sofa
At one with nature
Pissing off my neighbours
Crumpets in my toaster
Bum parked on my sofa
At one with nature
Pissing off my neighbours

Knock, knock here
Knock, knock there
I think someone's there
Turn it up I don't care
Turn it up I don't care
Knock, knock here
Knock, knock there
I think someone's there
Turn it up I don't care
Turn it up I don't care

Authorities that I can't hear
You can't come in, no pigs in here
Warrant outstanding more than a year
Hand myself in if my solicitors there
Understanding the agenda
If you're law-abiding, cooperate, bless
Pirates like me say
You'll never catch me alive, or dead
HMP can't be a prisoner
Put the cuffs on me, put you in the finisher
On custody even as a visitor
It's not holiday, and it's not me dog
I want mahogany up in my yard
Doberman shitting on my grass
Name stitched up in all my garms
I never listened to what I got told
Crumpets in my toaster
Bum parked on my sofa
At one with nature
Pissing off my neighbours
Crumpets in my toaster
Bum parked on my sofa
At one with nature
Pissing off my neighbours
Crumpets in my toaster (Like not not here, not not there)
Bum parked on my sofa (I think someone's there)
At one with nature (Turn it up I don't care)
Pissing off my neighbours (Like not not here, not not there)
Crumpets in my toaster (I think someone's there)
Bum parked on my sofa (Turn it up I don't care)
At one with nature (Turn it up I don't care)
Pissing off my neighbours

I said
Knock, knock here
Knock, knock there
I think the feds are there
Fuck the feds I don't care
Knock, knock here
Knock, knock there
I think the feds are there
Fuck the feds I don't care
Please open the door, or we're gonna force entry
Last chance to open the door or we're gonna force entry
Come on, come on, supposed to be the police force, no force in you
Hey, shut it, your mouth, you little
No force in you, haha can't even get the door off haha2Embed
