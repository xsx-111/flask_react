Crack Lyrics
I love you like a crackhead loves crack (Crack, crack)
My addiction put my nose in the bag
I sneeze, you bless me (Woo), same time
Yeah, I'll see you next week (Next, next)
Running on empty, you know I never get sleep
Your next, he's the best me
Better version of me
You try and conversate, I got a face like a zombie
Losing my mind, slowthai is Ted Bundy
How I'm wired, I admired every time you got me food
I was hungry, mmm, got too comfy
Love me, I was bummy, didn't think much of me
I don't blame you, if you was me, I would probably hate you
But you're not, for that I'm grateful
Truly scrumptious angel

You made up stories, I don't blame you
But the plot gets thicker like your shape do
You're too sweet like grapefruits
Too sweet, bitter, why so facety?
You made up stories, I don't blame you
But the plot gets thicker like your shape do
You're too sweet like grapefruits
Too sweet, bitter, why so facety?
Reflecting, disconnected
Assuming the worst, you're obsessive
I don't blame you like you blame me (Why do you blame me?)
I don't hate you like you hate me
There's a thin line divide
Caught in a slip tide like a slipknot
I'm not a rabbit, we fuck like rabbits (Fuck like)
Then we break up (Why do we break up?)
Arguments, shit I couldn't imagine
Then we break up, I don't blame you
Like you blame me, I don't blame you (I don't)

You made up stories, I don't blame you
But the plot gets thicker like your shape do
You're too sweet like grapefruits
Too sweet, bitter, why so facety?
You made up stories, I don't blame you
But the plot gets thicker like your shape do
You're too sweet like grapefruits
Too sweet, bitter, why so facety?Embed
