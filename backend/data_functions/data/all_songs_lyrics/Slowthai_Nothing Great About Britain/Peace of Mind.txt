Peace of Mind Lyrics
I feel peace of mind when I'm sleeping in my bed and I can’t hear it
I feel peace of mind when I'm dreaming of a life I ain't living

Walking through the blocks, I see the cracks, dodge syringes
I was with the lads, bookies tryna watch the fixtures
Two one the pool, roulette machine is British
Tryna take my pennies, now I’m moving Sid Vicious
Lock up your daughters, leave them coming off their hinges
Fuck your older brother, say "I'm with his little sister"
It's cold in England, so much colder in Winter
Put on your parka, save room for Christmas dinner

I feel peace of mind when I'm sleeping in my bed, I can't hear it
I feel peace of mind when I'm dreaming of a life I ain't living
I feel peace of mind when I'm sleeping in my bed, I can’t hear it
I feel peace of mind when I’m dreaming of a life I ain't living

Gotta thank mum for the 23 years she wiped my arse
"Thank you Ma", now I’m gone
Hotwire the motor, joyride, I don't give a twot
Naught to 100, less than 1
Uncle smoking food on the bench in the park, alone
Let him in, he broke her heart
Now I'm to blame, but the problem is really not ours
Tell me twice, I still ain't ask
Peace of mind when I’m sleeping in my bed, I can't hear it
I feel peace of mind when I'm dreaming of a life I ain't living
I feel peace of mind when I'm sleeping in my bed, I can't hear it
I feel peace of mind when I'm dreaming of a life I ain't living

I feel peace of mind when I'm dreaming of a life I ain't livingEmbed
