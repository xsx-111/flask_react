Doorman Lyrics
How's business this morning?
Pretty good
I made 'bout twelve, thirteen quid
And that was without not having any arguments with anyone
That's pretty j– just straight
If you don't ****, gonna get your head kicked in

Shoot the messenger, string 'em up
She's a 10 plus 10, not enough
Mixed messages, wires crossed
Marry me, what you got? Too much
Toothbrush and socks
Parents minted, Mayfair, couple dogs
We go on walks, she never talks
I pour my heart out, she laps up my blood
Blue lights, double vision
Heart races like supercars
Two drinks, the room's spinning
Zebedee, you're the ace of hearts
High society, cute kittens
Allergies, I don't like you enough
Blocked me on your private finsta
Your godmother should come play with us
Nicotine, can't quit it
Two's up, two's down
You stub it out before I finish
On my arm and I scream out, "Wow"
Nicotine, can't quit it
Two's up, two's down
You stub it out before I finish
On my arm and I scream out, "Wow"

Doorman, let me in the door
Spent all my money, you ain't gettin' no more wages
Sure, sir, sir, are you sure?
In short, I'm not a mop you can drag 'cross the floor
Inside, shell shock
She's standin' with a guy
Guys your mans stare him out, real polite
"No, please, no thanks"
"Want a drink?"
"I'm alright"
Beer goggles on, pull the wool, now I'm blind
Clear as day, I can see
You make me melt, sun, ice cream
You smooth like felt, soft to the touch
You wear repellent, smell your scent from up above
Angel getting carried out the club
For slapping Harry, Harry's just a mug
I'm stood outside waitin', where you gone?
Cubicle lines, catch a cold, Jack Frost
Nicotine, can't quit it
Two's up, two's down
You stub it out before I finish
On my arm and I scream out, "Wow"
Nicotine, can't quit it
Two's up, two's down
You stub it out before I finish
On my arm and I scream out, "Wow"

Just about any type of drug is in
But glue-sniffing ranks equal number one with cheap booze
Hello
Cyril is a glue man and his outlook on life is invariably through a plastic bag
Even on the street, he has something up his sleeve
To make work more tolerable
The only thing that no one takes is heroin, you know?
If they do, we kick 'em out
That's the thing, that's the thing that is really, really bad for you
Most, most people take–
Most people take things in moderation, you know?19Embed
