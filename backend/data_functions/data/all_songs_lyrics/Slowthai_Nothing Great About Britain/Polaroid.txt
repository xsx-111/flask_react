Polaroid Lyrics
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it

Couples times I was cautious, couple times with no warning
Couple times Stone Cold Stunner, couple times Stephen Hawking
I don’t wanna hear them murmur, you can miss me with the bullshit
Swear life just gets dumber and dumber, as the drugs get morish
Couple times I lost my friends, couple times I got new ones
But who gives a fuck about them, man I got do it on my ones
Couples times I relied, got lied to and denied
I only care about mines, diamond diggin in mines
Couple times lost my self, couple times chilling with skets
Couple times gave em the world, just to get my dick wet
Couple times felt like a melt, came, bust a nut and I left
Gave away parts of my soul, trading soul with skets
Couple times head was gone, couple times like what’s next
Couple times in my zone, I just thank mum and I flex
Couple times I was broke, why I keep running through cheques?
Most time don’t go home, theres vultures watching my nest
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah

Said I’m no one, still I’m no one
But I’m someone they wanna know now
I’m like hold on, what’s going on
I don’t know don... shut your mouth
Text me, I don’t reply, know why, you're getting aired out
No co-sign, I got no time
Road rage, don’t make me turn around
It’s cold, but I’m getting heated, get rubbed out, deleted
I’m with a fixer, called Felix
Moving ninja, never seen it
I’m with Kwesi, doing Kermit
In studio, like a hermit
Enthusiasm, can’t curb it, forward, determined
I’m with Jak, Squidgy black
In my spliff, how we Morrocin?
How it is, man I'm twist, in your bits, what’s the problem?
Sometimes it’s like; I got c*** wrote on my forehead
I’m gorgeous, yeah gorgeous, I know that, so it’s nothing
Remember when I didn’t have nothing
No food in my cupboard, honey rice in my stomach
Burglaries, robbings, couple times dotting
Always been plotting, blue lights and I’m jogging
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture (Nothing great about Britain), shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah yeah yeah
Kodak moment, Polaroid picture, shake it, yeah, yeah
