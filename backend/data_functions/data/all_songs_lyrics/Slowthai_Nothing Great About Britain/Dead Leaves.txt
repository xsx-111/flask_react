Dead Leaves Lyrics
Cut them off
Most them ones, can't trust
Most them ones wanna be someone
It's funny what they do in the club
Sharin' hugs
"We're best friends," no we're not
Move your hand from my top
Alpaca on the joggers and I don't even jog
Just a lover, word to my mother
You're just undercover
See you watching, quick unfollow
Make my heart turn hollow
Won't be here tomorrow
I'm like the sun, I rise up, then gone
Back here tomorrow
Clockwork Orange
I ain't done a day of porridge
Don't make me Chuck Norris
'Cause I run my town but I'm nothin' like Boris
Tyron for PM
'Cause I'm active AM to PM
Drop-top on the BM
BM drop top when she see him
Guilt trip, not guilty what I'm pleadin'
Crime scene, can't see me fleein'
Sold out shows, not a packed coliseum
Carpe diem, don't just live on the weekend
Not a box, you can't try fit T in
Locksmith, break the lock, no key ting
Annoying how your whip got keyed
Slowthai might've been the one that keyed it
Dead leaves, cut 'em off
Can't give me a chance, this ain't Tour de France
Just bike to the stars, upgrade to a quad
True say, I felt pain, but that made me strong
Dead leaves, cut 'em off
Can't give me a chance, this ain't Tour de France
Just bike to the stars, upgrade to a quad
True say, I felt pain, but that made me strong

Boiling point, is nan's stew ready?
Weston Favell, JD reggy
Was you born in a barn?
Close the door, it's chilly
Next door screamin' 'bout they got kids
But they don't live with me
Reply in ad libs, "Allow the badness"
In an Audi, rush hour traffic
Can't flutter mascara lashes
Admit it 'cause you know it's long
Too many liars, I don't trust no one
Done walked through fires barefoot, no top
Yeah, the heat was fire but the bop don't stop
Not a lot goin' on in Northampton
Shawshank ting, need redemption
True say sellin' drugs, ain't got a pension
Try repent my sins, but I'm not a reverend
Not a lot goin' on in Britain
Hot cross buns and a pot stewin'
Yeah, I love tea, got a cup brewin
While you're commentatin' on how I do it
Silence is loud, silence my movement
Silence them, it's about the music
If you snakin' me, you will learn by force
Make myself snake boots, then I walk my walk
Dead leaves, cut 'em off
Can't give me a chance, this ain't Tour de France
Just bike to the stars, upgrade to a quad
True say, I felt pain, but that made me strong
Dead leaves, cut 'em off
Can't give me a chance, this ain't Tour de France
Just bike to the stars, upgrade to a quad
True say, I felt pain, but that made me strong2Embed
