Go All Night (Let Me Roll) Lyrics
Stayed up talkin' all night
Take my body, it's so right
Tired, but we go all night
Baby I'll roll, pass the blunt
Stayed up talkin' all night
Take my body, it's so right
Tired, but we go all night
Baby I'll roll, pass the blunt

Let me roll
Watch it burn, I'll broke it up real fine
Say you're my baby3Embed
