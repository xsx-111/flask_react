Something Else Lyrics
Watch the replay
I give it all away
Another girl's takin'
You say it's all the same
I know it's all a game
I know how you're making out
Another bad play
It's the same old thing when you open your mouth
Forgetting what we talked about
I know it's coming

I gave my all to you
But it seems my love was not enough now
I know you're hurting too
But I lost a place that I barely found
When I believed in this
I would be giving what I needed, baby
When I remember you
I will remember what it means to carry on

You tell me one thing, then another
Always something else
I'm onto you, it's never ending
Always something else
You tell me one thing, then another
Always something else
You tell me one thing, then another
It's always something else
Rewind the heartache
You try, but it's fake
Knowing what you're taking
The things I don't say
You see it in my face
And then it's all coming out
Boy, I beg your pardon
You ain't callin' me out
Go ahead and hide it, I already know
I've seen the future and it's over

I gave my all to you
But it seems my love was not enough now
I know you're hurting too
But I lost a place that i barely found
When I believed in this
I would be giving what I needed, baby
When I remember you
I will remember what it means to carry on

You tell me one thing, then another
Always something else
I'm onto you, it's never ending
Always something else
You tell me one thing, then another
Always something else
You tell me one thing, then another
It's always something else1Embed
