Go All Night (Let It Burn) Lyrics
Now we smokin up, bae
Now we smokin up, baby
Now we smokin up, baby
Now we smokin up
Couldn't hold it in
I tried to fight it
Turn away
I let it out

Stayed up talkin' all night
Take my body, it's so right
Tired, but we go all night
Baby I'll roll, pass the blunt
Stayed up talkin' all night
Take my body, it's so right
Tired, but we go all night
Baby I'll roll, pass the blunt

Give me another round of what I had
Give me another round of what I hadEmbed
