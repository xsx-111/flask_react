Cut 4 Me Lyrics
So many nights
She's got me high
Someone who won't bite
Don't wanna stop her
I gave it time, I'm in no rush
You're slippin' now, that's right
Can't wait to tear it apart

Cut for me, you're all that I need
Tenderly, give me what I need
Would you please rock?
Carefully, you're all that I need
Talk to me, give me what I need
Would you please breakdown?

Stop thinking twice
You say it's wrong
But it feels so right
Now you can't handle
A kiss from behind, I make you blush
You're slippin' now, don't fight
Can't wait to tear that apart
Cut for me, you're all that I need
Tenderly, give me what I need
Would you please rock?
Carefully, you're all that I need
Talk to me, give me what I need
Would you please breakdown?

Bite, bite, bite, bite hard
Break, break, break, break down
Bite, bite, bite, bite hard
Break, break, break, break down5Embed
