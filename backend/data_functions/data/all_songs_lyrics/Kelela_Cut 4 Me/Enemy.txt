Enemy Lyrics
You're all up on me now
That you're my enemy
There’s nothing here to save
It’s all here in front of me
When I’m feeling low
You’re not the remedy
I’m keeping to myself
I get the best of me

You know we give it up
But love is not enough
They always acting up
We keep on lettin' 'em
I called you on your bluff
But you be holding tough
I need someone who knows
Someone who gives a fuck

But you don’t know how
I’m going out

Spend some time alone
Now you’re up in my face
Breathing down my neck
Better back up off me now
Don’t you know it’s me
K-E-L-E-L-A
You want it back
I’ll keep the best of me now
You know we give it up
But love is not enough
They always actin up
We keep on lettin' 'em
I called you on your bluff
But you be holding tough
I need someone who knows
Someone who gives a fuck

But you don't know how (But you don't know how)
I'm going out (I'm going out, out)
But you don't know how (How)
I don't know how (I don't know how)
Don't know how to get it through you
Don't know how to get it through you

Gave you all my time
Now I’m on my grind, yeah
There’s no hate
It couldn’t wait
Matter fact, I should thank you
Gave you all my time
Now I’m on my grind, yeah
There's no hate
It couldn't wait
Matter fact, I should thank you
Gave you all my time
Now I'm on my grind, yeah
There's no hate
It couldn't wait
Matter fact
Thank youEmbed
