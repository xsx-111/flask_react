Bank Head (Extended) Lyrics
Like kickin' an old bad habit
It's hard, but I'm not static
We lock eyes from far away
And then you slowly turn your face
Like middle school, we're a secret
There's more to it, but we keep it
It's not a game I know
We're moving at our pace

Remembering that one time
Had to stop it's making me hot
Come on out, there's no need to hide
Could you be my new love
Could it be that we need some time
I'm still browsing, there's no need to buy

It's all I dreamed of, it can't get started
Time goes by really slow and I need to let it
And all I dreamed of, it can't get started
Time goes really slow and I need to let it
It's all I dreamed of, it can't get started
Time goes by really slow and I need to let it out
And all I dreamed of, it can't get started
Time goes really slow and I need to let it out
I'm keeping you close, you know it
And I'm taking my time to show it
You're touching me like you've had it all along
Feels like you're right
And once you're around I notice
That I need to draw you closer
A breath away
I wonder how you keep it all inside

Remembering that one time
Had to stop it's making me hot
Come on out, there's no need to hide
Could you be my new love
Could it be that we need some time
I'm still browsing, there's no need to buy

It's all I dreamed of, it can't get started
Time goes by really slow and I need to let it
And all I dreamed of, it can't get started
Time goes really slow and I need to let it out

Could you be my new love
It's all I dreamed of, all I dreamed off
It can't get it started
Sad we couldn't go any deeper
Something tells me you're a keeper
It's all I dreamed of
It can't get it started
Time goes by
Sad we couldn't go any deeper
Something tells me you're a keeper
It can't get it started
Sad we couldn't go any deeper
Something tells me you're a keeper
Sad we couldn't go any deeper
Something tells me you're a keeper
It's all I dreamed of
Time goes by7Embed
