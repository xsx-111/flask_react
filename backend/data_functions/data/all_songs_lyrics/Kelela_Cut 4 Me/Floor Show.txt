Floor Show Lyrics
Give me a reason to listen
Tell me, I already know your answer
Under her spell
You pledge your allegiance
Tell me no more, I studied your steelo
But I can't get out

Ain't never left
Although I tried a million times
Wonder how it feels
I'll never know, you're never mine
You should stop the front
Before I catch you in a lie
You forget my name
But you say it every night

'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Actin like you don't know
Puttin' on a floor show
'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Took some time to get right
Things were lookin' so bright
'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Actin like you don't know
Puttin' on a floor show
'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Took some time to get right
Things were lookin' so bright
Up to now, it's eaten me up
Took a few cycles of up and down
To really turn around
Boy I can tell, you know what you're doin'
But this tug of war is addictive somehow
I can't get out

Ain't never left
Although I tried a million times
Wonder how it feels
I'll never know, you're never mine
You should stop the front
Before I catch you in a lie
You forget my name
But you say it every night

'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Actin like you don't know
Puttin' on a floor show
'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Took some time to get right
Things were lookin' so bright
'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Actin like you don't know
Puttin' on a floor show
'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Took some time to get right
Things were lookin' so bright
Giving you my everything, you
Turned around and did things your way, I
Try to fight the urge to define
Letting go of things that ain't mine
Desperate for another day
Wish I knew the thing to say
Spent my time building you up
And now it's falling down
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time

'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Actin like you don't know
Puttin' on a floor show
'Til the end, 'til the end of time
Took some time to get right
Things were lookin' so bright

Stop for just a minute
Let me tell you what I've fallen into
I am trapped inside your conscience
I know that you're thinking your way out3Embed
