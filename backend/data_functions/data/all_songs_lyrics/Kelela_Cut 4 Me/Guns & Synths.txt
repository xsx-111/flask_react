Guns & Synths Lyrics
There's a part of me
That feels like I've got this, not a doubt
Honesty will take care of me
I will never be without

Then the other side is undecided
I'm in a rut
In these times of compromised confidence
I need a mantra

It's not wrong or right
You know it's about what's workin'
Keep it light
Swallow my pride
I fill another application out
I feel like quitting the fight
And love always hurts
When I let go it's lookin' up
Lookin' up, lookin' up

There's a part of me
That feels like I've got this, not a doubt
Honesty will take care of me
I will never be without
Then the other side is undecided
I'm in a rut
In these times of compromised confidence
I need a mantra

It's not wrong or right
You know it's about what's workin'
Keep it light
Swallow my pride
I fill another application out
I feel like quitting the fight
And love always hurts
When I let go it's lookin' up
Lookin' up, lookin' up2Embed
