Send Me Out Lyrics
Send, send
Send me out
Out, out, out

Love, do I have to spell it out?
You're gone through the night
I close up to cope with all our time apart
You do your thing, I'm going out
Surprise, you're bitter now
Don't get worked up, you know I care about you

Signals you're sending
Feels like we're floating
First contact
We'll sort it out
All through the night

Send, send, send
Send me out
Out, out, out

Love, should I try another route?
I'll come over now
Boy, fly me out to make you better now
Just promise that you'll turn me out
Almost time to go
Just one more round before you send me out
Now that we're standing closer together
I need to feel you in my arms
All this mixed emotion breaks me down and makes me wanna cry
Baby, let me show you how
To forget it and focus on the future now
Even though I had a bit of doubt about it
I still wrap you around my heart

Send, send, send
Send, send
Send me out
Out, out, out
Send, send, send
Send, send
Send me out
Out, out, out4Embed
