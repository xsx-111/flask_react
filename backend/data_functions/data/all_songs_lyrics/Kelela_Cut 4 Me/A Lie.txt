A Lie Lyrics
Grey and cloudy
It rains every day
With, without
Either way we're both suffering
We rode away
Wish you didn't draw it out this long
Blowing smoke out my window
On our way home

I see, too
You're not the only one
Kiss that story goodbye
It's what they call a lie

Bound, though you are free
To do what you want
It'll be just fine and i know it
I love you
I know we'll speak
It's only a matter of time
Couldn't hate you forever
You know it
I see, too
You're not the only one
Kiss that story goodbye
It's what they call a lieEmbed
