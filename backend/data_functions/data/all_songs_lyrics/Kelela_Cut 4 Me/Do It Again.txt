Do It Again Lyrics
Late at night you feel me creep in
One touch takes you out your sleep
And I got you where I want
Stop before I'm done
You're begging me
I won't do it again

Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
(I'm holding out)
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
(Holding out)

Now you're wide awake, I'm on top
Suddenly I'm the one who can't stop
No rules to this game, turn me out
Now I'm helpless
And I beg you
Do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
(But you're holding out)
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again

You keep beggin' me, beggin' me
Beggin' me, beggin' me
You keep beggin' me, beggin' me
Beggin' me
To do it again
I keep beggin' you, beggin' you
Beggin' you, beggin' you
I keep beggin' you, beggin' you
Beggin' you
To do it again
You keep beggin' me, beggin' me (Do it again, do it again)
Beggin' me, beggin' me (Do it again, do it again)
You keep beggin' me, beggin' me (Do it again, do it again)
Beggin' me (Do it again, do it again)
To do it again (Do it again, do it again)1Embed
