Cherry Coffee Lyrics
Trust me, I'll feel better
Say it's over, baby
Been tellin' me for a while
That you're gonna stop
Hurting, but I weather
Finally got through the sting
That's the hardest part
Seeing in the dark

You're in deep
I see what's going on
It's a twisted cycle, you've confused with love
I'm in deep
Feel like I'mma die, a fade to mind
I keep letting go, but I know you're holding on

Keep me up in bed at night
You're better than you'll ever know
I'm in a story, prisoner
Taking my time

You never give up, now it's over
Told you, baby
Pray to the almighty
That you figure out
How to pull the trigger
And then you'll look at me
Someone you know who tried
Now that we're clear, bye bye
You're in deep
I see what's going on
It's a twisted cycle, you've confused with love
I'm in deep
Feel like I'mma die, a fade to mind
I keep letting go, but I know you're holding on
You're in deep
I see what's going on
It's a twisted cycle, you've confused with love
I'm in deep
Feel like I'mma die, a fade to mind
I keep letting go, but I know you're holding on6Embed
