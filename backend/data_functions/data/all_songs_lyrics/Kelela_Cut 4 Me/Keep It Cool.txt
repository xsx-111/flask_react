Keep It Cool Lyrics
Beautiful, you're not mine
You can't stop and it's a crime
We're gonna blow our cover
Bound to surrender, unless we

Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, cool
Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, keep it cool

Round and round inside our heads
We're going no where
"Focusing is hard" you're telling me
'Cuz I'm not there
This ain't no coincidence
Taking all I've got
I almost surrendered
Why must we

Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, cool
(Why must we)
Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, keep it cool
Hope one day the stars align
You're deep within me
'Til you give it up
We can't surrender, you're not free

Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, cool
Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, keep it cool

Make it hot
When you surrender
You make it hot
Then, we'll surrender
Make it hot
You know
I make it hot3Embed
