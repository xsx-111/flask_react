The Guesser Lyrics
We felt a change in times sometimes when I talk
It wasn't really clear at first
The gentry men were also one to admire
The fancy people were the same
Take a look
The only thing is that the numbers don't add up
Late from work
It's just a typical thing in which you need to comply
The might is bearing on the wretch
For working class the joy of drinking prevails
The taps are open never closed
Take a guess
The only thing is that the guesser is a mess
Walk on by
It's just a difficult time in which the people comply
It's a difficult time
Put your hands on the wall
Take a look at the scene that you conceive as paradise
Then just close your eyes
Find your way
It's a typical time
Periodical sign
Take a gamble and make a little bet on paradise
Oh, avert your eyes
Guess the way
To move a problem is to stay out of harm
All of the worry isn't gone
The working man is feeling under the weather
The passing woman even worse
Take a look
The only thing is that the numbers don't have worth
Walk on by
It's just a seminal time
Such a terrible plight
Take a guess
The only thing is that the guesser is a mess
Walk on by
It's just a difficult time in which the people comply
It's a difficult time
Put your hands on the wall
Take a look at the scene that you conceive as  paradise
Then just close your eyes
Find your way
It's a typical time
Periodical sign
Take a gamble and make a little bet on paradise
Oh, avert your eyes
Guess the way2Embed
