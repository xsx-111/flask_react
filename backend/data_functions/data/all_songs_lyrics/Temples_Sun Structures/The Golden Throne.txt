The Golden Throne Lyrics
A friend is more than a companion
A foe is less than that to me
When you hear the words
The words you long to hear
Open up
The guidance from a close and loved one
Is more important than you think
When your arms are closed
Then open with a key
Secret key

Clashed hands shaking in the closet
Hands down, you to see
Past lives forgotten and remembered
Act now
When I don't know where to go

Everything that you say to your closest one
Makes you feel like a pain toward everyone
When the words are unkind, you'll regret the choice
For as long as you choose there may be rejoice
In the colour of day when you see the truth
Take a step to the front to their point of view
Understand what they mean when they say the words
When sorry is said, feel it to your bones
Amends is made with a connection
A lonely man becomes a king
When you need the words
The words you long to feel
Listen up
The triumph of a close and loved one
The journey to the golden throne
When the gown is graced
Proceed towards the stage
Golden stage

Clashed hands shaking in the closet
Hands down, you to see
Past lives forgotten and remembered
Act now
When I don't know where to go

Everything that you say to your closest one
Makes you feel like a pain toward everyone
When the words are unkind, you'll regret the choice
For as long as you choose there may be rejoice
In the colour of day when you see the truth
Take a step to the front to their point of view
Understand what they mean when they say the words
When sorry is said, feel it to your bones6Embed
