Keep in the Dark Lyrics
Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Just sleeping in the sunlight
Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Just staying in the sunshine

Turn off your light, let's step into the dark
Sleep away your life, shine fear into her
Save your face and keep your hands firmly pressed into the earth
I feel relief when night time eventually comes
Talk of all the dreams, you surely have one
Mind your head and keep your hands firmly pressed into the earth
Earth
Earth
Earth

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling, dressed in white
A shameful display, it's all in bourbon and lace
To keep in the dark
Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling, dressed in white
A colourless string to a colourful bow
That sings in the night, and never grows old

Night follows faceless grace with wandering eyes
Drawn to a beauty left to leer in the light
Climb the stairs and keep your only precious white wine full of worth
Dressed in a  safe from the dark
But dressed in a body looked stranger to her
Flashing words attempt to call an all showing girl
Your true worth (worth, worth)

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling, dressed in white
A shameful display, it's all in bourbon and lace
To keep in the dark
Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling, dressed in white
A colourless string to a colourful bow
That sings in the night, and never grows old2Embed
