Colours to Life Lyrics
Move, rest in tombs of sleep
Choose visions, wake from deep
Painting ourselves on a stained glass floor
The things we discuss are disguised until unveiled

In the hour of night, we take from ourselves
We replace and reward
It's the balance of thoughts
Seeks to find affirmation, speaking in tongues
Sing the words through you

Dawn of creation
Blessed in devotion
Love, lost spaces in time
Bring the colours to life
Spectrums defy us
Left to remind us
Love, lost spaces in time
Bring the colours to life

Loose words when voices speak
New shades of darkness seek
Staining ourselves on a painted floor
The things we have done are exposed unto ourselves
In the hour of night
We take from ourselves
We repent and reward
It's the balance of thoughts
Seeks to find adoration, sleeping in tongues
Sing the words through you
