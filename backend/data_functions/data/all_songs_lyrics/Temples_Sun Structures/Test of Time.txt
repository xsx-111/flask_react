Test of Time Lyrics
The flower falls from an elegant tree
And scattering nature's seed
And as the leaves fall after the rain
The soil will always fade
And as the water drips down from the top
From the veil oh I can't be touched
The message reads like a marrying rhyme
As we stand through the test of time

Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why

Into the night, we are high; never mind
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the stars in sky
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet
Back from the clouds, be alive, nature speak

The hour ends in a soggy sound
As the trees full of fall falls down
And then the leaves drip golden sand
The lettering breaks again
And the river brings up from the top
From the heaven that life forgot
A message reads like a marrying end
As we stand through the test of time
Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why
Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why

Into the night, we are high; never mind
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the stars in sky
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet
Back from the clouds, be alive, nature speak

Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why
Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why

Into the night, we are high; never mind
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the stars in sky
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet
Back from the clouds, be alive, nature speakEmbed
