Sun Structures Lyrics
Move away from the shade of the glass
All in till summer last
All the rocks in the golden light
Mythical trust of a long lost fortune

Carry on to the distant sun
Relics flare in the eyes of the one
Even brace while in the gun
Legacy waits in a long lost fortune

Take the path of you, inside the odyssey
Ritualistic signs upon the desert sea
Lead the river to the water
Take the fire from the trees
(Ah, ah)

Calling all in the time of the last
Ceremonial prayer to the grass
Sink the ground where the image falls
Mythical trust to a long lost fortune
Carry on to the far away side
Cross the side to the eyes of the one
Resting place for the echoing young
Legacy waits in a long lost fortune

Take the path of you, inside the odyssey
Ritualistic signs upon the desert sea
Lead the river to the water
Take the fire from the trees3Embed
