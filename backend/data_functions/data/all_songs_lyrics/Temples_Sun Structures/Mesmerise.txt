Mesmerise Lyrics
Mesmerise, symbolize everything that’s unique
Make the choice with a voice, speak within and talk away
Seems to endeavor, breach from within, beside the shallow lake of youth
Seen our reflection shine like a gem, within and serenade the view

Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire, early in the morning
Age fell into the sea, sunset of the east, you and I are older

Paradise is alive in the conscious of the brain
Shake away and become for one hour of the day
Piece of the passage, there from before, becomes a carousel of truth
Seems all the pleasure, shine like a gem, beneath the ever-changing view

Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire, early in the morning
Age fell into the sea, sunset of the east, you and I are older

Do you say what you feel at the end of the day
In your heart
In the rain, I’ll watch it wash you away
In a heartbeat, in our heart’s beach
Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire, early in the morning
Age fell into the sea, sunset of the east, you and I are older
Tears fell upon the fire, fell upon desire, early in the morning
Age fell into the sea, sunset of the east, you and I are older7Embed
