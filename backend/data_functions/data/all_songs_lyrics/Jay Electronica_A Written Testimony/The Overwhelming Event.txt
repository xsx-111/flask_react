The Overwhelming Event Lyrics
I don't wanna waste any time
I ask the question, "Who are the real Children of Israel?"
And I'd like to answer it right away
Go ahead, give me the sign
Like any good lawyer in a courtroom
He tells you what he's gonna prove
Alright
And then he goes ahead and proves it and let the jury make the decision
The honorable Elijah Muhammad has said that almighty God Allah revealed to him
That the black people of America are the real Children of Israel
And they, we, are the choice of God
And that unto us, he will deliver his promise
That's right7Embed
