Flux Capacitor Lyrics
To my uptown posse (Yeah), to my uptown posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard?)
To my BK posse (Yeah), to my BK posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard?)
To my 3rd Ward posse (Yeah), to my 3rd Ward posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard?)

Yeah, you know I'm full time trippin’
The crib look like Zaha Hadid did it, nah, he different
Hov here to deliver you like Moses, so it's
Indisputable fact, we the chosen
Throwin' Roc Nation brunches, that’s a feast for
Non-believers, I created my own Easter
Evidence for your reverence
Why would I not have a watch like a Saudi prince?
It unfoils
The slave that shook hands and humbled the duke of oil
The spook that spoke sterling silver and pearls twirled, tumbled out my nappy coils
Visions of sugar plums for all the boys and girls
Why would I sell out? I'm already rich, don't make no sense
Got more money than Goodell, a whole NFL bench
Did it one-handed like Odell handcuffed to a jail
I would've stayed on the sidelines if they could've tackled the shit themselves
You backstabbers gon' turn me back to the old Jay
He's not who you wanna see, he's not as sweet as the old Ye
When I die, please don’t tweet about my death (Death)
Tryna get mentions, bringin’ attention to yourself (To ya)
Please don't post some pic from in the club (Club)
With some quote you stole like we was tighter than what we was (Uh)
Tryna get likes from my love
If you can’t go by the crib and give my mama a hug
To my uptown posse (Yeah), to my uptown posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard?)
To my BK posse (Yeah), to my BK posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard?)
To my 3rd Ward posse (Yeah), to my 3rd Ward posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Uh)
Tell that Magnolia posse (Yeah), tell that Magnolia posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard? Uh, uh)

I send duaa's up from the belly of the Dunya (Subhanallah)
Duaa's up for my umi in the ummah (Subhanallah)
Duaa's up for the honorable Louis Farrakhan
Who pulled me out the grave and pointed me towards the Sunnah (Mash’Allah)
Remember Rappin Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought we'd make it to Lā 'ilāha 'illā Allah
It's the day of the judgment, fulfillment of the covenant
These universal truths remain self-evident
R-O-C stand strong like Sphinx do (Uh)
Now who wan' come test the champion sound?
Limb by limb, we all gon' cut 'em down
Send for the hacksaw, take out the tongue
Tell that Parkway posse, tell that Parkway posse
Get the gat, get the gat, get the gat
From the Mag to that Melph to the Caliope
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
To my uptown posse (Yeah), to my uptown posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard?)
To my BK posse (Yeah), to my BK posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah)
To my 3rd Ward posse (Yeah), to my 3rd Ward posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Uh)
Tell that Magnolia posse (Yeah), tell that Magnolia posse (Yeah, yeah)
Get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Yeah), get the gat (Ya heard?)

I wanna go back to the—
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead with a full— Old way
But I'm drunk instead with a full ashtray, you're too late
Ashtray, you're too late
Too late, late
Too late, late
I wanna go back to the—
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead with a full— Old way
But I'm drunk instead with a full ashtray, you're too late
Ashtray, you're too late
Too late, late8Embed
