Fame and Fortune LyricsFame and fortune, facts of life
Most of what makes it is useless tripe
So change the angle of the battle plan
To hit the target
Fame and fortune, fancy that
Nothing but rabbits come out of the hat
So try to catch a falling star
Crush it into dust and stuff it down a jar
And throw it far away
Now the point is back to front
See-through people
See-through monuments
No empire
The beginning
At the ending
The beginning
At the ending
The beginning (one goes up)
At the ending (one goes down)
The beginning (one goes up)
At the ending (one goes down)
Hey!
Smash a face against the wall
Grind a face into the ground - Oh No
Pretty faces on the wall - They Fall
Heat to boiling, disappear in the sky
Slash the ashes, and bake into a pie
(Pretty faces on the ground) - Oh No, No, No
Fame and fortune is a stupid game and
Fame and fortune is the game I play
Fame and fortune is a stupid game and
Fame and fortune is the game I play
Fame and fortune is a stupid game and (fame and fortune)
Fame and fortune is the game I play (fame and fortune)
Fame and fortune is a stupid game and (fame and fortune)
Fame and fortune is the game I play
I play foreverEmbed
