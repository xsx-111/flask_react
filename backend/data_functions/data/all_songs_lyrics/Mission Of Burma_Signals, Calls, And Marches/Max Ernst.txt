Max Ernst LyricsPeople did not like that man Max Ernst
(The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus)
He was so irrational, Max Ernst
(Garden Airplane-Trap, Garden Airplane-Trap)
The pleasures of the sight
The pleasures of the flesh
The vanities of life
He loved them all
In the pretty house they go away
(In the pretty house, In the pretty house)
In that pretty house they do not stay
(Not in the pretty house, Not in the pretty house)
In the burning sea
In the laughing lights
In the luminous sea
In the brash gold night
In the turtle's head I blacked out fast
In the city's halls always it laughed
