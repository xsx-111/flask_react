Outlaw LyricsI have split in two
I have split in two
Saw those creatures in the back of my heart
Opened the door and attacked them at the start
Pushed my blood into a deeper trance
It consumes my thought, it alters my stance
I have slipped into a mighty stream
Open my fins, open my scream
I saw you sleeping with your coat on a hill
While my face lay at the windowsill
I walked down the street on the sidewalks so cold
I walked down the street into the coat that folds
You turned around, screamed at the scene
Grabbed my hand and leapt out of the screen
I won't be there when the monster flips
I'll have it buried with an axe and a pick
I have seen you in your jacket
Now I am an outlaw, outlaw
I have seen you in your jacket
Now I am an outlaw, outlawEmbed
