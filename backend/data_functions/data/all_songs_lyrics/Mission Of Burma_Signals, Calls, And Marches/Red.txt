Red LyricsThere's a window in my head
There's a window in my heart
I look out of them when I'm sleepy
And then I fall apart
Things are crumbling outside of me
And they're crashing at my door
There's a crest that keeps arriving
I strip my face off of the mirror
And then I take another breath
The animals are still screaming
Dreaming, screaming for
A human's death
Things are crumbling outside of me
And they're crashing at my door
There's a crest that keeps arrivingEmbed
