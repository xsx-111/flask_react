Academy Fight Song Lyrics
Walk into my room
Ask me jerky questions
Don't mean what you say
Immaculate protection
Play by the rules
So close to the vest
Hope that all's not lost
And this is not a waste

Stay just as far from me
As me from you
Make sure that you are sure
Of everything I do
'Cause I'm not not not not not not not not
Your academy
Your academy

The halls smell like piss
The rooms are underlit
Still it must be nice
You're such a perfect fit
What's that I hear?
The sound of marching feet
It has a strange allure
It has a strange... allure
Stay just as far from me
As me from you
Make sure that you are sure
Of everything I do
'Cause I'm not not not not not not not not
Your academy
Your academy

Maybe you're right
I shouldn't judge
What's wrong or right
This is too much
I'm not judging you, I'm judging me
My academy
Your academy
My academy
Your academyEmbed
