Devotion Lyrics
No matter what the size, we always try to hit the mark
They say it's temporary, but their lights will soon fade to dark
Endurance, fortitude, and strength take a wicked toll
This can only mean promotion, but the party’s what matters of course

I’ve been in the service of the company for ten years
Stuck inside this dream factory, making real all your darkest fears
Though my duties have been few, I performed them as commanded
When the gyro gets so wet beneath the skids I understand it
Some people just don’t realize what devotion means

I should have known better than
To feed so greedy from this filthy hand
It’s the same old story
The underside of folly
And what right you’ve got to criticize
The warp and weft of well told lies
And thus it was hereafter
Amid the nation’s bastards
Ahh ahh
Ahh ahh

Pockets of power, pouches of pestilence
The trip would make life celebrate our new heads
And it’s final, but not fatal, represents a rubber caste
We would stick by to the end with tenderness and prejudice
Some people just don’t realize what devotion is
I see something staring us in the eye
It’s another bad dream, the system caught us in our lie
And I know I’m not the smartest man who ever walked the earth
But we have to think that wellness, it’s a sign of something worth
And look what is wrong to feel just what devotion means
