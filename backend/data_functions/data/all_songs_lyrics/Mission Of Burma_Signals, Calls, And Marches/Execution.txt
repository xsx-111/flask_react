Execution LyricsIt wasn't complicated
It was just done wrong
To get him to run but
It took him too long
He could be headed in his arms
Then he couldn't see
The man behind him
No ball, no chain
No hammer from the judge
No deal, no trial
It's just an execution
Don't tell him
'Cause he doesn't wanna know
Know, know, know about it
I got no father
I couldn't connect
With confused reasons
Well, what could I expect?
Over the fence
With his back to wall
I heard the gun and I heard them call
Yeah, I heard them call my name
Simple life
A simple man's luck
An open door
Now he betrayed them ... 
But he would never
He'll never do it again
He'll never, never, never, never
Simple life
A simple man's luck
An open door
Now he betrayed them to the State 
And he'll never
You'll never do it again
I bet you'll never
You'll never do it again, no
Never, never
You'll never do it again
Never, never
You'll never do it again
