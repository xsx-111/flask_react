Empty Pages Lyrics{Intro}
{Verse 1}
Found someone who can comfort me
But there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane
But I just want you to know
{Verse 2}
She's the one makes me feel so good
When everything is against me
Picks me up when I'm feeling down
So I've got something to show
{Chorus}
Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages
{Verse 3}
Often lost and forgotten
The vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard
But I've got something to show
{Chorus}
Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages
{Instrumental Bridge}
{Chorus}
Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages
{Verse 4}
Often lost and forgotten
The vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard
But I've got something to show
{Outro}
You know
Found someone who can comfort me
But there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane
But I just want you to know1Embed
