Freedom Rider LyricsLike a hurricane around your heart when earth and sky are torn apart
He comes gathering up the bits while hoping that the puzzle fits
He leads you, he leads you
Freedom rider
With a silver star between his eyes that open up at hidden lies
Big man crying with defeat, see people gathering in the street
You feel him, you feel him
Freedom rider
When lightning strikes you to the bone, you turn around, you're all alone
By the time you hear that siren sound, then your soul is in the lost and found
Forever, forever
Freedom rider
Here it comes1Embed
