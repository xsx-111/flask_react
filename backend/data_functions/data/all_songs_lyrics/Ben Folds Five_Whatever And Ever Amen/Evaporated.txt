Evaporated Lyrics
What I've kept with me
And what I've thrown away
And where the hell I've ended up
On this glary, random day
Were the things I really cared about
Just left along the way
For being too pent up and proud

Woke up way too late
Feeling hungover and old
And the sun was shining bright
And I walked barefoot down the road
Started thinking 'bout my old man
It seems that all men want to get into a car and go
Anywhere

Here I stand
Sad and free
I can't cry
I can't see
What I've done
Oh God what have I done?
Don't you know I'm numb, man
No I can't feel a thing at all
'Cause it's
All smiles and business these days
And I'm indifferent to the loss
I've faith that there's a soul somewhere
That's leading me round
I wonder if she knows which way is down

Here I stand
Sad and free
I can't cry
I can't see
What I've done
Oh God what have I done?

I poured my heart out
I poured my heart out
It evaporated, see?

Blind man on a canyon's edge
Of a panoramic scene
Maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random
Dangling on a string
Or slumped over in a vacant room
Head on a stranger's knee
I'm sure back home
They think I've lost my mind
Here I stand
Sad and free
I can't cry
I can't see
What I've done
Oh God what have I done?2Embed
