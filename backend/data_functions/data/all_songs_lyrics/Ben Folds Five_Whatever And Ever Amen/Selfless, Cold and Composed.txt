Selfless, Cold and Composed Lyrics
I
Said what you wanted to hear
And what I
Wanted to say
So I will take it back
And all the dishes intact
Let them be
Broken
Broken

It's easy to be
Easy and free
When it doesn't mean anything
You remain selfless, cold
And composed

You've done me no
Favor to call and be nice
Telling me I
Can take anything
I
Like
You don't owe me to be so polite
You've done no wrong
You've done no wrong
Get out of my sight
It's easy to be
Easy and free
When it doesn't mean anything
You remain selfless, cold
And composed

Come on baby, now throw me a right to the chin
Don't you stare like you never cared, I know you did
But you just smile
Like a bank teller
Blankly telling me "Have a nice life."

Come on baby, now throw me a right to the chin
Just one sign that'll show me that you give a shit
But you just smile
Politely
And I grow weaker and I

Said what you wanted to hear
And what I
Wanted to say
So I will take it back
It's easy to be
Easy and free
When it doesn't mean anything
It doesn't mean anything
You can take anything
You can take anything
So selfless, cold
So selfless, cold
So selfless, cold
And composedEmbed
