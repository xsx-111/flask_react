Kate Lyrics
She plays "Wipeout" on the drums
The squirrels and the birds come
Gather around to sing the guitar
Oh, I... Have you got nothing to say?

When all words fail, she speaks
Her mixtape's a masterpiece
Walks through the garden
So the roses can see
Oh, I... Have you got nothing to say?

And you can see the daisies
In her footsteps
Dandelions (dandelions)
Butterflies (butterflies)

I wanna be Kate!
Kate!
Kate!
Kate!

Every day she wears the same thing
I think she smokes pot
She's everything I want
She's everything I'm not
Oh, I... Have you got nothing to say?
She never gets wet
She smiles and it's a rainbow (oh, oh)
And she speaks (and she speaks)
And she breathes (yeah, and she breathes)

I wanna be Kate!
Kate!
Kate!
Kate!

Down by Rosemary and Cameron
She hands out the Bhagavad Gita
I see her around every couple days
I wanna see her so that I can say, "Hey... Kate!"

Ooh, la la la
Ooh, la la la
Oooh, la la la laa
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

She never gets wet
She smiles and it's a rainbow (oh, oh)
You can see (you can see)
I wanna wanna wanna wanna be...
Kate!
Kate!
Kate!
No, no...
Kate!
Kate!
Kate!
No, no, no, no, no, no...1Embed
