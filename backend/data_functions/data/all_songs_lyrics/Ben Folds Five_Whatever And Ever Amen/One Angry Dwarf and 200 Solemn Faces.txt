One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces Lyrics
September '75, I was 47 inches high
My mom said by Christmas I would have
A badass mother GI Joe for your little minds to blow
I still got beat up after class

Yeah, now I'm big and important
One angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces are you
If you really want to see me
Check the papers and the TV
Look who's tellin' who what to do
Kiss my ass goodbye

Don't give me that bullshit, you know who I am
I'm your nightmare little man
Vic, you stole my lunch money, made me cry
Jane, remember second grade?
Said you couldn't stand my face
Rather than kiss me
You said you'd rather die

I'm big and important
One angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces are you
If you really want to see me
Check the papers and the TV
Look who's tellin' who what to do
No, kiss my ass goodbye
You'll be sorry one day
Yes you will, yes you will
You shouldn't push me around
Cause I will, yes I will
You will be sorry when I'm big
Yes you will, yes you will
You will be sorry

Now I'm big and important
One angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces are you
If you really want to see me
Check the papers and the TV
No, look who's tellin' who what to do
Kiss my ass
Kiss my ass
Kiss my ass goodbye now
Kiss my ass
Kiss my ass goodbye now
Kiss my ass
Kiss my ass goodbye now
Kiss my ass
Kiss my ass goodbye now
September '75, I was 47 inches high
September '75
