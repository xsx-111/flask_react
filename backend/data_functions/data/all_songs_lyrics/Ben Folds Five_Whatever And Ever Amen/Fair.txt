Fair Lyrics
He shouted out his last word
And he stumbled through the yard
And she shattered her last china plate
And spun off in the car

When he lunged onto the hood
She stopped to tell him she'd been wrong
He was thrown head over heels
Into the traffic coming on

But then all is fair
All is fair in love

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba

Did you get my other letters
Sometimes I think I oughta call
'Cause you know I often wonder
If you open them at all
Every couple nights or so
You know you pop into my dreams
I just can't get rid of you
Like you got rid of me
Oh, but I send my best
'Cause God knows you've seen my worst

Yeah well, all is fair
All is fair in love

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ah, ah, ah

All this breathing in, never breathing out
All this breathing in, never breathing out
All this breathing in, never breathing out

Well, I guess she made her way
Through the mob too late to hear him say
That he'd gotten all he'd wanted
A crowd to watch him bear the pain
He'd been keeping in
(So what) So what
All is fair
All is fair in love
Yeah well, all is fair
All is fair in love

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba

Am I right?
Am I right?
Not only am I right
I'm lonely and I'm right
YeahEmbed
