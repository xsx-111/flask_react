Song for the Dumped Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4!

So you wanted
To take a break
Slow it down some
And have some space
Well, fuck you too

Give me my money back
Give me my money back
You bitch
I want my money back
And don't forget
Don't forget
To give me back my black T-shirt

I wish I hadn't
Bought you dinner
Right before you
Dumped me on your front porch

Give me my money back
Give me my money back
You bitch
I want my money back
And don't forget
Don't forget
To give me back my black T-shirt
So you wanted
To take a break
Slow it down some
And have some space

Give me my money back
Give me my money back
You bitch
I want my money back
I want my money back
And don't forget2Embed
