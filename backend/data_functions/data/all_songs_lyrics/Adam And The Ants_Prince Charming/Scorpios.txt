Scorpios LyricsThere's a gang in every town
I say that the rules be turned around
Listen here from one who knows
Be fearless just like the Scorpios
Pretty, look young be fearless
Like the Scorpion
Pretty, look young be fearless
Like the Scorpion
The Scorpion
The Scorpion
Black's the colour watch the claws
With nails as sharp as Diana Dors
Watching us is stopping you
From cruising Ugly Avenue
Pretty, look young be fearless
Like the Scorpion
Pretty, look young be fearless
Like the Scorpion
The Scorpion
The Scorpion
And if by chance you cling to hate
Just rest assured it's your mistake
Hold up your head, you know I'm right
The street's the place, tonight's the night
The night
The night look pretty, look young be fearless like the Scorpion
The night look pretty have fun, don't listen when you're told there's none...Embed
