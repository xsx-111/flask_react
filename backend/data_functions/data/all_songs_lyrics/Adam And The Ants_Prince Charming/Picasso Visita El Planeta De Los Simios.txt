Picasso Visita El Planeta De Los Simios LyricsSee the Spaniard eating chocolates
See the Spaniard have a ball
See the Spaniard trust in no one
He's on quality street
He's on quality street
As the masters rot on walls
And the angels eat their grapes
I watched Picasso visit The Planet Of The Apes
As the masters rot on walls
And the angels eat their grapes
I watched Picasso
Pablo Picasso
Visit The Planet Of The Apes (yeah)
See the Spaniard seek companion
See the Spaniard take it all
See the Spaniard sell his friends out
He's on quality street
He's on quality street
And pretenders pretend
To their patronage lend
But it's the ones we don't see
That always fascinate me
As the masters rot on walls
And the angels eat their grapes
I watched Picasso visit The Planet Of The Apes
As the masters rot on walls
And the angels eat their grapes
I watched Picasso
Pablo Picasso
Visit The Planet Of The Apes (yeah)
As the real heroes died
And their ideas supplied
To a fat little magpie
With money in his eyes
They bowed and they scraped
As opinions he shaped
Now every little sketch a fortune will fetch
And the bleach killer kills
And the bleach killer kills yeah
And as the masters rot on walls (see the Spaniard sell the whole world)...Embed
