Ant Rap Lyrics
Rap up
Rap it up
Put some wax on the tracks and slide on out of here
Hane, hane, hane, hane, hane

Hatchets to the corner, ants to the ground
Improve to the groove, get down to the sound
Buttons and bows, and bleu, blanc, rouge
All things lively must be used
Liberté, egalité
Au jour d'hui c'est trés trés trés
Voici l'opportunité, nous incroyables
I got the moves, they got the grooves
Summon the gods, and they all approve
Bad vibes akimbo, on the shelf
Bit of a rap thing, going for myself
These gold on the teeth, no sense at all
It only matters, when it's on the wall
I'm standing here with my four men
Let's start that rapping thing again

Marco, Merrick, Terry Lee
Gary Tibbs and Yours Truly
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
I have the mouth
So tired of anarchists looking at me
Don't need their credibility
"Destroy", they say, "defy", "condemn"
As long as you don't destroy them
With twenty years of drugs and drink
I thought the time had some to think
About standing up and saying that
It's a tragedy, and such old hat
I'm standing here with my four men
Let's start that rapping thing again

Marco, Merrick, Terry Lee
Gary Tibbs and Yours Truly
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
I have the mouth

The happy feet are all we need
Summoned the gods and they all agreed
These feet won't stop, they're in such a hurry
Knock it on the head and I go for a curry
Staying sober can be neat
Right down to your happy feet
Keep on trying to pin me down
Why a title for your sound?
I'm standing here with my four men
Do this rapping thing again
I got Marco, Merrick, Terry Lee
Gary Tibbs and Yours Truly
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
In the Naughty North and in the Sexy South
We're all singing, I have the mouth
And you have the mouth
And he got the mouth1Embed
