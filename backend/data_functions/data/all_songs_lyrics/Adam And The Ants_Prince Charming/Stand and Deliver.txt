Stand and Deliver Lyrics
Stand and deliver!

I'm the dandy highwayman who you're too scared to mention
I spend my cash on looking flash and grabbing your attention
The devil take your stereo and your record collection
The way you look, you'll qualify for next year's old age pension

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife

I'm the dandy highwayman so sick of easy fashion
The clumsy boots, peekaboo roots that people think so dashing
So what's the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking?
It's kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake he's making

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife
And even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine

We're the dandy highwaymen so tired of excuses
Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses
We're the dandy highwaymen and here's our invitation
Throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation!

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife

And even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine

Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly
Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly
Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly
Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly
Stand and deliver (Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly)
Your money or your life (Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly)
Stand and deliver (Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly)
Your money or your life (Qua qua, da diddly, qua qua, da diddly)2Embed
