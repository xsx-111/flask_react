Come with Us LyricsCome with us
And leave your Earth behind
Bright and clear, we see the light
Our universe is at your side!
Please lead us to other suns more bright
Behold! They're coming back!
Behold! They're coming back!
They're coming back
They're coming back
They're coming back
They're coming back
Come with us...Embed
