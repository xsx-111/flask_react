The Test Lyrics
Oh
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Yeeeh (oh)
Am I coming through?
Am I coming through?
Is this sweet and pure and true?

Devil came by this morning
Said he had something to show me
I was looking like I've never seen a face before
Here we go now, let's slide in through the open door

Pictures and things that I've done before
Circling around me, I'm here on the floor
I'm dreaming this and I'm dreaming that
Regretting nothing, think about that

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord, I'm shining
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I've almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain what I've seen
I'm happy now to have seen it
To find that the images are fading away

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord I'm shining

Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain the things I've seen
But now I think I see the light
Now I think I see the light

Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord I'm shining

Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
You know I almost lost my mind
Now I'm home, and I'm free
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?

(You'd better go to bed now)
(You'd better go to bed now)
(You'd better go to bed now)
(You'd better go to bed now)
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
You'd better go to bed now
(You'd better go to bed now)
(You'd better go to bed now)

My heart and soul, they are free
My heart and soul they are free

(Oh)
You know I almost lost my mind
Now I'm home, and I'm free
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?Embed
