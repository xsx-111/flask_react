Bad-Eyed and Loveless LyricsYes'n she's bad-eyed and she's loveless
A young man's fancy and an old man's dream
I'm self raising and I flower in her company
Give me no sugar without her cream
She's a warm fart at Christmas
She's a breath of champagne on sparkling night
Yes'n she's bad-eyed and she's loveless
Turns other women to envious green
Yes'n she's bad-eyed and she's loveless
She's a young man's vision in my old man's dreamEmbed
