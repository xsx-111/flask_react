Pied Piper LyricsNow if you think Ray blew it
There was nothing to it
They patched him up as good as new
You can see him every day ---
Riding down the queen's highway
Handing out his small cigars to the kids from school
And all the little girls with their bleached blond curls
Clump up on their platform soles
And they say "Hey Ray --- let's ride away
Downtown where we can roll some alley bowls."
And Ray grins from ear to here, and whispers...
So follow me. Trail along
My leather jacket's buttoned up
And my four-stroke song will pick you up when your last class ends;
And you can tell all your friends:
The Pied Piper pulled you
The mad biker fooled you
I'll do what you want to:
If you ride with me on a Friday anything goes
So follow me, hold on tight
My school girl fancy's flowing in free flight
I've a tenner in my skin tight jeans
You can touch it if your hands are clean
The Pied Piper pulled you
The mad biker fooled you
I'll do what you want to:
If you ride with me on a Friday anything goesEmbed
