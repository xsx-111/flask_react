Strip Cartoon LyricsFish and chips, sandpaper lips and a rainy pavement
Soho lights, another night --- thinking of you
Black cat, sat on a wall, winks at me darkly
Suggesting ways and means that I might win a smile ---
As you leave the place where you work until 12.30
And the policemen nods as you pass along his beat
Sweaty feet, troubled brow -- we're all in the same game, lady
Life's no bowl of cherries --- it's a black and white strip cartoon
I've been warned that you and your friends are crazy
As from your hearts you bare your parts to the gentlemen
Who, while they drool, trying to keep cool, spill their Scotch and water
But I'm not that way, I must say --- I'd much prefer to see you in your texturised rubber rainwear around 12.30
Come and play shades of grey in my black and white strip cartoon
Strip cartoon is all I'm after
Strip cartoon is all I crave ---
So come to my place around 12.30
'cos I'm a leading politician at a dangerous ageEmbed
