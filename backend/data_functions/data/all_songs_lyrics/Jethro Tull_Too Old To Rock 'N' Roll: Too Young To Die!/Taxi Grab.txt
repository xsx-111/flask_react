Taxi Grab LyricsShake a leg, it's the big rush, can't find a taxi can't find a bus
Bodies jammed in the underground evacuating London town
Nowhere to put your feet as the big store shoppers and the pavements meet
Red lights --- pin stripes --- short step shuffle into the night
Tea time calls --- the Bingo Halls open at seven in the old front stalls
How about a Taxi Grab
There's an empty cab by the taxi stand driver's in the caf√© washing his hands
Big diesel idles --- the keys inside --- c'mon Sally let's take a ride
Flag down --- uptown --- no sweat. For rush hour travel, it's the best bet yet
