Big Dipper LyricsThe mist rolls off the beaches, the train rolls into the station
Weekend happiness seekers, pent-up saturation
Well, we don't mean anyone any harm, we weren't on the Glasgow train
I see you at the Pleasure Beach, roller-coasting heroes
Big Dipper riding
We'll give the local lads a hiding
If they keep us from the ladies
Hanging out in the penny arcades
Shaking up the Tower Ballroom
Throwing up in the bathroom
Landlady's in the backroom
Oh well, I'm the Big Dipper it's the weekend
Big Dipper it's the weekend rage
Rich widowed landlady give me your spare front door key
If you're thirty-nine or over, I'll make love to you next Thursday
Oh well, I may stay over for a week or two, drop a postcard to my mum
I'll see you on the waltzer, we'll go big-dipping daily
Big Dipper riding
Oh, we'll give the local lads a hiding
If they keep us from the ladies
Hanging out in the penny arcades
Shaking up the Tower Ballroom
Throwing up in the bathroom
Landlady's in the backroom
Oh, well, I'm the Big Dipper it's the weekend
Big Dipper it's the weekend
Big Dipper it's the weekend rageEmbed
