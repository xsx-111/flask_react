That Day LyricsCan you hear me now
Lying in this bed
Embedded in this written story
Can you hear me now
Calling from this bed
I'm spitting words but there's no meaning, no
(Now he's taking his time)
He's got nothing to lose
(But the first thing he sees)
Is the last thing he choose
(And when the moment arrived)
He just found he had nothing to say
That day
Can you hear me now
Sky is turning red
The streets are all gone
Am I dreaming, no
Can you hear me now
Falling from this bed
Nudist that bears gifts
But when will it show me
(Now she's taking her time)
She's got nothing to lose
(But the first thing she sees)
Is the last thing she choose
(And when the moment arrived)
She just found she had nothing to say
That day
He lies awake in his bed every night devising ways to conceal the strain
She never tells of her midnight fears or admits that she does the same
They never meet, never touch, never speak and for one tired old refrain
Can you hear me now
Lying in this bed
Embedded in this written story
Can you hear me now
Calling from this bed
I'm spitting words but there's no meaningEmbed
