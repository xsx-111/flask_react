Pieces LyricsFor a long long time
I've been in pieces
In the corner of a room
In an endless afternoon
For a long long time
I've been in pieces
For a long long time
I've been in pieces
I've been in pieces
I've been in pieces
There is a way down
That I wish I had not found
You just split yourself in two
One for them and one for you
One for them and one for you
For a long long time
I've been in pieces
All the words I mean to say
They never come out the right way
And there are things that I could tell you
But they'll never come out the right way
And there are sides that I could show you
But they'll never come out the right way
Never come out the right way
Never come out the right way
Never come out the right way
Cause I've been in pieces
I've been in pieces
I've been in pieces
I've been in pieces
I've been in pieces
I've been in piecesEmbed
