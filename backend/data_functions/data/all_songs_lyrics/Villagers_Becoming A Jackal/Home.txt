Home LyricsThe night's synthetic half-light
Rolls over your steering wheel
I'm closing my eyes just for a while
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
The house - the first thing I see
Filled up with a family
Surrounded by city and by sea
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
Will you wake me when we're almost halfway
I don't wanna take this trip alone
A saint is chasing a snake
For everybody's sake
And so they go burning cars
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
The mother prepares the weapon
Before handing it to son
Who watches as daddy runs
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
Will you wake me when we're almost halfway
I don't wanna take this trip alone
Cause I'd never reach my home
The flames wander through the city
And set fire to the sea
Then out of the blaze appears a face
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
A girl with a look in her eyes
As if to say, "I despise
Such poisonous family ties"
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
But a poison as sweet as nectar
Could never forget or neglect her
It carries her home and closes her eyes
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
So she goes back under
Swallows the water
Fixes her face like a good little daughter
And follows her family
Who follow a saint and a snake
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
Will you wake me when we're almost halfway
I don't wanna take this trip alone
Cause I'd never reach my home
No I'd never reach my home
No I'd never reach my home
Home
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
(Wake me when we're almost halfway)
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
(Wake me when we're almost halfway)
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
(Wake me when we're almost halfway)
(Can you call me when we're almost halfway)
(Wake me when we're almost halfway)2Embed
