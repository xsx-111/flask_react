The Meaning Of The Ritual LyricsMy love is selfish
And I bet that yours is too
What is this peculiar word called truth?
My love is selfish
And it cares not who it hurts
It will cut you out to satisfy its thirst
For the meaning of the ritual so habitual and cursed
My love is selfish
How it separates the earth
It takes every shiny stone but leaves the dirt
For the cowards in the corner who just don't know what they're worth
They've been twisted by a hollow kind of pain
I can see it in their eyes, but I ignore it every day
'Cause my love is selfish
And it remembers everything
Like the first time it was moved enough to sing
How it dangled on that stage just like a puppet on a string
The meaning of the ritual
The meaning of the ritual
The meaning of the ritual
The meaning of the ritual
The meaning of the ritual
The meaning of the ritual
The meaning of the ritualEmbed
