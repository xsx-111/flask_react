Set The Tigers Free Lyrics
Farewell to my only friend
You've been so good to me
Now the carnival has ended
Let's set the tigers free
The spring was always early
And the winter never came
But since I got this hunger
It just hasn't been the same
I'm leaving for the great wide open plains
Leaving while this holy spark remains
I see you've written promises to make me stay
But it really doesn't matter now anyway
I'm leaving

True love feeds on absences like pleasure feeds on pain
So no matter where I'm standing I still love you all the same
And I hope you feel the same way when its your turn to disappear
I'll be cheering from the sidelines with a sandwich and a beer

And all at once I step outside into the wind and rain
I let it wash my weary eyes and see you do the same
(And all at once I step outside into the wind and rain
I let it wash my weary eyes and see you do the same)
