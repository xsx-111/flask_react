Ship Of Promises LyricsYou see a mask from your window at night
So you wake and you go outside
And you put it on
And they treat you in a different way
But you can't understand what they say
After you've put it on
So a change is never an end
Cause this is happening all over again
And it's been days since I left
On this ship of promises
Another day, another denial
Every longing's up on trial
So you learn to put it on
As the captain calls everyone in
To the dance hall and the night begins
You have to put it on
All these visions of a welcoming party, pretty party
Have been lost, cause it's the same since I left
On this ship of promises
All the churches I remember well
Clocking in and out to the sound of the bell
We just put it on
It takes you in, it scrubs you clean, it sanitizes every dream
And you put it on
You just put it on
But I'll meet you in between
What I say and what I mean
And we will make our own mess
On this ship of promises
Cause it's the same since we left
On this ship of promises
We just could not care less
On this ship of promises
Don't look backEmbed
