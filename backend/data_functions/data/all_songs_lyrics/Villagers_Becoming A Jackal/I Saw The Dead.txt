I Saw The Dead LyricsHave you got just a minute
Are you easily mad
Let me show you the back room
Where I saw the dead
Dancing like children
On a midsummer morn
And they asked me to join
They asked me to join
But my body was stubborn
Wouldn't let me give in
So I offered a good deed
In return for a sin
Now they've got me where they want me
In this daily parade
And I walk unafraid
I walk unafraid
But the crowd's are all laughing
At my every mistake
And its making my neck hurt
And I feel like a fake
How can I even stand here
Like I've something to say
I got nothing to say
I got nothing to say
And it feels like I'm changing
Keep forgetting my way
So I asked an old stranger
And he led me astray
It's something we're missing darling
So let's wander instead
And I'll show you the back room
Where I saw the dead
And we will be thankful
And we will be fed
You take the torso
And I'll take the head
It's something we're missing darling
So let's wander instead
And I'll show you the back room
Where I saw the deadEmbed
