Stoney End LyricsI was born from love, and my poor mother worked the mines
I was raised on the good book Jesus till I read between the lines
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning
Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again
(Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again)
I can still remember him with love light in his eyes
But the light flickered out and parted as the sun began to rise
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning
Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again
(Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again)
Never mind the forecast, 'cause the sky has lost control
'Cause the fury and the broken thunder's come to match my raging soul
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning
Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me
Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me againEmbed
