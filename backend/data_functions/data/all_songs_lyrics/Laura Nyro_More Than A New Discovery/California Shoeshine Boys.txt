California Shoeshine Boys LyricsCalifornia shoeshine boys, counting up their dimes;
Counting up the girls they've known, and counting up the times...
I got heartache, but I got news:
California shoeshine boys, you can shine my shoes!
California shoeshine boys never really care
Only for that California shoeshine in their hair...
I got heartache, but I got news:
California shoeshine boys, you can shine my shoes!
California sunshine boys, rapping ten feet tall;
John can make sweet Cindy cry, but Joe can make her crawl....
I got heartache, said I've got heartache
I got miles of heartache, and I've got heartache
I got walls of heartarche...
Let me go... let me go...
Let me go.. let me - ten hundred walls of heartache...
Let me go - ten hundred walls of heartache...
Let me go... Let me go...
Let me go...
I got heartache, but I got news:
California sunshine boys, yeah... yeah, yeah...
California shoeshine boys, counting up their dimes
Counting up the girls they've known, and counting up the times...
I got heartache, but I got news, baby:
California shoeshine boys, you can shine my shoes!
California shoeshine boys, yeah...
California shoeshine boys, yeah...
California shoeshine boys, California shoeshine boys
California sunshine boysâ€¦
Yeah, uh-huh!Embed
