Goodbye Joe LyricsWe were lost in the fair on the highland, good bye, Joe
With the sky and the deer on the highland, good bye, Joe
Time is full of changes and now you've got to go
Don't forget that we loved on the highland, good bye, Joe
Good bye, Joe, yes, I understand, I'm trying not to cry
But if I do, it's only cause I'll miss you, one more time, let me kiss you
I remember when you came calling, good bye, Joe
Like a sunrise that rose without warning, good bye, Joe
Time is full of changes and now you've got to go
And we walked on a Manhattan morning, good bye Joe
Good bye, Joe, yes, I understand, I'm trying not to cry
But if I do, it's only cause I'll miss you, one more time, let me kiss you
Good bye, Joe, good bye, Joe, time is full of changes, Joe, and now you've got to go
Don't forget that we loved on the highland, good bye, Joe, goodbye, Joeâ€¦Embed
