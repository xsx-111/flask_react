Buy and Sell LyricsCocaine and quiet beers, sweet candy and caramels
Pass the time and dry the tears on a street called buy and sell
Life turns like the endless sea. Death tolls like a vesper bell
Children laugh and lover dream on a street called buy and sell
Ladies dress calico style, beware your heart
And the men walk shamelessly, aimlessly by
Cinders in the daylight, junkyards in the sky, buy and sell
Sell my goods to buy my roof, my bed, my bed
Two pennies will buy a rose. Three pennies and who can tell
On a street that comes and goes by the name of buy and sell?
Buy and sell, sell my goods to buy my roof, my bedEmbed
