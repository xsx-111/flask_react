Wedding Bell Blues LyricsBill
I love you so, I always will
I look at you and you see the passion eyes of May
Oh, but am I ever gonna see my wedding day?
Oh, I was on your side, Bill, when you were losing
I'd never scheme or lie, Bill, there's been no fooling
But kisses and love won't carry me 'til you marry me, Bill
I love you so, I always will
And in your voice I hear a choir of carousels
Oh, but am I ever gonna hear my wedding bells?
I was the one came running when you were lonely
I haven't lived one day not loving you only
But kisses and love won't carry me 'til you marry me, Bill
I love you so, I always will
And though devotion rules my heart, I take no bows
Oh but, Bill, you know I wanna take my wedding vows
Come on, Bill
So come on, Bill
Come on and marry me, Bill
I love you so, I always will
Got the wedding bell blues
Yeah, yeah, the wedding bell blues
Yeah, yeah, the wedding bell blues
Yeah, yeah, the wedding bell bluesEmbed
