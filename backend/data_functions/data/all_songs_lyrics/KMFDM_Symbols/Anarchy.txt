Anarchy LyricsYou break my back
You won't break me
All is black
But I still see
Shut me down
Knock me to the floor
Shoot me up
Fuck me like a whore
Trapped under ice
Comfortably cold
I've gone as low as you can go
Feel no remorse
No sense of shame
Time's gonna wash away all pain
I made a god out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king of deceit
Now I sleep in anarchy
Anarchy
Sacrifice to the cause
Turn your code into law
Compensate to validate the loss
Take a thief
Nail him to a cross
Gospel of rage
Faction of hate
Deviate from the absolute
Born of revenge
Raised on cement
Chaos created government
I made a god out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king of deceit
Wake me up in anarchy
Anarchy
Anarchy
Anarchy
Trapped under ice
Comfortably cold
I've gone as low as you can go
Feel no remorse
No sense of shame
Time's gonna wash away all pain
I made a god out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king of deceit
Now I sleep in anarchy
I made a god out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king of deceit
Wake me up in anarchy
Born of revenge
Raised on cement
Chaos created government
I made a god out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king of deceit
Wake me up in anarchy
Anarchy
Anarchy
Anarchy
Anarchy
