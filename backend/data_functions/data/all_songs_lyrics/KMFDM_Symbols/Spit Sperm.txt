Spit Sperm LyricsI keep account of my hits and my misses
The bottle makes the final call
Fuel me with some of your kisses
Turn towards the weeping wall
Distilled within your discipline
Return to go and start again
Bleeding on your hallowed ground
I'm gonna lay this sodden soul right down in...
Spit sperm spit
Spit sperm spit
Your TV is my teacher
Confessional and preacher
Forgive me, Lord, for all this hate
I simply am inebriate
See the gun
Pick it up
All day long you'll have good luck
See the gun
Let it lie
You'll want that gun before you die
Spit sperm
This moral bankrupt stinking vat
Spit sperm
Of shit-fueled lies and empty highs
Spit sperm
Bled between these piss-stained lines
Spit sperm
And hid behind my glazing eyes
I keep account of my hits and my misses
The bottle makes the final call
Fuel me with some of your kisses
Turn towards the weeping wall
Distilled within your discipline
Return to go and start again
Bleeding on your hallowed ground
I'm gonna lay this sodden soul right
Spit sperm
Spit sperm
Spit sperm
Spit sperm
Your TV is my teacher
Confessional and preacher
Forgive me, Lord, for all this hate
I simply am inebriate

Spit sperm spit
Spit sperm spit
See the gun (Spit)
Pick it up (Sperm)
All day long (Spit) you'll have good luck
See the gun (Spit)
Let it lie (Sperm)
You'll want that gun (Spit) before you dieEmbed
