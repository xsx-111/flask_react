Unfit LyricsYou are the sweetest disease for me
I can't hear you say "Please" to me
There's nothing you cannot say to me
Come on, get down, and pray with me
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'll wipe a stripe on you tonight
I'll tee you high, and you will fly
There's no feeling inside of me
You'll see nothing can hide in me
You'll find nothing can feed on me
Don't look, listen, or believe in me
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'll wipe a stripe on you tonight
I'll tee you high, and you will fly
You are the sweet disease in me
I cannot hear your "Please" to me
There's nothing you can say to me
Come on, get down, and play with me
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'll wipe a stripe on you tonight
I'll tee you high, and you will fly
Fly
You will
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down....up
- Sweet disease in me
I cannot hear your "Please" to me
There's nothing you can say to me
Come on, get down, and play with meEmbed
