Mercy LyricsI went through too many people
I went through heaven and hell
I went from Rome to Bagdad
Too many stories to tell
What do you mean by that?
Mercy is all you get
Do what you won't regret
Freedom's your self-respect
What do you mean by that?
I lived through too many aeons
I've risen up, and I fell the fall
I have been there, and I have done that
I've seen it all and all
What do you mean by that?
Mercy is all you get
Do what you won't regret
Freedom's your self-respect
What do you mean by that?
My time is running like water
Deeper I dive and deeper
Last of nine lives of the cat
I saved my soul for the reaper
What do you mean by that?
(I saved my soul for the reaper)
Mercy is all you get
(Deeper I dive and deeper)
Do what you won't regret
(I saved my soul for the reaper)
Freedom's your self-respect
(Deeper I dive and deeper)
What do you mean by that?
(I saved my soul for the reaper)
Mercy is all you get
(Deeper I dive and deeper)
Do what you won't regret
(I saved my soul for the reaper)
Freedom's your self-respect
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?Embed
