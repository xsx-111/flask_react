Waste LyricsWhat I don't know, I don't like
What I don't like, I don't  want
What I don't want, I waste
I hypnotize with alibis and fingers made of lead
I sympathize with frozen eyes turned inwards in my head
I realize to my demise it's better left unsaid
That columns crash down endlessly, and I will end up dead
Go!
Waste
What I don't see, I don't know
What I don't know, I don't want
Waste
What I don't want, I don't need
What I don't need, I don't feel
Waste
What I don't feel, I don't say
What I don't say, I don't do
Waste
What I don’t do, I don’t like
What I don’t like, I waste
I theorize I'm on the rise
But all I do is fall
I victimize my love of life
I've seen and done it all
Ready, steady, stop
Hurry up and wait
The tick-tick-ticking of the clock
Delineates your fate
Waste
What I don't see, I don't know
What I don't know, I don't want
Waste
What I don't want, I don't need
What I don't need, I don't feel
Waste
What I don't feel, I don't say
What I don't say, I don't do
Waste
What I don’t do, I don’t like
What I don’t like, I waste
Ready, steady, go
Finish up your plate
Before you even realize
It's gonna be too late
I don’t know what I see
I don’t want what I know
I don’t need what I want
I don’t feel what I need
I don’t say what I feel
I don’t do what I say
I don’t like what I do
I just like to waste
Waste
