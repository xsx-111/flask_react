Torture LyricsMy motivations unresolved
Things are just never what they seem, uh huh
Apathy's currencies deceit
Pitch-bended radiated dreams
The jackal's wishing well forgotten
Dark cloud sunrise
The view of someone somewhere else is
Burnt in my eyes
How long - dug-up remains
How low - the rotting fame
How low - to see right through
How long - the hole I knew
How low - the clear-eyed stain
How long - to set aflame
How low - to be set up
How long - and taken out
The anti-like karma from the crack in a handful
Painting on a mural in a foreign landfill
Mind controlled by the pulley of the strings
So remote the view from the puppetry swing set
My reservations have evolved
Scenes once negated ushered in, uh huh
Mercy killings one-to-one defend
Visionary criminals descend
On knees all burning
A time of lifeless useless thought
What a paid ride
Alchemic jail-cell vivisection
Test-subject day job
How long - to pacify
How low - you still deny
How low - from up above
How low - the tripping sound
How long - to kick back down
How long - the creeping crown
How low - the holy cheat
How long - the leap of faith
These revelations undermined
Controlled belief in leads mankind, uh huh
Each penny sold and mesmerized
We're stoned
Two-fold reversal beckoning
The binding crayon words inverted
In Justice travestia
How long - dug-up remains
How low - the rotting fame
How low - to see right through
How long - the hole I knew
How low - the clear-eyed stain
How long - to set aflame
How low - to be set up
How long - and taken out
We worship acid moans and curbside holidays
Recycle shit we throw away in glossy packaged craze
Maybe in a day or so I'll stumble on that grassy knoll
To set the record straight
Announcing to myself:
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
We kill everything that's not tied down
We euthanize but keep alive the lowest form of prison life
So useful and experimental
Treatment of the sick and dying
What about the torture?
What about the torture?
What about the torture?
What about the torture?Embed
