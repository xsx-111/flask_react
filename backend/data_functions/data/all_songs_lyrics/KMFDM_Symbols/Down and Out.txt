Down and Out LyricsLa la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la

Welcome aboard the crazy trip
Circle of fools say, "Hi"

Watch your step, or you might trip
We're glad you came on by

The guys and I prepared a brew
You really ought to taste

It makes you strong and makes you 
Don't let it go to waste
All of us
Are going down
All of us
Are going down
Great that we pretend that we are all that
We enjoy ourselves
Should we get some help?
We have always failed, yet there is no doubt
Can't go wrong from here
We are down and out
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la

Care for some sweets to chase your drink?
I see you've quite a thirst

No no no, you can't yet go
First things must come first
All of us
Are going down
All of us
Are going down
Great that we pretend that we are all that
We enjoy ourselves
Should we get some help?
We have always failed, yet there is no doubt
Can't go wrong from here
We are down and out
We are down and out
We are down and out
Delicious not? You feel alive?
You need a little space?

So, you're not feeling well?
What's wrong with your face?
Great that we pretend that we are all that
We enjoy ourselves
Should we get some help?
We have always failed, yet there is no doubt
Can't go wrong from here
We are down and out
We are down and out
We are down and out

Holy smokes! We goofed again
The brew was not quite right

We'll throw him back behind the pen
And try again tonight
Welcome aboard the crazy trip
Circle of fools say, "Hi"  (Hi)

Watch your step, or you might trip
We're glad you came on by
Great that we pretend that we are all that
We enjoy ourselves
Should we get some help?
We have always failed, yet there is no doubt
Can't go wrong from here
We are down and out
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la laEmbed
