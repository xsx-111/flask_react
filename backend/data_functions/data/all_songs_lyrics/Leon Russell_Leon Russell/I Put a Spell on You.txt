I Put a Spell on You Lyrics1, 2, 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 1, 2

Well, honey, I've got what you need
When you're layin' down home alone
There's so much better things to do with your finger
Than to put it in a telephone
And you said come quickly 'cause your mama's away
But I had your mama just the other day

I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
Honey, I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
You better get yourself together and find out what you gonna do
(Find out all about it, tell the world about it)
And your daddy's a 'rassler but I know his style
I know some 'rassling music gonna drive him wild

I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
Mama, you gotta get yourself together, find out what you're gonna do
(Find out all about it, tell the world about it)
If I made her come quickly 'cause her mama's away
I think the guitar player might have something to say

(I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(Ooh, ooh)

Well now you're out own your own and you're layin' down on your back
It's not interrogation but you think that you might crack
And you said you'd never steal again, or scream for more
But you'll yell and kiss the balls that hang on the pawnshop door

I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
Lord I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
And you better get yourself together and find out what you gonna do
(Find out all about it, tell the world about it)
Yeah, come quickly 'cause your mama's away
But I had the ole girl just the other day

I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
I put a spell on you (I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(Ooh, ooh I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)
(I put a spell on you)Embed
