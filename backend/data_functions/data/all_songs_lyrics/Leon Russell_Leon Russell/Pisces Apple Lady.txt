Pisces Apple Lady Lyrics
Get off your bottle, go down and see a friend
He'll know what to do, lordy, when you tell him how bad it's been
He said you oughta get away to the English countryside
This cryin' won't help you now boy
Why don't you look how many tears you've cried?

When I got down to Chelsea I had no expectations
Oh, but to get away from the delta girl and the painful situation
But I hardly had the time, oh, to laugh and look around
And I found my heart was a-goin' again like a-English leaps and bounds, yeah

And she's a Pisces apple lady
When she speaks softly she screams
(She really got herself together)
Yes she does
(Oh oh)
She's a Pisces apple lady
Took me by surprise
And I fell into a hundred pieces
I said a-right before her eyes

Now we're together all the way to L.A
I know that she loves me 'cause she can brighten up a smoggy day
If I believed in marriage, oh, I'd take her for my wife
And move on down into high gear baby for the rest of my natural life
Oh, oh, oh
And she's a Pisces apple lady
When she speaks softly she screams
(She really got herself together)
Yes she does
(Oh oh)
She's a Pisces apple lady
She took me by surprise
And I fell into a hundred pieces
I said a-right before her eyes
Well she's a Pisces apple lady
When she speaks softly she screams
(She really got herself together)
Yes she does
(Oh oh)
And she's a Pisces apple lady
Took me by surprise
And I fell into a hundred pieces
I said a-right before her eyesEmbed
