Prince of Peace Lyrics
Try and judge me only by my time and changes
And not mistaken words, for I say many
Listen closely to my song and watch my eyes
There's not much time to spill, there's hardly any
Well, look at all the children living in the streets
And they're lucky, not afraid to touch each other
They're not afraid to be themselves or someone else
I choose the friends with love and not by color

Never treat a brother like a passing stranger
Always try to keep the love light burning
Listen only to his song and watch his eyes
For he might be the Prince of Peace returning
Yes, it might be the Prince of Peace returning

Oh, love the blind and wounded as you would yourself
And the businessmen in cells collecting pennies
Judge their wealth by coins that they give away
And not the ones they keep themselves for spending
And never be impatient with the ones who love you
It might be yourself that you're burning
Listen only to this song and watch their eyes
For you might be the Prince of Peace returning
And we never treat a brother like a passing stranger
Always try to keep the love light burning
Listen only to this song and watch his eyes
For you might be the Prince of Peace returning
Yeah, you might be the Prince of Peace returningEmbed
