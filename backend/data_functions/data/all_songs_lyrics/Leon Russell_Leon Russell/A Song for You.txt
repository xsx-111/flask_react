A Song for You Lyrics
I've been so many places
In my life and times
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my love on stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and
I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly
But darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darling can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and
I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place
Where there's no space and time
I love you for my life
You are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and
I was singing this song to you


But I love you in a place
Where there's no space and time
I love you for my life
You are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and
I was singing this song for you

We were alone and
I was singing this song for you
We were alone and
I was singing my song
Singing this song for you2Embed
