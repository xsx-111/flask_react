Delta Lady Lyrics
Woman of the country now I found you
Longing in your soft and fertile delta
And I whisper sighs to satisfy your longing
For the warm and tender shelter of my body

'Cause you're my
Delta lady
Yeah you're my, be all my
Delta lady

Please don't ask how many times I found you
Standing wet and naked in the garden
And I think of days and the different ways I held you
I held you closely to me, yes our heart was beating

'Cause you're my
Delta lady
Yeah you're my, be all my
Delta lady

Oh, and I'm over here in England
And I'm thinking of you
Because I love you, yes I do (yes I do)
Woah I love you, alright (you know I love you)
There are concrete mountains in the city
And pretty city women live inside them
And yet it seems the city scene is lacking
I'm so glad you're waiting for me in the country

For you're my
Delta lady
Darlin' you're my, oh me oh my
Delta lady

Woo
(You're my delta lady)
Gonna walk, gonna talk
Gonna scream and shout
Gonna tell all the world
What I'm thinkin' about
(You're my delta lady)
(You're my delta lady)
Gonna walk, gonna talk
Gonna scream and shout
Gonna tell all the world
What I'm thinkin' about
(You're my delta lady)
(You're mine, delta lady)
Gonna walk, gonna talk
Gonna scream and shout
Gonna tell all the world
What I'm thinkin' about
(You're mine, delta lady)Embed
