Roll Away the Stone Lyrics
Well it's such a strange world that I'm living in
She was my woman and he was my friend
But I was wrong again
Such strange changes that you put me through
But like a fool I'm still in love with you
What can this poor boy do?

Roll away the stone
Don't leave me here alone
Resurrect me and protect me
Don't leave me laying here
What will they do in two thousand years? Yeah

It's such a strange time that we're passing through
I thought you'd tell me when your time was due
I guess you thought I knew
Whoa, strange way to keep avoiding me
Why did you lie how could I help but be
Oh won't you help me please?

Roll away the stone
Don't leave me here alone
Resurrect me and protect me
Don't leave me laying here
What will they do in two thousand years?
Roll away the stone
Don't leave me here alone
Roll away, roll away the stone
Roll away the stone
Roll away, roll away, roll away the stone
Roll away the stone
Roll away, roll away the stone
Roll away the stone
Roll away, roll away the stoneEmbed
