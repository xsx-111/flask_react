Hurtsome Body Lyrics
When I first saw you down in Tennessee
I knew you were the only girl for me
And when you sang your song
It made me happy, yes it did
But you took my money and you took my old car
And you ran straight into my best friend's arms
And I just want to ask you darling

How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
Now I'm alone in England
And I'm thinkin' of how it used to be

We never did so well down in Hollywood
But mama I treated you just as good as I could
And I still love ya, won't you tell me

How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
Now I'm alone in England
Singin' about how it used to be
Whoa, I still love ya darling, won't you tell me
How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
How can you hurt somebody, hurt somebody like me?
How can you hurt somebodyEmbed
