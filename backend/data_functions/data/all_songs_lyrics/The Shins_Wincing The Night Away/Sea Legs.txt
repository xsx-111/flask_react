Sea Legs LyricsOf all the churning random hearts under the sun
Eventually fading into night
These two are opening now
As we lie, I touch you under fuller light
Girl if you're a seascape, I'm a listing boat
For the thing carries every hope
I invest in a single light
The choice is yours to be loved
Come away from an emptier boat
Cause when the dead moon rises again
We've no time to start a protocol to hem us in
And when the dog slides underneath the train
There's no cry, no use to searching for the mutt's remains
Throw all consequence aside
In a cheerless pyre we will set alight
Of all the intersecting lines in the sand
I routed a labyrinth to your lap
I never used a map sliding off the land
On an incidental tide
And along the way you know, they try, they try
And we got sea legs and we're off tonight
Can I've that to which they've no right?
You belong to a simpler time
I'm a victim to the impact of these words
And this rhyme
Cause when that dead moon rises again
We've no time to start a protocol to hem us in
Darling when the dog slides, open the door, and where'd she go?
There's no time, no use to searching for the mutt's remains
Throw all consequence aside
In a cheerless pyre that we will set alight2Embed
