Sleeping Lessons LyricsGo without
'Til the need seeps in
You low animal
Collect your novel petals for the stem
And glow, glow
Melt and flow
Eviscerate your fragile frame
And spill it out in the ragged floor
A thousand different versions of yourself
And if the old guard still offend
They got nothing left on which you depend
So enlist every ounce
Of your bright blood
And off with their heads
Jump from the hook
You're not obliged to swallow anything you despise
See, those unrepenting buzzards want your life
And they got no right
As sure as you have eyes
They got no right
Just put yourself in my new shoes
And see that I do what I do
Because the old guard still offend
(Their pudgy hearts and shiny heads)
They've got nothing left on which we depend
So enlist every ounce
Of your bright blood
And off with their heads
Jump from the hook
You're not obliged to swallow anything you despise
(That you despise)11Embed
