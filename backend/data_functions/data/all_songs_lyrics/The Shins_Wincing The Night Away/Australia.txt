Australia Lyrics
"Time to put the ear covers on!"
"No!"
La-la-la-la!
La-la-la-la!
La-la-la-la!

(Born to) Born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies
All you want's one more Saturday
Well, look here until then
They gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
Till the day

We come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on a dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth to gouge my eyes

You'll be damned to be one of us girl
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I try, ooh-ooh!
A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
You keep 'em folded in your lap
Or raise them up to beg for scraps
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
Just the same

Will you be pulled from the ocean
A-just a minute too late?
Or changed by a potion
To find a handsome young mate for you to love?

You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Well, do it now or grow old
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold


Been alone since you were twenty-one
You haven't laughed since January
You try and make like this is so much fun
But we know it to be quite contrary
La-la-la-la
Dare to be one of us, girl
Facing the android's conundrum
I felt like I should just cry
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
You Himmler in your coat, you don't know how long I've been
Watching the lantern dim
Starved of oxygen
So give me your hand and let's jump out the window
La, la, la, la, la!
La, la, la, la, la!
La-la, la, la, la!15Embed
