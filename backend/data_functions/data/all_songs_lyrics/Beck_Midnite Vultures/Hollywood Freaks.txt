Hollywood Freaks Lyrics"What, say what?"
"He my nun!"
Hot milk!
Mmmm...tweak my nipple
Champagne and ripple
Shamans go cripple
My sales go triple...
We drop lobotomy beats
Evaporated meats
On the hi-tech streets
We go solo
Dance floors and talk shows
Hot dogs, No Doz
Hot sex in back rows

I wanna know what makes you scream
Be your twenty million dollar fantasy
Treat you real good
Expensive jeans
Hollywood freaks on the Hollywood scene
Touch it real good if you want a piece
Party people know I'm that type of freak
People look so snooty
Take pills, make them moody
Automatic bazooty
Zero to tutti frutti
Sex in the halls
Niagara Falls
Local shopping malls receive anonymous calls
Hot like a cheetah
Neon mamacita
Eat at Taqueria
Pop lockin' beats from Korea
Looking like jail bait
Selling lots of real estate
Looking like a hot date
Banging like an 808


Do you want to feel this?
Do you want to feel this?

Norman Schwartzkopf!
Something tells me you want to go home!
Champagne, bibles, custom clothes you own
Calling up from special area codes
Hollywood notes with the Hollywood phones
I got nothing to do, nowhere to go
I'll tell you what you want
If you want to know...
Satin sheets
Tropical oils
Turn up the heat 'til the swimming pool boils
Let all the neighbors
Read it in the papers
Making all those gentlemen cry realistic tears...


Jocking my Mercedes!
Probably have my baby!
Shop at Old Navy!
He wish he was a lady!

Do you wanna feel this?
Do you wanna feel this?
Dance floors, all the talk shows
Hot dogs, No Doz
Hot sex in back rows
You know
Hyundais, tricked out
Christmas in July
6.2 percent!
Yeah, you fill in the blanks
Sha-na-na-na-na-na, yeah!
Tutti frutti!
Automatic bazooti!
Yeah, I'm mixin' business with leather! (laughs)1Embed
