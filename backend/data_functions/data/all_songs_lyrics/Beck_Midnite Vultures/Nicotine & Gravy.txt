Nicotine & Gravy Lyrics
I'll be your chauffeur on a midnight drive
It takes a miracle just to survive
Buried animals call your name
You keep on sleeping through the poignant rain

I think we're going crazy
Her left eye is lazy
She looks so Israeli
Nicotine and gravy

I'll feed you fruit that don't exist
I'll leave graffiti where you've never been kissed
I'll do your laundry, massage your soul
I'll turn you over to the highway patrol

I think we're going crazy
Her left eye is lazy
She looks so Israeli
Nicotine and gravy

I think we're going crazy, things don't even faze me
Her left eye is lazy, nicotine and gravy
Miracles amaze me, she looks so Israeli
Love the way she plays me, I think I'm going crazy
I don't want to die tonight, I don't want to die tonight
I don't want to die tonight, I don't want to die tonight
I don't want to die tonight, I don't want to die tonight
(You're something special, so much more)
(Think I'm going)
I don't want to die tonight, I don't want to die tonight
(I know, yes I know)
(Think I'm going crazy)

I'll be your chauffeur on a midnight drive
It takes a miracle just to survive
Buried animals call your name
You keep on sleeping through the poignant rain

I think we're going crazy, things don't even faze me
(I think we're going crazy)
Her left eye is lazy, nicotine and gravy
(Her left eye is lazy)
Miracles amaze me, she looks so Israeli
(She looks so Israeli)
(I don't want to die tonight, I don't want to die tonight)
Love the way she plays me, nicotine and gravy
(Nicotine and gravy)
(I don't want to die tonight, I don't want to die tonight)2Embed
