Milk & Honey Lyrics
Don't take your red ribbons off
You're about to make a fool of yourself
In the aluminum sunset
Drinking from a drain
I'm a hundred miles behind myself

Milk and honey
Pouring down like money
Make a poor boy want to run
Milk and honey
Do you want to love me?
Under the aluminum sun

Did you hear those war torn stories
Where the lifeguards slept in the streets
In the jungle lands
With the cold Cola cans
You'll get the keys to the city for free

Milk and honey
Pouring down like money
Bring a poor boy to his knees
Milk and honey
No, it isn't funny
Living in a garden of sleaze
Well, I can smell the V.D. in the club tonight
Excuse me please
Could you tell me how to get to the Soviet embassy?

Bangkok athletes in the biosphere
Arkansas wet dreams
We all disappear
Kremlin mistress
(Milk, milk, honey)
Ring the Buddha chimes
She slip me ruffies
(Milk, milk, honey)
Receding hairlines

She's all right, touching my body
She's all right, on my computer
She's all right, selling me watches
(Milk, milk, honey)
She's all right, ring on my finger
(Milk, milk, honey)

Milk and honey
Pouring down like money
Bring a poor boy to his knees
Milk and honey
No, it isn't funny
Living in a garden of sleaze
Milk and, milk and
Do you want to to honey
Milk and honey
(Is she romantic?)
Milk, milk, honey1Embed
