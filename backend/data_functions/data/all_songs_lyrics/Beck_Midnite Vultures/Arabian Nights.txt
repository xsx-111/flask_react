Arabian Nights LyricsBazookas and fisticuffs
Medicating in Porsches
98-karat stick shift
Chinatown late-night meals
Alfonzo giving me a backrub
2 P. M. Laser vizzaginal rejuvenation
Triple album project
Detonating' tracks like these
Magnums and Barrettas
Part-time hostages in pottery classes
Blind date at the wax museum
Norwegian hockey players
Passed out in government limos
Prime ministers with cryogenic faces
Louis Vuitton suitcases
Autographs and paid vacations
Divorce papers and synthetic lubrications
Playing' you like top-40 stations
Ah... You know the deal
Arabian nights
White satellites
Voodoo is tight/tied?
Airbrushed memories strewn like
Pamphlets into fifth Mississippis
Time-lapse footage of duct-taped lies
Animal frequencies pinching deodorized nerves
Cosmetic procedures
On the cartilage of apocalypse
Mannequin tycoons with airport-piano-bar mystiques
Remodeling conjugal amaracus
Flexing like suburban Spartacus
Getting smacked up by unemployed hand models
Running out into the middle of traffic with beaujolais bottles
Arabian nights
White satellitesEmbed
