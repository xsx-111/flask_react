Pressure Zone Lyrics
The countryside is overgrown
There's a lighthouse in her soul
Wrestling with butcher girls
She don't ever change her clothes

Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones a hundred years
Lizards in the pressure zone
Mother knows it's only a phase

Cherry gardens feel like ice
Hazard lights from her past
Underneath the broken bridge
Hookers hug illegal dads

Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones a hundred years
Lizards in the pressure zone
Mother knows it's only a phase

Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones a hundred years
Lizards in the pressure zone
Mother knows it's only a phase

It's only a phase, it's only a phase1Embed
