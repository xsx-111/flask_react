Debra Lyrics
Ah yeah, come on
I met you at JC Penney's
I think your name tag said Jenny!
I cold-step to you with a fresh pack of gum
Somehow I knew you were looking for some. . .oh no!
Like a fruit that's ripe for the picking
I wouldn't do you like that Zankou Chicken
Cause only you got a thing that I just got to get with
I just got to get, get with you, and you know what we're gonna do

I wanna get with you, oh girl
And your sister
I think her name is Debra
I wanna get with you, only you, girl
And your sister
I think her name is Debra, oh!

Oh girl, I only wanna be down with you
Cause you got something that I just got to get with
I pick you up late at night after work
I said, "Lady, step inside my Hyundai
I'm gonna take you up to Glendale
Yeah, gonna take you for a real good meal."
Cause when our eyes did meet
Girl, you knew I was packing heat
Ain't no use in wasting no time gettin' to know each other
You know the deal!
Cause only you've got a thing
That I just got to get with
(got to get with!)
I just got to get with you girl, and you know
I wanna get with you, only you, girl
And your sister
I think her name is Debra
I wanna get with you, girl yeah!
And your sister
I think her name is Debra, ohhh!

Uhh, come on
Ooh lovely lady, girl you drive me crazy
Ooh lovely lady, girl you drive me crazy
Ooh lovely lady, girl you drive me crazy
Ooh lovely lady, girl you drive me crazy
Craaaaaaa?oh girl, and your sister, Debra
Yeah, you're driving me crazy. Crazy, oh hoo! Crazy
Oooooh ow, yeah I got a little bit of sympathy for you, girl
Yeah cause I'm a, I'm a full-grown man and I'm not afraid to, to5Embed
