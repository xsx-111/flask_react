Get Real Paid Lyrics
Kick it

We like the boys with the bullet proof vests
We like the girls with the cellophane chests
We like the boys with the bullet proof vests
We like the girls with the cellophane chests

I know you really want it
Cause your daddy's always on it
And he knows just how to flaunt it
He got pictures in his wallet
And he want to be your lover
Does he look just like my mother
Does he cover you like butter
And just leave you in the gutter

I want to know if I'm worth your time
There's so much to do before you die
Thursday night, I think I'm pregnant again
Touch my ass if you're qualified

We like to ride on executive planes
We like to sit around and get real paid
We like to ride on executive planes
We like to sit around and get real paid
I know you really want it
Cause your daddy's always on it
And he knows just how to flaunt it
He got pictures in his wallet
And he want to be your lover
Does he look just like my mother
Does he cover you like butter
And just leave you in the gutter

I want to know if I'm worth your time
There's so much to do before you die
Thursday night, I think I'm pregnant again
Touch my ass if you're qualified

I know you really want it
Cause your daddy's always on it
And he knows just how to flaunt it
He got pictures in his wallet
And he want to be your lover
Does he look just like my mother
Does he cover you like butter
And just leave you in the gutter
I want to know if I'm worth your time
There's so much to do before you die
Thursday night, I think I'm pregnant again
Touch my ass if you're qualified

We like the boys with the bullet proof vests
We like the girls with the cellophane chests
We like the boys with the bullet proof vests
We like the girls with the cellophane chests2Embed
