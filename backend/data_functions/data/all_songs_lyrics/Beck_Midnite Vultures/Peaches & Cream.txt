Peaches & Cream Lyrics
Don't tell your right hand, baby
What your left hand do
You know those road check girls
Will make your brown breath blue

Ooh, ooh, ooh, peaches and cream
You make a garbage man scream
Such a dangerous dream
Peaches and cream
Peaches and cream

You look good in that sweater
And that aluminum crutch
I'm gonna let you down easy
I've got a delicate touch

Ooh, ooh, ooh, peaches and cream
You make a garbage man scream
Come on girl it's a dream
Peaches and cream
Peaches and cream
You're a torn out page
From a best selling book
Your home girl's on the line
But your daddy's off the hook
Where do we go now?
Give those pious soldiers
Another lollipop
Cause we're on the good ship
Ménage à trois

Ooh, ooh, ooh, peaches and cream
You make a garbage man scream
You're such a delicate thing
Ooh, ooh, ah, peaches and cream
You're the only dream I'm gonna need tonight
Peaches and cream
You're the only dream I'm gonna need tonight

Keep your lamplight trimmed and burning
Keep your lamplight trimmed and burning
Keep your lamplight trimmed and burning
Keep your lamplight trimmed and burning
Ooh, ooh, ooh, peaches and cream
You make a garbage man scream
Come on girl it's a dream
Ooh, ooh, ooh, peaches and cream
You make a garbage man scream
You're such a delicate thing

Ooh, ooh, ooh, peaches and cream1Embed
