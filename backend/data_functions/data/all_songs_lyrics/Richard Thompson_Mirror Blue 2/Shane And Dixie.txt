Shane And Dixie LyricsShane and Dixie they were two-bit crooks
They wanted to be famous like you read in books
Shane had the brain and Dxie had the looks for glory
As a bank robber Shane really hadn't got a clue
He'd end up likely at the end of a noose
Which was fine by Shane if the papers could use the story
CHORUS
Fame and love, fame and love
Fame and love will never die
Shane said to Dixie, we're getting nowhere
But I've a fine idea if you love me, swear
We'll be household names if we only dare, forever
Here's two bullets in my old carbine
One is yours and the other is mine
Then we'll be happy till the end of time together
CHORUS
She screams, she swears
She tears her hair
Saying, Shane this time
You've lost your mind
Shane took aim with the 16-bore
And Dixie lay dying down there on the floor
Shane was shaken but his purpose was more inspired
Shane said, Lord what have I done
But this victory is only halfway won
Then he put the barrel underneath his tongue and fired
CHORUS
They found the bodies when the neighbours complained
Shane was all over the walls like paint
Dixie looked bad but her heart beat faint but surely
Well they saved her life, they were just in time
And she turned her back on a life of crime
And she married the man who came to type out her story
O the news of the screws most generously gave
The money helped to pay for Shane's new grave
And it looked so fine till the vandals sprayed it over
Time went by and the weeds grew high
And hid Shane's grave from the curious eye
And maybe that's why we forget those lines he told her
CHORUS
