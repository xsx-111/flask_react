King of Bohemia Lyrics
Let me rock you in my arms
I'll hold you safe and small
A refugee from the seraphim
In your rich girl rags and all

Did your dreams die young?
Were they too hard won?
Did you reach too high and fall?
And there is no rest
For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of all

Your eyes seem from a different face
They've seen that much that soon
Your cheek too cold, too pale to shine
Like an old and waning moon

And there is no peace
No true release
No secret place to crawl
And there is no rest
For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of all
If tears unshed could heal your heart
If words unsaid could sway
Then watch you melt into the night
Adieu and rue the day

Did your dreams die young?
Were they too hard won?
Did you reach too high and fall?
And there is no rest
For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of allEmbed
