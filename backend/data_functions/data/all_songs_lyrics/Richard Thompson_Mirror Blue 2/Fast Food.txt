Fast Food Lyrics
Small mac, Big Mac, burger and fries
Shove 'em in boxes all the same size
Easy on the mustard, heavy on the sauce
Double for the fat boy eats like a horse

Fry them patties and send 'em right through
Microwave oven gonna fry me too
Can't lose my job by getting in a rage
I got to get my hands on that minimum wage

Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Got to make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant
Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Got to make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant

Shake's full of plastic, meat's full of worms
Everything's zapped so you won't get germs
Water down the ketchup, easier to pour on
Pictures on the register in case you're a moron

Keep your uniform clean and don't talk back
Blood down your shirt gonna get you the sack
Sugar, grease, fats and starches
Fine to dine at the golden arches
Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Got to make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant

Baby thrown up in booth number nine
Wash it down, hose it down, happens all the time
Cigarettes in the coffee, contact lens in the tea
I'd rather feed pigs than humanity

Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Got to make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant
Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Got to make it fast, it's a fast food restaurantEmbed
