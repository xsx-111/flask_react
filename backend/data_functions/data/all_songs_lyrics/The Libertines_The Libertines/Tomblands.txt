Tomblands LyricsHigh register operational

In the land of the gauching skiving sun
Their bodies are in the room, lad
Never an honest days work is done
They call it the Tomblands

No, they're never gonna get me, no
Never gonna get me, no
Never gonna get me, no

Fifteen holes in the dealer's chest
Yo ho ho, he was a Mini Martell man
Serve the girls and shovel up the rest
Pieces of eight in the jukebox
Oh you know
Didn't want to be the one to tell you
She was only fourteen
Sussed out your dirty sordid little scene

Never gonna get me, no
Never gonna get me, no
They're never gonna get me, no
Yeah, they're never gonna get me, noEmbed
