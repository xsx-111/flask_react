The Saga Lyrics
A problem, becomes a problem
When you let down your friends
When you let down the people
When you let down yourself
Oh, and only fools, vultures and undertakers
Will have any time for you, oh

A problem, becomes a problem
When you lie to your friends
When you lie to the people
When you lie to yourself
And the truth's too harsh to comprehend
You just pretend there isn't a problem

I am a pimp and a slave
I dig my bed you dig my bed, wooh
I dig my grave
And the truth's too harsh to comprehend
You just pretend there isn't a problem
No no, I ain't got a problem
It's you with the problem
Problem
