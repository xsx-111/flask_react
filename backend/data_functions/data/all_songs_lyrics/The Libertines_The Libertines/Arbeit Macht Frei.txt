Arbeit Macht Frei Lyrics
Roll a gasper
The guard said he could stay alive if he shovelled and burned his friends to die
People to die
And on the gate read 'Arbeit Macht Frei'

In her rollers and a gasper
She cleans the steps on a mean street where no policemen walk the beat
Her old man
He don't like blacks or queers

Yet he's proud we beat the Nazis
How queer
