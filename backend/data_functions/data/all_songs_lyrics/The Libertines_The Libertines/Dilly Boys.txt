Dilly Boys LyricsMy love wrote the words to the saddest songs
The songs that says that life's too long
And the moon is always blue, just because
I wish you'd sing me those other songs again
The songs that say life's worth the worry and the pain
The sun smiles through the rain, just because
Just because she's the sweetest girl, the sweetest girl in the world
She's my moral guide, oh she does nothing at all
Smokes all of my bones and stares at the wall
Maybe she'll pace the room, howl at the moon
But still she's the sweetest girl
And he's the sweetest boy in the world
And me, I'm just a dilly boy
A fresh flower pressed Piccadilly boy
Hands on hips, pout on lips
Meat, rag-tag like a dilly boy
She's the sweetest girl, the sweetest girl in the world
In China Town, they all la la la la la etc
Me, I'm just a dilly boy
A fresh flower pressed Piccadilly boy
Hands on hips, pout on lips
Meat, rag-tag like a dilly boy
She's the sweetest girl, the sweetest girl in the worldEmbed
