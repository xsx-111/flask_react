The Ha Ha Wall Lyrics
If you get tired of just hanging around
Pick up a guitar and spin a web of sound
And then you could be strung out all day
With lovers and clowns
Now I find myself hanging around

It's been a long war, we're tired and dirty
Still not dirty enough for you

Well I've been thieving
I stole the light from the dawn
Well if you come round this ledge
You wish you'd never been born
Oh, tell me you can you see me
Oh, can't you see through it all?
I'm empty, lost and alone
Oh won't you heed my call?

It's been a long war, yes, we're tired and dirty
Still not dirty enough for you
Oh, I'm so tired of hanging around
Oh, I'll pick up a guitar, spin a web of sound
Spin my love

So tired of hanging around
Just hanging around
Just hanging around1Embed
