Campaign of Hate Lyrics
There's a campaign of hate
It's waiting at the school gates

And for what I am aware
Must be what you wrote
What you write, and you swore that you'd swear
To remember why you came
Not to play follow the leader, no no
Poor kids dressing like they're rich (Mods!)
Rich kids dressing like they're poor (Oh my God)
White kids talking like they're black
I tried it with Charlene
And I spent three days on my back
Cause she said baby
I like the cut of your J.I.B
Don't believe them when they say
That you don't get nothing for free
It's all for free, follow me now

There's a campaign of hate
It's waiting at the school gates
There's a campaign of hate
It's waiting at the school gates
There's a campaign of hate
It's waiting at the school gates
There's a campaign of hate
It's waiting at the school gates
There's a campaign of hate
It's waiting at the school gates
There's a campaign of hate
It's waiting at the school gates1Embed
