Never Never LyricsI was sucking on a cigarette
Where did that crowd come from?
There all the pennies for the slot machines
Sells you back your dreams
It's fine in hell, boy
It's fine with you
Why don't we try it again now
But my heart won't sing
Until that story's all been told
That she buckled my spine, tattered my soul
Oh ain't that a wonder
Didn't you always say
There's gonna be a better way
I'm still lining them up
Knocking them down with you
Did you see this girl, that girl
Look of never never
Can I stay here forever?
Never, never, never you mind
Find it somewhere over the railings
Didn't that tall man say
There's gonna be a better way
Oh I'm still lining them up
Knocking them down with you
Yes I was sucking on a straight
Where did that crowd come from?
Said they're the pennies from the slot machines
Sells you back your dream
That's fine in hell, boy
So that's fine with you
But didn't you always say
There's gonna be a  better way
I'm still lining them up
Knocking them down with you
Lining them up
Knocking them down baby with youEmbed
