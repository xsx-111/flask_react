Music When the Lights Go Out LyricsIs it cruel or kind not to speak my mind
And to lie to you rather than hurt you?
Well, I'll confess all of my sins
After several large gins
But still I'll hide from you
Hide what's inside from you
And alarm bells ring
When you say your heart still sings
When you're with me
Oh, won't you please forgive me?
I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
And though the memories of the pubs
And the clubs and the drugs and the tubs
We shared together
Will stay with me forever
But all the highs and the lows
And the to's and the fro's
They left me dizzy
Oh, won't you please forgive me
I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no
Well, I no longer hear the music when the lights go out
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt
The strange fate in my mind is all too clear
Music when the lights come on
The girl I thought I knew has gone
And with her my heart had disappeared
Well I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
All the memories of the fights and the nights
And the blue lights, all the kites
We flew together
I thought they'd fly forever
But all the highs and the lows
And the to's and the fro's
They left me dizzy
Oh, won't you forgive me
I no longer hear the music
Well, I no longer hear the music
I no longer hear the music
When the lights go out
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt
The strange fate in my mind it's all too clear
Music when the lights come on
The girl I thought I knew has gone
And with her my heart had disappeared
I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
And I no longer hear the music4Embed
