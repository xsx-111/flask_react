What Katie Did LyricsShoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Oh, what you gonna do, Katie?
You're a sweet, sweet girl
But it's a cruel, cruel world
A cruel, cruel world
My pins are none too strong, Katie
Hurry up, Mrs Brown
I can feel it coming down
& it won't take none too long
But since you said goodbye
Polka dots fill my eyes
And I don't know why
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
What you gonna do Katie?
You're a sweet, sweet girl
But it's a cruel, cruel world
A cruel, cruel world
Safety pins are none too strong Katie
They hold my life together
And I never say never
And I never say never again
But since you said goodbye
The polka dots fill my eyes
And I don't know why
Since you said goodbye
The polka dots fill my eyes
And I don't know why
Say you want
Say you will
Say you won't but don't leave me standing
Say you will, it's up to anyone
That's what they all like to know
...
And since you said goodbye
The polka dots fill the sky
And I don't know why3Embed
