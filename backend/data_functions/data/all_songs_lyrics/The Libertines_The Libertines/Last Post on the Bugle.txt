Last Post on the Bugle Lyrics
If I have to go
I will be thinking of your love
Oh somehow you'll know
You will know
Thinking of your love

Slyly they whispered away
As I played the last post on the bugle
I heard them say
Oh that boy's no different today
Except in every single way

If I have to go
I will be thinking of your love
Oh somehow you'll know
You'll just know
Thinking of your love

Oh, I was carried away
Caught up in an affray
As they let him away, he sang
"We'll meet again someday
Oh my boy, there's a price to pay"
If I have to go
I will be thinking of your love
Oh somehow you'll know
And don't know how but you'll know
Be thinking of your love
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la la la

Inside I felt
So, so alone
Locked in a room
Waiting 'til kingdom come
Although I felt elated
I felt like I was scum

Oh, I was carried away
Caught up in an affray
As they let him away, he sang
"We'll meet again someday
Oh my boy, there's a price to pay"
Feels like I've never been away
Though it's been longer than I could possibly say
I've been wandering the market
Carrying a sign, saying the end of
The world is nigh
I'm glad to see we're still tight
The bonds that tie a man are tight
Yet we do what we do
With ritual habituality
All through the night2Embed
