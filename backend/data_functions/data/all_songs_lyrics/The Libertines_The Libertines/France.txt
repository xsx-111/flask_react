France LyricsThe ideal girl in London from France
Came over, then left me, she left me entranced
Now I have to get by once again on my own
Nothing but memories
So I remember your eyes, that unique shade of brown
While these blue eyes of mine, they stay closed
I kissed you goodbye on the N109
I choked as I watched the bus go
Choking and smoking to your angelic soul
Choking and smoking myself into a hole
Where the only way out is to sleep and to dream
And to cry out your name1Embed
