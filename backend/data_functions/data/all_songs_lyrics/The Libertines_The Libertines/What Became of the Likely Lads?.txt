What Became of the Likely Lads? Lyrics
Please don't get me wrong
See I forgive you in a song
We'll call the Likely Lads
But if it's left to you
I know exactly what you'd do
With all the dreams we had

Cause blood runs thicker, oh
We're thick as thieves, you know
If it's important to you
It's important to me
I tried to make you see
You don't want to know
But you don't wanna know

If you pipe all summer long
Then get forgiven in a song
Well that's a touch, my lad
They sold my rights to all my wrongs
And when they needed the new songs
It’s ‘welcome back’, how sad

But blood runs thicker, oh
We're thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you
It's important to me
I tried to make you see
You don't want to know
But you don't wanna know
Oh, what became of the Likely Lads?
What became of the dreams we had?
Oh, what became of forever, though?
Oh, what became of forever, though?
We'll never know

But please don't get me wrong
See I forgive you in a song
We call the Likely Lads
We all bought the ones
We taught 'em all, we wrote the songs
That's filled with dreams we have

But blood runs thicker, oh
We're thick as thieves, you know
If it's important to you
It's important to me
I tried to make you see
You don't want to know
But you don't wanna know

Oh, what became of the Likely Lads?
What became of the dreams we had?
Oh, what became of forever, though?
Oh, what became of forever, though?
We'll never know
But blood runs thicker, oh
We're thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you
Yes, it's important to me
I tried to make you see
You don't want to know
But you don't wanna know

Oh, what became of the Likely Lads?
What became of the dreams we had?
Oh, what became of forever, though?
Oh, what became of forever, though?
We'll never knowEmbed
