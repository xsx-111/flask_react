Road to Ruin Lyrics
How can we make you understand
All you can be is given in your hand
You won't need money
Trust in me, take me by the hand
Oh give us a chip
Dreams are strewn across the sand
You won't need money

And all the pimps, punks, pederasts, jugglers and fools
They drive me crazy, are climbing the walls
Show me the way, the way to the store
'Cause I'm so sick, so sick of it all
But when the penny drops

Trust in me, take me by the hand
Don't cash in your chips strewn across the sand
You won't need money

And all the pimps, punks, pederasts, jugglers and fools
They drive me crazy, are climbing the walls
So show me the way, the way to the store
'Cause I'm so sick, so sick of it all
But when the penny dropsEmbed
