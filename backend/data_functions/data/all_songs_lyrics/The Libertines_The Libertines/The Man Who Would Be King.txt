The Man Who Would Be King LyricsI've been told if you want to make it in this game
You got to have the luck
You got to have the look
To make aught
I'd quite like to make it through the night
My heart beats slow, fast
Don't feel right
With a sleight of hand I might die
What about you over there?
Well, don't you think I care
Well I know, you know, I know, you know I know

And to the man who would be king
I would say only one thing
To the man who would be king
I would say only one thing

La la la-la-la-laa
La la la-la-la-laa
I lived my dream today
And I have lived it yesterday
And I have lived it tomorrow
Oh don't look at me that way
Well, I heed the words you say
But my heart has gone astray
We watched friendship slip away
But was it ever supposed to be that way?
I lived my dreams today
I lived it yesterday
And I'll be living yours tomorrow
Anything else to say?
I lived my dream today
I lived it yesterday
And I'll be living yours tomorrow
So don't look at me that way!
What about you Nancy, my dear?
What about you Nancy, my dear?
What about you Nancy, my dear?
What will you do when she comes here?
Oh she'll kill me
Oh, I don't want to kill me

And to the man who would be king
I would say only one thing
And to the man who would be king
I would say only one thing
La la la-la-la-laa
La la la-la-la-laaEmbed
