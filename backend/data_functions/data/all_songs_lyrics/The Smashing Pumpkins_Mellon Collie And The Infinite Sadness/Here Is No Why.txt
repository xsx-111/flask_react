Here Is No Why Lyrics
The useless drag of another day
The endless drags of a death rock boy
Mascara sure and lipstick lost
Glitter burned by restless thoughts
Of being forgotten

And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Desperate and displeased
With whoever you are
And you're a star

Somewhere
He pulls his hair down over a frowning smile
A hidden diamond you cannot find
A secret star that cannot shine
Over to you

May the king of gloom
Be forever doomed

And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burning up in speed
Lost inside the dreams
Of teen machines
The useless drags, the empty days
The lonely towers of long mistakes
To forgotten faces and faded loves
Sitting still was never enough


And if you're giving in
Then you're giving up

'Cause in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burning up in speed
Lost inside the dreams
Of teen machines5Embed
