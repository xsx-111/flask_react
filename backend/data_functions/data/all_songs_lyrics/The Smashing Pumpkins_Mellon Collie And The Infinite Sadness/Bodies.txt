Bodies Lyrics
Cast the pearls aside
Of a simple life of need
Come into my life forever
The crumbled cities stand as known
Of the sights you have been shown
Of the hurt you call your own
You know, you know

Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide

The empty bodies stand at rest
Casualties of their own flesh
Afflicted by their dispossession

But no bodies ever knew
No bodies
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is

Now we drive the night, to the ironies of peace
You can't help deny forever
The tragedies reside in you
The secret sights hide in you
The lonely nights divide you in two
In two, in two
All my blisters now revealed
In the darkness of my dreams
In the spaces in between us

No bodies ever knew
Nobody
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
No bodies ever knew
Nobody
No bodies felt like you
Nobody
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide4Embed
