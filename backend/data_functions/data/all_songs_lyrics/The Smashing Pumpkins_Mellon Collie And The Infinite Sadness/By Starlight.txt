By Starlight Lyrics
By starlight I'll kiss you
And promise to be your one and only
I'll make you feel happy
And leave you to be lost in mine
And where will we go, what will we do?
Soon said I, we'll know

And are you just like me?
Dead eyes, Dead eyes, are you just like me?
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas yeah
Dead eyes, Dead eyes, are you just like me?

And all along, we knew we'd carry on
Just to belong

By starlight I know you
As lovely as a wish granted true
My life has been empty, my life has been untrue
And does she really know, who I really am?
Does she really know me at last?

And are you just like me?
Dead eyes, are you just like me?
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas yeah
Dead eyes, Dead eyes, are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
Oooh, Oooh, Ju-
Oooh, Oooh5Embed
