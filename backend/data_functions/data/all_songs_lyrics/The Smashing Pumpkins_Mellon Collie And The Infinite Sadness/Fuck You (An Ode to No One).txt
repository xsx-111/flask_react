Fuck You (An Ode to No One) Lyrics
I'm never coming back
I'm never giving in
I'll never be the shine in your spit
I disconnect the act
I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me

And you're mistaken, it's you that's faking
Living and breathing and dying too
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
You can't bring me back, you can't bring me back
Cause I give it all back to you
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks
Wreak their havoc upon this world
The disenchanted, the romantics
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole

Destroy the mind, destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind, destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart
And you, you make me so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect
To runaround kids in get-go cars
With Vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies
Giving us the farewell runarounds
I took a Virgin Mary ax to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you, yeah
I give it all back to you
For you

No way
I don't need it
I don't need your love
Disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love
Disconnect

No way, no way, no way
Disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love
Disconnect
No way, no way, no way
Disconnect
