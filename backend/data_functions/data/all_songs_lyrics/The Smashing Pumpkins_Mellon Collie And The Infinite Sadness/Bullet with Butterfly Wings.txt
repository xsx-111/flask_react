Bullet with Butterfly Wings Lyrics
The world is a vampire
Sent to drain
Secret destroyers
Hold you up to the flames
And what do I get
For my pain?
Betrayed desires
And a piece of the game

Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked
Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?
I wanna change
What do you got
When you feel the same?
Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, yeah
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son, for you

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
And someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage!

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, for you

And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved41Embed
