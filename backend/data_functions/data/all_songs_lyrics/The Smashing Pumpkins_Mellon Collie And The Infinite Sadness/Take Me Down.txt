Take Me Down Lyrics
Take me down, to the underground
Won't you take me down, to the underground
Why oh why, there is no light
And if I can't sleep, can you hold my life
And all I see is you

Take my hand, I lost where I began
In my heart I know all of my faults
Will you help me understand
And I believe in you
You're the other half of me
Soothe and heal...
When you sleep, when you dream
I'll be there if you need me, whenever I hear you sing

There is a sun, it'll come, the sun, I hear them call me down
I held you once, a love that once, and life had just begun
And you're all I see...
And trumpets blew, and angels flew on the other side, dear
And you're all I see, and you're all I'll need
There's a love that God puts in your heart5Embed
