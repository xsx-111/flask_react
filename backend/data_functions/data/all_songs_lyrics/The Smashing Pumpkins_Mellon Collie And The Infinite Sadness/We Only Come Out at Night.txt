We Only Come Out at Night Lyrics
We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

And once again, you'll pretend to know me well, my friends
And once again, I'll pretend to know the way
Through the empty space
Through the secret places of the heart

We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

I walk alone, I walk alone to find the way home
I'm on my own, I'm on my own to see the ways
That I can't help the days, you will make it home OK
I know you can, and you can

We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night
And once again, you'll pretend to know that
That there's an end, that there's an end to this begin
It will help you sleep at night
It will make it seem that right is always right
Alright?

We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night3Embed
