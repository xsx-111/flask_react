Tales of a Scorched Earth Lyrics
Farewell, goodnight, last one out turn out the lights
And let me be, let me die inside
Let me know the way through this world of hate in you
'Cause the die is cast and the bitch is back
And we're all dead, yeah, we're all dead

Inside the future of a shattered past
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes, there are no feelings

Bless the martyrs and kiss the kids
For knowing better, for knowing this
'Cause you're all whores and I'm a fag
And I've got no mother and I've got no dad

To save me from the wasted, save me from myself
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes there are no feelings

If I believe, if I deceive, if I defend you now that way
Would you believe, could you recieve, could you have faith?
No one is, is ever gone
And time is everything and I have none
Everybody's lost just waiting to be found
Everyone's a thought just waiting to fade
So fuck it all, 'cause I don't care
So what somehow somewhere we dared

To try to dare, to dare for a little more
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes, there are no feelingsEmbed
