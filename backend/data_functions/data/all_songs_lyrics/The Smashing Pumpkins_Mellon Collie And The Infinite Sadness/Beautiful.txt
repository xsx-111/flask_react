Beautiful Lyrics
Beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful, as wonderful as they come
And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass, wanting you
Beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sky
Wonderful, it's wonderful, to know that you're just like I

And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who you love and who you won't
No, no
Who you love and who you won't

And I love you, as you love me
Na na na na na na na na
So let the clouds roll by your face
We'll let the world spin on to another place
We'll climb the tallest tree above it all
To look down on you and me
And them
And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who you love and who you won't
No, no
Who you love and who you won't
No, no
Who you love and who you won't
No, no

Don't let your life wrap up around you
Don't forget to call, whenever
I'll be here just waiting for you
I'll be under your stars forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you
I'll be under the stairs forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you...5Embed
