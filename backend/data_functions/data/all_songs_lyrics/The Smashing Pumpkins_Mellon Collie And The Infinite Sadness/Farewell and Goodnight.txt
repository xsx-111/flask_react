Farewell and Goodnight Lyrics
Goodnight, to every little hour that you sleep tight
May it hold you through the winter of a long night
And keep you from the loneliness of yourself

Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
Cause it's hard luck, when no one understands your love
It's unsung, and I say

Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart

Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your
Head light with the wishes of a Sandman and a
Night light, be careful not to let the bedbugs
Sleep tight nestled in the covers

The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away

The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away
And you can tell, it's just as well
And you can tell, it's just as well

Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart
