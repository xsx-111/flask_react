Porcelina of the Vast Oceans Lyrics

As far as you take me, that's where I believe
The realm of soft delusions, floating on the leaves
On a distant shoreline she waves her arms to me
As all the thought police are closing in for sleep
The dilly dally of my bright lit stay
The steam of my misfortunes has given me the power to be afraid

And in my mind I'm everyone
And in my mind

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

Porcelina of the oceans blue (Porcelina)
Porcelina, Porcelina

In the slipstream of thoughtless thoughts
The light of all that's good, the light of all that's true
To the fringes gladly I walk unadorned
With gods and their creations, with filth and disease
Porcelina, she waits for me there
With seashell hissing lullabyes and whispers fathomed deep inside my own
Hidden thoughts and alibis
My secret thoughts come alive

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

And in my mind I'm everyone
And in my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone of you
You make it right
It's all alright
You make it right

Porcelina of the oceans blue (Porcelina)
Porcelina of the oceans blue (Porcelina)
