Love Lyrics
To my mistakes
To my mistakes of cowardice
She shimmy shakes
The jimmy jakes of consequence
Born of the airs and dues
My airs of madness do declare
That it's okay
It's love

It's what you wanted to see
It's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need
She'll make it up
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love

Machine gun blues
Her vacant rush is so steel
I'm unaware
Lost inside your visions
I got mine too over
I got mine and I got you
'Cause I know you
You're love
It's what you wanted to see
It's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need
She'll make it up
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love

And when I lost my mind
I knew I was in for a long night

Can I look up to you as you look down on me
Can I feel in to you as you felt in to me
I can't help what you see, I can't help but to be
For what you needed to need, she'll make it
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love
Love solves everything...but love2Embed
