Galapogos Lyrics
Ain't it funny
How we pretend we're still a child
Softly stolen
Under our blanket skies
And rescue me from me
And all that I believe

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace
Here with you
Will you leave me too?

Carve out your heart
For keeps in an old oak tree
And hold me for goodbyes
And whispered lullabyes
And tell me I am still
The man I'm supposed to be

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too
Will you leave me too?
Too late to turn back now
I'm running out of sound
And I am changing, changing
And if we died right now
This fool you love somehow
Is here with you

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Would you leave me too?
Would you leave me too?4Embed
