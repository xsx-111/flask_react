In the Arms of Sleep Lyrics
Sleep will not come to this tired body now
Peace will not come to this lonely heart

There are some things I'll live without
But I want you to know that I need you right now
I need you tonight

I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves
'Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes
And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me
I need someone to ease my mind
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find
And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight
'Cause I want you to stay, with me
I need you tonight
She comes to me like an angel out of time
As I play the part of a saint on my knees

There are some things I'll live without
But I want you to know that I need you right now
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire for you5Embed
