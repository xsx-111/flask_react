Stumbleine Lyrics
Boredom's in the bathroom shaking out the loose teeth
Sally's in the stirrups claiming her destiny
And nobody nowhere understands anything
About me and all my dreams
Lost at sea
Jack it up Judy set your heart alight
Mayfair mistress of the satellites
Misspent youth - faking up a rampage
To hold off the real slaves
Paid off and staid

And what you never knew
Can never get to you
So fake it
I'll be your Stumbleine
I'll be your super queen
And make you

Jukebox fuckup hanging round the drugstore
No matter what you say he'll be back for more
Mommy's in the manger with the little kids
She's got her reasons, got my forgets
Of tears and idle threats
Misplaced
And no matter what they do
They can't get to you
So fake it
I'll be your stumbleine
I'll be your super queen
And make you me

Come around Ruby I could never sleep alone4Embed
