Blank Frank Lyrics
Blank Frank, it is the messenger of your doom and your destruction
Yes, he is the one who will set you up as nothing

And he is the one who will look at you sideways
His particular skill is leaving bombs in people's driveways

Blank Frank  has a memory that's as cold as an iceberg
The only time he speaks is in incomprehensible proverbs

Blank Frank is the siren, he's the air-raid, he's the crater
He's on the menu, on the table, he's the knife and he's the waiter

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
