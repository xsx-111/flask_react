Edge Of No Control (Part 2) LyricsDramatically removed
Made to listen, made to be improved
Bite the hand that feeds you
As every single day becomes subdued
I believe you are open to suggestions
Allowed to make a choice
How often does it happen
That you have to raise your voice
For the right to question the doubts?
Then your right turns into a fight
For freedom, equality, voice and reason
Don't try to kid me, patronise or humourise me
Or even try to utilise me
All our life is spent
In this permanent brainwashed contempt
Yes, all our life is spent
In this permanent brainwashed contempt
Yes, all our life is spent
In perpetuated malcontent
Everything you are
In every single way
I'm pushing it too far
There's nothing that you want to say
For everything you are
I count the nights and count the days
I'm pushing you too far
It's time that everybody pays
If you ask no questions then beware of lies
If you ask no questions then beware of lies
Everything you are
In every single way
I'm pushing it too far
There's nothing that you want to say
For everything you are
I count the nights and count the days
I'm pushing you too far
It's time that everybody pays
What we have is the past, present and future
Take your pick it's up to you
Every day that you are pinned down
Understand the point of view
Redeploy in education
Reaffirm the sense of doubt
This is why the situation
Needs a major turnabout
With this violent chemical reaction
It's completely out of place
A state of near exhaustion
In the population raceEmbed
