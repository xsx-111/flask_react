Drop LyricsAs you fall into your seat
Forget the past
Release the heat
And isolate yourself
Completely bypassed
How long can it last
A complete contrast
Relinquish any sense of doubt
It's time to move this mess about
Too loud to amplify hi-fi
Why buy into the system
Interruptus of the system
It's deceived us of the freedom
To defy
Have you ever wondered
What does one drop in the ocean
Signify
The lie
Multiply
Forget the past
Release the heat
And multiply
Is this what you wanted
Is this how you wanted it to be
Yeah I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Is this what you wanted
Is this how you wanted it to be
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
I want to knowEmbed
