Edge Of No Control, Part 1 Lyrics
Hello Jack, hey it's Mark
And I'm at the studio and uh hey man
Just wanted to see what's up
And I wanted to give you some bpm's as long as I got your message machine here
We got 117
We got 93
We got 94. 5
We got 112
Demonstrated
Obliterated
Led by the nose like a bull to the arena
Of imperfection
Or are ya' falling under the pressure
Or will you rise to the pleasure
Of seeing the end in sight
The year of conformity in everyday life
Sterilized
Dehumanized
Taken to the edge of no control
Pulling the hamstring of events in a national agenda
Will lead to global mass hysteria
Punching holes in the ozone layer
Everyday reality is a possibility
Could it be that axiom dreams
Agree on how we exist in some numbered stack
Filed and then remembered
This is a global warning
My name is rectified
Disciplined for mass production
Of my assumption
Of the way things run
You're looking down the end of a gun
This information led to things that we have done
Concentration of the liberation
Ignorance is the curse of the nation
Most everywhere
A state of disrepair
Stunned at the contradiction of self
Sentence analyze
Never recognize the root of the problem
Once again it's time to let go
You're letting your feelings show
Positive think is the mass extinction
Maximize capitalize realize
Do your dreams replay the past, if not
What do your dreams forecast?
Take the opportunity to assess destruction
Think with an open mind
Lead to effect the dimension of culture
Communicate it's never too late
Just realize
This is a cause and effect for a
Misguided president select never show emotion
No development, just devotion
The pie in the sky
My name is rectified
Disciplined for mass consumption
My assumption
The way things are
Can't look back it's gone too far
For everything you are
Concentration of liberation
Ignorance is the curse of the nation
Almost everywhere
A state of disrepair

My name is rectified
Disciplined for mass production
No solution
For the way things are
Can't look back back it's gone to far
For everything you are
In every single way
I'm pushing it too far
There's nothing you can say
For everything you are
In every single way
I'm pushing it too far
There's nothing you can say
For everything you are
In every single way
I'm pushing it too far
There's nothing you can say
(A symbol of soul governing man)

My name is rectified
Disciplined for mass consumption
My assumption
The way things are
Of the way things run
You're looking down the end of a gun
This information led to things that we have done
Concentration of the liberation
Ignorance is the curse of the nation
Most everywhere
A total state of disrepair
Considerate unaware
My name is rectified
Disciplined for mass consumption
No solution
For the way things are
Can't look back, it's gone too far
For everything you are
For everything you are
In every single way
I'm pushing it too far
There's nothing you can say
There's nothing you can say
There's nothing you can say
There's nothing you can say
There's nothing you can sayEmbed
