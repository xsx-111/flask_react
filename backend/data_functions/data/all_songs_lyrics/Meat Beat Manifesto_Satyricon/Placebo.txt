Placebo LyricsCan you visualize the consequences that we patronise
But it's alright, you're too far gone, just realize
Taste the spice of life and you'll feel fine, together we can climb
But it's alright, there's nothing there, did you realize
Chorus 1:
Yeah my placebo will put you in Disneyland
We'll be in heaven, it will make your mind expand
Yeah my placebo, unreality overrides
We'll be in limbo for the rest of our lives
Rise above yourself, get higher, feel on fire, your desire will mesmerize
But it's alright, you electrify, it's getting hot
For the circular cosmic spot, it's getting too hot
Chorus 2:
Yeah my placebo will put you in Disneyland
We'll be in heaven, it will make your mind expand
Yeah my placebo, unreality overrides
We'll be in limbo for the rest of our lives
Take a look at what you are, you can't ignore the fact it's dying
Take at look at who you are, I can't disguise the fact I'm trying
I know that we're too far gone, just realize it won't take long
Every man and woman is a star tonight
And time and time again nothing makes sense
And time and time again nothing relents
And time and time again now it's alright
Cause time and time again it's outta sightEmbed
