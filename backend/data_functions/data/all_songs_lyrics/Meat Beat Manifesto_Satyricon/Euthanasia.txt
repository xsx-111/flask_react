Euthanasia LyricsI see the future
I see the future coming down on me
Swimming in the sea, coming down on me
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
It's lost in space
Somewhere in time, born too late
Too high to climb, too high, too late
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
Come into the light, feel alive
Come into the light, feel alright
I'm out of mind, put out of sight
I looked into the future
Now my mind's not right
But it's out of sight
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
Heat from the sun
Ignites the air, the air that we breathe
What did you achieve?
Just what did you achieve?
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
Say goodbye, then hit the sky
Come into the light, feel alive
Come into the light, feel alright
Come into the light, feel alive
Come into the light, feel alright
Come into the light, feel alive
Come into the light, feel alright
Come into the light, feel alive
Come into the light, feel alrightEmbed
