Original Control (Version 1) LyricsStep one: measure for measure, get smart, come on get people talking loud and
Clear
Step two: create some atmosphere and blow away the one way ride before we
Collide
Chorus 1:
Can't you see how easy it could be to send Joe Public into a panic and at the
Drop of a hat
In seconds flat, you'll be asking yourself what hit me
If you want to keep up you'll have to stay down, the either, the or, the past
The now
The voice inside you becomes the voice of now
Motivate, take the chance, backward in coming forward
Draw the heat, in case you're ignored, don't take a backseat defeat
Activate, strike it home, head over heels
With the intention of expanding the dimension of control, oh!
Chorus 2:
Can't you see how easy it could be to send Joe Public into a panic and at the
Drop of a hat
In seconds flat, you'll be asking yourself what hit me
If you want to keep up you'll have to stay down, the either, the or, the past
The now
The voice inside you becomes the voice of now
Chorus 1:
Can't you see how easy it could be to send Joe Public into a panic and at the
Drop of a hat
In seconds flat, you'll be asking yourself what hit me
If you want to keep up you'll have to stay down, the either, the or, the past
The now
The voice inside you becomes the voice of now
Original control
The voice of nowEmbed
