Son Of Sam LyricsVictims of opportunity
De-sensitised, conceived in fantasy
Another under-achiever
Kicked around, a disbeliever
What I don't understand is what it takes
To make a man so unstable, insane
A compulsion overrides, the devotion
The power over life and death
Feeding the obsession
The stimulated loss of breath
Re-fuelling the repression
It's as if the will to power
Becomes stronger by the hour
Can peace of mind ever be ensured?
And will the victim ever be cured?
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
Systematically removing
Any obstacles which may get in the way
We're speeding up the downward spiral
Immunize against reprisal
Any hope of a solution
Fades away into disillusion
This is how the problem stands today
Stabilize, recognize
The perspective which stares you in the eyes
The shape of things to come
It's dumb to think that you'll overcome
This kind of behaviour can never be ensured
But can it ever be cured?
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I was dreaming we were somewhere else
The time was displaced
Your memory faltered, my memory erased
It's easy to recognize
Every time you look at yourself
It stares you right in the eyes
It stares you right in the eyes
It stares you right in the eyes
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I am
I am the Son of Sam
I am the Son of Sam, I am, I am, I amEmbed
