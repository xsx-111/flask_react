Mindstream LyricsReal time, slow motion, everything seems bent out of shape
Elevate, high enough, till you reach what's above

Effective slow motion, is slowing down the pulse of our generation
Colours of light hit the night and are lost by the force of our persuasion
Chorus 1:
Things aren't too clear, and the more I see
Things disappear momentarily
Things aren't too clear, and the more I see
Things disappear momentarily
And the more I see
Momentarily
And the more I see
Momentarily
I know it's nearly over
Unwinding, spell binding
I feel it crossing over
Astounding, ultra-sounding
Chorus 2:
Things aren't too clear, and the more I see
Things disappear momentarily
Things aren't too clear, and the more I see
Things disappear momentarily
And the more I see
And the more I seeEmbed
