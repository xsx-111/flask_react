The Law LyricsHow many times did you call me
And I knew it was late
I left everybody
But I never went straight
I don't claim to be guilty
But I do understand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
Now my heart's like a blister
From doin' what I do
If the moon has a sister
It's got to be you
I'm gonna miss you forever
Tho' it's not what I planned
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
Now the deal has been dirty
Since dirty began
I'm not asking for mercy
Not from the man
You just don't ask for mercy
While you're still on the stand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
I don't claim to be guilty
Guilty's too grand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
That's all I can say, baby
That's all I can say
It wasn't for nothing
That they put me away
I fell with my angel
Down the chain of command
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand
There's a law, there's an arm, there's a hand2Embed
