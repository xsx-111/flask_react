Guitar and Video Games LyricsHow is it you feel?
I remember you in the top of my room
All these things we wondered how to hide
See how it works when
All the day long in a bottle of mud
All these fears we wondered how to hide with our love
How is it you feel when you run?
Ships won't come in in a bottle of mud
All this time looking for love
And you want to find peace
And you find me
Mondrary fields, where we run
See how it works with a bottle of rum
All this time hiding from death
And we want to be strong
But we find...
The true story, a tale
Writing itself as we sail
A story, a tale
Writing itself as we wail
Oh, no
Never again, my dear
Should we come dancing here
We'll play guitar and video games
What if we refuse to follow the rules of fashion?
Tell me something you'd tell a fool
Ways to refuse to follow the rules of fashion
How is it you feel, then?
Remember you in the top of my room
All these things remade me and caused
To be something grand
Never again shall we
Come dancing in the sea
We'll play guitar for a new
We'll play guitar for a new
We'll play guitar and video games
What if we refuse to follow the rules of fashion?
Tell me something you'd tell a fool
Ways to refuse to follow the rules of fashion1Embed
