100 Million Lyrics
Pay for the sign on the hill that says, 'You're home.'
Pay for the hole in the ground to place your bones
Pay for the words in your mouth to flow
Pay for the soles of your shoes to walk the streets of kings
Pay for the simplest things

Pay for the food on your plate to live
Pay for the mood in your mind to give a thought disguised
Pay for the simplest things

Who turned
Who turned the light out?
Who turned
Who turned away?
Who turned
Who turned the light out?
Who turned
Who turned away?

One hundred million
Fences around us
Can we own everything
Including the moon and the sun and the stars?
Pay for the whip on your back to break
Pay for the chain on your neck to control your life
Pay for everything

Who turned
Who turned the light out?
Who turned
Who turned away?
Who turned
Who turned the light out?
Who turned
Who turned away?

One hundred million
Fences around us
Can we own everything
Including the moon and the sun and the stars?Embed
