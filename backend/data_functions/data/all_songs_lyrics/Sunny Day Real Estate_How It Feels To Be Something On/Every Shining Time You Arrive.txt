Every Shining Time You Arrive Lyrics
Changing every little desire
We were counting on forces we could not control
Oh, and all those things you realized
Were nothing more than a memory displaced through

So the story's told beyond our grasp
We were climbing forever, an infinite task
Shoulders straining with the endless toil
We're nothing more than a feather moving in the wind

I want to change everything
I want to change everything
I want to blame everything on

Oh, and all these seeds will grow anyway
Even though the outcome, we cannot say
So, you'll always have your time to shine
Even in the winter of your darkest hour

I want to change everything
I want to change everything
I want to blame everything on
In the depths of my gloom
I crawl out for you
From the peaks of my joy
I crawl back into
Oh, letting me down every time you smile
Every shining time you arrive
You arrive
You arrive1Embed
