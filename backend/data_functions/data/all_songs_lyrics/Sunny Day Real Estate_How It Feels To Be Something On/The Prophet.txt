The Prophet LyricsSun shines on my face
How its golden design
Rain falls in this place
And the fields come alive
Days are only rumors we've wasted
We've crossed the millions
We'll see where we stand
Far removed from the womb
Will you carry me across the sea?
Will you carry me?
We can drink from fountains
And the taste of truth
Far removed from the womb
Will you carry me 'cross the sea?
Will you carry me?
Rhythm and mind
Don't waste no time
Want to let it all out
When the chains fall off
And the walls fall down
When we break the seal
And our hearts pour out
When the frozen ground
Comes alive around us with a screamEmbed
