Two Promises Lyrics
Long days, caught in his room
Trapped in the gloom of the dying light
His heart pleads through the wounds that he bleeds
The wounds he never can close
Wrong way, mind in a haze
Never know what he could do
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul
Now she's gone again.'
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood
Now she's gone again.'

Long days, alone with his shame
Fanning the flames of desire
His heart breaks as his memory plays images of her betrayal
Wrong way, his mind in a rage
Never know what he could do
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul
Now she's gone again.'
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood
Now she's gone again.'

Why did you leave me here?
How could you lead me down here?
He can't decide where to go then, oh
Two promises, one imperfect, oh
Walls he's building keep on crumbling down
Walls are falling, try to keep them sound
To keep them sound

Long days, he thinks the time will be soon
Pacing his room with his dark thoughts
His heart breaks at the road he must take
The road that will lead to the end
Wrong way, he thinks it's time for release
He'll never know peace in his lifetime
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul
Now she's gone again.'
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood
Now she's gone again.'

Why did you leave me here?
How could you lead me down here?

He can't decide where to go then, oh
Two promises, one imperfect, oh
Walls he's building keep on crumbling down
Walls are falling, now, there is no sound
There is no sound
There is no sound
There is no soundEmbed
