Roses in Water Lyrics
Roses in water
Wise men see
Move around before centuries
Later on, we'll travel far
Roses in wine
I can see strange ways

An endless wave
Strange

Roses in water
Wise men see
Later on, we'll follow love
Roses in wine
I can see strange ways

To walk with me
An endless wave
StrangeEmbed
