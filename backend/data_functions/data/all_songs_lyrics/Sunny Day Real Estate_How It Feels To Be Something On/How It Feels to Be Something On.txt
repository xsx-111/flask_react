How It Feels to Be Something On Lyrics
If I break down all that I am
A field of wires will see what it's worth to walk
To break the lines of all that I feel
If I turn 'round, what matters the most in time
We're going nowhere

Don't tell me now
The days I've had
To fill it up but spill instead
Talk to remind
Days, weeks and hours

All in time will be
Later on, we'll try
Hollow peaks we've climbed
All these things I've seen
How it feels to be something on
That's how the days go

If I break down all that I am
A field of wires will see what it's worth to walk
To break the lines of alternate steel
In time, we're going nowhere
Don't tell me, God
The dreams I've had
To fill it up but spill instead
Talk to remind
Days, weeks and hours

All in time will be
Later on, we'll try
All we gave to fly
Hollow peaks we've climbed
All these things I've seen
How it feels to be something on1Embed
