Jug Band Music LyricsI was down in Savannah
Eatin' cream and bananas
When the heat just made me faint
I began to get cross-eyed
I thought I was lost, I'd
Begun to see things as they ain't
As the relatives gathered
To see what's the matter
The doctor came to see was I dyin'
But the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
I was told a little tale
About a skinny as a rail
Eight-foot cowboy with a headache
He was hung-up in the desert slottin' rats
And tryin' to get a drink of water
With his knees a-gettin' mud-caked
And I'll tell you in a sentence
How he stumbled into Memphis
Tennessee, hardly crawlin' lookin' dust-baked
We gave him little water, a little bit of wine
He opened up his eyes
But they didn't seem to shine
And the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
So, if you ever get sickly
Get sis to run quickly
To the dusty closet shelf
And pull out a washboard
And play a guitar chord
And do a little do-it-yourself
Call on your neighbors
To put down their labors
And come and play the hardware in time
'Cause the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
I was floatin' in the ocean
Greased with suntan lotion
When I got wiped out by a beach boy
He was surfin' when he hit me
But jumped off his board to get me
And he dragged me by the armpit
Like a child's toy
As we staggered into land
With all the waders eatin' sandwiches
And tried to mooch a towel from the hoi polloi
He emptied out his eardrums
I emptied out mine
And everybody knows that the very last line
Is the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
And the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"Embed
