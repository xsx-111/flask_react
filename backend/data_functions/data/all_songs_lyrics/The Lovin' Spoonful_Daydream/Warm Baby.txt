Warm Baby LyricsSummertime's for summer girls
Who kiss and run away
But winter girls have lovin' arms
To warm a winter day
Love me, love me when the leaves turn brown
And I'll marry my warm baby
When the snow is on the ground
I need a warm baby (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
Keep me warm all the winter long (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
'Cause the summer sun's a-fadin' (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
And the winter winds are blowin' strong (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
I won't worry 'bout the winter (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
With a woman just to keep me warm (Ooh, warm, warm)
Summertime's for summer girls
Who kiss and run away
But winter girls have lovin' arms
To warm a winter day
Love me, love me when the leaves turn brown
And I'll marry my warm baby
When the snow is on the ground
When the wind starts whistlin' (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
Through the branches of the trees (Ooh,  warm, warm, warm baby)
And the whisper by the window (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
Is the fallin' of the autumn leaves (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
I need someone to caress me (Ooh, warm, warm, warm baby)
Like a soft, soft summer breeze (Ooh, warm, warm)
I need a warm baby (Warm baby, warm, warm baby)
Keep me warm all winter long (Warm baby, warm, warm baby)
'Cause the summer sun's a-fadin' (Warm baby, warm, warm baby)
And the winter winds are blowin' strong (Warm baby, warm, warm baby)Embed
