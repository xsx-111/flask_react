There She Is LyricsThere she is, she's the one
That's the one I turn to
When I need to get a lead
On what I'm gettin' into
Ooh, the way you keep me spinnin'
I'll hang on as long as love's the prize we're winnin'
I have found rollin' 'round
Somewhere very private
How her touch can mean so much
But I can't describe it
Ooh, just let me keep on thinkin'
I'll just find a way to keep our love from sinkin'
Ooh, the way you keep me spinnin'
I'll hang on as long as love's the prize we're winnin'
I have found rollin' 'round
Somewhere very private
How her touch can mean so much
But I can't describe it
Ooh, just let me keep on thinkin'
I'll just find a way
To keep our love from sinkin'
There she is, she's the one
That's the one I turn to
When I need to get a lead
On what I'm gettin' into
Ooh, the way you keep me spinnin'
I'll hang on as long as love's the prize we're winnin'Embed
