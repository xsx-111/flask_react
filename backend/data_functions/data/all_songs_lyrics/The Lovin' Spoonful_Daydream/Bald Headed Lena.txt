Bald Headed Lena LyricsBald headed Lena
Has anybody seen her?
Cute as she can be
She got a cue ball head
That's hard as lead
But she's alright with me
Bald headed Lena
Has anybody seen her?
Cute as she can be
She can't wear no wig
'Cause her head's too big
But she's alright with me
Tricky Tessie, Messy Bessie
Both gals are full of stuff
Mella Ella, Crazy Stella
Both them gals are tough
Now, you take Daisy
She's so crazy
Don't know night from day
Silly Tilly, Lyin' Lily
Take 'em all away
Bald headed Lena
Has anybody seen her?
Cute as she can be
She got a cue ball head
That's hard as lead
But she's alright with me
Sloppy Gertie, she's so dirty
Skinny Minnie, she's too lean
Tracy's face is out of place
And Joanie's down right mean
Now, you take Lizzie
She's so dizzy
She went and lost her mind
Ellie Mae might save the day
But she's deaf, dumb and blind
Ah, bald headed Lena
Has anybody seen her?
Cute as she can be
She got a cue ball head
That's hard as lead
But she's alright with me
Hoi, hoi, hoi
Bald headed Lena
Has anybody seen her?
Cute as she can be
She can't wear no wig
'Cause her head's too big
But she's alright with me
She's alright with me
She's alright with me
Hey, Lena
She's alright with meEmbed
