Day Blues LyricsWell, it's day blues
Sunlight's shinin' on some bad news
Makes it feel like everything you do is gonna lose
Sunlight frownin' down on me, 'cause you didn't sleep
Sunlight frownin' down on me
When my nights get so bad
That I'm hangin' out sad
And stare at all hours of the morning
When the day folks arise
With the sleep in their eyes
To go follow the tracks they've been born in
That's the day blues
Stayin' away, girl, a little too long
Now, I'm sittin' in the middle of a blue song
Same old right back thinkin' 'bout you song
Sunlight frownin' down on me
When the dawn comes to me
Why does light have to be
Like the mirror that's showin' I'm older?
And the sun don't feel good
And I ask how it could
When it feels like a crow on my shoulder
That's the day blues
Sunlight's shinin' on some bad news
Makes you feel like everything you do is gonna lose
Sunlight frownin' down on me, 'cause you didn't sleep
Sunlight frownin' down on meEmbed
