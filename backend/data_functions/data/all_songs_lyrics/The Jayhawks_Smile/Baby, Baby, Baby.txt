Baby, Baby, Baby Lyrics
Baby, baby, baby
I had to move along
I took my bags, I took my car
But it all went wrong

Beneath the gloom
I hear the sirens whine
They sound so far away
A darkened room
I hear you call my name
I had so much to say

I've been so faithful
I've been so true

There's a million flags flying
A million dreams that died
And I died too
As twisted metal rained across the interchange

I've been so faithful
I've been so true
I would have run
(Baby, baby, baby)
But I never saw it coming
(Baby, baby, baby)


I've been so faithful
I've been so true

I would have run
(Baby, baby, baby)
But I never saw it coming
(Baby, baby, baby)
I would have run
(Baby, baby, baby)

Flying, flying, ooh
So beautiful
So beautiful
You'll cry your eyes
Just like Jesus Christ
Just like Jesus Christ
So beautiful
You'll cry your eyes
Just like Jesus Christ
Just like Jesus Christ
So beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
