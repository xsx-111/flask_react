Mr. Wilson Lyrics
Mister, Mister Wilson
Humble and brave
Empty of hate
On your best behavior
You can be sure
I won't ignore you
No one knows you quite like I do
You're so brand new

Alex flew to Memphis
Smug in his ways
Big in his day
Claimed all children evil
Scared that his best
Is all in his past
No one knows you quite like I do
You're so used

Can't you see my guardian angel looking over me?
Can't you see my guardian angel looking over me?

Holly paced the desert
Twisted her dreams
Hatched crazy schemes
Cancelled her engagements
High on cocaine
Jump-start her brain
No one knows you quite like l do
It all fell through
Can't you see my guardian angel looking over me?
Can't you see my guardian angel looking over me?


Your doubt is your undoing
Afraid to open your door
You're still too busy screwing
Up the battle and the war

Can't you see my guardian angel looking over me?
Can't you see my guardian angel looking over me?Embed
