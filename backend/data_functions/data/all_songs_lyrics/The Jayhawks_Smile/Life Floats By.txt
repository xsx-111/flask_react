Life Floats By Lyrics
Abuse me and confuse me
But never, never, never use me
Ah, you leave me so tired
So utterly uninspired

Thunder Bay was a drag, baby
Thunder Bay was a drag, baby

Upon the gravel and the dust
If I don't move I will rust
You're a faint recurring melody
I can't seem to recall

In my mind, in my soul
I never really loved you
In my mind, in my soul
I never really loved you

Ah, the sun shines off the power lines
And the trees, they wave me on
There's a black cloud of happiness
I can't finish what I've begun
We hit Duluth on a jag, baby
We hit Duluth on a jag, baby

I grab my coat, my hat and my paperback
From the corner of my eyes, I see you smile

In my mind, in my soul
I never really loved you
In my mind, in my soul
I never really loved you

I hear what they're saying
There's no use in praying
So I'll just slip away


In my mind, in my soul
I never really loved you
In my mind, in my soul
I never really loved you
Do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do do do
