Somewhere in Ohio Lyrics
Scarface, you were out of place in Ohio
Too bad, you were out ahead, and you're slowin'
You were feeling like a bomb without a target
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Look out, Joe, I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I'm callin' you from somewhere deep in Ohio
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Skin-tight, you were up all night, and it's showin'
So tough, you were breakin' up over the wire
Well, I saw you headin' up a muddy river
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Look out, Joe, I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I see the flashin' lights along the highway, uh huh
You sounded lost and desperate on the phone

Look out, Joe, I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I'm callin' you from somewhere deep in Ohio
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baEmbed
