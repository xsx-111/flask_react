(In My) Wildest Dreams Lyrics
When you had a brief encounter
With your fortune and your fame
Well, I stood beside and watched the fans that followed
I saw you from a distance
And I heard them call your name
But you winked at me as if to say, "I'm sorry"
Yeah, you winked at me as if to say, "I'm sorry"

In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreams

Well, the more I get to know you
The less that I admire
I fade as the unholy light surrounds you
Well, I'm mystified you got so high
You had so far to fall
What you don't own you beg, you steal, you borrow
What you don't own you beg, you steal, you borrow

In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreams

I never felt this close to you
I never will again
As you gaze at me from on your ivory tower
You're pretending to be happy
You're pretending to be free
As you watch the minutes slowly turn to hours
As you watch the minutes slowly turn to hours

In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreamsEmbed
