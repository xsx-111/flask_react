Smile Lyrics
Wake up
Put your shoes on
Take a breath of the northern air
And rub those eyes
Genuflect beneath the starry skies

Before
You climb the mountain
First the foothills must appear
Step high and light
And take up your staff and shining armor

(Chin up, chin up)
You don't really have a problem
(Chin up, chin up)
In your hour of despair

And smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile
The stars
On the horizon
Stretch as far as the eyes can see
They represent
The souls of those like you and me

And smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
And smile


(Chin up, chin up)
You don't really have a problem
(Chin up, chin up)
In your hour of despair

And smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile when you're down and out and out and out and out and out
(Find something inside you)
(The sky is falling down, the sky is falling down)
(Find something inside you)
(The sky is falling down, the sky is falling down)Embed
