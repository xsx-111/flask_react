Pretty Thing Lyrics
Taking pictures of the boys
Passed out in your bed
True collector till the end
You burned your bridges well
With games of kiss and tell
Left me twisting in the wind
You occupy your days
Walking through a maze
Convincing everyone you've got a lot to say

You're such a pretty thing
You're such a pretty thing
You're such a pretty thing
I taught you everything you know

When you first came to town
Buying drinks until you drowned
So many wasted nights
The blood lay on your hands
Trying to make amends
But you're spilling on your dress
The gypsy's on the move
But the caravan remains
A new backdrop but same old play
You're such a pretty thing
You're such a pretty thing
You're such a pretty thing
I taught you everything you know


You're such a pretty thing
You're such a pretty thing
I taught you everything
You're such a pretty thing
You're such a pretty thing
I taught you everything you knowEmbed
