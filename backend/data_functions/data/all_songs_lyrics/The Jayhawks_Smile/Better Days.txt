Better Days Lyrics
Took a walk down Paramount
(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of Saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trenchcoat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope
But a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, ooh
Too late for hope
But a dream remembered
Better days
Made love in the Toronto rain
(I've seen better days)
From Hamilton I look the train
(I've seen better days)
"What you regret," you softly said, "are things you never do"
I regret I didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope
But a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, ooh
Too late for hope
But a dream remembered
Better days
Better days

Now I stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned I could have stayed
But I just walked away
I could have done a lot of things
In my better days
Too late for hope
But a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, ooh
Too late for hope
But a dream remembered
Better days
Better days
Better daysEmbed
