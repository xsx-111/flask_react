Broken Harpoon Lyrics
Gonna build a fire
Lead the choir
In my song
As I climb the walls
Walk the halls
To be strong

Once
It was around my schoolboy days
New lines were drawn and rules were made

I wear the scars
Smell the blood
On the breeze
I weathered the storm
For a glimpse
Of the trees

When
It seemed no matter what you gave
I took my secret to my grave
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon

I could drown
In the sound
Of my dreams
Shiver and moan
Feel the need
To be free

Once
It was around my schoolboy days
New lines were drawn and rules were made

Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoon
Broken harpoonEmbed
