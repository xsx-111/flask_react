What Led Me to This Town Lyrics
What led me to this town?
Room to roam, but no place called home
Dazed at first but shaking off the Sunday gloom
What led me to this town?

Such a lazy afternoon
Eight shades of gray, and I can taste the rain
Oh, how high the lovely have flown
What led me to this town?

Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over me

Sometimes I can't get free
You're standing right there in front of me
Woke up one day and my dreams were gone
What led me to this town?

Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over me
What led me to this town?
Are you keeping a secret?
Well I'm keeping one, too
Can you keep it a secret?
I'm in love with you

What happened to this boy?
Aw, such a lovely mother's son

Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my life
Blue lights are shining over my lifeEmbed
