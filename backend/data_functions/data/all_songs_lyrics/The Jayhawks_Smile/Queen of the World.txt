Queen of the World Lyrics
Just a face among the crowd
Another ship on the sea of sweet confusion
Standin' on your toes
While your jewelry was swayin' to the music

You are a rose among the leaves
And you're the only one I'll ever need
And when I look into your eyes
I know that you will

Take me to a place I never go
You send me kisses made of gold
I'll place a crown upon your curls
All hail the queen of the world

Just an ordinary girl
With an ordinary life that you have chosen
But you're the fire in the snow
Though I believe that I'm the only one who knows it

You never liked to sleep alone
You left some lipstick on the telephone
And when I look into your eyes
I know that you will
Take me to a place I never go
You send me kisses made of gold
I'll place a crown upon your curls
All hail the queen of the world


Take me to a place I never go
You send me kisses made of goldEmbed
