Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? Lyrics
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have-nots would have tried to freeze you in ice

Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

Well, I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine?

Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow
Glimpse through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy life

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has he had another, baby, standing in the shadow?
Just where have you been all your life?
Talking about all the people who would try anything twice

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has she had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

Well, you take your choice at the time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of declineEmbed
