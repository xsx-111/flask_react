Take It or Leave It Lyrics
You can turn off and on more times
Than a flashing neon sign
When you want you're bad
But you can be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend just what you're going to do now
You take it or leave it
It's just my life

There've been times when you tried makin' eyes
At all my so called friends
Then you go, now you're back
But you can be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friends just what you're going to do now
You take it or leave it
It's just my life

Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la
I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
When you don't come home at night
You said you'd call, that's a lie
But you could be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friends just what you're going to do now
You take it or leave it
It's just my life

Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la
Oh la la la ta, ta ta ta, la la la la1Embed
