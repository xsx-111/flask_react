My Girl Lyrics
I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I got the month of May
I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl (my girl) my girl
Talking about my girl

I go so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, baby, than the birds in the trees
I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl (my girl) my girl
Talking about my girl

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I don't need no money, or count my pay
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can take
I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talking about my girl

I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
I even got the month of May
(My girl) My girl
I'm talking about my girl1Embed
