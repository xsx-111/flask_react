Railroad Song Lyrics
I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee
I was cold, tired and dirty hungry as I could be
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs
So I asked the policeman
Can I stay here long
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now
We don't want you around
See I'm trying to build me a respectable town
And we don't need a hobo like you hagnin' around

So I left that town, Lord, had my guitar in my hand
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man
But this life that I chose to live, sometimes is strange
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from riding the train
I'm a hobo I know, but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr. Choo-choo train take me away

I'm going to ride this train Lord until I find out
What Jimmie Rodgers and the Hag was all about
See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine
But I want to go back a little further in time
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr. Choo-choo train take me awayEmbed
