Kiss the Ring Lyrics
Hey! Hey!

We kill the girls to get paid
And put the whole damn room on the edge of the blade
You'll get far, stay clean
And if the world stops believing, I'll keep believing
That the world could make a change
(All I know is I won't stop believing)
And put the suicide dolls as the last ones to mate
(All I know is I won't stop believing)
Come hard, stay clean
(You're the next if you don't stop your creeping)
And singing songs for the damned now
(You're the next if you)

Hail! Hail!
'Cause the king is gone
And if you don't stop believing, we'll keep believing
You put the record on
And live the life that you're making, shots that you're taking
So grab the cash and run
And let the suits watch each other kill one another
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing
You gotta kiss that ring
Well, alright

Move like the wolves, keep the faith
There ain't a dry eye left in the back of the place
Is it hard to stay clean?
And if you all keep believing, I'll keep believing
That the world drives the saints
(All I know is I won't stop believing)
And put the shotgun shells in the hills it makes
(All I know is I won't stop believing)
So come hard, stay clean
(You're the next if you don't stop your creeping)
Because they don't give a damn, now
(You're the next if you)

Hail! Hail!
'Cause the king is gone
And if you don't stop believing, we'll keep believing
You got your leather on
And live the life that you're making, shots that you're taking
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing
You gotta kiss that ring

Hail, hail 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail 'cause the king is, the king is gone
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

'Cause the king is gone
And if you don't stop believing, we'll keep believing
And get your leather on
And live the life that you're making, shots that you're taking
So grab the cash and run
And let the suits watch each other kill one another
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing

Fist up, head down
Hail, hail to the king11Embed
