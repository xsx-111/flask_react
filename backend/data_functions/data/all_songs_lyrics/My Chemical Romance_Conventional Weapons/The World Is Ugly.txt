The World Is Ugly Lyrics
These are the eyes and the lies of the taken
These are their hearts
But their hearts don't beat like ours
They burn 'cause they are all afraid
For every one of us
There's an army of them
But you'll never fight alone
'Cause I wanted you to know

That the world is ugly
But you’re beautiful to me
Well are you thinking of me now?
(Now)

These are the nights
And the lights that we fade in
These are the words
But the words aren't coming out
They burn 'cause they are hard to say
For every failing sun, there's a morning after
Though, I'm empty when you go
I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me
Like I'm thinking of you?
I would say I'm sorry, though
Though, I really need to go
I just wanted you to know

I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I'm thinking of you
Every night, every day
These are the lies
And the lives of the taken
These are their hearts
But their hearts don't beat like ours
They burn 'cause they are all afraid
But mine beats twice as hard

'Cause the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me
Like I'm thinking of you?
I would say I'm sorry, though
Though, I really need to go
And I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me?
Stop your crying, helpless feeling
Dry your eyes and start believing
There's one thing
They’ll never take from you

(One day, like this
We'll never be the same
Never, forever
Like ghosts in the snow
Like ghosts in the sun)24Embed
