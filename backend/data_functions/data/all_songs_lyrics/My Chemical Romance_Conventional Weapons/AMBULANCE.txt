AMBULANCE Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You don’t know a thing about this life, and we are up for
Everything it takes to prove we’re not the same as them
And we will wear our masks again, out after dark
'Cause we are up for everything it takes, and we are not the same

'Cause we are not afraid
And we are not ashamed

And if you save my life, I’ll be the one who drives
You home tonight
And if I ever let you down, I’ll be the one who drives
You home tonight

Remember once, you walked this kind of life quietly, I’ll sleep
Behind the wheel, and passing every face you see the first time
Singing every piece as you walk by proving that with
All of my mistakes, that we are not the same
'Cause we are not the same
And we are all to blame

And if you save my life, I’ll be the one who drives
You home tonight
And if I ever let you down, I’ll be the one who drives
You home tonight, you home tonight!

It's driving you down, it's driving you down
It's driving you down, it's driving you down
It's driving you down, 'cause it's driving you down
It's driving you, driving you down

You don’t know a thing about this life
And you don’t know a thing about this life
And you don’t know a thing about this life
'Cause you don’t know a thing about me, you don’t know a thing

And if you save my life, I’ll be the one who drives
You home tonight
And if I ever let you down, I’ll be the one who drives
You home tonight, you home tonight, you home tonight!
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you, driving you, driving you down8Embed
