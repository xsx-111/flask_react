Make Room!!!! Lyrics
Make room! Make room!
Down on the coffin,​ there's a coffin or two
Dead chic, so cool
The cannibals are starving when they're looking at you
Tank tops, jet stream
Karate lessons with a killing machine
White lines, nose bleeds
I know you get excited when the cameras go
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta

Me and you, and all of this living dead
Burning up in the sun, where the bodies add
Sitting here with you, in misery
Anybody gonna come and rescue me?
La la la
Alright
Whoah!

Make room! Make room!
One day, you're gonna have explaining to do
Drag star, so cool
There's only room for one man and the one is you, you, you
Me and you and all of these living dead
Burning up in the sun, where the bodies add
Got a taste for the cash and androgyny
Anybody wanna come and rescue me?

Alright, oh
Well alright, well alright
Well alright, well alright
Well alright
Well alright, well alright
She's alright
Everybody in the room is alright
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!
We are never gonna change the world
We are never gonna change the world
'Cause we are never gonna die!

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die!
