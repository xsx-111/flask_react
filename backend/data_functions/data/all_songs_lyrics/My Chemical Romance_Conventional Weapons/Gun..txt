Gun. Lyrics
We could get somebody else, but we want someone like you
We could get somebody else, but we want someone like you
We could get somebody else, but we want someone like you
We could get somebody else, but we want someone like you
We could get somebody else, but we want someone like you
We could get somebody else, but we want someone like you

Well, as soon as I get my gun
I'll point it out the window, at the setting sun
As soon as I get my gun
I'll tell you all about it when you fall in love
As soon as I get my gun
I'm gonna make a call
Well, as soon as I get my gun
Get my gun

Well, the uniform isn't sewn
They make 'em like we give 'em out to anyone
As soon as we get your gun
A heckle for a pistol is a lot of fun
It's just the kind of place we run
Because the government
Because the government wants your gun
Wants your gun, whoa
Well, if I'm old enough to die for your mistakes
Then let's go
Can I bleed enough to fill up what the engine takes?
We don't know
But if you're watching up above
They're teaching me to kill, who's teaching me to love?
Now, baby
Isn't it crazy?

Well, as soon as I get my gun, as soon as I get my gun
They'll put me on vacation, underneath the sun
As soon as I get my gun, as soon as I get my gun
I'll holler and flash it at my belting blood
Out on the sand
Like a hole from an IED
'Cause I'm holding up my gun
Holding up my gun, yeah

Well, if I'm old enough to die for your mistakes
Then let's go
Can I bleed enough to fill up what the engine takes?
We don't know
But if you're watching up above
They're teaching me to kill, who's teaching me to love?
Now, baby
Isn't it crazy?
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my G-U-N (Don't even have a gun!)
I'm standing out in the S-U-N (Don't even have a gun!)
I'm never gonna have a son (Don't even have a gun!)
She's never gonna have a son (Don't even have a gun!)
I'm never gonna have a S-O-N
And now I'm never gonna have a S-O-N

Well, if I'm old enough to die for your mistakes
Then let's go
Can I bleed enough to fill up what the engine takes?
We don't know
But if you're watching up above
They're teaching me to kill, who's teaching me to love?
Now, baby
Isn't it crazy?

As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
As soon as I get my gun (Don't even have a gun!)
Well, as soon as I, as soon as I get my gun9Embed
