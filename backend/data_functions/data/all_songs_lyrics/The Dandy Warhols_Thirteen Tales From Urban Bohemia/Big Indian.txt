Big Indian LyricsWell, my friends, do me so right
I'm lucky this far or maybe its karma
I get over them, but
Only at times
And I thank my lucky stars
Wish I may, I wish that I might
Just keep an open mind
All of the time
My old man told me one time
You never get wise
You only get older
And most things, you never know why
But that's life
When the future is frightening
And I seem to be fighting it
As soon as it's brightening
Then I, I feel fine
And then I feel fine
Well, my friends do me so right
I'm lucky this far or maybe it's karma
I get over them, but
Only at times
Well, the future is frightening
And I seem to be fighting
And as soon as it's brightening
Well, the future is frightening
The future is frightening
But I feel fine
Yes, I feel fineEmbed
