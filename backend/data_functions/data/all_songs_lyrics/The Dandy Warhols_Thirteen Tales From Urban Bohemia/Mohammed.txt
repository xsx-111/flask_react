Mohammed LyricsAgain and again
I get up and say, I only want to get it right
I only want to do the right thing
But all these demons harass my soul
I won't be today, I'm alone again
No one can make that alive
No one can say they're better not when
All this freedom you get is a lie
Again and againEmbed
