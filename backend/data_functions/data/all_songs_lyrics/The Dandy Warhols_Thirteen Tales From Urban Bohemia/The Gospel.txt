The Gospel LyricsMy sweet love, I'll take you there
(Comin' for to carry you home)
I'll take you down still water, I am
(Comin' for to carry you home)
No more weary, no more tired, I am
(Comin' for to carry you home)
My sweet love, I'll take you there
(Comin' for to carry you home)
Home, I will take you there
Home, I will take you there
My darling I will shelter you
(Comin' for to carry you home)
I'll lay you down, still water, I'll
(Comin' for to carry you home)
No more weary, no more tired, I'm
(Comin' for to carry you home)
Hmm
(Comin' for to carry you home)
Home, I will take you there
Oh, home, I will take you there
I'll, I will take you there
Oh, home, I will take you thereEmbed
