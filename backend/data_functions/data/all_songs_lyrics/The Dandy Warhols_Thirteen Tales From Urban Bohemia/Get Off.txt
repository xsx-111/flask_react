Get Off LyricsYeah, like it or not
Like a ball and a chain
All I wanna do is get off
And feel it for a minute, babe
Hot diggity dog
I love God all the same
But all I wanna do is get off
And feel it, feel it, feel it, babe
Baby, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe, you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
Yeah maybe I thought
What father would say
But all I wanna do is get off
And feel it for a minute, like the real thing, baby, I guess
I already forgot
Why I thought I was sane
But all I wanna do is get off
And feel it, feel it, feel it babe
Baby, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
Hey, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
And like it or not
Like a ball and a chain
All I wanna do is get off
And feel for a minute
Like the real thing, baby, oh yeah
I already forgot
Why I thought I was sane
But all I wanna do is get off
And feel it, feel it, feel it, babe
Baby, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
Hey, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, you find yourself against yourselfEmbed
