Godless Lyrics
Hey, I said you're godless
And it seems like you're a soulless friend
As thoughtless as you were back then
I swear that you are godless
Hey I guess you're lonely when
I gave you all it took so then
Stranger than it's ever been
I guess it's what you wanted

Oh wait, it seems that lonely I will be
I beg, I plead, but this is all that I have gotten

Hey, as for the day my friend
To hope that you could ever bend
I swear you are, I swear you are
Oh, I swear, that you are godless
Hey I said you're godless man
Hey and you're a soulless friend
Hey I said you're thoughtless
And I swear, I swear
And you're godless, and you're godless
God, you're godless2Embed
