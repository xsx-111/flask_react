Horse Pills Lyrics
Alright
(Pills)
Yeah, uh-huh
(Thrills)
Alright, kick it
(Spills)
Boy
(Chills)
Bust

So your ex got a mansion where you kick it on the hill
Your boy comes to see you, he's your Hollywood thrill
He's a Spanish fly, bucks like a stallion
In the suits that you got him, he looks more Italian
And you worry 'bout your tan when the weather's gettin' clammy
Summer in the city and winters in Miami
And you get so high on the high life pills
Cruisin' and boozin' and rockin' on the horse size

(Pills)
You could even take more
(Thrills)
You could even take more
(Spills)
Pills, thrills, chills and ills man, kills
And rockin' on the horse size
Butt's gettin' bigger
Do you think he'll notice maybe?
That's ok, don't worry 'bout it baby
'Cause everybody knows he pumps you for your money
That's all right, don't worry 'bout it honey
In your itsy bitsy teenie weenie riding up your butt bikini
Keepin' on the heels 'cause you're saggin' just a teenie bit
More than the girls he pretends he doesn't thrill
Rubbin' on the lotion, and rockin' on the horse size

(Pills)
You could even take more
(Thrills)
You could even take more
(Spills)
Pills, thrills, chills, and ills man, kills
And rockin' on the horse size

Sometimes you feel like Moses
That's when you're toasted

Yeah kick it
Yo bitch
That's right, bust
Uh-huh, yeah
(Pills)
(Thrills)
(Spills)
(Chills)
(Pills)
(Thrills)
(Spills)
(Chills)
(Pills)
(Thrills)
(Spills)
Rockin' on the horse sizeEmbed
