Solid LyricsWell, I must have a door in the back of my head
Where I dump out all the crap so I can just feel solid again
No more sitting around thinking about your hair
'Cause I must have a door in the back of my, back of my head
Yeah, I got a beautiful new Asian girlfriend
She comes over and hangs around for days in my bed
Yeah, you can't seriously believe I'm thinking about you, man
'Cause I must have a door in the back of my, back of my head
Well, it's a brand new day and I'm walking around old town
I feel cool as shit, because I got no thoughts keeping me down
I'm thinking bla-bla-de, bla, bla to your trip
Cause I must have a door in the back of my, back of my headEmbed
