Cool Scene LyricsWell, I'm just not making a scene
And I really don't feel like I need
I really don't mean that it's cool
Didn't really wanna be in high school
I'm dealing with the things that I've been
If it wasn't so appropriate then
I really don't care what I see
And I really don't know what I mean
And I really don't mean that it's cool
Didn't really wanna be in high school
All the talking fools
What it means
Last I've seen
Baby, it's all me
I'm just not making a scene
Never really felt that you're a cool being
I really don't know what I'd be
And it really isn't worth the trying
I'm feeling pretty chill with nothing
Like I'm livin in a world that follows you
Don't really think you know your friends, man
Like you're livin in a social hydrant
I really don't mean that it's cool
Didn't really wanna be in high school
All the talking fools
What it means
The last I seen
Baby, it's all me
Didn't really wanna be in high school
All the talking fools
What it means
Last I seen
Baby it's all me
Baby, it's all me
Baby, it's all me
Baby, it's all me
Baby, it's all me
Baby, it's all me
It's all me
It's all meEmbed
