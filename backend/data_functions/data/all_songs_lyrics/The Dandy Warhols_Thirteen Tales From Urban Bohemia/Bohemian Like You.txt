Bohemian Like You Lyrics
You got a great car
Yeah, what's wrong with it today?
I used to have one too
Maybe I'll come and have a look
I really love your hairdo, yeah
I'm glad you like mine too
See what looking pretty cool will get you

So what do you do?
Oh yeah, I wait tables too
No, I haven't heard your band
'Cause you guys are pretty new
But if you dig on vegan food
Well, come over to my work
I'll have 'em cook you something that you'll really love

'Cause I like you, yeah, I like you
And I'm feeling so Bohemian like you
Yeah, I like you, yeah, I like you
And I feel whoa, whoo

Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo
Wait!
Who's that guy just hanging at your pad?
He's looking kind of bummed
Yes, you broke up that's too bad
I guess it's fair if he always pays the rent
And he doesn't get all bent
About sleeping on the couch when I'm there

'Cause I like you, yeah, I like you
And I'm feeling so Bohemian like you
Yeah, I like you, yeah, I like you
And I feel whoa, whoo

Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo

I'm getting wise
And I feel so Bohemian like you
It's you that I want so please
Just a casual, casual easy thing
Is it? It is for me
And I like you, yeah, I like you
And I like you, I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you
And I feel whoa, whoo

Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo hoo12Embed
