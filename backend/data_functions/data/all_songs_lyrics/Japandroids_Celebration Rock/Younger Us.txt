Younger Us Lyrics
Remember when we had them all on the run
And the night we saw midnight sun
Remember saying things like "we'll sleep when we're dead"
And thinking this feeling was never gonna end

Remember when we had them all on the run
And the night we saw midnight sun
Remember saying things like "we'll sleep when we're dead"
And thinking this feeling was never gonna end
Remember that night you were already in bed
Said "fuck it" got up to drink with me instead!

Gimme that naked new skin rush
Give me younger us
Gimme that you and me in a grave trust
Give me younger us
Gimme that girls learning love, wild and free
Give me younger us
Gimme my boys and I swimmin' through the streets
Give me younger us
Gimme that night you were already in bed, said "fuck it"
Got up to drink with me instead

Gimme that naked new skin rush
Give me younger us
Gimme that you and me in a grave trust
Give me younger us
Gimme that girls learning love, wild and free
Give me younger us
Gimme my boys and I swimmin' through the streets
Give me younger us
Gimme that night you were already in bed, said "fuck it"
Got up to drink with me instead2Embed
