For the Love of Ivy Lyrics
You look just like an Elvis from hell
My heart is broken, and I'm going to hell
Bury me way down deep in hell
I'm a steel driving man, I want to go to hell
Then go tell Ivy
For the love of Ivy
I did it for Ivy
You're the one
Gonna buy me a graveyard of my own
And kill everyone who ever done me wrong
Gonna buy me a gun just as long as my arm
And kill everyone who ever done me harm

Then go tell Ivy
Yeah go tell Ivy
For the love of Ivy
You're the one

Jawbone eat and jawbone talk
Jawbone eat you with a knife and fork
I was hunting for answers down in the dark
When suddenly I had a better thought
I was all dressed up
Like Elvis from hellEmbed
