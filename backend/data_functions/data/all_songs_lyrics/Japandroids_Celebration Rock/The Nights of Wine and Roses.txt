The Nights of Wine and Roses Lyrics
Long lit up tonight and still drinking
Don't we have anything to live for?
Well of course we do
But till they come true
We're drinking
And we're still smoking
Don't we have anything to live for?
Well of course we do
But till they come true
We're smoking
We all want to know what nobody knows
What the nights of wine and roses hold
For the wine and roses of our souls
So we down our drinks in a funnel of friends
And we burn our blends right down to the end
We don't cry for those nights to arrive
We yell like hell to the heavens
We all want to know what nobody knows
What the nights of wine and roses hold
For the wine and roses of our souls
So we down our drinks in a funnel of friends
And we burn our blends right down to the end
We don't cry for those nights to arrive
We yell like hell to the heavens
Hey!!!1Embed
