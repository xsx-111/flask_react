Continuous Thunder Lyrics
Heart's terrain is never a prairie
But you weren't wary
You took my hand
Through the cold, pissing rain
Dressed to the nines
Arm in arm with me tonight
Singing out loud
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like continuous thunder

Oh, and if I had all of the answers
And you had the body you wanted
Would we love with a legendary fire?

And if the cold, pissing rain flooded that fire
Would you still take my hand tonight?
Singing out loud
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like continuous thunder
Like continuous thunder
Like continuous thunder
Like continuous thunder
Like continuous thunderEmbed
