The House That Heaven Built Lyrics
When the soul of the city
Was laid to rest
And the nights forgotten and left for dead
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I happened on a house
Built of living light
Where everything evil disappears and dies
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

When they love you, and they will, (and they will)
Tell 'em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down, (slow you down)
Tell 'em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will, (and they will)
Tell 'em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down, (slow you down)
Tell 'em all to go to hell

I settled in slowly, to this house that you call home
To blood and breath, fear, flesh and bone
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Blush of our bodies in the heat of the night
All day the day after, reddened the skies
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
When they love you, and they will, (and they will)
Tell em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down, (slow you down)
Tell em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will, (and they will)
Tell 'em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down, (slow you down)
Tell 'em all to go to hell

It's a lifeless life, with no fixed address to give
But you're not mine to die for anymore
So I must live
Born of a bottle, from heaven's hand
And now you know and here I am
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

When they love Me and they will, (and they will)
Tell 'em all they'll love in your shadow
And if they try to slow me down, (slow you down)
Tell 'em all to go to hell
When they love you, and they will, (and they will)
Tell 'em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down, (slow you down)
Tell 'em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will, (and they will)
Tell 'em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down, (slow you down)
Tell 'em all to go to hell

When they love you, and they will, (and they will)
Tell 'em all they'll love in my shadow
And if they try to slow you down, (slow you down)
Tell 'em all to go to hell6Embed
