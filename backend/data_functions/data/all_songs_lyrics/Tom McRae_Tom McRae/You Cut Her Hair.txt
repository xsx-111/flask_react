You Cut Her Hair LyricsTime
Has coloured in
The black and white
Of your sin
So burn
Burn the flag
Rip it up
Bury the Rags
But I will find you still
Move in for the kill
You cut her hair
So live
Live long
See her face
In everyone
And turn
Turn the page
Start again
Change your name
But I will find you still
Move in for the kill
You cut her hair
You cut her hair
You cut her hairEmbed
