Draw Down The Stars LyricsComing back to the city
That I never quite leave
Picture you by the ocean
Picture me coughing into my sleeve
Like a snake eating snake you confuse me
Who's killer? Who's captive? Who's free?
In a city that kills by constriction
Throw your streets around me and squeeze
And draw down the stars
Draw down the stars
What's in your heart?
Your heart
This fluorescent night will divide us
And dissolve to a flickering screen
We all know each others' secrets
Things seen, but not seen
Draw down the stars
Draw down the stars
What's in your heart?
Draw down the stars
Draw down the stars
What's in your heart?
Your heartEmbed
