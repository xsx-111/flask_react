2nd Law LyricsTell all my friends
I have gone to the moon
Tell all my friends
I will write them soon
And tell them
If you see them
That I am better left alone
'Cause I'm living up here where the air is thin
Where gravity don't bring you down
I'm living up here and I'm watching your
Universe cooling down
I spend my days beneath a perspex dome
I think that I have finally come home
So tell them
If you see them
That I am better left alone
'Cause I'm living up here where the air is thin
And where gravity don't bring you down
I'm living up here and I'm watching your
Universe cooling down
Yeah, I'm living up here where the air is thin
And where gravity don't bring you down
I'm living up here and I'm watching your
Universe cooling downEmbed
