The Boy With The Bubblegun LyricsWelcome to the second reel
Glad that you can make it
We thought your fate was sealed
It's not what we expected
But you punch above your weight
And you're stronger than you look
And the ending's not the same
They changed it from the book
I'm the boy with the bubblegun, I'm taking aim
I cannot hit to hurt or cause you pain
If words could kill I'd spell out your name
It's time to kill the king
It's written in the scripture
See what tomorrow brings
Got to get a bigger picture
So forgive me, forgive me, forgive me
For I am born to be what I must be and I must be
The boy with the bubblegun, I'm taking aim
I cannot hit to hurt or cause you pain
If words could kill I'd spell out your name
I'm the boy with the bubblegun
The boy with the bubblegun
I'm the boy with the bubblegun with work to do
If songs could kill this one's for youEmbed
