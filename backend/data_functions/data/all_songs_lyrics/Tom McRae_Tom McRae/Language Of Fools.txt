Language Of Fools LyricsI cannot use this language of fools to communicate with you
The things that you say to mark the time of the day are calculated to bemuse
And hey yeah...hey hey yeah
Won't you hide me? Won't you hold my life? Let me have this time
And lie here while I close my eyes, hold me through this night
One good day will lead the way for another, my love
Living here things are never so clear you discover my love
And hey yeah...hey, hey yeah
Won't you hide me? Won't you hold my life? Let me have this time
And lie here while I close my eyes, hold me through this night
Hide me, won't you hold my weight, hold me through this nightEmbed
