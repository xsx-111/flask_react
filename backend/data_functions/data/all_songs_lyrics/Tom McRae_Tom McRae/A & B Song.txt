A & B Song LyricsA say's he's glad to be here
B's chasing storms in the lightning state
Where everyday above ground is a good day
And life is great
A's got cocaine body
B's got a benylin brain
A knows he's gonna be some body
B don't believe in fame
And all
Our time
Slips away
And all
Our time
Slips away
A's got a girl for each season
B's got a mail order bride
A knows he's headed for salvation
B's afraid to die
If hell is in the detail
Babe I'm a microscope
I know i'll live to see you swinging
Given enough rope
And all
Our time
Slips away
And all
Our time
Slips away
And all
Our time
Slips away
And all
Our time
Slips away
A's growing tired of conversation
He's ready for his final scene
B's whistling Hotel California
And still living out the dream
Here we are together
Let's roll the dice just one more time
Odd number says we walk away now
Even says we die
Don't wanna die
The storm is rising in me
The storm is rising in me
The blood is rising in me
The blood is rising in me
The storm is rising in me
The storm is rising in me
The blood is rising in me
The blood is rising in me
And all
Our time
Slips away
And all
Our time
Slips away
And all
Our time
Slips away1Embed
