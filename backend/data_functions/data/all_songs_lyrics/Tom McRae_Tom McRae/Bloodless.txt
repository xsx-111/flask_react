Bloodless LyricsThis train don't stop at the Stations of the Cross
No reasons left to believe
Trying to stay awake, gave yourself a caffeine headache
To hide the taste of sleep
In choosing to forget you cut away the safety net
That holds your heart, holds your heart
And you go in search of youth touching up your empire roots
But these days we don't know how to march
Satisfied with a knife in your spine, you're bloodless
So tell me again, what am I feeling?
You know me so well, so what am I feeling?
And how can you tell? I've got a feeling
You don't know
We think that we're the ones we're the bright unconquered suns
Wait a while we'll watch the light grow stale
And we smell so very clean, but we're the oil in this machine
And this machine, this machine is going wrong
So choose your sides, when it comes to the fight you're bloodless
So tell me again, what am I feeling?
You know me so well, so what am I feeling?
And how can you tell? I've got a feeling
You don't know
You choose your side but in the fight
I see your blood run white, your blood run white
And I've seen it all before and I see it again
And I see it again, so what am I feeling?
You know me so well, so what am I feeling?
And how can you tell? I've got a feeling
You don't know
So tell me again now, what am I feeling?
You know me so well, so what am I feeling
And how can you tell? I've got a feeling
And I see it again, so what am I feeling?
You know me so well, so what am I feeling?
And how can you tell? I've got a feeling
You don't knowEmbed
