Untitled LyricsGet me out, get me out, get me out of this room, let me see
Cut it out, cut it out, rip it out from this wound, let me bleed
But wait now, wait now for me
Won't you?
Shut it out, shut it out, black it out with the night, to put me at ease
Won't you?
Talk it out, talk it out, yell out to the ghosts that stalk the street
But wait now, wait now for me
And we'll sail on the high tide, drift on the open sea
I've been waiting for so long
Take my hand, take my hand, kiss me softly, then take your leave
Won't you?
Sit down, sit down, take the weight of me, let me grieve
But wait now, wait now for me
And we'll sail on the high tide, drift on the open sea
I've been waiting for so long
But wait now, wait now for me
And we'll sail on the high tide, drift on the open sea
I've been waiting for so longEmbed
