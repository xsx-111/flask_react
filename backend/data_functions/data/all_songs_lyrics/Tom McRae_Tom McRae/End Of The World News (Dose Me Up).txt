End Of The World News (Dose Me Up) LyricsYou wake up to the sound of alarms
And youâ€™re driving your fabulous car
Listening to the music that reminds you
You used to be young, you used to be young
And now you're searching for a sign with your name
To define you the king of the game
What will you do when there's nothing left
For you to earn and for you to learn?
So dose me up, once is not enough
I can still see the ground
And from this high rise view looking down on you
I'm not the one wasting my time
And every culture has its own magazine
And information takes the place of your dreams
Finding ways to fill up the silence
But it's all that you need, turn on your TV
So dose me up, once is not enough
I can still see the ground
And from this high rise view looking down on you
I'm not the one wasting my time
This is the end of the world news
This is the end of the world news
Sponsored by God
So dose me up, once is not enough
I can still see the ground
And from this high rise view looking down on you
I'm not the one wasting my time
So dose me up, once is not enough
I can still see the ground
And from this high rise view looking down on you
I'm not the one wasting my time
So dose me up, once is not enough
I can still see the ground
And from this high rise view looking down on you
I'm not the one wasting my timeEmbed
