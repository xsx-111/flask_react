One More Mile LyricsI feel the night is on your side
Shadows wait you when you rise
You hold the weight of every moment
And move no distance in your stride
And while you wallow in your wounds
You let the devils draw near
One more mile is all we have
You got nothing to fear
I feel the night is on your side
And I don't recognise this road
We sleep all day and walk all night
You're leading me too far from home
And he says pour another drink
And take a good look around
One more mile is all we have
Until the lost become the found
And by the firelight I see footprints
The shadows circle on the floor
And everything is so familiar
We have come this way before
Do I have the will?
Do I?
One more mile
One more mile
Do I have the will?
Do I?
One more mile
One more mile
Take a good look round
Take a good look roundEmbed
