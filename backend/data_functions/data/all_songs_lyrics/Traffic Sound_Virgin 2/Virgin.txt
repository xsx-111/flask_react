Virgin Lyrics
Babe, I just woke up today
Heard those words you've been saying about me

Can't regret you, my friend
Can't regret you, my friend, oh!

I know how hard you have tried
Pleasing me, means no lie, no game, no!

Can't regret you, my friend
Can't regret you, my friend

Now you won't get what you want
You may say I was wrong, but you failed (Yeah you failed!)

Can't regret you, my friend
Can't regret you, my friendEmbed
