Jews Caboose Lyrics
Shadows crawl in the evening

Yeah, it's alright

Shadows crawl in the evening
 it's near me

You won't feel the same tomorrow, no
You can't feel the same tomorrow, no
I'll think about you driving my car
My love for you has gone much too far, baby
Alright

You said you need me but you want me dead
I think my body's what you need instead

Keep your head from the butcher's eye
Hi!
Hi, baby baby babe baby!
Keep down, baby!Embed
