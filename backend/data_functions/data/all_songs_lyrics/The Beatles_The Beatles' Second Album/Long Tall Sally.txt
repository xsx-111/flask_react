Long Tall Sally Lyrics
I'm going to tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He says he had the misery it but he got a lot of fun
Oh baby
Yeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby
Some fun tonight

I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby
Yeeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby
Some fun tonight


Well long tall Sally built pretty sweet
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh baby
Yeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby
Some fun tonight

Well, we're going to have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun tonight
Have some fun, yeah yeah yeah
We're going to have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun tonight
Yeah, we'll have some fun, some fun tonightEmbed
