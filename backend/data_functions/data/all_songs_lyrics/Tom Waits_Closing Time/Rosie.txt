Rosie LyricsWell, I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
And all that you left me was a melody
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
Rosie
And the moon's all up, full and big
Apricot tips in an indigo sky
And I've been loving you, Rosa, since the day I was born
And I'll love you, Rosie, 'til the day I die
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
Rosie
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
Rosie
And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
