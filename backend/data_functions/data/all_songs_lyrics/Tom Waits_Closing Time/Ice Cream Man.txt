Ice Cream Man LyricsWell I'm clicking by your house about 2:45
With sidewalk sundae strawberry surprise
I got a cherry popsicle right on time
A big stick, momma, that will blow your mind
'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band, yeah
I'm an ice cream man, baby
Honey, I'll be good to you
If you missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret
Come back around and don't forget
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool
Got something better than a swimming pool
'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm an ice cream man
Honey, I'll be good to you, yeah
'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm an ice cream man
Honey, I'll be good to you
You see me coming, you ain't got no change
Don't worry, baby, it can be arranged
Show me you can smile, baby, just for me
Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free
'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm an ice cream man
Honey, I'll be good to you
Be good to you
Be good to you
Be good to you
I'll be good to you, yeah
I'll good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you
I'll be good to you
Don't you know
I'll be good to you
Good to youEmbed
