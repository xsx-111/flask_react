Martha Lyrics
Operator, number please, it's been so many years
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears?
Hello, hello there, is this Martha? This is old Tom Frost
And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now Martha please recall
Meet me out for coffee where we'll talk about it all

And those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day

And I feel so much older now, you're much older too
How's your husband? And how's your kids?
You know that I got married too
Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature

And those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
And Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
And we saved 'em for a rainy day
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am
And all that really mattered then was that I was a man
I guess that our being together was never meant to be
But Martha, Martha, I love you, can't you see?

And those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
And we saved 'em for a rainy day

And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to you6Embed
