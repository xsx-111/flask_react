Virginia Avenue LyricsWell, I'm walking on down Virginia Avenue
Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to
Harold's Club is closing
And everybody's going on home:
What's a poor boy to do?
I'll just get on back into my short
Make it back to the fort
Sleep off all the crazy lizards inside of my brain
There's got to be some place
That's better than this
This life I'm leading's driving me insane
And let me tell you I'm dreaming
Let me tell you that
I'm dreaming to the twilight
This town has got me down
I've seen all the highlights
I've been walking all around
I won't make a fuss, I'll take a Greyhound bus
Carry me away from...
Tell me, what have I got to lose?
'Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue
The bars are all closing
'Cause it's quarter to two
Every town I go to is like a lock without a key
Those I leave behind are catching up on me
Let me tell you they're catching up on me
They're catching up on me
Catching up on me, catching up on me
Catching up on me1Embed
