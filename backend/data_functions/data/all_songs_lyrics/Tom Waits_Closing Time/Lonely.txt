Lonely LyricsLonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
I thought that I knew all that there was to
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Melanie Jane, won't feel the pain
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
And I thought that I knew all that there was to
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
And I still love you
I still love you
Lonely, lonely1Embed
