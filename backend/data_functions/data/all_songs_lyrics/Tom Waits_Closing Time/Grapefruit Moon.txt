Grapefruit Moon LyricsOne, two, three, four
Grapefruit moon, one star shining
Shining down on me
Heard that tune, and now I'm pining
Honey, can't you see?
Cause every time I hear that melody
Something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Can't turn back the tide
Never had no destinations
Could not get across
You became my inspiration
Oh, but what a cost
And every time I hear that melody
Something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is more than I can hide
Now I'm smoking cigarettes
And I strive for purity
And I slip just like the stars
Into obscurity
And every time I hear that melody
Puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is all that I can see3Embed
