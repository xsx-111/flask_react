Old Shoes (& Picture Postcards) LyricsI'm singing this song, it's time it was sung
I've been putting it off for a while
But it's harder by now, 'cause the truth is so clear
That I cry when I'm seeing you smile
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you? And then I'll be gone
Every time that I tried to tell you that we'd
Lost the magic we had at the start
I would weep in my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I'd search once again for the spark
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you? And then I'll be gone
I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go
So I'll leave you to cry in the rain
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
But honey, my heart was not born to be tamed
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you? And then I'll be gone
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you? And then I'll be gone
Can I kiss you? And then I'll be gone
Can I kiss you? And then I'll be gone1Embed
