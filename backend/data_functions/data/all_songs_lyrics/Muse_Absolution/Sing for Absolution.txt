Sing for Absolution Lyrics
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful
Tiptoe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, ooh

There's nowhere left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, hey

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, hey

Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed12Embed
