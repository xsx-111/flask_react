I Just Found Out LyricsI just found out, some things I thought of you
I-I never dreamed, thet they were true
I-I-I just found out, that you were leavin' me
I-I never dreamed, thet it would be
I prayed to God to send her love to me
When deep inside this love would never be
I just found out, that you was cheatin' me
I-I-I never dreamed, that it could be
I prayed to God to send her love to me
When deep inside this love could not be
I-I just found out, that you were cheatin' me
I-I-I never dreamed that it could beEmbed
