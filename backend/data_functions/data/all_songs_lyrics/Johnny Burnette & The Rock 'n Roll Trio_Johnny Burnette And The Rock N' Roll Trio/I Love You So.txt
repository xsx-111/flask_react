I Love You So LyricsWhy do I love you so, I'll never let you go
'Cause deep inside I know, I-I-I love you so
(Love you so, love you so)
If you would say "I do", the dreams I hold for you
I know would all come true, I-I-I love you so
(Doo-doo-doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-wop)
To me you're Just everything, the sun, the moon above
To me only you can bring, happiness and love
Though years may come and go and things will change I know
My need for you will grow, I-I-I love you so
(Doo-doo--doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-wop)Embed
