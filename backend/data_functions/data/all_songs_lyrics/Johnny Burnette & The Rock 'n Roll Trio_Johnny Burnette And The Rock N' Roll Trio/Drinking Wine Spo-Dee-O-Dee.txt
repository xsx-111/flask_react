Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee LyricsWell, down in New Orleans where everything's fine
All them catfish, drinkin' that wine
Drinkin' that mess with delight
An' when they get drunk they fight all night
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, wine bop-bop
Wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, pass that bottle to me
Well, I got a nickel, have you got a dime?
Let's get together and buy a little wine
Some by the fifth, some by the quart
When you buy sherry, you're doin' things smart
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, wine bop-bop
Winе spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, pass that bottle to mе
Well, wine-wine-wine, oh, wine-wine-wine
Yeah, wine-wine-wine, oh, wine-wine-wine
Oh down in New Orleans, pass that bottle to me
Drinkin' that mess with delight
An' when they get drunk they fight all night
Knockin' down windows, bang down doors
Drinkin' half a gallon an' then holler for more
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, wine bop-bop
Wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, pass that bottle to me
Oh, wine-wine-wine, oh, wine-wine-wine
Oh, wine-wine-wine, oh, wine-wine-wine
Oh, down in New Orleans, pass that bottle to meEmbed
