Lonesome Tears In My Eyes LyricsBaby-baby-baby blues an' sorrows
And a love for tomorrows seems to suit you just fine
Baby-baby-baby blues an' sorrows
And a love for tomorrows seems to suit you just fine
Can't forget that you told me so many promises, lies
I'm gonna try to forget these lonesome tears in my eyes
You've broken my heart, gonna do it again
Can't get rid of the spell you got me in
Can't forget that you told me so many promises, lies
I'm gonna try to forget these lonesome tears in my eyesEmbed
