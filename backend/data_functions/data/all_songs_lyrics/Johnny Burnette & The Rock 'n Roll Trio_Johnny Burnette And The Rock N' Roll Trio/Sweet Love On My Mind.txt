Sweet Love On My Mind LyricsWell, I'm a man who's got nothing but sweet love on my mind
If you really gonna leave me let me love you just one more time
Well, you know I ]ove you baby, I need your lovin' bad
Well give me some sweet love right this minute or you're gonna make me mad
I'm a man who's got nothing but sweet love on my mind
Well you love me, then you leave me and I cry the whole night through
Yeah you love me, then you leave me and I don't know what to do
I need your little ol' arms around me to hold and squeeze me tight
But you just love and leave me gal and you know that that ain't right
I'm a man who's got nothing but sweet love on my mind
I'm a man who's got nothing but sweet love on my mind
Well now won't you love me baby and I know I don't lose my mind
Well, you know I love you honey, but you don't treat me right
Better give me just a little bit of your sweet lovin'
Or we're gonna have a big fight
I'm a man who's got nothing but sweet love on my mind
Well the river looks cold and the bottom is a long way down
If you really gonna leave me, that's where I'm gonna be found
When the mailman comes in the morning, there's a note upon my door
Just bring my mail to the bottom of the river, I don't live here no more
I'm a man who's got nothing but sweet love on my mindEmbed
