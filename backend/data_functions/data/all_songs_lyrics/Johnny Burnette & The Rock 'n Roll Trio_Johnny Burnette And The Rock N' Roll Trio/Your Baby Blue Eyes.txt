Your Baby Blue Eyes LyricsYour baby blue eyes and your promises and lies
Have got me in a mess
Why don't you do me right and quit tryin' to fight
Everytime you get distressed?
Your sugar daddies and your money man
Well, I know they treatin' you right
Why don't you do something, baby?
Whether wrong or right, 'cause baby tonight's the night
They say that love is a wonderful game
And it happens everyday
Oh why, oh why did they pick on me
And make things happen this way?
You got stars in one eye and lies in the other
Now which am I gonna believe?
You better do something, baby
Whether wrong or right, 'cause baby tonight's the night
They say that love is a wonderful game
And it happens everyday
Oh why, oh why did they pick on me
And make things happen this way?
You got stars in one eye and lies in the other
Now which am I gonna believe?
You better do something, baby
Whether wrong or right, 'cause baby tonight's the nightEmbed
