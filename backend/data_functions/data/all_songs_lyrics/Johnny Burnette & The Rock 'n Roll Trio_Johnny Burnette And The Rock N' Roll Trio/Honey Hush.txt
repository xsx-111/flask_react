Honey Hush LyricsWell, come in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
Come in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
'Cause your sugar daddy don't want no talkin' back
You keep on a-tellin', talking 'bout this and that
You keep on a-talkin', talking 'bout this and that
I got news for you, you ain't nothing but an alleycat
Turn off the waterworks baby, they don't move me no-more
Turn off the waterworks baby, they don't move me no-more
When I leave this time, I ain't com' back no-more
Honey hush! Oow!
I said come in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
Come on in this house woman, stop all that yakety-yak
Don't make me nervous, I'm holdin' a baseball bat
Well it's a hi-ho, hi-ho silver
A hi-ho, a hi-ho silver, hi-ho, a hi-ho silver
Hi-ho, hi-ho silver
Hi-ho, hi-ho silver awayEmbed
