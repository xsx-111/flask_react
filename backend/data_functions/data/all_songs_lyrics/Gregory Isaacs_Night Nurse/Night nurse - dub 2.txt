Night nurse - dub 2 LyricsQuick, quick, quick, quick
(I'm hurt by love)
Quick, quick, quick, quick
Tell her try your best, just to make it quick
Whom attend to the sick, my god
For there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two, many times before
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory
Night nurse
Only you alone can quench Jah thirst
My night nurse, make it quick
Oh, the pain it's getting worse
I don't wanna see no doc, no
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
For there's no prescription for me
She's the one and only remedy
Night nurse, oh god
Only you alone can quench Jah thirst
My night nurse, make it quick
Oh, the pain it's getting worse
I'm hurt by love
Quick, quick, quick, quick
(And I'm sure)
Quick, quick, quick, quick
(No doctor can cure)
Quick, quick, quick, quick
Quick, quick, quick, quick
I don't wanna see no doc, no
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
'Cause there's no prescription for me
She's the one and only remedy
Night nurse
Only you alone can quench Jah thirst
My night nurse, make it quick
Oh, the pain it's getting worse
I'm hurt by love
Quick, quick, quick, quick
(Ah)
Quick, quick, quick, quick
(Ah)
Quick, quick, quick, quick
(Ah)
Quick, quick, quick, quick
(That's too bad)
Tell her try your best just to make it quick
Whom attend to the sick, my god
For there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two, many times before
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory
