Material Man Lyrics
I really wanna know right now

I know you wasn't around when I was slaving myself
Yet you seat back and relax
And you took all the wealth
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises that you're giving on to Rasta
I really wanna know right now

I gave a hand onto the wicked
But I give him it with caution
While, I was giving love
He was seeking for reaction (Tell me)
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises that you're giving on to Rasta
I really wanna know right now
Yes, I really wanna know right now (Oh, Mister Wicked)

I know you wasn't around when I was slaving myself (Oh, gosh)
Yet you seat back and relax
And you took all the wealth
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises you are giving on to Rasta (Please)
I really wanna know right now
Really wanna know right now
You put your trust in vanity
And forget about your liberty
But I really wanna know right now
Now we get to understand
You are just a material man
And now we get to know, right now
Really wanna know right now
Now we get to understand
That you're just a material man
Hey, Mister WickedEmbed
