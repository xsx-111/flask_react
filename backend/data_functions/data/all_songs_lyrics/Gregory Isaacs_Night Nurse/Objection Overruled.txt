Objection Overruled LyricsPlease give me a chance
So I can make my confession
Although i was wrong
Won't you please overrule your objection
And give me one chance
So that I can make things up with you
I must apologize
Cause I'm so sorry to treat you so cruel
Although i was wrong
Seem I was only playing a fool, so
Just one more chance
So we can talk this thing over
One more chance
Cause I don't wanna end as the loser
I must apologize
Cause I'm so sorry to treat you so cruel
Allthough i was wrong
Seem I was only playing a fool, so
Please give me a chance
So I can make my confession
Allthough i was wrong
Won't you please overrule your objection
And give me one chance
So that I can make things up with you
Over and over and over
One more chance
Cause I don't wanna end as a loser
One more chance
So we can talk this thing over
One more chance
Cause I don't wanna end as a loser
One more chance
Over and over and over
Seem I was playing a fool
I hope your objection will be overruled
One more chance
So we can talk this thing over
One more chance
Over and over and over
One more chance
Over and over and over
One more chance
So we can talk this thing over
One more chance
Over and over and over1Embed
