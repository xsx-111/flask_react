Cool Down the Pace Lyrics
Lad-la-la-la

Went to a dance last Saturday night
I was feeling tipsy, the mood was right
Sight a little daughter and a steppin' out the corner
'Cause I feel like dancing all night

But I said, cool down the pace for me little woman
You're dubing it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be

I told her to try, I dont know why
No use trying 'cause she can't
And, so, she do it how she want

So I said, cool down the pace for me, little woman
You're rocking it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be
You're rocking too fast for me
Said she would try
But she just don't know why
She keep on trying, but she can't
And, so, she do it how she want (Yeah)

But I beg her, cool down the pace for me, little woman
You're dubing it too fast for me
I said to cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be

Please, sister, try
I don't know why
No use trying 'cause you can't
And, so, she do it how she want (Yeah)

But I said, cool down the pace
Please, cool down the pace
You're rocking it too fast
This dance is gonna last

Move a little slower
A move a little slower, not so fast
All night this dance is gonna last
Cool down, cool down, cool down
Not so fast
All night this dance will last
Don't be no haste
Just cool down the pace1Embed
