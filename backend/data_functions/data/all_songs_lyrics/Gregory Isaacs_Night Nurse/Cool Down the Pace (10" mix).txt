Cool Down the Pace (10" mix) LyricsWent to a dance last Saturday night
I was feeling tipsy, the mood was right
Sight a little daughter steppin' out the corner
'Cause I feel like dancing all night
But I told her
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're coming in to fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be
I told her to try
I dunno why
She keep on trying be she can't
And so she do it how she want
And so I told her
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're coming in to fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be
And I told her, cool down, cool down
I told her, cool down, cool down
Went to a dance last Saturday night
I was feeling tipsy, the mood was right

'Cause I feel like dancing all night
And so I told her
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're coming in to fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be
She said she would try
She just dunno why
She keep on trying be she can't
And so she do it how she want
And so I told her
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're coming in to fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be
And I told her, cool down, cool down
I told her, cool down, cool down
Cool down, cool down
She said she would try
I dunno why
She keep on trying be she can't
And so she do it how she want
But I told her
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're coming in to fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're coming in to fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should beEmbed
