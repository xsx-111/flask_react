Hot Stepper LyricsI thought it would be better
Now I'm a branded hot stepper
If I am guilty, Lord God
Then I will pay
Now I'm a victim
By the words men say
And now I'm wanted
There's a price on my head
So I, so I
Said I'm a wanted
But Jah won't let the wicked capture I, no way
If I get crucial
Along the way
Cause men has been brutal
By the games they play
And cause me to be wanted
There's a price on my head
So I, so I
Said I'm a wanted
But Jah won't let the wicked capture I, no way
I know things will be better
Though I'm a branded hot stepper
If I get wearied
Why step in the way?
I will get over
Cause it's a game men play
But now I'm wanted
For the things that I know not about, oh no
Said I'm a wanted
But Jah won't let the wicked get me on, no way
Wanted for doing good among my people
Night and day
Wanted for living clean among my brethren
The games the people play
Wanted for doing good
Things will be better
Though they brand me as a stepperEmbed
