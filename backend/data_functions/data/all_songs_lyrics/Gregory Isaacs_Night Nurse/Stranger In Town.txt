Stranger In Town LyricsNow I may not be familiar with your language
But I sure would like to cross over your bridge
Said I may not dress in style as the men in your town do
But I sure know what to say: I love you
I wanna love you in the morning
Love you in the evening too
Even when you're lonely
I'll make you happy when you're feeling blue
I'm just a stranger in your town
Once in a while I pop around
Now I may not be familiar with your language, oh no
But I sure I'm gonna cross over your bridge
Do I may not dress in style as the men in your town do
But I sure know what to say: I love you
I wanna love you in the morning
Love you in the evening too
Even if you're lonely
Make you happy when you're feeling blue
Do I'm just a stranger in your town
Once in a while I pop around
Let's be friends
Friends that never end
I'm just a stranger
So let's be friends
You see me around, yeah
'Cause I wanna love ya
Yes I wanna love ya, whoay
Just stranger in your town
I'll be around
'Cause I wanna love yaEmbed
