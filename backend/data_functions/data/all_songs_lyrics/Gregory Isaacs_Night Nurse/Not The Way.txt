Not The Way Lyrics
Go and tell her you're sorry
You ain't too big to apologize, no
No
If you care that much about her
You gotta treat my sister nice
Yeah, yeah

I heard you kick her in her bum even though she's still your baby
But that's not the way to treat a lady
If she is wrong, try show her the right
No need to quarrel, no need to make a fight
Because the daughters take a little longer to sight up the Father
Yeah
I said, the daughters take a little longer to do the works of Jah Jah
Never let her go astray, yeah
Try show her the right way, yeah


I heard you kick her in her bum even though she's still your baby
But that's not the way to treat your lady
If she is wrong, try show her the right
No need to quarrel, no need to make a fight
Because the daughters take a little longer to sight up the Father
Yeah
I said, the daughters take a little longer to do the works of Jah Jah
Never let her go astray, yeah
Try show her the right way, yeah
She's your sister
So, don't mistreat her, no
I said, the d-ters take a little longer
D-ters take a little longer
She'll learn one day
Never let her go astray, yeah
She's your sister
So, don't mistreat her, no
And she'll learn one day, yeahEmbed
