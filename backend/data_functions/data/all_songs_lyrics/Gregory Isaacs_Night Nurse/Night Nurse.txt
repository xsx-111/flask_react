Night Nurse Lyrics
Tell her "try your best" just to make it quick
Come attend to the sick
Cah, there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this Jah-thirst
My night nurse (Oh gosh)
Oh, the pain is getting worse

I don't want to see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
Cah, there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this Jah-thirst
My night nurse
Oh, the pain is getting worse
I'm hurt, my love (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I don't want to see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
Cah, there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this Jah-thirst
My night nurse
Oh, the pain is getting worse
I'm hurt, my love
And I'm sure; no doctor can cure

Night nurse
Night nurse (Oh gosh)8Embed
