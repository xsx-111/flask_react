Blinded LyricsI find it hard to find it
When my eyes are blinded
I find it hard to find it
When my eyes are blinded
I find it hard to breathe
Though I need it every day
I find it hard to breathe
Though I need it in every way
I find it hard to find it
When my eyes are blinded
I find it hard to find it
When my eyes are blinded
I find it hard to breathe
Though I need it every day
I find it hard to breathe
Though I need it in every way
I'm down on my knees
Forced to beg
Oh taste the pain
Hurts my arms to bend that way
To bend that way
To bend that way
To bend that wayEmbed
