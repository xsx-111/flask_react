Sunlight Lyrics
Trying to find it
Trying to find some words to say
Trying to hide it
Trying to remind me of that day

Looking around for an extra person in my life
To call my friend
And we're seen walking
And we're seen talking
Seems like there'll never be an end
Trying to find me out

Trying to hold it up
Trying to help it catch the sunlight
Trying to fold it up
Trying to make it fear the night

Looking around for an extra person in my life
To call my friend
We're seen walking
And we're seen talking
Seems like there'll never be an end
Trying to find me outEmbed
