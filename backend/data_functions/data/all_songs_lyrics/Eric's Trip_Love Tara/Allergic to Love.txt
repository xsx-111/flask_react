Allergic to Love LyricsI'd like to talk to you
Like to let you know
How and when I follow you
Just what I'm thinking
And why and when I hide in you
From the corner of my eye
Seems to close right shut
Like I'm allergic to love...
I see it in the movies on TV
TV in my room at night
TV's always on all night
And it's all right...
Cause I'm alone when I'm not following you anymore
Watching the way you stall
Watching everything and all...
Douh..douh...du...du...(mumbling...)
(Julie talks...)Embed
