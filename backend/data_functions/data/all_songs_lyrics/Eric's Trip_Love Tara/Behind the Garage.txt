Behind the Garage Lyrics
What would you like to talk about, then?
Since everything I say doesn't make sense
It's not 'cause what I did behind the garage
It's not just that, the reason I can't talk

How come it upsets you so?
Shouldn't it be me who feels uneased?
How come you first think of my health?
Trying to forget...

Everything that passes in my eyes
The second they close and I'm in my cold bed
"Keep your feet away from me," you said
Trying to close you out of my cold head

How come it upsets you so?
Shouldn't it be me who feels uneased?
How come you first think of my health?
Trying to forget...1Embed
