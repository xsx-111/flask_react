Anytime You Want LyricsBlind me, your eyes I wanna see
What is it you're gonna do to me?
Find me another place to stay
Are you ever gonna let me see your face?
Quietly, I'm lying still in the cold
I can feel the leather begin to hold me
'Til I can feel my arms
Any time you want
Any time you want
Any time you want
Any time you want
Any time you wantEmbed
