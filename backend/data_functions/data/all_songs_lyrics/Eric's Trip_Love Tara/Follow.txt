Follow Lyrics
You look at me
What do you want to see?
Is it in me you believe?
You want to see if you leave

Follow me back down
Follow me back down

I gotta know
Is it real
What you show?

Follow me back down
Follow me back down

See you want us to be
You gotta see
What I want to be
Fly away with me
I gotta see
What you want to be
She wants to see
What I think she believes

Follow me back down
Follow me back down
Follow me back down
Follow me back down

Follow me back down
Follow me back down
Follow me back down
Follow me back downEmbed
