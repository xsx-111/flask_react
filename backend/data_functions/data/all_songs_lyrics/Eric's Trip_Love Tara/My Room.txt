My Room Lyrics
These words mean very
Little to me
Don't use them if you
Don't have to

In my room
Feel too soon
I can't write
Stay the night

Do you understand?
TV seems so bland
I ate too much grease
Can't begin to sleep

In my room
Feel too soon
I can't write
Stay the night

In my room
Feel too soon
I can't write
Stay the nightEmbed
