Spring Lyrics
I want you
But I'm not sure if you'd still want me
If you knew the thoughts
And I'd like to tell you
But I know that if I tried to
I could never lie

I need to
Have it, though I know that I'm an asshole
And know you know I am
And I'd like you
To know there's nothing that I'd rather tell you
But I could never lie

You think it's all your fault
But I don't

I want you
But I'm not sure if you'd still want me
If you knew the thoughts
And I'd like to tell you
But I know that if I tried to
I could never lie
You think it's all your fault
But I don't
You think it's all your fault
But I won't
You think it's all your fault
But I don't
