Stove Lyrics
Used to wonder if you understood
The way I felt about the stove
At our friend Peter's house
I wished you'd slow it down
I thought you'd listen to me
I wish you'd try to stop and show me
That you could even slow it down a bit
At least for me

Used to wonder if you understood
The way I felt about the stove
At our friend Peter's house
I wish you'd leave me be
I thought you'd listen to me
I wish you'd try to stop and listen
There's other ways I could get it, you know
That, don't you?
You know that, don't you?Embed
