Secret for Julie Lyrics
You have a little secret
That you share with someone else
You say it was nothing or something
To talk about

It's true that we were broken up
You could do anything, and you did
But I know a little something
Block it out of my head

It seems like it's a little secret
Between you and her, that's all you say
If it was nothing, then how come
It's so wrong?

A wrongful act I will not forget
My love and heart are too strong to let
You out of my life for something gross
That's in the past

The past
Please tell me
Please help me
Get it together
You really hurt me
You make me feel like
It's all my fault
Don't go back again
Don't go back againEmbed
