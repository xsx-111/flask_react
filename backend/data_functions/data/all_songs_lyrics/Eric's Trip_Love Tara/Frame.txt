Frame Lyrics
It's your obsession, not mine
I'm not obsessed with the darker mind
Can't you let it go away?
And then come back to it another day?

Always feeling out of place
Can't keep up with the pace
Everything's changed
Nothing's gonna be the same again

It's my confusion, not yours
I'm just confused about the feelings of yours
They tear us apart, again and again
That's the way it has always been

Always feeling out of place
Can't keep up with the pace
Everything's changed
Nothing's gonna be the same again

Never again
I fell out of frame
Never again
I fell out of frame
Never again
I fell out of frame
Never againEmbed
