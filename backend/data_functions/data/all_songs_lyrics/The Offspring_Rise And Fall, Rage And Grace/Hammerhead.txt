Hammerhead Lyrics
Ow

I am the one, camouflage and guns
Risk my life to keep my people from harm
Authority vested in me
I sacrifice with my brothers in arms

Through this doorway, what's on the other side?
Never knowin' exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded, voices screaming "Let's go!"
Come on, do it, here we go!

(Oh) I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) I'll shut my eyes, it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
(Oh) I'll take a life ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) It's playing over and over in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows

Stay the course, reasonable force
I believe I serve a greater good
Smoke and dust, enemies are crushed
Nothing left where a man once stood
Through this doorway, what's on the other side?
Never knowin' exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded, voices screaming "Let's go!"
But, I'm just doing what I'm told

(Oh) I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) I'll shut my eyes, it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
(Oh) I'll take a life ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) It's playing over and over in my head
Where it begins and where it'll end, nobody knows


Hey, go!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
In my head, in my head
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil for thou art with me
Locked and loaded, gonna find my truth
Now, I'm busting through, all hell breaks loose, and-a
(Woo-hoo!) And, you can all hide behind your desks now
(Woo-hoo!) And, you can cry, "Teacher, come help me!"
(Woo-hoo!) Through you all, my aim is true
My

(Woo-hoo!)
(Woo-hoo!) My aim is true
(Woo-hoo!)
My aim is true2Embed
