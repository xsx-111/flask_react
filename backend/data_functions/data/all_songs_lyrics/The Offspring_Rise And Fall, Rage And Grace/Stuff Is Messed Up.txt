Stuff Is Messed Up Lyrics
Now, I don't know, and it's hard to explain
But it seems like things are just kind of insane
Because the world is crying, but nobody's listening
So, please leave a message on my cell phone
I see bullets getting better, biblical weather
And that guy on TV is, like, a total asshole
Who are you wearing tonight?
Celebrity fundraiser, tight
Black ties making wrongs right
How's your social Band-Aid?

I don't know much, I don't know too much
But I know this: shit is fucked up

I guess it's all about the dream
The ends justify the means
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
You know it's all about the dream
The ends justify the means

Now, thank God for the media for saving the day
Putting it all into perspective in a responsible way
With more celebrity news, typical bullshit views
I think we're losing this fight sponsored by Bud Light
And now, we're rocking the casbah and taking the flak
The genie's out of the bottle, and we can't put it back
All this stuff, it's overwhelming my brain
Can you see the storm coming? It's coming this way
I don't know much, I don't know too much
But I know this: shit is fucked up

I guess it's all about the dream
The ends justify the means
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
You know it's all about the dream
The ends justify the means
Justify the means

Shopping sprees, RPGs, ecstasy, atrophy
Genocide, Pimp My Ride, politize, euphemize
Injustice everywhere, apathy, I don't care
Hurricanes, climate change, huh
Therapy, I won't tell, rehab and LOL
Worldwide calamity, TV reality
Euthanize, supersize, death squads and boob jobs
And VIP infamy, gratify instantly

I don't know much, I don't know too much
I don't know much, I don't know too much
I guess it's all about the dream
The ends justify the means
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
You know it's all about the dream
The ends justify the means
The means, the means4Embed
