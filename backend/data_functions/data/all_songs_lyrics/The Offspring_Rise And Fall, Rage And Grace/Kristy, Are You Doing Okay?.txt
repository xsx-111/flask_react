Kristy, Are You Doing Okay? Lyrics
There's a moment in time, and it's stuck in my mind
Way back, when we were just kids
’Cause your eyes told the tale of an act of betrayal
I knew that somebody did

Oh, waves of time
Seem to wash away the scenes of our crimes
For you, this never ends

Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Though the marks on your dress had been neatly repressed
I knew that something was wrong
And I should've spoke out, and I'm so sorry now
I didn't know, ’cause we were so young

Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on innocence left behind
It never goes away
Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on innocence left behind
It never goes away
It never goes away

Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away2Embed
