Nothingtown Lyrics
Let's make this complicated
Thinking is overrated
We're busting out of this shitty little town, and
Green grass and colored lenses
Tear down these picket fences
Burn in our beds while the city lies sleeping

Why, oh, why
Are we starting up and going down?
And my, oh, my
Just the two of us in Nothingtown
Our superhero play
We'll leave this town today
Hold on tighter, with my lighter shining through

These city streets are burning
Rose red, your wheels are turning
Make me believe someday we could really leave, and
Blindfold a new direction
Stop asking better questions
Don't figure out that we're never getting out, and

Why, oh, why
Are we starting up and going down?
And my, oh, my
Just the two of us in Nothingtown
Our superhero play
We'll leave this town today
And I'll row it if you steer it
I'll yell until you hear it
Hold on tighter, with my lighter shining through
Why, oh, why
Are we starting up and going down?
And my, oh, my
Just the two of us in Nothingtown
Our superhero play
Our dreams get in the way
And I'll row it if you steer it
I'll yell until you hear it
Hold on tighter, with my lighter shining through

Still stuck in Nothingtown
Still stuck in Nothingtown
Come on, let's goEmbed
