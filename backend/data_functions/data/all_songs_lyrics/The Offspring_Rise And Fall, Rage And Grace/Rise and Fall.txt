Rise and Fall Lyrics
Ooh

This time, you're really dead
Once followed, but always led
You thought you'd rise above it all
It's all inside your head
All rippin' it up in shreds
I know someday, you’re gonna fall

And, I don't wanna say "I told you so"
But, I told you so
Now, you've lost control
And, I don't wanna be the rise and fall
Gimme more or nothin' at all

Mm

You're in an awful way
Sucked in by what you crave
They just can’t wait to see you crawl
And, you can only laugh
Give in to the other half
They're only tearin' down your walls
And, I don't wanna say "I told you so"
But, I told you so
Now, you've lost control
And, I don't wanna be the rise and fall
Gimme more or nothin' at all


They've come to see you rise and fall
They're only tearin' down your walls
They've come to see you rise and fall
And, I don't wanna say "You've lost control"

And, I don't wanna say "I told you so"
But, I told you so
Now, you've lost control
And, I don't wanna be the rise and fall
Gimme more or nothin' at allEmbed
