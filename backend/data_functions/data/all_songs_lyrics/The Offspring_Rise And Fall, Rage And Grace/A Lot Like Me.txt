A Lot Like Me Lyrics
How does it feel
When you have it all?
How can you live
With nothing at all?
Where do you run?
Where do you go?
The holes in your truth
Are starting to show

And the rain comes
And the world is on my head
Crave the sun
But I can't get out of bed

How can you take
Without giving back?
How does it work
When it's really cracked?

How does it feel?
(And no wonder hearts and minds have been won)
How does it feel?
(And I wonder how it's all come undone)

Want it, you got it, you're sorry you bought it, you're sliding
Want it, you got it, you're sorry you bought it, can't hide it
Tell me who do you see?
’Cause  you look a lot like me

How can you take
Without giving back?
Who do you see?
’Cause you look a lot like me

Want it, you got it, you're sorry you bought it, you're sliding
Want it, you got it, you're sorry you bought it, can't hide it
Want it, you got it, you're sorry you bought it, you're sliding
Want it, you got it, you're sorry you bought it, can't hide it



You look a lot like me, you look a lot
You look a lot like me 1Embed
