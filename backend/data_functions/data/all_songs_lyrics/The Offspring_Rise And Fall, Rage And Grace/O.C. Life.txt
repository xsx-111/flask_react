O.C. Life Lyrics
Want to be a member, want to be a name
Want to be a local face that plays the social games
Dancing through a time will bring you dinosaur trends
The limits of your mind is where the county line ends
Listen to the media present it all as fact
Following the lead ’cause you don't know how to act
Travel in a straight line ’cause you don't know your own way
They'll get you in the end before you know you have a say

This O.C. life is not the life for me
Insulated world, trade your happy thoughts
O.C. life is not the life so free
Oppression is for real
With artificial joys for you girls and boys

Want to be remembered, want to have some fame
Fighting to stay ahead is a part of the game
ATM and Starbucks, every corner are the norm
Environment so sterile, it'll get you to conform
714, wear it like a brand
Contaminated future has a biohazard scent
Fighting their rules, I don't see their way
Guess you're really in before you know you have a say
This O.C. life is not the life for me
Insulated world, with wide happy thoughts
O.C. life is not the life so free
Oppression is for real
With artificial joys for you girls and boys
