Takes Me Nowhere Lyrics
When the day begins, all the guilt sinks in
And, I look on the wreckage of the night
Though I try to break free, the cycle breaks me
Am I ever gonna see the light?
All the friends I've lost and the pain I've caused
Have never been enough just to make me stop
The lines I draw to look at myself
Are turning into somebody else

I know how this will end
But, I'm starting up again
Turned around, inside out
'Cause this way

Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
It beats me up
When I go there (I know I could start again)
When I go there (Oh no, here we go again)
Takes me nowhere (Oh no, here we go again)
It beats me up
Open on this scene, a familiar dream
Of you telling me what I already know
Though the truth seems near, you can't get there from here
But, you sure know where you're gonna go
As the rumor wind blows, my infamy grows
Seein' friends above and I hit another low
The picture I paint to look at myself
Is turning into somebody else

I know how this will end
But, I'm starting up again
Turned around, inside out
'Cause this way

Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
It beats me up
When I go there (I know I could start again)
When I go there (Oh no, here we go again)
Takes me nowhere (Oh no, here we go again)
It beats me up
Ah, ah

But, today, if I change
And stop digging my own grave
I will try to set things right
'Cause this way

Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
Takes me nowhere (I can't, can't see a way out)
It beats me up
When I go there (I know I could start again)
When I go there (Oh no, here we go again)
Takes me nowhere (Oh no, here we go again)
It beats me up
