Fix You Lyrics
She wakes up
Rage and grace
Pulling me closer, pushing away
And me, the sharpest thorn on your vine
Twisting and turning, we're all intertwined
Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, "You know
We'd all like to rearrange"

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me
Ha la la la

A beaming sunrise buries the night
The setting sun destroys the light
Then she says, "Baby, I've got to get going"
Cutting each other without even knowing
She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
All God's tears, for her they cry
And I am in her rain

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me

Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, "You know
We'd all like to rearrange"2Embed
