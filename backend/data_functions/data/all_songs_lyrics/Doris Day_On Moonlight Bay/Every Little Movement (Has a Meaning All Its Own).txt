Every Little Movement (Has a Meaning All Its Own) LyricsEvery little movement has a meaning on its own
Every thought and feeling by some posture can be shown
And every love thought that comes a-stealing o'er your being
Must be revealing all it's sweetness, in some appealing little gesture on its own
Every little movement has a meaning on its own
Mmmm
And every love thought that comes a-stealing o'er your being
Must be revealing all it's sweetness, in some appealing little gesture on its own
Every little movement has a meaning on its own
Every thought and feeling by some posture can be shown
And every love thought that comes a-stealing o'er your being
Must be revealing all it's sweetness, in some appealing little gesture on its own
And every love thought that comes a-stealing o'er your being
Must be revealing all it's sweetness, in some appealing little gesture on its ownEmbed
