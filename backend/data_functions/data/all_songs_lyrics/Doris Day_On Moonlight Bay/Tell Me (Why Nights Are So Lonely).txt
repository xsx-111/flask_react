Tell Me (Why Nights Are So Lonely) LyricsTell me why nights are lonesome
Tell my why days are blue
Tell me why all the sunshine
Comes just the one time when I’m with you
Why do I hate to go, dear?
And hate to say ‘goodbye’?
Now somehow it’s always so, dear
And if you know, dear, please tell me why?
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
La-da, la-la-da-de
Why do I hate to go, dear?
And hate to say ‘goodbye’?
Now somehow it’s always so, dear
And if you know, dear, please tell me why?Embed
