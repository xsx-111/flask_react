Tripmaker Lyrics
Way down in a cabin buried underground
In a place that's so far away
In a petrified cave that's made of stone
You'll find him workin' all alone
Takin' orange, green and white crystallized powders
Mixed in the colors of colorized vials
But now, you start to hear this bubblin' sound
The earth bein' shaken up from the ground

He's a trip, tripmaker makin' things
A trip, tripmaker just a-plannin' your dreams
A trip, tripmaker workin' night and day
A trip, tripmaker wanna see you pay
Say, watch out, watch out
He's comin' your way
Say, watch out, watch out
He's on the way

Well, he lives in the earth
Thirty meters away
I bet you couldnâ€™t find it
By night or day
A mighty small planet
Filled with hangin', green moss
A thousand signs sayin' "Stay Away"
A ton of cars stolen found buried this way
He's a trip, tripmaker makin' things
A trip, tripmaker just a-plannin' your dreams
A trip, tripmaker workin' night and day
A trip, tripmaker just to see you pay
Say, watch out, watch out
He's comin' your way
Say, watch out, watch out
He's on the way


He comes out late at night
When the moon shine down a bright eerie light
All dressed up in a hat
A white collared shirt
Gotta step in white
A polka dot tie
Been searchin' for your dollar now, night and day
Got a lot of good things you wanna try

He's a trip, tripmaker makin' things
A trip, tripmaker just a-plannin' your dreams
A trip, tripmaker workin' night and day
A trip, tripmaker just to see you pay
Say, watch out, watch out
He's comin' your way
Say, watch out, watch out
He's on the way
Say, watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch outEmbed
