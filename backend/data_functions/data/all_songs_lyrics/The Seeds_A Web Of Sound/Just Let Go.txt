Just Let Go LyricsCome on, girl, away with me
A man with films with beautiful dreams
I'll make you so high, so high that you seem
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a let yourself go
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a follow me
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a follow me
Forget your 9 to 5s of misery
I said come on come on, I'll set you free
I said come on come on, I'll set you free
I said come on girl, I'll set you free
I said, if you want, I'll haunt your door
I'll make you itch like never before
I'll get your image up there on the wall
I'm gonna make of me
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a just let go
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a set yourself free
I said come on baby, a love you can't see
I said I would you some happy years
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a set yourself free
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a run with me
I said comе on, such a beautiful thing, some light
I'll make you feel so good that your troublеs subside
I said come on baby can't you see with me
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a set yourself free
I said come on come on, come on with me
I'm gonna give you a coffee ride
I'll make you feel so good, so good inside
We'll fly so high, a thous' above
I know you're gonna be a spinning love
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a just let go
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a set you free
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a run with me
I'm gonna make you feel so happy
I said come on baby, run with me
I said come on baby, run with me
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a just let go
I said-a, just-a, just-a, just-a set you free
I've seen many lands of beautiful dreams
I'll pick the flowers that are everywhere
So I'll take you the magic, a land of no cares
So come on girl, so run with me
I said just set your troubles down, a worrying lie
Everybody tries so hard it seems
If you let yourself be free
I'm gonna end all your misery
I said come on come on a-run with me
I said come on come on a-run with me
I'm just like a train coming down the track
But don't you go and don't never look back
A whistle, a-blowin', I said, night and day
A bright light shining just to take you away
I'll hear you scream out in the middle of the night
I'll make you feel, feel all right
Said, A whistle, a-blowin' night and day
I'm gonna take you, take you away
I said, wooooooooo, wooooooo
Going to get you, gonna get you, I'm coming now
Dont' you hear I'm coming now
Gonna take your plans to a land of dreams
I'm gonna make this good, good it seems
Said I'm going down there, going to take you a way
Sayin' wooooooooo, wooooooo
