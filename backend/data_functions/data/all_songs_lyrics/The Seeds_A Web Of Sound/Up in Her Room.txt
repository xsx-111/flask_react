Up in Her Room LyricsUp in her room
Said I feel so good
Up in her room
She said she'd love me, she would
Out on the street
She's everybody's girl
Up in her room
Set my head awhirl
Up in her room
Say the way she walks
Up in her room
Just the way she talks
Up in her room
Smell the incense burn
Up in her room
Said I'm willing to learn
She got the soft skin
Soft like skin
Make me feel
Good within
She's got the kind of body
I idolize
I justa wanna lie
Here by your side
Up in her room
Going up in her room
Up in her room
Tear me up in her room
Mmmmmmmmmmm!
Mmmmmmmmmmm!
Mmmmmmmmmmm!
Mmmmmmmmmmm!
Up in her room
Said the way she talks
Up in her room
She's in a trance
Up in her room
Looking out her window
Up in her room
Staring at the clouds
Up in her room
Going up in her room
Up in her room
Say you love her room
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Up in her room
Said I'm two stories high
Up in her room
Climb into the sky
Up in her room
Said she's so bad
Up in her room
Said she's so bad
Up in her room
Saw a cloud of smoke
Up in her room
There's a cloud of smoke
She's got the softest hair
Red like minks
She makes me feel
So good inside
She's got the kind of body
I idolize
She says she wants to be
My devils child
Up in her room
Going up in her room
Up in her room
Said I cried for good
There's somebody knockin' on my door
But I don't care
I care no more
I said I just want to stay here
Lyin' in bed
I just wanna ease
My achin' head
Cause she love me baby
Night and day
She make me feel
Feel okay
Say Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
Come here baby
Walk to me
Come here baby
And talk to me
Said I got to have her present
In my hand
Going to give it
Give it to you
Said Aah! Aah!
It feels so good
Say you feel so good
Say you feel so good
You feel so good
Feel so good
Feel so good
I just found another cigarette
On the floor
Come on darling
And dream some more
Say I wanna see your all
Your beautiful dreams
Take me to lands
That I've never seen
Said Aah! Aah!
Inside my mind
Inside my mind
Inside my mind
Come on baby
Get on my
Camel ride
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Into the sea
Ride pleasure
Ride with me
Into your black
Pleasantry
Come on baby
Hold me now
All night!
All night!
Tonight! Tonight!

Justa let me love you
Baby think on

Said the way you walk
Makes me feel so good
Said the way you talk

Said I got the Lovin' just for you
