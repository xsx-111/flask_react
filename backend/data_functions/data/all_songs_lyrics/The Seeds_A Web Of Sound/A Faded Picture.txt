A Faded Picture LyricsOh, I want to go back
See my baby's face
Oh, I want to go back
To my happy place
That disappeared from view
Such a long, long time ago
It's a faded picture
Hanging on my wall
It's a faded picture
Isn't there at all
It's only there
When I closed my eyes
And started to cry
Over you
It's a faded picture
I can see it
Through colored tears
It's a faded picture
Bringing back
My lost years
It's only there
On rainy days
When tears have dried
And rainbows started to appear
Oh, I want to go back
When I was six years old
Just lying in the grass
Seeing all the clouds
Building castles in the sky
See all the animals go round
And hear music coming
From a merry-go-round
But it's a faded picture
Fade away on me
So hard to see
It's a faded picture
A picture of my childhood
A faded a picture
I'd go back if I could
It's only there
When I hear children laugh
Sit and play
On a bright sunny day
All so gay
It's a faded picture
So hard to see
When you're cryin'
It's hard to see
So hard to see
Just like a painting
This feeling is falling
My heart's buried
Right in the ground
A masterpiece
Of hearts that've gone
Lost for all time
Gone from me
My faded picture
So hard, so hard
So hard to see
My faded picture
Fade away from me
I couldn't bring it back
If I had tried
I couldn't bring it back
If I'd died
My faded pictures
Fade away
On me
So hard, so hard
So hard, so hard
To see my faded picture
Fade away on meEmbed
