Mr. Farmer Lyrics
See the farmer on the other side of town
He's always workin' hard 'til the sun goes down
He's up every mornin' right on five
A-wantin' green seeds just to come alive
But he don't wear no farm clothes
He's always usin' a rake and hoe
But his seeds are startin' to grow
Like a big stalk up through the sky

He used to live in an apartment in a big old city
With thick and priestly windows built right in
But he decided to move to a little tiny town
He wanna be a farmer for all year round
And on a country road where you can't see a thing
He's got five acres filled with little green things
He said he's workin' so hard all night and day

Mr. Farmer, let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me harvest your crops
I wanna have a dream come true
I said a farmer, farmer, farmer
I wanna be just like you

See the farmer a-walkin' downtown
Always draws a crowd when he's around
He's always wearin' seedy clothes
He shows them off wherever he goes
You can spot him anywhere
Got a bright pink thumb but he don't care
I said, he looks like something from a very bad dream

Mr. Farmer, let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me harvest your crops
Mr. Farmer, let me save your crops
I said, a farmer, farmer, farmer, farmer, farmerEmbed
