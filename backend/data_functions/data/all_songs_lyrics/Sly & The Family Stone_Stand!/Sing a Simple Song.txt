Sing a Simple Song LyricsSing a simple song!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' in my sleep
I'm walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin' in the street
Time is passin', I grow older, things are happening fast
All I have to hold on to is a simple song at last
Let me hear you say...

Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya
Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya

Sing a simple song
Try a little do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do
Do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do
Do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm livin', livin', livin' life with all its ups and downs
I'm givin', givin', givin' love and smiling at the frowns
You're in trouble when you find it's hard for you to smile
A simple song might make it better for a little while
Let me hear you say...
Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya
Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin'
I'm walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
I'm livin', livin', livin' love
I'm livin' lovin' know about lovin'
Everybody sing together

Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya
Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya
Sing it in the shower
Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya
Sing it every hour, sing it
Sing it, sing it, sing it
Sing it with your mama, sing it
Sing it mama, got it sing it
Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa ya
Sing it with your papa, sing it
Sing it papa, got it sing it
Yaaaaa, ya-ya yaa yaEmbed
