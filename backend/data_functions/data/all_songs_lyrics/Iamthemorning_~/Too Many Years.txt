Too Many Years LyricsI won't try
To feed the desires
To reveal that lies
Is all what's left of life
I won't try
To feed all the lies
To feel what lies
Beyond the eyes
Your cries and your laughter
Forever after
Too many years of broken bones
The humankind went through, and still
We keep fighting, and fighting, and fighting around
All the things that won't make us feel
Silence lies
In breeding desires
In feeding the lies
With all what's left of life
Since the time
That I saw the shining
Shivered in shallow water
All hasn't changed as expected
I still feel neglected
You don't recess
All the meaningless things you possess
All your books and your letters
The candles and dresses -
Those things that surround yourself
But then it comes:
It's neither dark, nor dawn
Like loved one's ashes I am free
I'm almost gone
And then I fly
And then I fall...
Like a bird, free
Like a bird, free...Embed
