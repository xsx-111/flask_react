Libretto Horror LyricsI felt the darkness, nothing else
Am I in hell?
Can you see me?
I am here
Air breathed and played over my face
I felt the shapes
I can't see
Why can't I see?
I don't know what to do
Where to go
I'm falling into void of afterglow
So help me, I can't breathe, I can't see
So tell me, will you stay here with me?
I feel so small
Beating the wall
Hopeless you can stay forever
No you wouldn't
No you can't
