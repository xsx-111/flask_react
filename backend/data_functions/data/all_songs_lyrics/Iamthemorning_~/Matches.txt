Matches LyricsI learn from sounds of silence in me that I hear
That I only hear
I learn these sounds of silence in me that I hear
That I only hear
But I will never
I will never
So off you go into silence, the season of fear
And all what is real
The silence breaks with a crack that I don't want to hear
It's making it real
So off you go
For all I know
You'll never come back into your empty home
So say goodbye, the shadows mild
I will sing you a lullaby
Silent fever
All the words they deliver not even
Silent fever
All the truth they deliver not even
You're drowning in water, 'cause you never bothered to learn how to swim
If you are the one never bothered, then how does you drowning affect me?
Your house is on fire, 'cause you were annoying, and I dropped the match in
Your house is on fire, 'cause you were annoying, and I dropped the match in
Silent fever
All the words they deliver, not even
Silent fever
All the truth they deliver, not evenEmbed
