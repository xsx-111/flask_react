Lighthouse LyricsLight has never shown you the way out this place
But I have came here to take you away
And after we go down
To the ground
Bury your sorrows down
In the ground
No one ever wanders
This world is full of wonders
And I'm the one to let them know
They will not listen though
Voice is getting thinner now
Will I survive, please tell me how
Shall I began to save the rest
When will I finally rest?
Storm year is coming
But I'm not coming home
Storm year is coming
I'm on my own
And all of the sudden there is nowhere to go
No one to follow when you're on your own
Air has turned to liquid
I swim across the crimson sea
My hands and legs done into fists
If so then why do I sink?
And all of a sudden there is nowhere to go
No one to follow when you're on your own
Only the waves crashing down on the shore
So slow
Soon though your pain bring you back to your home
You will know
And all of a sudden there is nowhere to go
No one to follow when you're on your own
Only the waves crashing down on the shore
So slow
Soon though your pain bring you back to your home
You will know
You're on your own in this
You're on your own in this
You're on your own in this worldEmbed
