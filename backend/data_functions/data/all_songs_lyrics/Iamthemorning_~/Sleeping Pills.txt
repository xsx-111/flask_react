Sleeping Pills LyricsNight
Cover my heart
Cover my dreams
Sweet sleeping pills
Night
Beautiful art
Following dreams
Easy it seems
Days
Pass in decay
Waiting for night
Waving goodbye
Soar
Torn from my throat
Hear how I scream
Disembodied spirit
We are sleeping
Dreams are soothing
Night will hide us
Time of wonders
Night will make us
Stronger, sleep
We are waiting
Go to sleepEmbed
