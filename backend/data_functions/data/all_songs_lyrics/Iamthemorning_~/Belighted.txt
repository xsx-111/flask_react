Belighted LyricsWhite light slowly becoming me
I can barely feel what i feel
White light on my skin
My jorney begins with
Dissolving in the air
But I don't even care
All that story will break your heart
Do not care
Do not break
All that story will break your heart
But you don't care
You're not scared
