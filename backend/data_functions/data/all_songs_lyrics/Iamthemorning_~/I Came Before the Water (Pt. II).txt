I Came Before the Water (Pt. II) LyricsI came before
All the waters washing over empty shore
I escaped it all
All the prisoner cells and still I ask for more
Stones lay cold and sharp
Under my aching bare feet
And so walking into water
I accept my final defeat
I wait to see
If the waters will at last devour me
As if the sea
Can decide if I live or die instead of me
Stones lay cold and sharp
Under my aching bare feet
And so walking into water
I accept my final defeatEmbed
