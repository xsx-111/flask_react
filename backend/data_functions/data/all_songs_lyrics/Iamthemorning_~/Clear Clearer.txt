Clear Clearer LyricsTime to backtrack
And never go to making
Time to shut your eyes

"All fears are figments" -
This is what they try to bring me
I won't shut my eyes
What you think you see
Never was real
This proves rumours shallow:
Pills I've got to swallow
Never made my life
Of the water I was born
And into water I'll be gone
Sea becoming me
What you think you see
Never was real
/you expect it/Embed
