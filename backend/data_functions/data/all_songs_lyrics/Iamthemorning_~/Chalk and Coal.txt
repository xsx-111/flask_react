Chalk and Coal LyricsSo
I am led to the choice
How many hours and hours will I sacrifice
To find out this was all a lie
I have never been fine
Of all the iincurable suffering
They only offer
Some pills that would make me sick
No
Not again
Not again
Not again
I'm living inside my head
I'm living inside this hell
Mess
My name's emptiness
And I'm turning bitter and sour
With each passing hour
Until nothing's left of me
And though you see
I'm not meant to be
Until I'm deceased
This won't set me at ease
I am rotten inside
I'm not pure
No
Not again
Not again
Not again
You're not getting anywhere like thisEmbed
