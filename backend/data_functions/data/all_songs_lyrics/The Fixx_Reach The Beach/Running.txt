Running LyricsI only wanted the truth, looking into
No more feelings of doubt
Then someone showed me the root of all evil
When all the lights were out
Shallow sleep, just leaning
Am I leaving the game?
I must be dreaming lots of undercover
Dreams are always the same
When the nights close in
When the nights close . . 
Well it's another night I waste at the opera
With a permanent friend
I should have taken direction much sooner
Another night in the air
If the lights came on
If the lights came on
I'd switch myself, with someone else
Then I'd shake myself
Things start to happen when I . . 
Things start to happen when . . 
Things start . . 
Oh, I can see myself running
But I'm standing still
And I can hear myself screaming
But there's no sound
When I wake up crying life brings me down
But it's not worth losing, until it's found
Oh, I can see my way home, home
I close my eyes and I'm back by the ocean
My hair feels wet
I'm on the brink of a lifelong ambition
Whatever dream comes next
I'm the seat of a hearse and guess who's driving?
I'm with you all the way
I hear the step of a fool, who's coming
All night, never day
Then the lights came on
Then the lights came on
I switch myself
With someone else
Then I shake myself
Things start to happen when I . . 
Things start to happen when . . 
Things start . . 
I can see myself running
But I'm standing still
I can hear myself screaming
But there's no sound
When I wake up crying life brings me down
No it's not worth losing, until it's found
Oh, I can see my way home
I'm at a house, all the windows are broken
It's where I once used to live
I must be losing all my undercover
Dreaming always the same
I can see myself running
. . . Still
. . . See myself running
I switch myself
. . . Running (repeat)Embed
