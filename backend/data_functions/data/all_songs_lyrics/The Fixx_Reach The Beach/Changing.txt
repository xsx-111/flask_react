Changing LyricsChased by fools in a world of their own
Pushing aside oil the signs that inspire
Avoiding the art, to create a new issue
Someone with handcuffs who's chained to the past
If I'm changing then I'm changing
Take off your mask there's no place in my desk file
For someone who reasons - regardless of new styles
Settled on a handshake, my first mistake
It's my life and I say
What for this, this what for?
I don't need those looks so pick your face off the floor
Justice may prove we should wait not provoke
To entertain must we stick to the rules?
If I'm changing oh won't you please let go
Trapped by rules in a world that could breathe
Choking the spark, that creates -- am I signing a new lease?
Ask yourself why before raising dead issues
You are someone who's lost touch and died in the clasp
I settled for a handshake, my first mistake
It's my life and I say
What for this, this what for
I don't need those looks so pick your face off the floor
Justice may say we should wait not provoke
To entertain must we stick to the rules?
If I'm changing oh won't you please let go (repeat)Embed
