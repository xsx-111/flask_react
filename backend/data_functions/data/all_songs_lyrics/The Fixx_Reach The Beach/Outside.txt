Outside LyricsOutside, I stretch the mind that hides within
New pride, I lose four walls that keep me tied
Outside, I breathe new air that reaches me
Fresh tide, does all the cleansing life can give
Tongue-tied, no words will match this point of view
Chastise, I don't belong as no one owns
Washing, flowing, taking all my fears away
Rushing, blowing, touching, gives all life a grace
Washing, flowing, taking all my fears away
Outside
Outside, I stretch the mind that hides within
New pride, I lose four walls that keep me tied
Washing, flowing, taking all these fears away
Rushing, blowing, touching, gives my life a grace
Washing, flowing, taking all these fears away
