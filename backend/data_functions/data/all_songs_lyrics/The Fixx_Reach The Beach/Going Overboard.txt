Going Overboard LyricsSo it's flotsam and jetsam
You leave the ship
Sinking slowly
When you do the plank
But it's a bridge talk for deathtrap
So aquanautic
But I'm anchored, electric
Release the jib
CHORUS
I'm going overboard
Over the side
I'm going overboard
Over the side
When the Bombay sets sail
On a coconut float
Drifting so aimlessly
When the engine chokes
Devoted, alerted
You thank my pipeline
When the coast guard has a safeguard
Reveals the twist
CHORUS
There's one thing for sure
True love in the tide
I'm going overboard
Slipping
You got a party on a poop deck
Live under the flag
I got a cocktail and I'm full sail
Completes the trip
You take your life into your own hands
You do your party piece
I took my life into my own hands
I left that ship
CHORUS
There's one thing for sure
Over the side
I fell in love with an oar
True love in the tideEmbed
