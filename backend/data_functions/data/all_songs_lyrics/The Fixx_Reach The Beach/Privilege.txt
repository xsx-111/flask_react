Privilege LyricsSo correct me if I'm wrong though a day's twenty four hours long
How come you feel unwired and disconnected
Draw attention to yourself is your life a living hell?
Change your act, re-write the script the way you planned it
Radio news reports
Truth and fact distorts
And the world's majority is understated
If the views are on your mind
It's the wavelength you must find
Be prepared to hold your weight
Huh! Hah!
Privilege you have the right
If you're on the frequency
If you're on the frequency
So when you say that
There's always something else to do
There must be one thing you can try
There's always something else to do
When a week has just three days
It's the young that always pay
But who keeps the cold at bay with understanding
If there's a dying urge inside
To release forgotten pride
Don't rely on words of gloom
Don't be disjointed
Privilege you have the right
If you're on the frequency
If you're on the frequency
So when you say that
There's always something else to do
There must be one thing we can try
There's always something else to do
Heretic the witch was right
She had the frequency
She has the potency
Energy the time is right
To fight for decency
Privilege you have the right
If you're on the frequency
If you're on the frequency
So when you say that
There's never anything to do
There must be one thing you can try
There's always something else to do
How?
How I begin, Tell me how, How?
I tune in, Tell me how, How?
When do I tune in for now?
Draw attention to yourself
Are you tuned into the show?
She had the frequency
She has the potency...Embed
