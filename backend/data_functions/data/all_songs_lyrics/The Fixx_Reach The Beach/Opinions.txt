Opinions LyricsWatching, waiting playing who's who
Don't play to win to be second to you
The door will open when I suffer enough
Who will hold this hand when the going gets rough?
Such good intentions always nipped in the bud
What do you expect? Well, you never could
If I stop laughing just to be at your door
Always opinions turning you round
Always opinions turning you down
I don't play chess but I could play with you
Not much impressed not who do you do
I saw it coming you saw it his way
Always opinions turning you round
Always opinions turning you down
Never decisions letting me know
Always conditions turning you round
I want you to draw the line
Why can't you make up your mind?
I know about you but what about me?
Excuses all the time
Blew away with 'high insight'
No more good advice so what about me?
I'm playing who's who
Who would have thought this would turn into fact
The door's wide open you have lost your act
I saw it coming you saw it his way
Always opinions turning you round
Always opinions turning you down
Nesen decisions letting me know
So now you've taken over
Always conditions turning you round
I'm playing who's who
I'm playing who's whoEmbed
