Liner LyricsLiner, it was a fantasy sea cruise
It was a bet destined to lose
Across the waves, what was he thinking?
Sea shore, he had a wet foot in the sand
He was holding U.N. plans
Across the waves. what was he thinking?
All aboard before the storm
They've never seer a place like this before
Island in a forgotten latitude
And with colonial attitude
They took the chance for repossession
Grey skies there were no palm trees in the wind
And when a saint starts hiding sins
It's all aboard whilst peace is sinking
All aboard before the storm
Crossing swords before the dawn
Seen before, back in an infant's dream
Like a rubber duck, floating in the bath
So I sailed away on their time, Liner!
Taking young lives in their prime, Liner!
Harbour, I saw a flag waving goodbye
I saw a soldier's baby cry
What's it all for, that's what I'm thinking
Inside, I must he lacking true insight
Because I always sleep at night
Across the waves whilst men are . . 
All aboard before the storm
Crossing swords before the dawn
Seen before back in an infant's dream
Like a rubber duck, floating in the bath
So I sailed away on their time, Liner!
Taking young lives in their prime, Liner!
Liner! To a distant shore
All aboard before the stormEmbed
