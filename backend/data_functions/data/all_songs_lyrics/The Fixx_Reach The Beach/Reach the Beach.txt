Reach the Beach LyricsPassing time has no surprise
When pleasure found is my resource
Should I lose my lover's eyes
Then secrecy will hide my course
Forgotten lies aim to distract me
This mono mind must not connect
Purer nature will contain me
Free fall in air I will surpass
When I'm falling, calling, I return
Floating closer to your shore
I start to drift with the tide
Maybe I'll reach, I'll reach the beach
My heart is sealed watertight
Maybe I'll reach. I'll reach the beach
When in your eyes I see the sign
A teasing passion for a desperate man
Should I lose my lover's eyes
Then secrecy will hide my course
When I'm feeling too sure, then I drown
Floating closer to your shore
I start to drift with the tide
Maybe I'll reach, I'll reach the beach
My heart is sealed watertight
Maybe I'll reach, I'll reach the beachEmbed
