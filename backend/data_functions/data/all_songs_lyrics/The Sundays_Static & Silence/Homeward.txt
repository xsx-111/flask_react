Homeward Lyrics
You've stolen my heart and I want you to remember
Now what'll I do? living alone
You've stolen my heart and it hurts me to remember
Now where'll I go to? living alone

And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath

As night falls I hear voices on the radio
(ooh) I'll follow their dreams
And wake up alone

And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath
So now still burning silently away
A storm without the thunderEmbed
