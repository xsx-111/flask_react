Monochrome Lyrics
It's 4 in the morning July of '69
Me and my sister
We crept down like shadows
They're bringing the moon right down to our sitting-room
Static and silence and a monochrome vision

They're dancing around
Slow puppets silver ground
And the world was watching with joy
We hear a voice from above and it's history
And we stayed awake all night

And something is said and the whole room laughs aloud
Me and my sister
Looking on like shadows
The end of an age as we watched them walk in a glow
Lost in space, but I don't know where it is

They're dancing around
Slow puppets silver ground
And the stars and stripes in the sand
We hear a voice from above and it's history
And we stayed awake all night

They're dancing around
It sends a shiver down my spine
And I run to look in the sky and
I half expect to hear them asking to come down
(oh) Will they fly or will they fall?
To be excited by a long late nightEmbed
