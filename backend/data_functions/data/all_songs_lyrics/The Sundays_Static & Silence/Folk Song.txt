Folk Song Lyrics
Summer sky and a throat bone dry
And all the fields are all gold
Dusty lane with a song in my brain
And it stoned me to my soul

I climb higher move towards the fire
Blaze sun

Silver trees and a whispering breeze
Are my sight and my sound
The thought of heaven couldn't drag me from the path
When i'm wandering here alone

I climb higher move towards the fire
So blaze sun

Watch until it dies slow falling from the sky
Plae fading sunEmbed
