Cry Lyrics
And I'm standing on a platform
Now I'm staring from a train
And all the trees roll back beside but I'm so oblivious
To the dark to the light
It's all the same

You gave me so much
And now it's of the earth

And it makes me cry
It can makes me cry

And you're standing here beside me
In a picture in a frame
And your voice could never fade it's so familiar
Things you said in my head
Every day

You gave me so much
And now it's of the earth
And it makes me cry
It can makes me cry


You're with me so much
Through you're never with me anymore

And it makes me cry
It can make me cryEmbed
