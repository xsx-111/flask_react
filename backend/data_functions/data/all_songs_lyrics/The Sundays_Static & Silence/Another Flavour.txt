Another Flavour Lyrics
Fashion - the timing's all wrong
They taste another flavour
And pretty soon you're gone
Fashion - this time it's too late
You knew you'd have to pay for this one day

He loves me now - he loves me not-
He loves me once again
Usual story, another surprise

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Fashion - this time it's alright
They tickle you with a feather
They tell you you're sublime
Turn on - to each their own
Usual story, another surprise

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Fashion - the timing was wrong
Your friends are fair weather
You knew it all along
Turn on - to each their own
It's doing my mind in another surprise
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh ooh ooh yeah

Don't let them black you out for the evening
Sad-happy sufferer no no no
Don't let them crack you
Try not to feel it
As long as they're watching your show this timeEmbed
