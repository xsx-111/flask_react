Downtown Train Lyrics
Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now?
Can't you hear me now?

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely, now

I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four-way
You watch 'em as they fall
Oh baby, they all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
Where every night, every night is just the same
Oh baby
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
All of my dreams just fall like rain
Oh, baby, on a downtown train


Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
Where every night, every night is just the same
Oh baby
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train?
All of my dreams just fall like rain
Oh, on a downtown train
Oh, on a downtown train
Oh, on a downtown train
Oh, on a downtown train
Downtown trainEmbed
