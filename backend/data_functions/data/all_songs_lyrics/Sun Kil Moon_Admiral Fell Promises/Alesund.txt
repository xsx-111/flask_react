Alesund LyricsNo this is not my guitar
I'm bringing it to a friend
And no I don't sing
I'm only humming along
Up here in the air
I'm just mumbling at the clouds
Wanting to be known
While I pass the lonely hours
I came down from the room
I saw you in the rain
Laughing with some people
Hair dripping down your face
Your calm hypnotic eyes
The Scandinavian glow
I felt them like a flame
Candle in my cold bones
Tonight you were my muse
As I belted and I strummed
Trying not to drown
In the helicopter drone
Ålesund
Ålesund
From the crowd I heard
You sing a pretty line
Was it: "there's so much love -
That I wanna cry"
I thought about it long
Had you repeat it in my ear
I couldn't place it though
But Lord, you being so close
I should've played it then
From the intro to the end
When they offered me the stage
At the bar we landed in
But I turned and walked
Away from all the fun
And back into the black
Seaside night of Ålesund
Ålesund
Ålesund
Ålesund
