You Are My Sun LyricsYou are my light, dark cities
You fill the loss of the day
You are my love, radiant and pretty overseas
You find ways of bringing hope
The lonely hours, the gloom of night
Empty mornings
You are a stem of wild flowers
Rolling hills around the bay
You are a gap in the meadow
Soaring low in this way
You are my friend in the shadows
There to bring when I need
You are the suites of the cellos
There to mend if I bleed
You are a swing, sleepy porches
The warm light on my face
You are a charge of wild horses
You are the sun, you are my sun
Seeping over, spilling out
Over the mountains, you are my sun
Leona, Leona, Leona
Leona, Leona, Leona
Your fingers breathe with grace and ease
A gentle wave of guitars playing
Leona, Leona, Leona
Leona, Leona, Leona
Does sense of stares, light as air
Verses sound everywhere
Leona, Leona, LeonaEmbed
