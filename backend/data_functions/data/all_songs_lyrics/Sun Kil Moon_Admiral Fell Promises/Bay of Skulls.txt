Bay of Skulls LyricsHad I known, had I been warned
The hawks will hover, buzzards swarm
The rattlers strike, scorpions sting
Their tiny drops can slay a king
You have told so many lies
Said them right into my eyes
Used your powers to hurt them
Crashed into your open sun
The Bay of Skulls have found you
The Bay of Skulls have found you
The moon has settled for the night
The days pass faster than I'd like
For I have traveled many miles
Have been met with many smiles
And every April, gray winged doves
Build their nests and guard their young
From my garden window view
Hear their early morning cooEmbed
