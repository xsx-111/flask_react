The Leaning Tree LyricsScattered relics of your love
Just lying around your dusty room
Bearing old souls, old men, old scars
Dissonant wallow of guitars
Burning off Indian sun
On the water barges hung
Through the bay window panes
Covers, magnify, and brings
Sleepy poet's perfect dream
Pastel homes along the sea
This I would, this I will
Leave to join you in the hills
For you I would, for you I will
Leave this for the auburn hills
Find your old peeling house
Find you out there
Hear the owl call from the trees
Smell the midnight forest breeze
Shield you from this dark and night
Wake you in the morning
You came to me in a dream
Walking down the path by the cold, icy stream
The white of the snow coating the past
In the Sierra wintertime you disappeared
You left me alone in the old master room in my mountain home
And I called for you so many times
And longed for one more day with you in my life
I longed for one more day with you in my life
I see you there in my dreams
Your poise is perfect, balanced statuesque queen
Your beautiful hair, your ocean blue eyes
You bear the depths of your loss inside
And I begged of you so many times
Forgive me once and for all for all of my lies
To forgive me once and for all for all of my lies
Oh mommy, the leaning tree like a diamond
As we pass the long dead grass, thirsty in the sun
Memories rest beyond the broken fence, let their spirits be
The birds have left their mother's nest on the roses' thorns
There they swing over the bleach-white grain, sprawled over the hillEmbed
