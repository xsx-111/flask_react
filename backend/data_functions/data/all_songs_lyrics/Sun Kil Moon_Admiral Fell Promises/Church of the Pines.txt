Church of the Pines LyricsSpring, spring, flowers blossom and bloom
Squirrel, squirrel, jump down onto my roof
Sparrow, cardinal, hummingbird
Redwood, holly tree, juniper
The service moves slowly through the hills
Faint sound of the highway
Night sets on the church of pines
Ending the day, they laid down to rest
From my room, I look at the street
And see the youths passing along
While I unwind, head in a song
And in my bed, I play the guitar
I loosen the strings 'til I find a tone
And if it don't come then I put it down
Howl, howl, dogs of the neighborhood
Moon glow, over the gravestones
Dense vines, strangle the black oaks
The lamp light, the fallen fence posts
The sun rises over the tree line
With welcoming morning light
Day sets on the church of pines
One day we'll all be laid to rest
From the hills I look up at stars
And feel the darkness swell like a bruise
And in my head, I'm playing with words
I scramble and strain to find the right ones
Sometimes there are none
Sometimes they don't comeEmbed
