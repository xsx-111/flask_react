Australian Winter LyricsUp through the ashes you rose
Leaving her forever purer than before
All of her goodness enclosed
With an ever-burning red volcanic glow
From your honest eyes, I stole
And I've forsaken you, and I amount to nothing
Still up these rivers we'll row
Far away along, fish in flow forever
I fly around the earth
Fluttering along, humming like a swallow
I sing their long eyes to sleep
But their applause leaves me blank and hollow
The ocean beneath me is loneliness
The cities all are one, repeating and repeating
The haunted rustling of leaves screeching across the porch
Raindrops pluck the windows
I pull myself underneath
Her warm soft blankets
This Australian winterEmbed
