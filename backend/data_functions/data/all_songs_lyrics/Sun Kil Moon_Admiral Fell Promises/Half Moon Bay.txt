Half Moon Bay LyricsThe saddest eyes she wore
So longing and forlorn
That made me love you more and more
The bluest heart she owns
As she gets more and more alone
As the deepest cello drones
The oldest yard-cat sings
Her mournful bellowing
From branches in the trees
The stillest star shines red
With them bringing havoc and death
Upon the land they'll sweep
The painful midnight cries
When one leaves a world behind
Leaves a world be, leaves a world behind
And here in Half Moon Bay
Hear the hum of the highway
Hum of the high, hum of the highway
Highway 1
Grey clouds, muted sun
Down by the footbridge stream
I am walking in a dream
Wailing in my dreams
Cuz winter-time was through
I could not be there for you
I couldn't care for you
And hear the traffic come
Down the old Highway 1
Down the Devil's Slide it runs
And nothing clears these stains
Not the January rains
Rising in the stream
Down by the bay-leaf tree
Our lonely bird eyes meet
Lonely bird eyes, lonely bird eyes meet
Under the blue moonbeams
I am wandering in my dream
Walking in my, wandering in a dream
Highway 1
Grey clouds, muted sun
Highway 1
Grey clouds, muted sunEmbed
