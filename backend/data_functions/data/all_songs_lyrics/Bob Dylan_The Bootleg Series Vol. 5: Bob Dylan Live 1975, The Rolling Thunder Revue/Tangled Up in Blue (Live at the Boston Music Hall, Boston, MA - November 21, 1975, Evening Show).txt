Tangled Up in Blue (Live at the Boston Music Hall, Boston, MA - November 21, 1975, Evening Show) Lyrics
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
She was lying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on his shoes
Heading out for the Old East Coast
Lord knows he's paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when they first met
Soon to be divorced
He helped her out of a jam, I guess
But he used a little too much force
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out West
Splitting up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walkin' away
Sayin' over her shoulder
"We'll meet on another day, on the avenue"
Tangled up in blue
He had a job in Santa Fe
Workin' in an old hotel
But he never did like it all that much
And one day it just went to Hell
So he drifted down to New Orleans
Lucky enough to be destroyed
Well he got him a job on a fishing boat
Docked right outside of Delacroix
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind
And he just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, right beside my chair
Said "Don't tell me, lemme guess your name"
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
Must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoes
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started in the dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it all came crashing down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going on back again
I got to get to them somehow
All the faces we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are truck drivers' wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue
Thank youEmbed
