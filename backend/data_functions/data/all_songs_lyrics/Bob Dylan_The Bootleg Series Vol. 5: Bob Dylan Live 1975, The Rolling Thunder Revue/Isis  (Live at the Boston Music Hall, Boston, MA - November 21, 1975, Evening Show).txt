Isis  (Live at the Boston Music Hall, Boston, MA - November 21, 1975, Evening Show) Lyrics
I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong
I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry and washed my clothes down
A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away, he was not ordinary
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
I said, "I got no money, man," he said "That ain't necessary"

We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket and he gavе me his word
I said, 'Where wе going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth
I said, "That’s the best news that I've ever heard"
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold
I was thinking 'bout diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she saw I was so reckless
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could just hang on and be her friend
I still can't remember all the best things she said
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said, "There's a body that I'm trying to find"
"If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price”
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind
Well, the wind, it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to get on

Picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her
She was there in the meadow, where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special"
She said, "You look different," I said, "Well, I guess"
She said, "You been gone," I said, "That's only natural"
She said, "You going to stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes"

Isis, oh, Isis, you a mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain
Thank youEmbed
