Nothing (Live)  Lyrics
Sitting target, sitting waiting
Anticipating nothing, nothing

Life is full of surprises
It advertises nothing, nothing

What am I trying to do?
What am I trying to say?
I'm not trying to tell you anything
You didnâ€™t know when you woke up today

Sitting target, sitting praying
And God is saying nothing, nothing

Always knows the prospects
Learn to expect nothing, nothing

What am I trying to do?
What am I trying to say?
I'm not trying to tell you anything
You didn't know when you woke up today

Nothing, oh no, nothing, oh no
Nothing, oh no, nothing, oh no
"Thank you. Thank you very much."Embed
