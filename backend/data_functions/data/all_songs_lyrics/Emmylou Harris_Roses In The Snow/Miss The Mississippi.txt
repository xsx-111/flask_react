Miss The Mississippi Lyrics
I'm growing tired of the big city lights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore

I am sad and weary, far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always along and blue
Nothing seems to cheer me
Under Heaven's door
Miss the Mississippi and you

I'm growing tired of the big city lights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore

I am sad and weary, far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you
Mississippi and youEmbed
