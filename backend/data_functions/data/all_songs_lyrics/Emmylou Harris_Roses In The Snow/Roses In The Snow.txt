Roses In The Snow Lyrics
I met my darling in the springtime
When all the flowers were in bloom
And like the flowers, our love blossomed
We married in the month of June

Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow

Now God has taken my darling
And left me with a memory
One memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me

Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow

My darling's buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when the winter snows start falling
On his grave I'll place a rose
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snowEmbed
