One Step at a Time LyricsTalk to me
Don't leave me wondering
Talk to me
Let's see what tomorrow brings
And then when you remember
Things will be so much better
Talk to me
Talk to me (Talk to me)
Don't give me the silent treatment
Talk to me (Talk to me)
Guess I'm not in on the agreement
And then you might discover
One's better than the other
Talk to me
One step at a time (One step at a time)
I'm tryin' to get to you, babe (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)
You're gonna talk to me (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)
I'm tryin' to get to you, babe (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)
You're gonna talk to me (One step)
Talk to me
Though the damage done is so sad
Talk to me
With the sadness in your eyes
Everything will soon be better
You soon begin to realize
Come on and talk to me
One step at a time (One step at a time)
I'm tryin' to get to you, babe (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)
You're gonna talk to me (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)
I'm tryin' to get to you, babe (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)
You're gonna talk to me (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)
I'm tryin' to get to you, babe (One step)
One step at a time (One step at a time)Embed
