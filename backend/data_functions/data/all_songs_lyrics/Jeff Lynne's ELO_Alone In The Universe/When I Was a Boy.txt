When I Was a Boy Lyrics
When I was a boy, I had a dream
All about the things I'd like to be
Soon as I was in my bed
Music played inside my head
When I was a boy, I had a dream

When I was a boy, I learned to play
Far into the night and drift away
Don't want to work on the milk or the bread
Just want to play my guitar instead
When I was a boy, I had a dream

And radio waves kept me company
In those beautiful days when there was no money
When I was a boy, I had a dream

When I was a boy, I had a dream
Finding out what life could really mean
Don't want a job 'cause it drives me crazy
Just wanna sing, "Do you love me, baby?"
When I was a boy, I had a dream
And radio waves kept me company
In those beautiful days when there was no money
When I was a boy, I had a dream
