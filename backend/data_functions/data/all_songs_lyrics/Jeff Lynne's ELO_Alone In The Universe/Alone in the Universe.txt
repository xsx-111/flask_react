Alone in the Universe Lyrics
Alone in the universe
All alone in the universe

That's how it feels now you are gone
I knew it all along
I'm such a long long way from home

Alone in the universe
All alone in the universe

It gets so sad in the unknown
I'm tired of being alone
I'm such a long long way from home

Alone in the universe
All alone in the universe

No matter where I try to roam
It only goes to show
I'm such a long long way from home2Embed
