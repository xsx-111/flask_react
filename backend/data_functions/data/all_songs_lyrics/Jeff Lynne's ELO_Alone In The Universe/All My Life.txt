All My Life Lyrics
All my life, I was looking for you
And suddenly, you were there
All my life, I knew what I would do
Just stand there like a fool and stare

All my life
All my life

I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
All my life

All my life, I searched for you
But you were never there, were you?
Thought I'd found you once or twice
It was a sad affair or two

All my life
All my life

I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
All my life

I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
All my life

Yeah, yeah
All my lifeEmbed
