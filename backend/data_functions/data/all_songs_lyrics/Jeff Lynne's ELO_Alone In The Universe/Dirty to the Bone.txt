Dirty to the Bone LyricsShe's dirty to the bone
She cheats at everything she does
She's dirty to the bone
She cares for nothing but herself
She'll drag you down, until you drown in sorrow
She'll pull you in, she'll take you down
She'll mess you up, she'll move around
She knows it all, she's dirty to the bone
She's dirty to the bone
She'll deceive you 'til the cows come home
She's dirty to the bone
She cares for nothing but herself
She'll drag you down, until you drown in sorrow
She'll pull you in, she'll take you down
She'll mess you up, she'll move around
She knows it all, she's dirty to the bone
She'll drag you down, until you drown in sorrow
She'll pull you in, she'll take you down
She'll mess you up, she'll move around
She knows it all, she's dirty to the bone
She's dirty to the bone (dirty to the bone)
She's dirty to the bone (dirty to the bone)
She's dirty to the bone (dirty to the bone)
She's dirty to the bone (dirty to the bone)Embed
