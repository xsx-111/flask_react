On My Mind LyricsNow and again I think about her
About the way things were
Thinking about her now is the way that it is
I think I know what's right and what's wrong
And never listen to people who lie
And I remember
The day's sad and tender moments that she has
I never needed anybody
The way I need her now
Always lost and never found
On my mind and I just can't forget her
She's on my mind and I can't make it better
So now she knows it's all about her
No matter what she says
I still believe in her
She still believes in me
I never needed anybody
The way I need her now
Always lost and never found
On my mind and I just can't forget her
She's on my mind and I can't make it better
On my mind and I just can't forget her
She's on my mind and I can't make it betterEmbed
