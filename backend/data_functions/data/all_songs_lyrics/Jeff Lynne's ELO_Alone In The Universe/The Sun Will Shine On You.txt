The Sun Will Shine On You LyricsYou've got to learn how to cry
Before you learn how to fall
You've got to turn from the darkness
And go through it all
Just remember that it's all right
It's all right to be true
And the sun will shine on you
You've got to try to remember
The promises you made
You've got to hold on to yourself
And never be afraid
Foolish notions try to get you
No matter what you do
But the sun will shine on you
Oh yeah, the sun will shine on you
Anything you want
You can have for your own
It was always there for you
If only you'd have known
Try to find it, try to love it
Try to see it through
And the sun will shine on you
Oh yeah, the sun will shine on you
The sun will shine on you
The sun will shine on you
Oh yeah, the sun will shine on youEmbed
