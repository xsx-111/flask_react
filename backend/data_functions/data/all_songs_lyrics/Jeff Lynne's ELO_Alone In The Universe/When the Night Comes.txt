When the Night Comes Lyrics
When the night comes
That's when I think of you
When the night comes
I get midnight blue

But what can I say
When the night comes to stay?

When the night comes (And everybody's gone)
When the night comes (And I'm here all alone)
When the night comes
Every night, that's when I think of you

Now's the time
I see the twilight coming on
Now's the time
Pretty soon, they'll all be gone

But where will I be
When the night comes to me?
When the night comes (And everybody's gone)
When the night comes (And I'm here all alone)
When the night comes
Every night, that's when I think of you


But what can I say
When the night comes to stay?

When the night comes (And everybody's gone)
When the night comes (And I'm here all alone)
When the night comes
Every night, that's when I think of you
When the night comes (And everybody's gone)
When the night comes (And I'm here all alone)
When the night comes
Every night, that's when I think of you
When the night comes (And everybody's gone)
When the night comes (And I'm here all alone)Embed
