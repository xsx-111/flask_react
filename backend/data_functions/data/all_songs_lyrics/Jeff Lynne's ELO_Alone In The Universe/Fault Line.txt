Fault Line LyricsLivin' on the fault line, waiting for the big time
Sends a shiver down your spine, livin' on the fault line
Waiting in the sun, with the big meter on
But it comes without a sign, livin' on the fault line
As the time rolls along, you know it's coming on
Playing in the sunshine, livin' on the fault line
Well the skies are blue, and the ocean too
Having such a good time, livin' on the fault line
When the fault line breaks, you know for all I say
There's no use in crying, livin' on the fault line
Livin' on the fault line, waiting for the big time
Sends a shiver down your spine, livin' on the fault line
Waiting in the sun, with the big meter on
But it comes without a sign, livin' on the fault lineEmbed
