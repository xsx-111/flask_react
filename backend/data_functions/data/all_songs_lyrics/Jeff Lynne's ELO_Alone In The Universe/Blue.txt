Blue LyricsBlue, is the world
Silent and blue, is the world
Sailing upon the deepest sea
Spending the void eternally
And blue, blue is the world
Blue, blue is the night
Silent and blue, is the night
And when the sun begins to glow
There'll be another blue tomorrow
And blue, blue is the world
Maybe I'm just dreaming
A million miles from the shore
Does the world stop turning
If you're not watching anymore
Sailing upon the deepest sea
Spending the void eternally
And blue, blue is the world
And blue, blue is the world
And blue, blue is the world
Blue is the world, blue is the world, blue is the world1Embed
