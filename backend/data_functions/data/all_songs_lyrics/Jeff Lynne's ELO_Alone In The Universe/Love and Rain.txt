Love and Rain Lyrics
It takes a lot of rain to make a flower grow
Yes it takes a lot of love and rain
And it makes a lot of pain to see you steppin' out
Yes it makes a lot of love and rain (love and rain)

Love and rain, keep comin' back again
Ooh love and rain

Love and rain, Oh the pleasure and the pain
Never feel the same again for love and rain (Love and rain)

Love and rain, keep comin' back again
Ooh love and rain

Love and rain, love and rain
Love and rain, love and rain

Love and rain, keep comin' back again
Ooh love and rain
Love and rain, love and rain, yeah, love and rainEmbed
