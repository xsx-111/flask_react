Calling And Not Calling My Ex Lyrics
She was once mine
That smile that shines
From the glossy magazine that's stuck inside the Sunday Times
She was so sweet on Christmas Eve
With the snow set deep
When we went walking through the pines
I had just been fired and her first offer had arrived
And the new year would see her flying far away from me
Though I didn't know it at the time

With outstretched hands
Now she commands
A famous figure for every picture
And she stands up strong and she demands
And they deliver
Yeah, she's a fixture
And it's a mixture of dumb jealousy and fear
That I might feel should she appear
Just like it hasn't been three years
And there's a distance to her voice over the phone
And that's because she stands alone
While I'm still sitting here

Girl, you see me here on another quiet night
I will wait until another indistinguishable day arrives
I'll decide where the light's even and bright
Where my life's sweet as it's slightly, disappointedly, just gliding softly by
And you won't wait for me in some secluded stand of trees
Some Christmas Eve, some God was kind enough to set aside
Although I'd love you too, I'm proud of you
God knows I'm feeling really stupid now
For ever having said goodbye
During the fight
I said, "Yeah right"
When you insisted that I visit, that you'd write
Now, I know you're working hard
So I never hear from you, and that's fine
You look the same on TV as when you were mine
I walk in from the kitchen and I finger the remote control
I watch you from the distance, you go walking through the terminal
I remember every instance, when you stung me
Oh, you're so lovely
Oh, you're so smart
So, go turn their heads, go knock them dead, go break their hearts

Go break their hearts
Baby, break their hearts
And I know you willEmbed
