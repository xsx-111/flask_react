Rachel Lyrics
Rachel, please, don't go to the beach
Don't go
Rachel, please, please stay here with me
Sadly

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

Suddenly, I land by the sea
Dead leaves
Rinsing fish, we cry in our sleep
Lightly

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

Oh-oh-oooh oh oh oh-oh-oooh
Oooh oooh
Oh-oh-oooh oh oh oh-oh-oooh
Oooh oooh1Embed
