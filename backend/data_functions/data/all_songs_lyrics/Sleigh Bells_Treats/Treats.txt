Treats Lyrics
Drummer boy
Heaven's deaf, drummer boy
Heavy metal band sing with me
Deep sleep
We can march to the beat
Heavy metal band deal with me
Drummer boy
Put the move on a beat
Let the other ones stick with me
Deep sleep
Put the heat on the street
Let the enemy sing with me

Ohhhh

Bomb heaven
Can they bomb heaven?
Heavy metal band fall with me
Bomb heaven
They can bomb heaven
Heavy metal band deal with me
Drummer boy
Heaven's deaf, drummer boy
Heavy metal band stick with me
Deep sleep
Put the heat on the street
Let the enemy sing with me
