Rill Rill Lyrics
Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart
Sixteen six six six and I know the part
You are the river flow
And we can never know
We're just the weatherman
You make the wind blow
Keep thinking about every straight face, yes
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces
What about them? I'm all about them
Six such straight A's
Cut 'em in the bathroom

So this is it then?
You're here to win, friend
Click click, settle up
See you on the moon, then
You're all alone friend?
Pick up the phone, then
Ring-ring, call them up
Tell them about the new trends
So this is it then?
You're here to win, friend
Click click settle up
See you on the moon, then
You're all alone friend?
Pick up the phone, then
Ring-ring, call 'em up
Tell 'em about the new trends
Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart
Sixteen six six six and you fell apart
You form a terror pack
And I'm aware of that
But we could fist fight drunk like The Parent Trap
Keep thinking about every straight face yes
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces
We never blink see and you can see me
We fell asleep in the middle of a theory

So this is it then?
You're here to win, friend
Click click, settle up
See you on the moon, then
You're all alone friend?
Pick up the phone, then
Ring-ring, call 'em up
Tell 'em about the new trends
So this is it then?
You're here to win, friend
Click click settle up
See you on the moon, then
You're all alone friend?
Pick up the phone, then
Ring-ring, call 'em up
Tell 'em about the new trends
Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart
Sixteen six six six and I'll know the part
You are the river flow
And we can never know
We're just the weatherman
You make the wind blow
Keep thinking about every straight face, yes
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces
What about them? I'm all about them
Six such straight A's
Cut 'em in the bathroom

So this is it then?
You're here to win, friend
Click click settle up
See you on the moon, then
You're all alone friend?
Pick up the phone, then
Ring-ring, call 'em up
Tell 'em about the new trends
So this is it then?
You're here to win, friend
Click click settle up
See you on the moon, then
You're all alone friend?
Pick up the phone, then
Ring-ring, call 'em up
Tell 'em about the new trends15Embed
