Crown on the Ground Lyrics
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Hey!

You never doubted it
You're so proud of it
You straight shouted it
You sold out of it
You couldn't care less
You're like a kid, yes
You think it's endless, endless, endless
You think you started this
It doesn't bother us
No clue about it
No, you never knew about it
You need the spotlight
You need to sit tight
You want a real fight, ah-ah

Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Hey!
You need to look back
To see your backtrack
Do you hear that?
Someone in your habitat
You are the real thing
You hear the bell ring
The class is ending, ending, ending
You don't think though
You don't wanna know
There's another show playing in your window
But for the better you
It's never never through
You're gonna have to, have to, have to

Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown, crown, crown
(Set, set that crown)
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown, crown, crown
(Set, set that crown)
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown, crown, crown
(Set, set that crown)
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown
Set, set that crown, crown, crown
(Set, set that crown)5Embed
