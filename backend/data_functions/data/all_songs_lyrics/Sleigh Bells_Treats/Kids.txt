Kids Lyrics
It was a Wednesday
I got the Kool-Aid
I hear the kick drum
Talking to my baby
I wanna feel the ocean
Put on my suntan lotion
I see the sun glow
Water moving slow motion
I got a beach chair
I see the blonde hair
Kick up my feet there
I feel the cool air
The breeze is nice now
I'll tell you right now
I sip my Kool-Aid
I'm feeling better now

Do I need a vacation?
Just need to get away for a while
Wait, did I forget my sunglasses?
Nope
Got 'em!
I paint my nails pink
They're in the sand though
I hear the old soul
Coming out my radio
I see a young boy
Hanging on a rope swing
He gets a nosebleed
And I hear the gull sing
I hope the water's warm
Gotta get my swims on
I pull my straps up
I'll see a thunderstorm
Oh no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no

Talking about boys
Put the music on
I'll just start dancing

Good looking sea shells
Need to make some new wishes
Watch out for sea glass
Watch out for jellyfishes
I see a young boy
Swimming out to sea now
I tell the life guard
He can't be bothered now
It's getting late though
Clouds are getting real low
The breeze is nice, yes
I think I better go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

But I never came though
They just sat right outside
And started looking at me
Everything was just perfect
I got a little sunburn, though1Embed
