Riot Rhythm Lyrics
You've got a smart best friend, she's okay
Carve you out, start today
Rush the door, take your seats
Our little saints play for keeps

Dear heart, don't stop fighting
Rhythm ride the lightning
It's not hell or heaven
Just like riot rhythm

You gotta march

Because my best friend, she's okay
Carve you out all the way
Straight A kids like a treat
She stands up, takes the heat

Dear heart, don't stop fighting
Rhythm ride the lightning
It's not hell or heaven
Just like riot rhythm
You've gotta march
You've gotta march
Ah ah ah ah ahEmbed
