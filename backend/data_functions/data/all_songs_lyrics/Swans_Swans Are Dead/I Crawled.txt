I Crawled Lyrics
You're my father
You're my father
I obey you
I obey you
I want you to be my father
I want you to be my father
Eliminate my freedom
I know what I am
You know what I am
I'm weak
Take what's mine
I'm weak
Take what's mine
Come into my room
Put your hands on my throat
Now choke me, choke me
Make me feel good
Make me feel good
Be my father
Be my father
Be my father
Make it right
Make it right
Think for me
Think for me
Choke me
Choke me
Be my, be my father
Be my father
We'll ride
We'll ride
We'll ride (Ride, ride, ride)
We'll ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Die
We'll die
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, now, ride
Now, ride, now, ride
Now, ride, now, ride
Now, ride, now, ride
Now, ride, now, ride
Now, ride, now, ride
We ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
Ride, ride1Embed
