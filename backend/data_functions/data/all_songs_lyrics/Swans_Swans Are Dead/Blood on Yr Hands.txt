Blood on Yr Hands Lyrics
There's blood on your hands, baby
Baby, there's blood on your hands
Mama's gonna get even with you
Mama's gonna get you back
When all the blood's washed over you
Mama will never forget
Mama loves you too much, baby
Mama loves you too much to cry
Mama loves her darling boy
She'll hold him close in her arms
Mama's gonna wash his sweet body
Mama loves you too much to cry
Mama loves you too much, baby
Mama loves you too much to cryEmbed
