Feel Happiness Lyrics

Shhh....
I'm truly sorry, for what I never did
But I forgive you, too; for your indifference
You were a lonely child, laid open to the world
And when I looked in your eyes, I saw myself there too
So please forgive me now, for what we never had
Although its useless to say - I wish you happiness
I wish you happiness, I wish you happiness

Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
Haaaa, happiness
