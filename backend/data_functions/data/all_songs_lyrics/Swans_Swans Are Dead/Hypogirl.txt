Hypogirl Lyrics
Can I steal your mind?
And can I crawl down inside?
And when I am your child
Can I feed in your eye?
And can I drink the air
Down in your cold black lung?
And can I breathe the sweet
Sick and lonesome blood?

Love is everywhere
No we will never escape
I love you more than my life
No, we will never escape

Can I cut out the core
And steal the food in your head
And curl my body inside
Down where it's dark and it's wet?

I love you more than your life
I love your body and mind
I love you more than your life
No, we will never escape1Embed
