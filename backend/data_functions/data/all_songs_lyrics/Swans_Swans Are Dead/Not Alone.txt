Not Alone Lyrics
In separate sections the bodies fall
The leaves are purple, the grass is red
I love your music, I love your style
The light inside you leaks through your eyes

Na na na na

The golden liquid that washed your face
Contain my secrets and bitter taste
I love your music, I love your throat
The light inside me feeds like a golden rope

Na na na na

And I alone
See through your eyes
And I alone
Will never die
And I alone
Can taste your hand
And I alone
Am sanctified
And I alone
Can smell your hair
And I alone
Feed you the air
And I alone
Can steal steal your breath
And I alone
Prevent your death
And I alone
Am not alone
And I alone
Am not alone...
Na na na na na...
It's the sun
It's the sun
Sh-sh-shining
Sh-sh-shining...
Shhhh....
Shhhh....Embed
