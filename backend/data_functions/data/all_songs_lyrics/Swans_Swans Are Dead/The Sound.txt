The Sound Lyrics
And wide are your delusions
Deep red is the space behind your eyes
Closed forever is the door to your room
But inside there, there's a sound
You despise, but I love
You despise, what I love
You despise, I love
You despise, I love


Mother, I…
Mother, I…
I was wrong
I am wrong…
You were wrong
I am wrong6Embed
