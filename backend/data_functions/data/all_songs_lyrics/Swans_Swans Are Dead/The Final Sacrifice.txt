The Final Sacrifice Lyrics
Lord Jesus
Oh, Jesus
You're my only God
You're my only girl

I follow you now
I follow you down
To a dirty black room
Where the air is gone
I'll lie down on the table
And I'll wait for you
To step inside me now
Come inside me now, Jesus

Step inside me now
Come on, come on in

Oh, Jesus Christ
You're my only God

If I drink your blood
I will be like you
Girl I wanna be like you
I look into your eyes
And close my mind
Get out my mind
Get out my head

Oh, Jesus
You're my only God

*applause*
