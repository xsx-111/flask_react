Team Mate LyricsWe used to go out nightly
To the armoury
You used to be my team mate
Or that's the way it seemed
We lost our friends
Because you wanted to
They had no faith in you
I had faith in you
You said we don't need anybody new
It's just me and you
On a bicycle for two
Ah ah ahhh
We used to hold on tightly
And you relied on me
I used to to be your team mate
Or that's the way it seemed
We lost our friends
Because you wanted to
They had no faith in you
I had faith in you
We've been everything you wanted to
It was just me and you
On a bicycle for two
Ah ah ahhh
Ah ah ahhhEmbed
