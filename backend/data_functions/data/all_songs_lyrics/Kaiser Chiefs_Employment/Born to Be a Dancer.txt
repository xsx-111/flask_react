Born to Be a Dancer LyricsYou and me were made, it's impossible to say
To be together always
Then you moved away to the capital of England
I hoped you'd stay there
Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I came down at your, on the National Express
Request to touch your breasts and
There I found that you, you were hanging with a crowd
A load of cheats and liars
Do you know what I've been thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohEmbed
