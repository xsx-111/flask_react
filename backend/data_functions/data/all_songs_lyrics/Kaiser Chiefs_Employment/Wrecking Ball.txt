Wrecking Ball LyricsIt's not my problem now
Get him to sort it out
And when the dust has cleared
Look on your shoulder
It looks like we're over
You've got a lot to say
For someone who says they're okay
It must be serious
To look on my shoulder
It looks like we're over now
Hit that wall with a wrecking ball
Again, if I'm over
Hit that wall with a wrecking ball
Again, if I'm over, you are
We got out just in time
The furniture was mine
And that's most unfortunate
So look on my shoulder
It looks like we're over now
Hit that wall with a wrecking ball
Again, if I'm over
Hit that wall with a wrecking ball
Again, if I'm over, you are
So look on my shoulder
It looks like we're over
Look on my shoulder
Hit that wall with a wrecking ball
Again, if I'm over
Hit that wall with a wrecking ball
Again, if I'm over, you areEmbed
