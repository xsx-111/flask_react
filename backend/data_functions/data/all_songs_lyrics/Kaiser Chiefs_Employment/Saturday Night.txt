Saturday Night Lyrics
Da-dum
Da-dum
Da-dum

S-S-S-Suddenly there's a knock at your head
Don't let them in because they're trying to take your TV set
H-H-H-Happiness is the ball in your hand
You've got to try and throw this party just as far as you can
C-C-C-Creosote is pouring out of my brain
I swear I heard the floorboards, they were creaking your name
G-G-G-Get a room, get ahead, get a hat
We're going to hell anyway, let's travel first class

Come through the city on a Saturday night
Watching the boys on their motorbikes
I wanna be like those guys
I wanna wear my clothes tight
With matching jackets and a fistful of notes
New sneakers and a fresh pack of smokes

P-P-P-Pneumothorax is a word that is long
They're just trying to put some punk back into punctured lung
P-P-P-Panic over, party off, party on
Cause we are birds of a feather and you can be the fat one
Come through the city on a Saturday night
Over your heads like a satellite
I wanna see what they see
I wanna love you like crazy
'Cause cameras are pointing right at your face
Can see into your room from outer space
Come through the city on a Saturday night
It's not the size of the man in the fight
I wanna know what that does
I wanna show you what matters
'Cause it's the size of the fight in the man
That makes the difference and decides who is champ
Come through the city on a Saturday night
'Cause you and me are on the edge of the knife
Come through the city on a Saturday night
I asked your mother and she said it's all right
We're getting married when we're thirty
I wanna do it on your birthday
'Cause I don't wanna waste a moment with you
I just wanna dance the whole night through

Come through the city on a Saturday night
'Cause you and me we're on the edge of the knife1Embed
