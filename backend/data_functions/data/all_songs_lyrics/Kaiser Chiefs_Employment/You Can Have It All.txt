You Can Have It All LyricsI tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus and that was that
There's more to this than passing by
There's more to this than meets the eye
I tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus, I saw your shoes
They fell apart some time ago
I'll buy some more in five years
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
I tell you what it's going to feel like
You lost a limb, and you can feel it itch
You leave, at night, not by my side
'Cause I'm not there to hold you too tightly
I tell you what it's going to be like
No, you can never hold my hand in public
They can't know or understand
That you and me are now together
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
Oh, oh
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And know that you can have it all
If it's all right, oh, oh, oh
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Ooh, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, la la
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, la la
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
Oh, oh
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And know that you can have it all
If it's all right, oh, oh, oh2Embed
