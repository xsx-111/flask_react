What Did I Ever Give You? LyricsHead down, keep your head down
Keep your rent down over time
Hold tight, to your red stripe
Why do we fight every time?
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
Nightclub, Marlboro light stub
Stuck to my gum all the time
I treat you
Like you're see-through
I don't mean to
Every time
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth?
Disgraced
Back to my place
I'm a complete waste
Of your time
I'm asleep
Before the first sheep
Until the last bleep
Of all time
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth
What did I ever give you?1Embed
