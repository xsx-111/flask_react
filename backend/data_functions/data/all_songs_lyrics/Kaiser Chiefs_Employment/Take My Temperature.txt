Take My Temperature LyricsLet's take a look at your eyes they're bloody mental
Swelled to the size of the Lincoln Continental
A bag of pills and a pack of ugly menthols
And I can tell by your teeth you've had a good life!
You can take my temperature
My god, I'm too unwell to be here!
And you can take my temperature
Cause I'm a hundred degrees in the shade over here
You said your sister, she stumbled to a party
Because the someone you like was at the party
You fell asleep on the coach before it started
And I can tell by the coach this is a nice place!
You can take my temperature
My god, I'm too unwell to be here!
And you can take my temperature
Cause I'm a hundred degrees in the shade over here
And now you tell me you've gone south for the winter
And I can count my friends upon my fingers
My hands are cold and I cannot feel ma fingers
And I can tell by your tan you're pretty healthy
You can take my temperature
My god, I'm too unwell to be here!
And you can take my temperature
It's like a hundred degrees in the shade over here
Oooooooh
Oooooooooooooh
Oooooooooooooooooh
You should take my temperature
My god, I'm too unwell to be here
And you can take my temperature
It's like a hundred degrees in the shade over here
You can take my temperature
My god, I'm too unwell to be here
And you can take my temperature
Cause I'm a hundred degrees in the shade over hereEmbed
