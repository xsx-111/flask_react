Box Full of Letters Lyrics
Got a box full of letters
Think you might like to read
Some things that you might like to see
But they’re all addressed to me
Wish I had a lot of answers
Because that’s the way it should be
For all these questions
Being directed at me

I just can’t find the time
To write my mind
The way I want it to read

You’ll come back again
And I’ll still be your friend

I got a lot of your records
In a separate stack
Some things that I might like to hear
But I guess I’ll give them back
I wish I had a lot of answers
Because that’s the way it should be
For all these questions
Being directed at me
