I Thought I Held You LyricsYou're like a moon that's full
Across a sea of foam
I'm the sky you've been burning
I don't think you even understand
I thought I held you by the hand
I thought I held you
I'm like a songwriter
You're the reason I've run out
Run out of metaphors
I don't think you even understand
I thought I held you by the hand
I thought I held you
I thought I held youEmbed
