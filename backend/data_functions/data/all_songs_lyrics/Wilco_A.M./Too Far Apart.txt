Too Far Apart LyricsYou came to meet me out on the line
You couldn't believe I was feeling fine
When I really needed you, you were gone
So long
We were too far apart
Right from the start
I couldn't be any closer to you now
Is it really punk rock, like the party line?
Do you have to think about that?
Can I give you some time?
'Cause when I really needed you, you were gone
So long
We were too far apart
Right from the start
I couldn't be any closer to you now
Too far apart
Right from the start
And I couldn't be any closer to you nowEmbed
