Blue Eyed Soul LyricsYou've got a blue-eyed soul
And if you don't let it show
It'll leave you, you won't even know
Without your blue-eyed soul
Can you keep it simple? Can you let the snare crack?
Can you let it move without holding back?
Are you afraid to let it go
Without your blue-eyed soul?
You're gonna lose control
You're gonna lose control
Without your blue-eyed soul
Without your blue-eyed soul
Without your blue-eyed soulEmbed
