Casino Queen Lyrics
Well the money's pouring down
And the people all look down
And it's floating out of town
I hit the second deck
And I spent my paycheck
And my wife that I just met
She's looking like a wreck

Casino Queen
My lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend
On your tables so green

I always bet on black
Blackjack
I'll pay you back
The room fills with smoke
And I'm already broke
And the dealer keeps on joking
As he takes my last token
