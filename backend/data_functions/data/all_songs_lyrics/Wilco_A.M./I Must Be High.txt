I Must Be High LyricsYou
Always wanted more time
To do
What you always wanted to do
Now you got it
And I, I must be high
To say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye
You
Never said you needed this
Now you're pissed that you missed
The very last kiss
From my lips
And I, I must  be high
To say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye
You
Never looked in my eyes
Long enough to find
Any peace of mind
But now you got it
And I, I must be high
To let you say goodbye
Bye, bye, byeEmbed
