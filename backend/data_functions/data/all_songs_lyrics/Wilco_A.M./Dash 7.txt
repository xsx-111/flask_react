Dash 7 LyricsDash 7 in the air
Propped to the sun alone
Jets hum
I wish that I was still there
Props, not a jet, alone
Where the sun doesn't come down
Because I've found the way those engines sound
Will make you kiss the ground
When you touch down
Dash 7 pointed down
The captain's announcement
Doesn't make a sound
Because I've found the way those engines sound
Will make you kiss the ground
I found the way those engines sound
Will make you kiss the ground
When you touch downEmbed
