Pick Up the Change LyricsIf it's just your heart talking, I don't mind
If you want to call me darling, that's just fine, that's just fine
But if it's your mind that's wandering, it'll fall in line
When I kiss your cheek, dear, every time, every time
We used to have a lot of things in common
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Aw honey, help me
Aw honey, help me pick up the change
If it's just your heart talking, I'll listen every time
Dear, you can talk my ear off, anytime, anytime
But if my mind starts wandering, it won't be gone long
Whenever I hear your heart talking, it's a song, it's a song
We used to have a lot of things in common
But you know now we're just the same
You always had more than I really wanted
Aw honey, help me
Come on honey, help me pick up
Aw honey, help me pick up the change
Aw honey, help me
Come on honey, help me pick up
Aw honey, help me pick up the changeEmbed
