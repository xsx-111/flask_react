Falling On A Bruise LyricsYou win some
And you lose some
But I've lost the will to lose
My part time job
My faith in God
Falling on a bruise
This no-star bed and breakfast
And insolvency abuse
Make me feel like
Throwing myself off
The kitchen shelf
Falling on a bruise
And all of my unwordly goods
The baliffs took them too
For all the duck-billed silly sods
From Brian Mills' catalogue
Something borrowed bartered and blue
You win some
And you lose some
You save nothing, nothing
For a rainy day
You need your Nutrasweet Daddy
Or some Peppermint Patty
Or just a hackneyed old cabby
Who can take you and your baby away
Two fives or a ten
Could get me back to you
And stop me
Falling on a bruise...
It’s not that I’m agrophobic
It’s just that it’s not safe to go outside anymore
So I just stay indoors with my T.V. Times
My petty crimes and my nursery rhymes
Someone said that the sound of a baby crying
Is the most beautiful sound in the world
But beauty is in the eye of the beholder
And as my heart grows colder and colder
I just feel so tired
The fridge is empty, the walls are damp
There’s no hot water, and I look like a tramp
And tramps like us, baby, we were born to walk
But where does a mother’s girl go when her mother’s gone
Some you win and some you lose
I’ve spent my whole lifetime
Falling on a bruise
And if I had the chance to do it all again
I’d change everything

I dunno, it seems to me, if they ain't gotcha one way, they've got you another. So what's the answer? That's what I keep asking myself... what's it all about? Know what I mean?Embed
