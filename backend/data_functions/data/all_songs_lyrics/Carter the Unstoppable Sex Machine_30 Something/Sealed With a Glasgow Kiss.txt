Sealed With a Glasgow Kiss LyricsI worship the ground that you walk on
Give praise to the place where you sit
Your face and the place that you talk from
Your teeth and those unlucky lips
I gave you my name and independence
And the best seven years of my life
With twelve months suspended from sentence
And fifty-two lovely black eyes
Love ain't like the movies
It blisters and bruises
And knocks you around with its fists
It leaves you a wreckage
Of postage and package
Sealed with Glasgow kiss
You're pure as the driven
And I should be in prison
Or under a lorry
Cause I hit you and I'm sorry
But love ain't like the movies
It blisters and bruises
And bites like a doberman
Never home sober and
Leaves you a wreckage
Of postage and package
All sealed with a Glasgow kiss
I desecrate the ground that you walk on
Put nails in the place where you sit
I wasted the space that you talk from
Your teeth and those unlucky lipsEmbed
