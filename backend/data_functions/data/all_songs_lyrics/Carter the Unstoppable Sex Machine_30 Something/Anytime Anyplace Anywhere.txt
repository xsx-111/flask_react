Anytime Anyplace Anywhere LyricsThe tequilla sun is rising
And the Harvey's Bristol moon is sinking
Put the Binatone on snooze
Open up some Special Brews
And start drinking
To the biggest mess in town
Then put on your dressing gown
Screw your head on upside down
Drink yourself into the ground
The bottles by the sink
They're the softest fucking drinks on the market
Yes sir, the Thunderbirds have gone
The wagons rolling on
And I'm on it
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss
Vodka and tomato juice
Disneyland or dipsomania
Pick a flavour
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
There's a wonderful world you can share
Try agrophobic, schizophrenic
Paranoid attacks of panic
Epileptic fit of laughter
Twenty five million mornings after
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss
Vodka and tomato juice
Disneyland or dipsomania
Name your poison
Pick a flavour
Moonshine, firewater, Captain Morgan, Johnnie Walker
Southern Comfort, mother's ruin
Happy hours of homeless brewing
Galloways sore throat expectorant
After-shave and disinfectant
Parazone and Fairy Liquid
If it's in a glass you'll drink it
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
There's a wonderful world you can shareEmbed
