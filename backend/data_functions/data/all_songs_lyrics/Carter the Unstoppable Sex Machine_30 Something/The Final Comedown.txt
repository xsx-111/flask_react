The Final Comedown LyricsI've looted and I've begged
On the tubes of the Bec on Broadway
I've been run over by cars
And to prove it here's the scars
On my wrist
I've been cut
I've been stitched
I've been buggered, bewitched, and abadoned
But nothing in Heaven or Earth
Prepared me for this...
The Final Comedown
It's a victory worth sharing
We should celebrate I think
With the bloodiest of marys
That I'm too fucked to drinkEmbed
