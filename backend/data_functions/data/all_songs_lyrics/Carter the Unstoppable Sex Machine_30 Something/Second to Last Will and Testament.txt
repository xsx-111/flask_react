Second to Last Will and Testament LyricsShadows? On me lungs? I've been eaten away. This is the end of me! Oh, God in heaven help me
I James Robert Injustice, being of unsound body and mind, hereby bequeath all my worldly goods to anyone who wants 'em
The debts that I got from gambling
The warrant for my arrest
All my bills which are now outstanding
And the bullet hole inside my chest
Give my body to medical science
If medical science will have me
They can take my lungs and kidneys
But my heart belongs to Daphne
Daphne!
Leave a night light on beside my death bed, baby
Turn the pillows, change the sheets
But don't switch on my electric blanket
Till it's time to sleep
Call my lawyer!
Are you prepared to meet your maker
And ask for you money back?
Have you got a receipt?
Are the goods damaged in any way?
This is my second to last will and testament
Only a rough draft
A handwritten estimate
Left on a shelf, never signed or delivered
With a picture of myself on a boat by the river
Don't bury me at sea
The pollution might kill me!
Just put my remains in a cheap box
And grill me
My pension and dole
Are there in the wardrobe
My air-cushioned soul
And my Blue Circle overcoat
I've left you no answers
Just hundreds of questions
This is my second to last will and testament
Before I, James Robert Injustice
Being of unsound body and mind
DieEmbed
