Grey Streets LyricsGrey streets and streets of grey
Patrolled by knights from the invading day
Closing eyelids stutter and tumble and turn away
Makeshift memories they collide for another stay
I was attracted to you because the forces were so blind
And you were attracted to me
Because my face smiled down from a wall
And you said I looked kind
Well hello it's me again
I just called 'round to see my friend
'Cause when I'm talking to you can't you see that the world's aglow
You're so semi-precious about life and you won't let your feelings show
I was a photograph
I was a picture on display
You were so negative because once I owned the world
But I gave it away
I am here and you are there
We are near so why should we care
You almost wish you werw dying it would be an excuse to really live
I sometimes wonder why 'cause you've got nothing left to give
And I was attracted to you
Because the forces were so blind
And you were attracted to me
Because my face smiled down from a wall
And you said I looked kindEmbed
