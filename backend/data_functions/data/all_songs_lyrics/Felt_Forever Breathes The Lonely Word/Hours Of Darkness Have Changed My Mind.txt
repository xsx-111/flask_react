Hours Of Darkness Have Changed My Mind LyricsGot into something dangerous and strange
Was into nothing that's the way I behave
I like those deep dark thoughts that leave you
Stranded way in mid-air
I'd like to do something that makes somebody somewhere
Care
Playing with fire why should I mind
I'm going beyond now what will I find
Corridors filled with smoke and all the trees uprooted
And dead
A man who's got three square eyes and a boy with the
Snakeskin head
I was torn apart by my love for a different land
I was led astray by the touch of the devil's hand
It's your second nature oh don't fool around 'till
That's gone
A man is a boy a boy is a child a woman's son
I'm a disciple I've become aware
Seen god in the heaven the devil down there
Isn't it 'bout time boy you got your thoughts onto
Something new
You could come up with me if you really want something
To do
And I was torn apart by my love for a different land
I was led astray by the touch of the devil's hand
It's your second nature oh don't fool around 'till
That's gone
A man is a boy a boy is a child a woman's sonEmbed
