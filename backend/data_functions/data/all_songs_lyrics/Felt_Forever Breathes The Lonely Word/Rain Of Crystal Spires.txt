Rain Of Crystal Spires Lyrics
Seven brothers on their way from Avalon
Seven sisters shooting skyways for the sun
Homer's Illiad lay burning in the fire
And I was pleased just then 'till you said that the sun will never shine

Will never shine
Will never shine
Will never shine
Will never shine
Never shine

A desert town to the west of Idaho
Leads to valleys shading vineyards from the snow
Messiah in the sky puts flames upon the sea
I was mesmerized 'till you said I was positively free

I'm always free
Yes I may agree
Yes I see
I'm always free
And the sun won't shine on me
No the sun won't shine on me
Oh come on sun please shine on me
Seven brothers on their way from Avalon
Seven sisters shooting skyways for the sun
You always said to me don't walk the straightest line
So I took heed of that 'till you said that the sun will never shine

Will never shine
It'll never shine
Never shine
It'll never shine
No never shine
It'll never shine
Never shine
The sun won't shineEmbed
