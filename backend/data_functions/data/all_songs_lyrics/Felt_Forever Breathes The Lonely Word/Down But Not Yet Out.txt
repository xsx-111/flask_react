Down But Not Yet Out LyricsI was feeling the strain of 20 years
I was saying well this is all there is
I was seeing my blood it dripped like tears
I was counting the cost of all my fears
So you wanted to be like me to be seen
So you wanted to rise from your darkest dream
So you wanted to be the things that I've been
Well let me tell you something
It's not what it seems
Let me give you advice
Hang onto your dreams
I was down but not yet out you see
I was riding the road to victory
I was sailing the stars of secrecy
And I was wearing the mask on honesty
Don't you know you can stop and start it again
If you thought about time then it would be your
Friend
Don't you know that the sword is the same as the pen
And in your world of trouble
Where nothin g goes right
I can give you advice
If you won't think once
Then baby think twice
So you see where I stand and where I fall
So you see what I've got and that's for all
So you see this big man ain't so tall
You have to keep your feet down on the floor
Do you still want to be like me to be seen
Do you still want want to rise from your darkest
Dream
Do you still want to be the things I've been
Well let me tell you something
It's not what it seems
Let me give you advice
Hang onto your dreams
Hang onto your dreams
Hang onto your dreamEmbed
