All The People I Like Are Those That Are Dead LyricsMaybe I should entertain
The very fact that I'm insane
I wasn't fooling when I said
All the people I like are those that are dead
I've been around this town and I've seen what god has done
I've been around and it's no fun
I've been a two-time tearaway god has told me so
But I don't believe in him you know
Don't make me a martyr for your causes
'Cause I don't believe a word that you said
All the people I like are those are dead
Maybe I should take a gun
And put it to the head of everyone
All the people I like are in the ground
It's better to be lost than to be found
I should listen hard to the voices from within
They are telling me that I'll never win
I should save myself I shoud save myself from sin
But I wouldn't know where to begin
You are trying to tell me what you believe in
But I ain't got a clue what you are talking about
It's better to be a man than to be a mouse
All the people I like are those that are dead
All the people I like are those that are dead
All the people I like are those that are dead
All the people I like are those that are dead
I've been around this town and I've seen what God has done
I've been around and it's no fun
I've been a two-timer/tearaway god has told me so
But I don't believe in him you know
Don't make me a martyr for our causes
'Cause I don't believe a word that you said
All the people I like are those that are
All the people I like are those that are
All the people I like are those that are deadEmbed
