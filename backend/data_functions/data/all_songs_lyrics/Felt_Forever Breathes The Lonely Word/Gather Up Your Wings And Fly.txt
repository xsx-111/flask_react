Gather Up Your Wings And Fly LyricsI was heading north on a plane that was heading south
Whisky in my pocket, cigarette was in my mouth
A vision on my knee but I wasn't reading much
Gather up your wings and fly now
You can take them to the sky
What's the betting that you'll be letting his hands dip into your loins
While all I'll be getting is a new sun setting on the downtown vegas morn
Downtown vegas that's the place of your dreams
Downtown London that's not tour scene
Step inside and take the weight off your tiny feet
You curled up in the corner you're looking so discret
And when you turned your face caught the light and oh you looked so sweet
Don't I always get my own way
Have you anything to say
What's the betting that you'll be letting his hands dip into your loins
While all I'll be getting is a new sun setting on the downtown vegas morn
What's the betting that you'll plead insanity
It won't be long now while we're shaking your apple tree
After seven days of fasting you said you'd seen the lord
You travelled back four centuries in search of a silver sword
Your self-induced hallucinations they just make me bored
Gather up your wings and fly now
You can take them to the sky
What's the betting that you'll be letting his hands dip into your lions
While all I'll be getting is a new sun setting on the downtown vegas morn
Donwtown vegas that's the place of your dreams
Downtown London that's not your scene
Shake your apple tree nowEmbed
