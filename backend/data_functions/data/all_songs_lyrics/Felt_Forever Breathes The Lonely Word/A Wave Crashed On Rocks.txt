A Wave Crashed On Rocks LyricsPeople are crying
What are we going to do
People are crying
I don't care about them I care about...
You in your wisdom you ruined it all
You sacrificed me for the cause of the storm
You ruined it all
Into the darkness
All I see is you
It's totally magic
What we've just been through
But now it's all over like a wave crashed on rocks
I'm not your Jesus so will you get off my cross
You ruined it all
People are crying
What are we going to do
People are crying
I don't care about them I care about...
You in your wisdom you ruined it all
You sacrificed me for the cause of the storm
You ruined it allEmbed
