September Lady LyricsSeptember lady's just woke up
You better take that smile and run
September lady's not for me
You can try someone new
Garrulous woman
Her mind is all made up
Her face is a mess
September lady's just woke up
And when she tells you, she tells you what to do
You go straight into her
And you know just what it is, know just what it is
Maybe I could reach for a star
A star is what I was hoping for
Maybe I could for the moon
Maybe we'll be there soon
I go into the pillow
Your head is underneath
There's blood on your legs
Your burning in the heat
You open wide, the sheets I slip inside
And you look so beatiful
And I know just what it is, know just what it is
September lady's just woke up
You better take that smile and run
September lady's not for me
You can try someone newEmbed
