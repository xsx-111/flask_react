Boys Will Be Boys Lyrics(Boys will be boys)
(Boys) John's gone, he's left on a bus
(Will be boys) In a hurry, he's forgot about us
(Boys) Even when Billy's getting confused
(Will be boys) He's got the girl, now he's nothing to lose
(Will be boys)
(Oh boy)
(Boys) It's all over and never again
(Will be boys) Will there be a confrontation like there was just then
(Boys) One girl in the neighbourhood
(Will be boys) Two boys and one's no good
(Will be boys)
(Oh boy)
(Boys will be boys)
(Boys) I wanna dance, I wanna dance with you
(Will be boys) Take you home, kiss you too
(Boys) Go steady, I could show you around
(Will be boys) Maybe tomorrow we can go downtown
(Will be boys)
(Boys) This time's my first time too
(Will be boys) I've never flirted with a girl like you
(Boys) It's not what I expected, but I don't care
(Will be boys) Is this a genuine teenage love affair?
(Will be boys)
(Oh boy)Embed
