Wednesday Week Lyrics
Here she comes to say goodnight
I'll get no sleep tonight
With a classroom vision she still can't see
She was the girl for me

Wednesday week, she loved me
Wednesday week, never happened at all

There she goes, I won't see her again
She's gone to school with her best friend
She only does the things she likes to do
Now she wants something new

Wednesday week, she loved me
Wednesday week, never happened at all
Wednesday week, she loved me
Wednesday week, never happened at all

Here she comes to say goodnight
I'll get no sleep tonight
Wednesday week, she loved me
Wednesday week, she loved me
Wednesday week, never happened at allEmbed
