Whizz Kids LyricsA financial romance
Got what you wanted took your chance
So here we go again
These whizz kids will never end
(Never never) be seen alone
(Get together) with ones of your own
(In their leathers) second to none
Whizz kids
Whizz kids
Whizz kids
Whizz kids
So now you've reached the top
Sweet success is all you've got
Well, holidays don't last long
Enjoy it now before it's gone
(Never never) be seen alone
(Get together) with ones of your own
(In their leathers) second to none
Whizz kids

(Never never) be seen alone
(Get together) with ones of your own
(In their leathers) second to none
