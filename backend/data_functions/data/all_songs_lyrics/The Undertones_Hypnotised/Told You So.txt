Told You So LyricsI wake up in the morning
I've been looking for a break
Then somebody tells me
You've been sleeping in too late
I told you so (I told you so, I told you so)
I told you so (I told you so, I told you so)
Now, it's too late to stop
I told you so
I've been taking all this trouble
Just to set my mind at ease
A man comes in crawling
Won't you please, please, please?
I told you so (I told you so, I told you so)
I told you so (I told you so, I told you so)
Now, it's too late to stop
I told you so
I never did expect
To have to carry so much weight
But the photographs are ready
You're twenty minutes late
I told you so (I told you so, I told you so)
I told you so (I told you so, I told you so)
Now, it's too late to stop
I told you soEmbed
