Tearproof LyricsShe's a girl in a million
Who does what a million girls do
Ever so slightly
Finger tipped tightly too
Tearproof, tearproof
First in the phone book
Who looks such a nice girl now?
Magazine madness
Guaranteed to show you how
Tearproof, tearproof
Whatever you fancy
A borderline case took down
An American hostess
Don't take the chance to bring her 'round
Tearproof, tearproofEmbed
