When Saturday Comes LyricsHear your mother on the telephone
Important people happy people on
Everywhere there's scattered magazines
Shooting red from colours yellowing
Any day of the week's when Saturday comes
Any day of the week, she's almost gone
Hiding pictures of her takeaway
Only laughing on a Saturday
Tomorrow's Sunday's special radio
Warning her the danger's long ago
Any day of the week's when Saturday comes
Any day of the week, she's almost gone
Such an independent girl
Think you've got what it takes
If you won't sit down next to me
Girl, that's my mistake
Teenage bop from a nervous holiday
Attracting lips from a hidden stowaway
Telegram go-gos got her yesterday
Shocking tears will never go away
Any day of the week's when Saturday comes
Any day of the week, she's almost gone
Any day of the week
Any day of the week
Any day of the week's when Saturday comesEmbed
