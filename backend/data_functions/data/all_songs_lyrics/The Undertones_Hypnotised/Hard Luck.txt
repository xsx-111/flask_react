Hard Luck LyricsHey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You come up to me
Saying that you can't see
Why the whole world thinks you're useless
Saying 'bout a friend
Drives you round the bend
Everything he does is success
Haven't you been told
You will soon be old?
It's your life and now it's your mess
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck
Hard luck
He's been working hard
He can run a car
Money gets you girls and he knows
He gets up at eight
You lie on till late
Lying in your bed reading Beanos
If you worked like him
You might not have been
A slob that drinks vodka and Veno's
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck
Hard luck
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to be
Hard luck, but you got what you wanted to beEmbed
