There Goes Norman LyricsOh, watch that man
There goes Norman
He'll get you if he can
There goes Norman
He's always hiding in the dark
Be sure to wander past the park, at night
Oh, what a surprise
There goes Norman
He'll poke out your eyes
There goes Norman
He never lets himself be heard
Too busy running after girls at night
There goes Norman
There goes Norman
Mother tell me, what can I do?
The girls are laughing, they're very cruel
Don't worry Norman, your time will come
And you can't meet them on their way home
Oh, he's out tonight
There goes Norman
He looks strange tonight
There goes Norman
Meanwhile the cops are on the heat
Cause Norman's waiting in the street tonight
There goes Norman
There goes Norman
There goes Norman
There goes NormanEmbed
