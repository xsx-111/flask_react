More Songs About Chocolate and Girls Lyrics
It's not that urgent
Wanting some attention
Our teenage dreams
They're surely worth a mention

'Cause here's more songs about chocolate and girls
It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard
A lot less time but a lot more care
So here's more songs about chocolate and girls

Sit down relax
And cancel all other engagements
It's never too late to enjoy
Dumb entertainment

'Cause here's more songs about chocolate and girls
It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard
A lot less time but a lot more care
So here's more songs about chocolate and girls

'Cause here's more songs about chocolate and girls
It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard
A lot less time but a lot more care
So here's more songs about chocolate and girls
Boys will be boys
And they've done all they can do
So just let's dance
And the rest is up to you

'Cause here's more songs about chocolate and girls
It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard
A lot less time but a lot more care
So here's more songs about chocolate and girls
It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard
A lot less time but a lot more care
So here's more songs about chocolate and girls
It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard
A lot less time but a lot more care...Embed
