The Way Girls Talk LyricsI never kissed a girl before
Too shy to go outside the door
Ah, who cares what's right?
I wanna know what they're doing tonight
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Talk
Have you seen the way she looks at him?
I don't believe the state they're in
Ah, we don't have time
To make fun of what we can find
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Talk
The boys said shout
The boys said shout
The boys said shout
The boys said shout
I hear she's going steady, is he alright?
I see she's got some other date tonight
Ah, who cares what wrong?
We always seem to hurt someone
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Can't listen to the way girls talk
Can't listen to the way girls talk
