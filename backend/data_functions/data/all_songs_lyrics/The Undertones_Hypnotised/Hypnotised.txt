Hypnotised Lyrics
I was out on my own
My friends weren't there
Just about to go home
When you made me stare

I fell into a trance
Just watching you dance
My world had stopped
When I saw your eyes on me

H-Y-P, I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P, I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P

People look at me
Standing by myself
But I only can see
You and no one else

I was still in a trance
Still watching you dance
My world had stopped
When I saw your eyes on me
H-Y-P, I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P, I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P

Now the dancing has stopped
And the doors are open
But I'm still in a spot
Your spell isn't broken

I'm still in a trance
Even though you won't dance
My world had stopped
When I saw your eyes on me

H-Y-P, I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P, I'm hypnotised
H-Y-P, I'm hypnotised
H-Y-PEmbed
