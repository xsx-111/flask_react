See That Girl LyricsI wake up screaming in the middle of something wrong
I'm always waiting for a taxi just to take me back home
It really doesn't make much difference
Everything I say makes no sense
I'm happy just as long as I can see that girl
So boys will be boys when they haven't got nothing to do
You're floored, I'm bored, na√Øve, we haven't a clue
It really doesn't make much difference
Everything I say makes no sense
I'm happy just as long as I can see that girl
I wake up screaming in the middle of something wrongEmbed
