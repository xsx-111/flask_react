Nine Times Out of Ten LyricsOne day in the week's enough
Nine times out of ten
What can you do when you're stuck in love?
Nine times out of ten
Nine times out of ten
Nine times out of ten
Sometimes I can always be right
Nine times out of ten
Sometimes it stays dark all night
Nine times out of ten
Nine times out of ten
Nine times out of tenEmbed
