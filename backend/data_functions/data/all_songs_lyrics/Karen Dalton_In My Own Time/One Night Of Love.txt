One Night Of Love LyricsHe gives me one night of love
Sometimes he gives me two
Hmm when I'm gone
He don't even think my name
It's got me down
Down to the ground
Looks like this whole world
And my best friend got me down
Hmm hmm
I gave him all my money
All of my good loving too
Oh, when I'm gone
He don't even mention my name
It's got me down
Down to the ground
Looks like this whole world
And my best friend got me down
It's got me down
I'm just singing this song
I wouldn't do anything wrong
It's got me down
I'm just telling the truth
I can't show you no kind of proof
It's got me down
Got me down
Down to the ground
This whole world
And my best friend got me down
It's got me down
One night of love
Gives me one night of love
One night of love
One night of love
One night of loveEmbed
