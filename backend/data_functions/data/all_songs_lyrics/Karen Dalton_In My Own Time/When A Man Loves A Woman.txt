When A Man Loves A Woman LyricsWhen a man loves a woman
He can do no wrong
He'd tell the world what a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
Cause She can do no wrong
He turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman
He'll give his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
And give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she tells him that's the way it ought to be
When a man loves a woman
He give up everything he has
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see
When a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause that's the way you've always been to meEmbed
