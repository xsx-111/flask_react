Katie Cruel (alternate mix) LyricsWhen I fist came to town
They call me the roving jewel
Now they've change their tune
They call me Katie Cruel
Chorus
Oh that I was where I would be
Then I would be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Go where I would, I can not
Through the woods I go
And through the bogs and mire
Straight way down the road
And to my heart's desire
Chorus
When I fist came to town
They brought me the bottles plenty
Now they've changed their tune
They bring me the bottles empty
