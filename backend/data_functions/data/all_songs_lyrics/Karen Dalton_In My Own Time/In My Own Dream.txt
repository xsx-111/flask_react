In My Own Dream LyricsI didn't know
I could be fool
It took me a long time
To find out
My mind
Is upside down
I was standing on
Too solid ground
Satisfied
That's what I thought I'd be
I kept on living in my own dream
In my own dream
Everyday
I grew blinder
Oh I thought I was so strong
I didn't need nobody's help
Oh but the strongest river
Can't flow up hill
Satisfied
That's what I thought I'd be
I kept on living in my own dream
In my own dream
Satisfy
That's what I thought I'd be
I kept on living in my own dream, own dream
In my own dreamEmbed
