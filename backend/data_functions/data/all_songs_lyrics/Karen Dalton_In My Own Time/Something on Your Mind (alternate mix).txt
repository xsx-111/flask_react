Something on Your Mind (alternate mix) LyricsYesterday any way you made it was just fine
So you turned your days into night-time
Didn't you know, you can't make it without ever even trying?
And something's on your mind, isn't it
Let these times show you that you're breaking up the lines
Leaving all your dreams too far behind
Didn't you see, you can't make it without ever even trying?
And something's on your mind
Maybe another day you'll want to feel another way, you can't stop crying
You haven't got a thing to say, you feel you want to run away
There's no use trying, anyway
I've seen the writing on the wall
Who cannot maintain will always fall
Well, you know, you can't make it without ever even trying
And something's on your mind, isn't it
Tell the truth now, isn't it
And something's on your mind, isn't itEmbed
