Take Me LyricsTake me to your darkest room
Close every window and lock every door
The very first moment I heard your voice
I'd be in darkness no more
Take me to your most barren desert
A thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very first moment I saw your smile
It would be like heaven to me
There are not any mountains too rugged to climb
No desert too barren to cross
Somewhere, if you just show me a sign
Of love, I could bear any loss
Take me to Siberia
And the coldest weather of the winter time
It would be just like spring in California
The day you say you'll be mine
Take me to Siberia
And the coldest weather of the winter time
And it would be just like Spring in California
The day you say you'll be mineEmbed
