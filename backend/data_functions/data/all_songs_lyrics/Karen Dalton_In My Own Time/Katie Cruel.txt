Katie Cruel LyricsWhen I first came to town
They call' me the roving jewel
Now they've changed their tune
Call me Katie Cruel
Through the woods I am goin'
Through the boggy mire
Straight way down the road
'Til I come to my heart's desire

If I was where I would be
Then I'd be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Where I would be, I can not
When I first came to town
They bought me drinks a' plenty
Now they've changed their tune
Hand me the bottles empty

If I was where I would be
Then I'd be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Where I would be, I can not1Embed
