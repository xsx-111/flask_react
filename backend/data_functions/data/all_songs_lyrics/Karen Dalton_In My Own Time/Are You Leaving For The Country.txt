Are You Leaving For The Country Lyrics
Are you leaving for the country?
You say the city brings you down
Leave the iron cloud behind
And feel the circus moving on

Are you leaving for the country?
I know a little country town
Where dogs are sleeping in the cold
And flagpoles fallen down

High and fine
Sold the wheel and time
Spread their weight and let the planet spin
Do you feel like something's not real?
Let the spirit move you again
Are you leaving for the country?


Do you feel like something's not real?
Let the Spirit move you again
Are you leaving for the country?
You say the city brings you down
Leave the iron cloud behind
And feel the circus moving on
Mmmmm, mm, mmmm
Hmmm, mhhm, hmmm, mm...Embed
