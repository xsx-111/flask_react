What make these men go crazy
When a woman wear her dress so tight?
What make these men go crazy
When a woman wear her dress so tight?
Must be the same old thing
That makes the tom cats fight all night
Why do all these men
Try to run these big-leg'd women down?
Why do all these men
Try to run these big-leg'd women down?
Must be the same old thing
That makes a bulldog hug a hound
Why that same thing
Why that same thing
Tell me who's a-blame?
The whole world fightin'
About the same thing
(guitar & instrumental)
Why do we feel so good
When a woman wear her eve'nin gown?
Why do I feel so good
When my baby get her eve'nin gown?
Must be the same old thing
That makes a preacher
Throw his Bible down
Why that same thing
Why that same thing
Come tell me who's a-blame?
The whole world fightin'
About the same thing
(piano & instrumental)
What make the men go crazy
When the woman wear her dress so tight?
What makes these men go crazy
When a woman wear her dress so tight?
Must be the same old thing
That make the tom cats fight all night
Why that same thing
Why that same thing
Now, tell me who's a-blame?
The whole world fightin'
About the same thing
That same thing
A-that same thing
Tell me who's the blame?
The whole world fightin'
About the same thing
(guitar & instrumental to end)
(Who's to blame?)
The whole world fightin' about the same thing
