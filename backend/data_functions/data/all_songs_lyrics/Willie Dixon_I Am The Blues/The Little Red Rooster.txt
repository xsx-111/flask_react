The Little Red Rooster LyricsI had a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow 'fore day
I had a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow 'fore day
He kept ev'rything in the barnyard
Eager settin' a-ready to lay
You know the dogs begin to bark
And the, the hounds
They begin to howl
You know the dogs they begin to bark
And the, the hounds
They begin to howl
You know my little red rooster's gone
Know the little red rooster's on the prowl
(harmonica & instrumental)
Now, if you see my little red rooster
Somebody, please drive him home
Now, if you seen my little red rooster
Somebody, ple-eee-ase run 'em home
There ain't been no peace in the barnyard
Since my little red rooster been gone
(piano & instrumental)Embed
