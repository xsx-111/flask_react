Back Door Man LyricsI-I-I am the, the backdoor man
I-I-I am, the backdoor man
Well, the men don't know
But the little girls they understand
When everybody is-a tryin' to sleep
I'm-a somewhere makin' my midnight creep
An ev'ry mo'nin when the rooster crows
He's tellin' me that it's the time to go
I am, the backdoor man
I am, the backdoor man
Well, the men don't know
But the little girls they understand

Well, they took me to the doctor
Shot full of holes
The nurse she cried, "Save his soul"
I was 'cused of murder in first degree
The judge wife cried, "Let the man go free"
I am, the backdoor man
I am, the backdoor man
Well, the men don't know
But the little girls they understand

I was accused a-murder in the first degree
The judge wife cried, "Let the man go free"
The cop's wife cried, "Don't take him down
I'd-a rather be in six feet of ground"
I am, the backdoor man
I am, the backdoor man
Well, the men don't know
But the little girls they understand

I am, the backdoor man
I am, the backdoor man
Well, the men don't know
But the little girls they understand

I am, the backdoor man
I am, the backdoor man
Well, the men don't know
But the little girls they understand

I am
I am
I-I-I am
The backdoor manEmbed
