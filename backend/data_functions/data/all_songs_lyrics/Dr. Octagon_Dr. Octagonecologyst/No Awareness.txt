No Awareness Lyrics
"What's your theory, Doctor?
Strangulation by terrifically powerful hands
But it's peculiar that this left deltoid muscle should be missing
It's been torn right out
Gentlemen, it wasn't torn. This is cannibalism!"

Your organic medical talk propels off my arms
The atom bomb final Lionel Richie not couth for this battle
I rattle, sing sing sing like bing bing bing
Ricochet Rabbit, grab it, lock up, pop up
Watch you jam like Autechre, with old energy it's me
Lyrically bionically you're panicked B
You end up and nobody is home as I react
Fertilizing your chrome, dome boils sore medicated
All flows rose and have a tweakin' speakin'
Puerto Rican the powerful machine gun stun
Ba-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, ambulance, lights bright
Paramedics FedEx your legs with eggs chicken hatch
Can't find two they dead ex, but the skin don't match

And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
Bio-production is greatly increased, magnetic fields
Velocity of projectiles, electro-liquid experiments
Theoretical observances and critical procedures, cool
To 77 Kelvins by submerging steel cylinders
Secure capacitated it in the cryogenic containing the crude samples
One millimeter in diameter
Since the last explosion, December 3rd, 1992
Reinforce mixing copper nickel-beryllium oxide
Concentric layers, proportional carbon density of the radian
It is therefore existent if it does not produce contradictory statements
Or quantum wave functions, mechanic mind out of matter
This behaviour is accompanied by conscious experience
Remains as perplexing as ever
Ask Copernicus about pushing limits

And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold

Like a 25 pep-a-pep-pep pellets, BB guns
Will stun buns, kickin' up dirt dust, must you see me
Hittin' like beepers, beep beep, vibrate
Take swift shake swift with myth while you smoke a spliff
Change strange and detour fought more
Minds with signs of minds on eight by ten
Class when atomic lines
You keepin' deep thought by but my planet court
Rehearsal is a must, lest my vital is a point to fuss
My inhabitants, past tense
Ever since Presidents
Lyndon B., Jerry, John, George and Carter like Optimus
Diesel reflects auto starter
Megatron, rejuvenate!
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold

Edge, dislocation specifically, opportunity to form
And ultimately fail, under stress depends on science immobile
Epoxy or stock composites
New conductors maximum amp use much finer filaments
18 percent of volume minus three-six-nine degrees
Celsius, a record for resistive electromagnets
A hybrid design, 700 30,000 gauss
For all types of DC residents absorption
Flowing through 15,100 watt light bulbs
Tremendous heat is generated driven by direct
But not oscillating current
Extremely powerful, fascinating
Engineering reflections, acoustic depth by analysis
Vulnerable to legal challenge
High exposure requires mental protection, replica
Artificial dynamic Microsoft tech
Heavy black cables, Nova robot demanding battery power
Acids found in Drosophila, the master gene
My family left Latvia
During the occupation
We were hunted
Like dogs
I just want to buy some...
Sedatives
What do you think I am
A goddamn doctor?
I don't sell sedatives
Tranquillizers
I do have3Embed
