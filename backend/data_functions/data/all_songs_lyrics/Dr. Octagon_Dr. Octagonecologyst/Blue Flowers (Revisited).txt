Blue Flowers (Revisited) Lyrics
"Let me show you somethin'"
"Let me show you somethin'"

Dr. Octagon, paramedic focus of the East
For priests my anesthetics prescribe a certain fertilizer
Homegrown computer wires on the microphone
Utilizing tracks inverted by inimical
High typical force, space sex intercourse
You get lost, and memorize to the Enterprise
Scotty the Captain, Mr. Spock keeps rappin'
4212, the ship moves at warp speed
Dynamic 7, navigation of the compass
Moving in crystals, operating lightspeed
I see the plants, they're growing...
("Let me show you somethin'")
Blue Flowers...
Blue Flowers...
"Let me show you somethin'"

Cyber analog through virtual reality
Different colors of earth, rocks in variety
Medical equal, with helmets on the space people
Galactic at 8, the verdict can't demonstrate
You be confused, and disobeying planet rules
Biochemistry, with stars for publicity
Megasonic bass with data chips in your face
Nuclear LinnDrums that bang hard on dark tracks
Reacting reverb, conscious spots on your nerve
I take a break like James Brown: to the bridge
Sailing takes me away
To where I'm really going... shoobedowop
Up, and away!
In my beautiful balloon!
Optical biofeedback, magnetic borders, x-ray
You see skeletons fly north for the next day
We give passes covered with dioxalyn gases
Return
Here's George Jetson!
Back with intriguing positive minerals
You enter the center search and raiding at random
With no condom, no rubbers will reach the testicles
And affect 'em, by animal means, I'm in your spectrum
As I walk through the garden of orange tomatoes... I see
Blue Flowers
Blue Flowers (twinkle, twinkle)
Blue Flowers (twinkle, twinkle)
Blue Flowers
