Intro Lyrics
So, what do you think, Doctor? Was I bothering? I didn't mean to. 
Scientific detachment—huh! Professional ethics. I'm not just a doctor—I'm a man. 
Doctor, I didn't mean to—!
—I have desires. I have needs. 
I know you have needs—and I know that you have desires. 
You know, it gets bigger and bigger inside of me until it's—I feel that it—it explodes, and I sprayed myself all over the wall. 
I think I have a way to cure you. And I like it when you get bigger and bigger, but I don't want you to explode all over the wall. Now, Doctor, you just lie down. It's time you let me take care of you. 
Let's get that medicine, what I need. 
Ohhhhh... Mmmm. I wish I had a doctor like you... So gentle. Oh, you like that?
Oh, yes... yes...
Fuck my pussy, Doctor!Embed
