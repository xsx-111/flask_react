Blue Flowers Lyrics
"Let me show you somethin'"
"Let me show you somethin'"

Dr. Octagon, paramedic fetus of the East
With priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room
With the strikes of force, scalpels since the holocaust
I do indeed in greed, explore meet the patients
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse
Holding up office lights, standing at huge heights
Back and forth, left wing swing to North
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope
Listen to your heartbeatâ€”delete, beep, beep, beep!
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap
Look at the lamp...
Blue Flowers!
Growing by the purple pond in the purple pastures
Blue Flowers!
Growing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows
Blue Flowers!
Growing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow
Would you care to listen to any more? Think about it
Holding bags on down right from the hospital
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidotes
Two telescopes that magnify size of a roach
Three computers, the cup of coffee planted with my hand and
Astroplanet detached, turn on rear foggers
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves
I see the mascot of evil he's not Kneivel
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see...
Blue Flowers!
It's raining green, by the pond
Blue Flowers!
It's totally raining green, pouring
Blue Flowers!
I smell the bees and the birds
Blue Flowers!
Different aspects of life, blue flowers
