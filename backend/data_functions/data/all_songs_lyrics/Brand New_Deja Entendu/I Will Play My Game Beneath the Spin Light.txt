I Will Play My Game Beneath the Spin Light Lyrics
The time has come for colds and overcoats
We're quiet on the ride
We're all just waiting to get home
Another week away, my greatest fear
I need the smell of summer
I need its noises in my ears
If looks could really kill
Then my profession would be staring
Know we do this cause we care
Not for the thrill
Collect calls to home
Tell them that I realize
That everyone who lives will someday die
And die alone

And we won't let you in
Though we're down and out
No we won't let you in
You win, you win, you win

I wrote more postcards than hooks
I read more maps than books
Feel like every chance to leave
Is another chance I should have took
Every minute is a mile
I've never felt so hollow
I'm an old abandoned church with broken pews
And empty aisles
My secrets for a buck
Watch me as I cut myself wide open
On this stage
Yes, I am paid to spill my guts
I won't see home till spring
Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic
But I am paid to make girls panic
While I sing
And we won't let you in
Though we're down and out
No we won't let you in
And we won't let you in
We don’t want what isn’t ours
We won't let you in
You win, you win, you win

And the coastline is quiet
While we're quietly losing control
And we're silent but sure
We invented the cure
That will wash out my memories of her
"The harpoon is loaded. The cage is lowered
The water is red."
Like you, like you

And we won't let you in
Though we're down and out
No we won't let you in
And we won't let you in
We don’t want what isn’t ours
We won't let you in
You win, you win, you win...3Embed
