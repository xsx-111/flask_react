Guernica Lyrics
Ever since I was young your word is the word that always won
Worry and wake the ones you love
A phone call I'd rather not receive
Please use my body while I sleep
My lungs are fresh and yours to keep
Kept clean and they will let you breathe

Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?
I am the watch you always wear, but you forget to wind

Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes

I submit no excuse
If this is what I have to do
I owe you every day I wake
If I could I would shrink myself
And sink through your skin to your blood cells
And remove whatever makes you hurt but
I am too weak to be your cure


I'm not letting you check out
You will beat this, starting now
And you will always be around
I'm there to monitor your breathing
I will watch you while you're sleeping
I will keep you safe and sound

Does anybody remember back when you were very young?
Did you ever think that you would be this blessed?
