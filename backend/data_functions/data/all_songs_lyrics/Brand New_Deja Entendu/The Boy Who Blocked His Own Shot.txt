The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot Lyrics
If it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand
I hope you find out what you want, I already know what I am
And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again
You can tell me how vile I already know that I am
I'll grow old, start acting my age
Be a brand new day in a life that you hate
A crown of gold, a heart that's harder than stone
And it hurts a whole lot but it's missed when it's gone

Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes, you can forget

And if it makes you less sad, I'll move out of the state
You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way
And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down
Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out
It's cold as a tomb and it's dark in your room
When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds
So call it quits or get a grip
Say you wanted a solution, you just wanted to be missed
Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes, you can forget
So you can forget, you can forget

You are calm and reposed, let your beauty unfold
Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones
Spring keeps you ever close, you are second-hand smoke
You are so fragile and thin, standing trial for your sins
Holding onto yourself the best you can
You are the smell before rain, you are the blood in my veins

Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes, you can forget25Embed
