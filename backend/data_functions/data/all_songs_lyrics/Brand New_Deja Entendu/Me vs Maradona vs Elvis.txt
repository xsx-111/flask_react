Me vs Maradona vs Elvis LyricsWith one or two, I get used to the room
We go slow when we first make our moves
By five or six, bring you out to the car
Number nine with my head on the bar
And it's sad but true, out of cash and IOUs
I got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar, get you out of the cold
My sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home

I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear, I'll tear you apart
Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk, and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free

I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say12Embed
