Good to Know That If I Ever Need Attention All I Have to Do Is Die LyricsAm I correct to defend the fist that holds this pen?
It's ink that lies
The pen, the prose, the paper
I live, I learn
You will always take what I have earned
And so aid my end while I believe I'm winning
Our friends speak out in our defense
Pay ten deaf ears for two months rent
We burn the gallows they erect
And cut the nooses they tie for our necks

You constantly make it impossible to make conversation
Keep us comatose but audible
And I like it the farther I get out
We pass it off but it's all on us
Only common conversation
It took everything I got
And I like it the farther I get out
Once said, always said
I will hold the past over your head
I'll speak my mind whenever I feel slighted
I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge
Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you
I slip concealed back to the keep
Concede to do the work for free
We prey as wolves among the sheep
And slit the necks of soldiers while they sleep
