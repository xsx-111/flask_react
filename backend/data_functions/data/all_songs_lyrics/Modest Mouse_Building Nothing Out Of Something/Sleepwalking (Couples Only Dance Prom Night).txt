Sleepwalking (Couples Only Dance Prom Night) Lyrics
I fell in love and I needed a roadmap
To find out where you lived
So excited though

Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking

The white trash boys listen to their headphones
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
I hung around there wasting my time
Hoping you'll stop by

'Cause I'm sleepwalking
I'm sleepwalking

A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside

Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking1Embed
