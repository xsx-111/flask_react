Broke Lyrics
Broke account, so I broke a sweat
I've bought some things that I'll sort of regret about now

Broke your glasses, but it broke the ice
You said that I was an asshole and I'd paid the price

Broken hearts want broken necks
I've done some things that I want to forget, but I can't

Broke my pace and ran out of time
Sometimes I'm so full of shit that it should be a crime

Broke a promise 'cause my car broke down
Such a classic excuse, it should be bronze by now

Broke up and I'm relieved somehow
It's the end of the discussions that just go round and round
And round, and round, and round, and round
And round, and round, it shouldn't have been anyway
No way, no way, that's right, that's right
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
It was like everything was evidence of broken time

You're living on fancy wine, you'll drink that turpentine
You're starting conversations, you don't even know the topic11Embed
