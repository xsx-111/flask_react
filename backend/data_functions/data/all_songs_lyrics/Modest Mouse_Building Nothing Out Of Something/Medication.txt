Medication Lyrics
This is the part of me that needs medication
This is the part of me that believes in heaven
This is the part of me that thinks outer space is all dead
This is the part of me that wishes it was with it
This is the part of me that's trying to be funny
This is the part of me that loves my parents
This is the part of me that thinks that ants are cavemen
This is the part of me that thinks all humans are ants
This is the part of me that learns from sitcoms
This is the part of me that means nothing

And I don't know
Where I could go away and you could wish that I had stayed
Or just stayed gone
And I don't know
And I don't know at all
So, out of the context
And into what you meant
And you know your reasons
You don't know who you are but you know who you want to be
I don't know
So you go to the library to get yourself a book
And you look and you look but you didn't find anything to read
And I don't know at all
Left all my kinder parts rusting and peeling
That guy was complaining as he looked at the ceiling
My nose isn't that big, it looks nothing like me
We're all doctors trading sadness for numbness
Grass looks much greener but it's green-painted cement
The mayor's machines are there cleaning the pavement
You can't make dirt clean so we'll just lemon-scent it2Embed
