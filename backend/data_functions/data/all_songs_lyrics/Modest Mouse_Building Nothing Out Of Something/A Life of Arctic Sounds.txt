A Life of Arctic Sounds Lyrics
As long as you're gone
I can't apologize
For all the things that I haven't said and done

And 100 miles is a long drive inside a car
200 miles is a long drive inside a car
300 miles is a long drive inside a car
400 miles is a long drive inside a car
500 miles is a real, long drive in a car
600 miles is a long drive inside a car
700 miles is a long drive inside a car
800 miles is a long drive inside a car
900 miles is a long, long, long, long ways in a car
And 1000 miles is a long drive inside a car!
1100 miles is too far inside a car

I wrote my name on the sun
Hey, all right, I might be goddamned
A life of arctic sounds
Hey, all right, I might be goddamned
All the sad comedians
Hey, all right, I might be goddamned
I wrote my name on the sun
Hey, all right, I might be goddamned
A life of arctic sounds
Hey, all right, I might be goddamned
All the sad comedians
Hey, all right, I might be...
