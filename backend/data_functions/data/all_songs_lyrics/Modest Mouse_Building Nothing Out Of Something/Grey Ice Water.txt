Grey Ice Water Lyrics
You're standing by the grey ice water
Out in the wind, above the ground, out in the weather
You had yourself a crazy lover
Becoming froze trying hard to forget her

You got a job up in Alaska
It's easy to save what the cannery pays
'Cause there ain't nowhere to spend it

You're standing by the grey ice water
Out in the wind, above the ground, out in the weather
You had yourself a crazy lover
Becoming froze trying hard to forget her

You took the path of least resistance
On the phone, cutting out talking
Short to long distance

At home on a boat, at home, it's a fish trap
At home on a boat, it's a fish trap
At home on a boat, it's a fish trap
On the arctic glass
On the arctic glass
On the arctic glass
On the arctic glass
On the arctic glass
On the arctic glass
On the arctic glass1Embed
