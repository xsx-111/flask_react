Whenever I Breathe Out, You Breathe In (Positive/Negative) Lyrics
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey

I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
If I did, I'd have nothing to say
I didn't feel angry or depressed
I didn't feel anything at all
I didn't want to go to bed
And I didn't want to stay up late
When you're living your life, well, that's the price you'll pay

Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all away
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all away

Your feelings are positive, negative, positive, negative
I'm feeling this positive, negative, positive, negative
Your seasons are positive, negative, positive, negative
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all away
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all away

I didn't go to work for a month
I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone
If I did, I'd have nothing to say5Embed
