Be Good To Yourself Lyrics
Running out of self-control
Getting close to an overload
Up against a no win situation
Shoulder to shoulder, push and shove
I'm hangin' up my boxing gloves
I'm ready for a long vacation

Be good to yourself when, nobody else will
Oh be good to yourself
You're walking a high wire, caught in a cross fire
Oh be good to yourself

When you can't give no more
They want it all but you gotta say no
I'm turning off the noise that makes me crazy
Lookin' back with no regrets
To forgive is to forget
I want a little peace of mind to turn to

Be good to yourself when, nobody else will
Oh be good to yourself
You're walking a high wire, caught in a cross fire
Oh be good to yourself
Be good to yourself when, nobody else willEmbed
