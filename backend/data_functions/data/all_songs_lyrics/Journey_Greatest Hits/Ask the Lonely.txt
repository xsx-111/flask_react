Ask the Lonely Lyrics
You've been picked and it's over
What's that chip on your shoulder?
Outside were solid rainbows
Inside is where the heart grows
Picking up the pieces
Something more to believe in

As you search the embers
Think what you've had, remember
Hang on, don't let go now
You know, with every heartbeat, we love
Nothing comes easy
Hang on, ask the lonely

You've got some fascination
With your high expectations
This love is your obsession
Your heart, your prized possession
Let down your defenses
Won't be up to the one who cares

When you are feeling love's unfair
You just ask the lonely
When you are lost in deep despair
You just ask the lonely

Ask the lonely
When you are down in deep despair
Ask the lonely
