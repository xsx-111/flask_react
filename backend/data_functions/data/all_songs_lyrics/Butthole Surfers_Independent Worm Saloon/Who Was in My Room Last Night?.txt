Who Was in My Room Last Night? LyricsI'm flying...
I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
Flying away, I'm flying away
I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
All night long my body burned, my sheets were wet and cold
The lights were on, my eyes were gone
And any second, lose control
The pounding at my window is just the pounding in my head
I wonder who was in my room last night?
Who the hell was in my bed?
There must have been a body there, I swear I felt some flesh
It took a little time, but I figured they were mine
There were fingers going down my chest
My mouth went through the ceiling
And my body fell through the floor
I couldn't find a key 'cause there was no hole I could see
And someone had moved the door
The cops, the priest, the crisis line
No one really had a clue
No one could tell us who was touching me
Or exactly what I should do
My throat was dry, my hopes were high
But nothing really ever got said
But who was in my room last night?
Who the hell was in my bed? Ow5Embed
