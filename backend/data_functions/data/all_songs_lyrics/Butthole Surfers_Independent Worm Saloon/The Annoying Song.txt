The Annoying Song LyricsHoly man get you hands down out of 25 (some strange yelling type thing) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Go ahead and leave ya
When she said to see me
Said ya gone ahead and leave ya baby
Right on your gun
Believe me
Go ahead and leave ya
When she had to see me
Said ya gonna have a lady baby (some other weird yell)
Go ahead and leave ya
When she had to see me
Said ya gone and had to leave ya baby
Right on your gun
Believe me
Go ahead and leave ya
Do ya gone and had a lady baby now AAAAAAAAAAAA!
Go ahead and leave ya
When she had to see me
Said ya gone ahead and leave ya baby
Right on your gun
Believe me
Go ahead and see ya
When she had to see me
Said you had a lady baby (2 scream come from the person listing or singing the song)
Go ahead and leave ya
When she had to see me
Said ya gone ahead and leave ya baby
Right on your gun
Believe me
Gone ahead and leave ya
When she had to see me
Said you gone ahead and leave ya baby
Why the fuck did I drive by
Go ahead and leave ya
When she had to see me
Said ya gone ahead and leave ya baby
Right on your gun
But hey
Gone ahead and leave ya
When she had to see me sayin'
