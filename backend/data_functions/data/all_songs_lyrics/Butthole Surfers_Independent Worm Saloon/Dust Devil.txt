Dust Devil Lyrics

I drove out to the canyon ground
Grinding dust off from the sand
I don't ever fuck with the Dust Devil
He's got the power of an upright in his goddamn hand

The sand becomes a potent elixir
Wind as hot as flame
The bodies fly right through the night
All faceless and without name
I grab onto a foreign handle
Walking all through a door
Discovered I was just buying a pint
Of turkey at the liquor store



I drove out to the canyon, baby
And hit the motherfucking road
I paid my fine and all the lights
Look exactly like a picture show
The desert skies before my eyes
They turned into a sea
A flaming mass of oil and gas
Screams with ecstasy
