Alcohol LyricsAlcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a bitch, so
Alcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a gun
Hey, hey, baby don’t you think I really am, I gotta know
Late last summer, don’t you know I saw it coming?
Didn’t hear it on the radio
Alcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a bitch, so
Alcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a gun
Hey, hey, baby don’t you really, really ever understand?
Late last summer, don’t you know it was a bummer?
Don’t you believe it got a little out of hand?
Why, why, darling does he always ever feel the same?
Everywhere I turn, don’t you know I love the burnin'
Goddamn it, I’m going insane
Alcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a bitch, so
Alcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a gun
Hey, hey, baby don’t you think I really am, I gotta know
Late last summer, don’t you know I saw it coming?
Didn’t hear it on my radio
Alcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a bitch, so
Alcohol
It burns my lips, so
Alcohol
It’s a son of a gun
Why, why daughter, don’t you think I know it’s time to go?
You should have seen it coming, and I know you’re kind of bumming
But at least you got my stereo
Hey, hey, baby doll, you know all I have to do is call
I took a lot of pain but you know I’ve got a friend
And his name is alcoholEmbed
