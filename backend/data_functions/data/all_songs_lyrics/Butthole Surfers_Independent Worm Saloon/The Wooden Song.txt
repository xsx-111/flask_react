The Wooden Song Lyrics
Take me, break me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll cry
Go with me, show me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll die
Lately I've been dancing in ceiling fans
Into the kitchen and out the back gate
Well I know it sounds strange but it could be the other way
Round to the ground where I know I must stay

Take me, break me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll cry
Go with me, show me
Tell me a good one and maybe I'll die
Lately I've been dancing in ceiling fans
Circled in secrets, playing a game
Well I know it sounds strange but it could be the other way
Round in a town where they don't know your name

Together
For a while
Ain't no good1Embed
