Dancing Fool LyricsYeah
Now I'm a dancin' fool!
Whoo!
Dance to the beat
Dance against something
Whoo!
Like before
I know she'll be back for more
Whoo!
Dance like cancer!
But now I'm a dancin' fool!
Just like cancer
I am the dancing fool
Dance with me
I am the disco king
Right before
I know she'll be back for moreEmbed
