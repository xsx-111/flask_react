Oh Caroline LyricsOh Caroline
My life shined when you walked in
Oh Caroline
My world shined when you came in
And if I go all over the world
I wouldn't find another lover like you
And if I knew a million girls, Caroline
Go to the end of the world for your love
Go to the end of the world for your love
Oh Caroline
My heart climbed when you came in
Oh Caroline
Life means more since you came in
And if I go all over the world
I wouldn't find another lover like you
And if I knew a million girls, Caroline
(Go to the end of the world) for your love
(Go to the end of the world) for your love
(Go to the end of the world) for your love, love, love oh Caroline
(Go to the end of the world) for your love
Can you feel my heart strings?
They're on fire
You threw it all away
(Go to the end of the world) oh Caroline, oh Caroline
(Go to the end of the world) love, love, love, love oh Caroline
(Go to the end of the world) love
(Go to the end of the world) for your love, loveEmbed
