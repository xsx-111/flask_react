Downed Lyrics
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head

I'm gonna live on a mountain
Way down under in Australia
It's either that or suicide
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, I got a mind
Over you it's not the first time
Ooh, I got a mind

Rainbow's crawling on a midday sun
But I've been lucky you're the only one
Sunday's calling, you'll be number one
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, you think of Jesus Christ
You walk on water but don't bet your life
All you walk is a fine line
It's such a strange strain on you

Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head
Too many people want to save the world
Another problem is a boy or girl
Some say the weekend is the only world
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, I've got a mind
Over you it's not the first time
All you walk is a fine line
It's such a strange strain on you

Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head
Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head
Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head
Downed, downed out of my head
'Round, 'round out of my head...Embed
