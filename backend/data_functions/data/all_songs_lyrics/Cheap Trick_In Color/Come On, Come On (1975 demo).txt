Come On, Come On (1975 demo) LyricsOo baby, feelin' so good;
Don't you ruin it tonight, tonight
It's been so long since I don't know when;
Oo treat me, treat me, treat me right
Don't ever lose me 'cause you're the one
Show me you're really mine, you're mine;
Come on, come on
Well, I know you can do it;
Come on, come on
Well, there ain't nothin' to it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah well I know you believe me
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, you can see the real me
Oo baby, come right here;
You were so lonely but now you're here
It's been so long since I don't know when;
Oo come on, come on, do it again
Don't ever lose me 'cause you're the one
Show me you're really mine, you're mine;
Come on, come on
Well, I know you can do it;
Come on, come on
Well, there ain't nothin' to it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah well I know you believe me
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, you can see the real me
Oo baby, feelin' so good;
Don't you ruin it tonight, tonight
It's been so long since I don't know when;
Oo treat me, treat me, treat me right
Don't ever lose me 'cause you're the one
Show me you're really mine, you're mine;
Come on, come on
Well, I know you can do it;
Come on, come on
Well, there ain't nothin' to it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah well I know you believe me
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
You can see the real me, the real me
