Big Eyes Lyrics
It's not the way you look, no
It's not the way you walk
Your eyes are somethin' good
You know they're clear and bright
It's not the color of your hair

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those big eyes
They keep calling my name
Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name

You're such a losing cause
Why don't you go get lost?
Who says you write the laws?
You're such a losing cause
Go on, get out of here

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name
You're such a losing cause
Why don't you go get lost?
Who says you write the laws?
You're such a losing cause
Go on, get out of here

It's not the way you look
It's not the way you walk
Your eyes are somethin' good
You know they're clear and bright
It's not the color of your hair

Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name
Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name
Big eyes
I keep fallin' for those
Big eyes
They keep calling my name
