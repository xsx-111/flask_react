Southern Girls (1975 demo) LyricsI've been north
I've been east to the california beach
There's only one place i know where to find you
And all you southern girls got a way with your words
And you show it
You say hump and I'll jump
You say go and I'll know
Waste no time getting
So close to you
And you'll never run way
When you find out why I wanted to find you
Ooh baby need some brand new shoes
Get out on the street
You got nothing to lose
You rock me and your crazy
And everyone says it, yeah yeah
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose
I've been up I've been down
I've been weak I've been strong
But I never met someone like you
And you'll never run away
When you find why I wanted to find you
You say hump and I'll jump
You say go and I'll know
Waste no time getting
So close to you
All you southern girls
Got a way with your words
And you show it
Ooh baby need some brand new shoes
Get out on the street
You got nothing to lose
You rock me and your crazy
And everyone says it, yeah yeah
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose
You think this boy, he loves you
Southern girls
You make it hard oh, so hard
I've been north, I've been east to the california beach
There's only one place i know where to find you
And all you southern girls got a way with your words
And you show it
Ooh baby need some brand new shoes
Get out on the street
You got nothing to lose
You rock me and your crazy
And everyone says it, yeah yeah
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose
Southern girls
Southern girls
