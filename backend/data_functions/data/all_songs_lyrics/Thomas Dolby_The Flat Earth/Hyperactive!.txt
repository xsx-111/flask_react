Hyperactive! LyricsHmm, tell me about your childhood
Oh
At the tender age of three
I was hooked to a machine
Just to keep my mouth from spouting junk
Ha, must have took me for a fool
'Cause they chucked me out of school
'Cause the teacher knew I had the funk
But tonight, I'm on the edge
You better shut me in the fridge
'Cause I'm burning up
Ow, I'm burning up
With the vision in my brain
And the music in my veins
And the dirty rhythm in my blood
They are messing with my heart
And they're messing with my heart
And they're messing with my heart
Won't stop messing with my
Oh, ripping me apart
Hyperactive when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm grown
Hyperactive and the night is young
And in a minute, I'll blow
And they're messing with my heart
(So how long have you been having these delusions?)
Keep on messing with my heart
(Hmm, please tell me more about your mother)
Oh, ripping, ripping, ripping, ripping, ripping me apart
Semaphore out on the floor
Messages from outer space
Deep heat for the feet
The rhythm of your heartbeat
'Cause the music of the street
It isn't any rapattack (Oh)
It isn't any rapattack (Oh)
Rap-a, rap-a, rap-a, t-t-t-t-t-tack
I can reach into your homes
Like an itch in your headphones
You can't turn it up, ow
Yuh-huh, I'm the shape in your back room
I'm the breather on the phone
And I'm burning up, ow
But there's one thing I must say
'Fore they lock me up again
You'd be safer at the back
When I'm having an
Attack, attack, attack, attack
Hyperactive when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm tall
Hyperactive as the day is long
Hyperactive in my bones
Hyperactive in your phones
Hyperactive and the night is young
Hyperactive when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm grown
Hyperactive 'til I'm dead and gone
Stand up, hyperactivate
Get up, hyperactivate
Wise up, hyperactivate
London, hyperactivate
Hyperactive when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm tall
Hyperactive as the day is long
Hyperactive in my bones
Hyperactive in your phones
Hyperactive and the night is young
Hyperactive when I'm small
Hyperactive, now I'm grown1Embed
