The Angel and the Fool Lyrics
Leaning out the window, watch the dying of the sun
Balancing the weight of the pill on her tongue
She'll be getting that look in her eyes
Cold and lonely, but I don't know why

See her near the border at the end of the line
She falls down and I can't do enough
But I won't ever let her give up
The angel and the fool

You're running out, keep running
You're running out, keep running
You're running out, keep running
You're running out, keep running out

She found herself in a world full of men
Watching them slowly destroy all her plans
'Cause all the love she won't allow
Herself to even dream about
Well both of us are older now, and it won't be long
The early morning siren
Is growing louder now
'Cause waking up is hard enough when there's no one else around
See her near the border at the end of the line
She falls down and I can't do enough
But I won't ever let her give up
The angel and the fool

You're running out, keep running
You're running out, keep running
You're running out, keep running
You're running out, keep running out2Embed
