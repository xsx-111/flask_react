The Changing Lights Lyrics
What did the storm wash away?
Are you bailing out
Out of the plans we've already made?
It won't bother me now
And you know I'll be okay
You gotta lead your life
But you're not sure you know the way

Well, you want to walk in white
You wanna sin, but you're too shy
So the candle just keeps burning down on you

My cards are on the table
I'm here tonight
But I don't need anything from you
Down on the bowery
The changing lights
And I'll still be waiting here for you

I saw that look on your face
You don't need me now
And sometimes you wonder if it's all
Just another mistake
And why can't you just walk away?
You gotta measure the cost
What have you gained, what have you lost
Well, I often wonder why
You want to win, but you won't fight
So the candle just keeps burning down on you

My cards are on the table
I'm here tonight
But I don't need anything from you
Down on the bowery
The changing lights
And I'll still be waiting here for you
My cards are on the table
I'm here tonight
But I don't need anything from you
Down on the bowery
The changing lights
And I'll still be waiting here for you10Embed
