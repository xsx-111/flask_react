Holding on for Life Lyrics
Girl take a seat, rest your weary bones
Your secret's safe in my hands
Tell me 'bout the years and let me buy an hour
Maybe help me to understand

Ain't nobody callin', ain't nobody home
What a lovely day to be lonely
You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love
You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love

Light another cigarette, burning in the cold
Waiting on the street for your man
You're trying not to look so young and miserable
You gotta get your kicks while you can

And in the Latin Quarter
Sitting on your own
What a lovely day to be lonely
You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love
You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love

Well you might belong to another time
Still you have to carry on, yeah
Nowhere else to go and you never know
What to hide and what to show, no

You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love
You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love25Embed
