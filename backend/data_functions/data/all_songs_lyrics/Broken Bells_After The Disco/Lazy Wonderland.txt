Lazy Wonderland Lyrics
I'm down by the fire
At the ocean side
Just waiting for that underwater world to say goodnight
Don't you hear that sound
From the tide and sand
They'll tell us to keep rolling and rolling if we can
So I've learned to keep my head in this lazy wonderland

Well you had to know that I had to know
The trick's for us not to be found out
And there's a place we can go
The trip is long but we can find a way

Tonight we'll go
Laughing all the way, my love
Tomorrow we'll go
Back in time to live today

Dew on the melon rind
In the morning light
Lying stubborn at the ending of another lovely night
And I've misplaced my mind
Don't know how or why
And when it wanders back I hope it's still a friend of mine
Well you had to know that I had to know
The trick's for us not to be found out
And there's a place that we can go
The trip is long but we can find a way

Tonight we'll go
Laughing all the way, my love
Tomorrow we'll go
Back in time to live today2Embed
