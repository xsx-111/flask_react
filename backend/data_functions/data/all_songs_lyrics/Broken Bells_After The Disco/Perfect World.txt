Perfect World Lyrics
Oh, London moon, help me stumble home
Let me lose myself along the way
I've got nothing left, it's kind of wonderful
'Cause there's nothing they can take away... away

The open doors left me wanting more
Never thought they'd close them all the way
The ordinary life they want for you
Is it too much to have to bear

But it's another way to win a useless fight
You've been lying so long don't know when you're faking
See the water on the rise
Just another day into a useless night
I've been pushing so hard now my hands are shaking
See the water on the rise

But I've been turned around, I was upside down
I thought love would always find a way
But I know better now, got it figured out
It's a perfect world all the same

But I've been turned around, I was upside down
I thought love would always find a way
But I know better now, got it figured out
It's a perfect world all the same

I was hoping for an easy rambling life
Till the notion came to my mind
We look for exit signs, but we can't be changed
Into nothing overnight
Though we know it's over, it keeps exploding
Every morning when we rise4Embed
