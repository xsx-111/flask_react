The Remains of Rock & Roll Lyrics
It's too long to wait around for everyone to decide
I'm off to the promise land if anyone needs a ride
It's a small car but we'll fit inside if we leave our bags behind
We'll entertain ourselves just watching the world go by

Is something wrong?
You don't look like you're having fun
The road is long
Gotta let go of the things you've done

We prefer good love to gold
And the remains of the rock and roll
When the moment's right
In the middle of the night
We can almost see the way to go

So long to everyone, 'cause they don't know who we are
Tell them you're sorry, but you'll have to break their hearts
Sister, you're old enough to take the wheel and drive
Your hands, your heart, your eyes, have made me realize

I hear your call
All of my senses are turned on
We're on a roll
Suddenly Earth is far below
We prefer good love to gold
And the remains of the rock and roll
When the moment's right
In the middle of the night
We can almost see the way to go

Can't you see me floating?
Forwards, backwards
Won't you lend a hand and help me out?
Hear me on your doorstep?
Knocking, knocking
Won't you open up and help me out?2Embed
