Leave It Alone Lyrics
All this time I'd never let you go
And now the same chains that I kept you in
They're holding down my soul
I set you up, I gave you life, I dragged you out the fire
And now you knocked me down, and you shut me out
And I can see it in your eyes
Somehow you got it in your head
That you could make it on your own
You were sheltered, loved and fed
But you just couldn't leave it alone

Leave it alone, leave it alone
Leave it alone, leave it alone
Leave it alone, leave it alone
Leave it alone, leave it alone

Well your heart was here
Resting on my lap
And I'd do it all again
But I'm never coming back
Well I know I'm lying
Lying in the cold
Yeah there's snow on the ground, and if I know myself
I'll be leaving down the road
I've been all around the world
But I got nowhere to go
I gave into this lonely life
And you can't change me now, so leave it alone

Leave it alone, leave it alone
Leave it alone, leave it alone
Leave it alone, leave it alone
Leave it alone, leave it alone

The ghosts are on the green
Each and every night
Oh, the distant light
That's the hardest part to take
That's the heart of all my pain
Lying in the cold
Oh, the distant light
In a hue we can't describe, still we know

Could it all be over now
We've seen it all the while
There's no dimension to the clouds
The moon and world around
That's the heart of all my pain
'Cause I don't want to go
Oh, the distant light
In a hue we canâ€™t describe, still we know5Embed
