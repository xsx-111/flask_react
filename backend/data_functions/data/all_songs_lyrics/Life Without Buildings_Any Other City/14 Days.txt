14 Days LyricsOh, oh, it's never unfair
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Do you know, do you know, it's never unfair
On a cloudy day, all that time ago, be yeah
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Do you know I'm leaving you in 14 days?
Take all the precious things, nothing less
I need to think, green child
The things you do, green child
I need to think
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Do you know, do you know, it's never unfair
Cloudy day, all that time ago, be yeah
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Do you know I'm leaving you in 14 days?
Take all the precious things, nothing less
I need to think, green child
The things you do, green child
The things you do
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Oh, oh, it's never unfair
Do you know, do you know, it's never unfair
In a foreign part, going blind, it's never unfair
Do you know I'm leaving you in 14 days?
Take all the precious things, nothing less
I need to think, green child
The things you do, green child
I need to think, fade
I'm leaving you in 14 days
Take all the precious things, nothing less
I need to think, green child
The things you do, green child
The things you do
It's your game, it's your game
It's your game, it's your game
It's your game, it's your game
It's your game, it's your game
It's your game, it's your game
It's your game, it's your game
It's your game, it's your game
It's your game1Embed
