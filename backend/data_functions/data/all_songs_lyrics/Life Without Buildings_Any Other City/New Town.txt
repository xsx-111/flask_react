New Town LyricsI forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot
I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot
When you lately i forgot
Happening again in a slow diagonal
I forgot it's happening again
Slow diagonal I forgot I forgot
When you I never used to
Only I used to think there's nowhere to go
Happening in a slow diagonal
I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot when you I forgot
Lately looking in your eyes
I've been feeling neo
I've been feeling neo
I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot
When you I used to think S S S S
I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot
Happening again in a slow diagonal
I forgot
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out!
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
I'm looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your eyes
With a feeling
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
I'm looking in your eyes
You do what you have to do
You do what you have to, do it, do it!
You do what you have to do
You do what you have to, do it, do it!
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
Do what you have to do
You do what you have to, do it, do it!
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your eyes
With a feeling
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your eyes
With a feeling
I saw you today, you were like snow
I saw you today, you were like snow
And never but oh... like a snow
I saw you, g-gui-gui, I saw you
I saw you today, you were like
The Sun's on my face, till Monday
I've been feeling neo
My tongue, my tongue, my tongue
Hair is long, I've been feeling
High sister, you're the high sister
I saw you today, you were like snow
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out
Every color of you fall out step out!
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
I'm looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
Looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your eyes
With a feeling
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
I'm looking in your eyes
You do what you have to do
You do what you have to, do it, do it!
You do what you have to do
You do what you have to, do it, do it!
Boy you drum, boy you drum, I love what you drum, drummer boy
Boy you drum, boy you drum, I love what you drum, drummer boy
Looking in your eyes, looking in your eyes
Oh ah, you boy you drum
You do what you have to do
You do what you have to, do it, do it!
You do what you have to do

If I rewind again, if I rewind again
I forgot, rhythm and knowledge
Rhythm and knowledge regenerate there
Rhythm and knowledge regenerate
Right on babe, rhythm and knowledge
If I rewind my baby
If I rewind, rhythm and knowledge, get
I rewind my baby
Every color of you4Embed
