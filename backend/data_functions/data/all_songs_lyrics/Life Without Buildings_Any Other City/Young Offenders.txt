Young Offenders LyricsWhy tonight, why tonight
Why tonight, what's so different tonight?
Why tonight, I waited for you
Bring in, seen you all my life
Night scene stealer, night scene stealer
In any other city, I care
In any other city, I'm hung up with a short click
So why tonight, why tonight
Why tonight, what's so different?
Bring in, seen you all my life
Night scene stealer, night scene stealer
Bring in, seen you all my life
Night scene stealer, night scene stealer
In any other city, I care
In any other city, I'm hung up with a sharp click
Why tonight, why tonight
Why tonight, I waited for you
Bring it, seen you all my life
Night scene stealer, night scene stealer
Bring it, seen you all my life
Night scene stealer, night scene stealer
In any other city, I care
In any other city in the world, I'm hung up with a sharp click
Two six too sick
It's not a number, don't remember this, forget it
It's not a number
Two six too sick
Don't remember this, it does twist
Two six too sick
Don't remember this
So why tonight, why tonight
Why tonight, it gets dark, that's all
In any other city, I care
In any other city in the world, I'm hung up1Embed
