Juno LyricsIt's Juno, it's Juno
I don't wanna be a player, hey, for you
For you
I'm gonna raise it, sadness, remember, already
I think about, already, hey, for you, for you
Your behavior shy kid
Your behavior
I wonder you
Are you real?
Are you real?
For you, sweet thing
For you he wrote notice
For you he wrote something else
It's Juno, it's Juno
I don't wanna be a player, hey, for you
For you
I'm gonna raise it, sadness, remember, already
I think about, already, hey, for you, for you
Your behavior shy kid
Your behavior
I wonder you
Are you real?
Are you real?
Shy kid
For you, sweet thing
For you he wrote notice
For you he wrote something else
Juno, it's Juno
I don't wanna be a player
For you, sweet thing
For you he wrote notice
For you he wrote something else
