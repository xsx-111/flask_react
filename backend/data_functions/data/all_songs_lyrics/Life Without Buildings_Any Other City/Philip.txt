Philip LyricsFor everything!
Darling, darling I
Couldn't understand science
Couldn't understand science
Couldn't understand science
Darling, oh darling I
How come, how come you're so pretty?
How come, how come you're so pretty?
Darling, oh darling I
Couldn't understand science
Couldn't understand science
Couldn't understand science
Darling, ever darling
Science, couldn't understand science
Darling, oh darling I
Couldn't understand science
How come, how come you're so pretty?
How come, how come you're so pretty?
How come, tracing the edge of it
How come, that's how I remember it
Do we need order goodbye
Do we need order, do we need order
Do we need order, do we need order
Do we need order, do we need order goodbye!
Darling, ever darling
Couldn't understand science
Couldn't understand science
Darling, ever darling
Science
Darling, couldn't understand science
Darling, ever darling
Couldn't understand science
Do we need order goodbye
Do we need order, do we need order
Do we need order, do we need order
Do we need order, do we need order goodbye!1Embed
