Sorrow LyricsSorrow, no
Sorrow, no
Causing you sorrow, no
Don't smoke in bed with me
Sorrow, no
Sorrow, no
Causing you sorrow, no
Don't smoke in bed with me
Your phone calls
Don't think they're wearing me out
They're not
But I'm mostly English
Mostly English
Difficult people slip away
Feeling that way about difficult people
Feeling that way about difficult people
Slip away, slip away
You're beautiful
But slip away
You're beautiful
Hearing you through the door
Fast
Slip away
You're beautiful
But slip away
You're beautiful
But you're gonna slip away like that
Feeling that way about difficult people
Come close to the phone
Closer to the phone
Should I
Same time
Don't keep me
Should I
Same time
Don't keep me
A friend from the 11th
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Make up you're higher
You're higher the first time
You're higher
Too many days since
We've met before
Don't be disappointed
We've met before
Don't be disappointed
Keep
Don't keep me
It's the new past
It's the new past
Holding you is like the new past
Holding you is like the new past
What's goin-
What's go-
I'm not leaving
Wha-
Wha-
The many ways
The many
Many ways
Yeah, talking so like that
Talking so like that
The many ways
The many w-w-ways
The many ways
The many ways
S L, the many ways
Eyes like lotus leaves
No, not even like
Lotus leaves
Eyes like lotus leaves
No, not even like
Lotus leaves
The many ways
The many w-w-ways
I see the many ways, ha ha
See things sure
Eyes like lotus leaves, no not even like
Lotus leaves
Eyes like lotus leaves, no not even like
Lotus leaves
The same, make it remind
The many ways, the many w-w-ways, the many ways
Eyes like lotus leaves, no not even like
It's quite decided how the boy can figure
It's quite decided how the boy can figure
V-v-v-v changing it, two beats and the boy can figure
Everything going that way, I found you
It's quite decided how the boy can figure
Two beats and the boy, the sun, the M, the sun, the M
It's OK calling, it's o-
Two beats and the boy can, finally
I thought about you to like the ninth degree
I thought about you to like the ninth degree
Two beats and the beautiful and checkered, the end
Beautiful and checkered
E fade
E fade
Beautiful
Close the door
Beautiful and checkered, fifty
Beautiful and checkered, E fade
She came in under
She kept things happen in a silent way
I'm better like this in a silent way, I'm for your love
I left it, I'm sure
You set the scene
I should, but you set the scene
I can dance, missed that loop but I can dance, ch-ch
I can, you set the scene by chance
Is there something?
Take the time away from me
Take the time away from me
S E fade, E fade
Take the time, make our own rules
Don't walk away from the people you meet, E fade
Without any noise
Sorrow
Nothing happened, nothing happened
You and me in the sea
Nothing happened but
You eighty-three, eighty-three, but maybe I'm one night take it
Sorrow
Without any noise
Eighty-three
Sorrow, no
Sorrow, no
Causing you sorrow, no
Don't smoke in bed, with me
Sorrow, no
Sorrow, no
Causing you sorrow, no
Don't smoke in bed, with me3Embed
