The Leanover LyricsIf I lose you
If I lose you
If I lose you
If I lose you
In the huh, the huh, the huh, mmm
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I
B-b-baby, baby
G G G, so G G G, you you you
If I lose you
If I lose you in the huh, the huh
If I lose you in the street
If I lose you in the street
If I lose you in the street at night
If I lose you in the street
If I lose, don't be sad
If I lose you in the street
If I lose you in the street, hey
If I lose you in the street
G G come here, come in, c'mere
Feel for you
Kiss me, break my mind, close the door
Black steel, break my mind, close the door
Black steel, the sight of you falling out
The sight of you
If I lose you in the street, six
If I lose you in the street
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Wassup? Wassup with you?
Wassup with your friends?
High heels, high heels
Oh I - MBV, MBV, MBV, MBV, MBV, more MBV, hi-fi
I wanna see you
Stand up, stand up, stand up
In the high heels
Don't trade, don't don't I don't trade
Don't trade, don't don't I don't trade
May I?
May I walk with you?
May I walk with you? Uh-oh
In the time it takes to slide it back
In the time - change is recorded at the automat
San Francisco mixed with a uh-oh
In the time it takes to slide it back
In the time it changes, shhh!
Emotional Chi, emotional Chi
Come on baby, don't fuss
The time it takes to slide it back
Say what? Say what?
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
In the time it takes to slide it back
Questions - say what?
I like you mostly late at night
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight with a tight
Budokan warp, Budokan warp
I warp
B B B B B freestyle
I like you mostly late at night
Break my mind, break my mind
In the time it takes to slide it back
Raining in my room, sweet and sleepy
Wassup? Wassup?
I can remember, I can remember four
We can, we can, we can three
Keep us together, keep us together
Keep up, together
In the time it takes to slide it back
In the time it takes to slide it back
In the time it takes to slide it back
Forever
You can be me, swim
The face of you
Ok the face, we can take it back
I can take you to the hills
Days like television
Days like television
D-d-d-d-d-days like television
Face of you, the face of you
In the time it takes to slide it back
In the time it takes to slide it back
The face of you, for, that's all
Should I wait for you, SFL?
Should I wait for you?

Come on, should I?
Never forget who you are
