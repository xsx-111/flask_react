Single File Lyrics
Here in line where stupid shit collides
With dying shooting stars
All we got to show what we really are
Is the same kind of scars
And looking at you all I see is
You're waiting for something

Single file
You're a murder mile
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it

If you're choking up, take this paper cup
But there's a price that you'll pay
For trying hard to become whatever they are
And saying whatever they say
So help yourself to this bitter pill
Or somebody else will

Single file
You're a murder mile
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it
Single file
Single file
