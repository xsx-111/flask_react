Southern Belle Lyrics
Killing a southern belle is all you know how to do
That and give other people hell
It's what they expect from you, too
But I wouldn't have you how you are

I don't want to walk around
I don't even want to breathe
I live in a southern town
Where all you can do is grit your teeth
But I wouldn't have you how you are

How come you're not ashamed of what you are?
And sorry that you're the one she got?

Ain't nobody looking now
Nobody, nothing's said
No one's about to shout
Nobody's seeing red
But I wouldn't have you how you are
You're killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle1Embed
