Alphabet Town Lyrics
Alphabet City is haunted
Constantina feels right at home
She probably won't say you're wrong
But you're already wrong
You're already wrong
And you threw up whatever she shot down

Said, "Show me around this alphabet town"
Said, "Show me around"

There's a name you keep repeating
You got nothing better to do
And you're with someone who'll hear you say it and just not mind
Her hand on your arm
Her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm
And told you her name, you can't pronounce it

I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town

I know what you are, I just don't mind
I won't say you're wrong
I know what you want and it's what I want
So let's go out
I'm ready to go out
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town3Embed
