Needle in the Hay Lyrics
Your hand on his arm
Haystack charm around your neck
Strung out and thin
Calling some friend, trying to cash some check
He's acting dumb
That's what you've come to expect

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay

He's wearing your clothes
Head down to toes a reaction to you
You say you know what he did
But you idiot kid
You don't have a clue
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye
You're pulling him through

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Now on the bus
Nearly touching this dirty retreat
Falling out
6th and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Four more blocks plus the one in my brain
Down downstairs to the man
He's gonna make it all okay
I can't be myself
I can't be myself and I don't want to talk
I'm taking the cure so I can be quiet wherever I want
So leave me alone
You ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
