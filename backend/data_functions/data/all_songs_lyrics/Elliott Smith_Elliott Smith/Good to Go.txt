Good to Go Lyrics
A low riding junkie girl
Rode down south to your little world like a dream

You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me

I wouldn't need a hero
If I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go

All I ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here

She kicked New York like a curse
And you traced her footsteps in reverse up to Queens

You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero
If I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go

All I ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here
Some empty envelopes from some other town
It's all I ever see around here
I'm waiting for something that's not coming1Embed
