Coming Up Roses Lyrics
I'm a junkyard full of false starts
And I don't need your permission
To bury my love under this bare light bulb

The moon is a sickle cell
It'll kill you in time
Your cold white brother will ride in your blood
Like spun glass in sore eyes

While the moon does its division
You're buried below
And you're coming up roses everywhere you go
Red roses follow

The things that you tell yourself
They'll kill you in time
Your cold white brother alive in your blood
Spinning in the night sky

While the moon does its division
You're buried below
And you're coming up roses everywhere you go
Red roses
So you got in a kind of trouble that nobody knows
It's coming up roses everywhere you go
Red rosesEmbed
