The White Lady Loves You More Lyrics
Keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know that's where you'll go tonight
I'll be thrown over just like before

The white lady loves you more

Need a metal man just to pick up your feet
It's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discreet
I know what this metal is for

The white lady loves you more

I'm looking at a hand full of broken plans
And I'm tired of playing it down
You just want her to do anything to you
There ain't nothing that you won't allow

You wake up in the middle of the night
From a dream you won't remember flashing on like a cop's light
You say, "She's waiting and I know what for"
The white lady loves you more
The white ladyEmbed
