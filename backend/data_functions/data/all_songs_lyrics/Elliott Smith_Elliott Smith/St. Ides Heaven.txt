St. Ides Heaven Lyrics
Everything is exactly right
When I walk around here drunk every night
With an open container from 7-11
In St. Ides heaven

I've been out haunting the neighborhood
And everybody can see I'm no good
When I'm walking out between parked cars
With my head full of stars

High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone

You think you know what brings me down
That I want those things you could never allow
You see me smiling, you think it's a frown
Turned upside down

'Cause everyone is a fucking pro
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
And they all got to say what you should and shouldn't do
Though they don't have a clue
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone

And I won't come down for anyone3Embed
