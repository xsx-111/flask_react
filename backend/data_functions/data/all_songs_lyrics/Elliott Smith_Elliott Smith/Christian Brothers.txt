Christian Brothers Lyrics
No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Christian Brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over

Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off

Fake concern says, "What's the matter, man?"
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand
Well, I know how much you care

Don't be cross, this sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, itâ€™s so fucking clear4Embed
