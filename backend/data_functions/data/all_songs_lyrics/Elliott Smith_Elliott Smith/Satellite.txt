Satellite Lyrics
While the hands are pointing up midnight
You're a question mark coming after people you watched collide

You can ask what you want to the satellite

'Cause the names you drop put ice in my veins
And for all you know, you're the only one who finds it strange

When they call it a lover's moon, the satellite
'Cause it acts just like lovers do, the satellite
A burned-out world you know
Staying up all night
The satelliteEmbed
