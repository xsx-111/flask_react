The Biggest Lie Lyrics
I'm waiting for the train
The subway that only goes one way
The stupid thing that'll come to pull us apart
And make everybody late

You spent everything you had
Wanted everything to stop that bad
And now I'm a crushed credit card registered to Smith
Not the name that you call me with

You turned white like a saint
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold-flaked paint
Oh, we're so very precious, you and I
And everything that you do makes me want to die

Oh, I just told the biggest lie
I just told the biggest lie
The biggest lieEmbed
