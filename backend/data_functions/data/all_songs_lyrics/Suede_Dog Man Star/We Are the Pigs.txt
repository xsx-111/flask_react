We Are the Pigs Lyrics
Well, the church bells are calling
Police cars on fire
And as they call you to the eye of the storm
All the people say, "Stay at home tonight."

I say, we are the pigs
We are the swine
We are the stars of the fire
Of the firing line

And as the smack cracks at your window
You wake up with a gun in your mouth
Oh, let the nuclear wind blow away my sins
And I'll stay at home in my house

I say, we are the pigs
We are the swine
We are the stars of the fire
We are the pigs
We are the swine
We are the stars of the fire
Of the firing line

We are the pigs
We are the swine
We are the stars of the fire
But deceit can't save you so...

Hey ho, hey ho
We all watch them burn
Hey ho, hey ho
We all watch them burn
Hey ho, hey ho
We all watch them burn
Hey ho, hey ho
We all watch them burn
We all watch them
We all watch them
We all watch them burn
We'll watch them burnEmbed
