New Generation Lyrics
I wake up every day
To find her back with me
Screaming my name through the astral plane
In this catalogue town, she takes me down
Down through the platinum spires
Down through the telephone wires
And we shake it around on the underground
And like a new generation, rise

And like all the boys in all the cities
I take the poison, take the pity
But she and I, we soon discovered
We'd take the pills to find each other

Oh, but when she is calling
Here in my head
Can you hear her calling
And what she has said?
Oh, but when she is calling
Here in my head
It's like a new generation calling
Can you hear it call?
And I'm losing myself
And I'm losing myself to you
Losing myself
And I'm losing myself

I wake up every day
To find her back again
Breeding disease on her hands and knees
While the styles turn and the books still burn
Yeah, it's there in the platinum spires
It's there in the telephone wires
And we spread it around to the techno sound
And like a new generation, rise

'Cause like all the boys in all the cities
I take the poison, take the pity
But she and I would soon discover
We take the pills to find each other

Oh, but when she is calling
Here in my head
Can you hear her calling
And what she has said?
Oh, but when she is calling
Here in my head
It's like a new generation calling
Can you hear her call?

And I'm losing myself
And I'm losing myself to you
Losing myself
And I'm losing myself to you
To you
To you
To you
