Black or Blue Lyrics
There was a girl who flew the world
From a lonely shore
Through southern snow to Heathrow
To understand the law

There was a boy who loved the noise
Of the underground
He left the coast and overdosed
On that London sound

He said, "I don't care if you're black or blue
Me and the stars stay up for you
I don't care who's wrong or right
And I don't care for the UK tonight
So stay
Stay."

And then one day, she moved away
From those garden walls
She left some flowers, he smoked for hours
She understood the law
I don't care if you're black or blue
Me and the stars stay up for you
I don't care who's wrong or right
And I don't care for the UK tonight
I don't care if you're black or blue
Me and the stars stay up for you
I don't care who's wrong or right
And I don't care for the UK tonight
So stay
Stay
Stay
Stay

There was a girl who flew the worldEmbed
