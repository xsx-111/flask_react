Heroine Lyrics
She walks in beauty like the night
Discarding her clothes in the plastic flowers
Pornographic and tragic in black and white
My Marilyn, come to my slum for an hour

I'm aching
To see my heroine
I'm aching
Been dying for hours and hours

She walks in the beauty of a magazine
Complicating the boys in the office towers
Rafaella or Della, the silent dream
My Marilyn, come to my slum for an hour

I'm aching
To see my heroine
I'm aching
Been dying for hours and hours
Been dying for hours and hours

She walks in beauty like the night
Hypnotizing the silence with her powers
Armageddon is bedding this picture, alright
My Marilyn, come to slum for an hour
I'm aching
To see my heroine
I'm aching
Been dying for hours and hours
I'm eighteen
And I need my heroines
I'm aching
Been dying for hours and nobody knows

I'm never alone now
'Cause I'm with her, with her, with her
And nobody knows
I'm never alone now
'Cause I'm with her, with her, with her
And nobody knows
I'm never alone now
'Cause I'm with her, with her, with herEmbed
