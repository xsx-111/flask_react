The 2 of Us Lyrics
Lying in my bed, I think of you
That song goes through my head, the one we both knew
In each line lies another line full of sacred sound
But you're outside where the companies dream and the money goes round

Lying in my bed
Watching my mistakes
I listen to the band
They said that it could be the two of us

The snow might fall and write the lines on the silent page
But you're outside making permanent love to the nuclear age
Two silhouettes by the cash machine make a lover's dance
It's a tango for the lonely wives of the business class

Lying in my bed
Watching my mistakes
I listen to the band
Lying in my bed
Nothing much to say
So, I listen to the man
He said that it could be the two of us
I heard you call from across the city through the stereo sound
And so, I crawled there, sickeningly pretty as the money went round

Lying in my bed
Watching my mistakes
I listen to the band
And the drums beat in my head
Pianos chime the sound
In this prison of the house
And as the illness comes again
Can you hear me through the rain
As I listen to the band?
As I sing the silent song
Mime each lonely word
Please listen to the man
He said that it could be the two of us

Alone but not lonely
You and me
Alone but not lonely
You and me
Alone but loaded
Alone but loaded1Embed
