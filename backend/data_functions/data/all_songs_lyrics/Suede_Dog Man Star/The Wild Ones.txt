The Wild Ones Lyrics
There's a song playing on the radio
Sky high in the airwaves on the morning show
And there's a lifeline slipping as the record plays
As I open the blinds in my mind, I'm believing that you could stay

And oh, if you stay
I'll chase the rain-blown fields away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh, if you stay
We'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today

There's a song playing through another wall
All we see and believe is the DJ and debts dissolve
And it's a shame the plane is leaving on this sunny day
'Cause on you, my tattoo will be bleeding and the name will stain

And oh, if you stay
We'll ride through disguised suburban graves
We'll go from the bungalows where the debts still grow each day
And oh, if you stay
I'll chase the rain-blown fears away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh, if you stay
We'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today
We'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay
Oh, if you stay1Embed
