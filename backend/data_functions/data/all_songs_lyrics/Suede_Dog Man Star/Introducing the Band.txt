Introducing the Band Lyrics
Dog man star took a suck on a pill
And stabbed a cerebellum with a curious quill
Europe, America, Winterland
Introducing the band

Chic thug stuttered through a stereo dream
A fifty knuckle shuffle, heavy metal machine
The tears of suburbia drowned the land
Introducing the band

So steal me a savage, subservient son
Get him shacked-up, bloodied-up and sucking on a gun
I want the style of a woman, the kiss of a man
Introducing the band

And as the sci-fi lullaby starts to build
See them whipping all the women, cracked governments killed
Oh, let the century die to violent hands
Introducing the band
Introducing the band
Introducing the band
