This Hollywood Life Lyrics
She-rocker, you're wasting your time
'Cause you're only a girl
She-rocker sacked the factory line
For a chance of a dance in a surreal world

She said, "Come rescue, rescue me
From this Hollywood life
Come rescue, rescue me
From this Hollywood life."

She-rocker, hear the audience scream
For the death of the king
But a hand-job is all the butchery brings
'Cause fame ain't as easy as him (how sad)

Oh, come rescue, rescue me
From this Hollywood life
Come rescue, rescue me
From this Hollywood life

Oh, come rescue, rescue me
From this Hollywood life
Come rescue, rescue me
From this Hollywood life

Come take this Hollywood life
Take this Hollywood life
Take this Hollywood life
Come take this Hollywood lifeEmbed
