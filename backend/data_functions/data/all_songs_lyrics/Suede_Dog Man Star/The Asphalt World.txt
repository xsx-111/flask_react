The Asphalt World Lyrics
I know a girl, she walks the asphalt world
She comes to me, I supply her with Ecstasy
Sometimes, we ride in a taxi to the ends of the city
Like big stars in the backseat, like skeletons, ever so pretty
I know a girl, she walks the asphalt world

But where does she go?
And what does she do?
And how does she feel when she's next to you?
And who does she love in her time-honoured fur?
Is it me or her?

I know a girl, she walks the asphalt world
She's got a friend, they share mascara, I pretend
Sometimes, they fly from the covers to the winter of the river
For these silent stars of the cinema
It's in the bloodstream, it's in the liver
I know a girl, she walks the arse-felt world

But where does she go?
And what does she do?
And how does she feel when she's next to you?
And who does she love in her time-honoured fur?
Is it me or her?
With ice in her blood
And a dove in her head
Well, how does she feel when she's in your bed?
When you're there in her arms
And there in her legs
Well, I'll be in her head

'Cause that's where I go
And that's what I do
And that's how it feels when the sex turns cruel
Yes, both of us need her, this is the asphalt world

With ice in her blood
And a dove in her head
Well, how does she feel when she's in your bed?
When you're there in her arms
And there in her legs
Well, I'll be in her head

'Cause that's where I go
And that's what I do
And that's how it feels when the sex turns cruel
Yes, both of us need her, this is the asphalt world2Embed
