The Power Lyrics
Through endless Asia
Through the fields of Cathay
Or enslaved in a pebble-dash grave
With a kid on the way
If you're far over Africa
On the wings of the youth
Or if you're down in some satellite town
And there's nothing you can do

Just give me, give me, give me the power
And I'll make them bleed
Give me, give me, give me the power
Although, I'm just the common breed

You might live in a screen kiss
It's a glamorous dream
Or belong to a world that's gone
It's the English disease

But give me, give me, give me the power
And I'll make them bleed
Give me, give me, give me the power
Although, I'm just the common breed
Give me, give me, give me the power
And I'll make them bleed
Give me, give me, give me the power
And I'll make them believe1Embed
