This Is Love Lyrics
I can't believe life's so complex
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress
I can't believe life's so complex
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress

This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is lo-lo-love that I'm feeling

Does it have to be a life full of dread?
I want to chase you 'round the table, I want to touch your head
Does it have to be a life full of dread?
I want to chase you 'round the table, I want to touch your head

This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is lo-lo-lo-love that I'm feeling

I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering
When you taste so good
I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering
While my headache burns
That love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is lo-lo-lo-love that I'm feeling

Even in the summer, even in the spring
You can never get too much of a wonderful thing

You're the only story that I never told
You're my dirty little secret, want to keep you so
You're the only story that never been told
You're my dirty little secret, want to keep you so
Come on out, come on over, help me forget
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in
Come on out, come on over, help me forget
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in

This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is lo-lo-lo-love that I'm feeling
That is love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, love, love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love that I'm feeling1Embed
