You Said Something Lyrics
On a rooftop in Brooklyn
At one in the morning
Watching the lights flash
In Manhattan
I see five bridges
The Empire State Building
And you said something
That I've never forgotten

We lean against railings
Describing the colours
And the smells of our homelands
Acting like lovers
How did we get here?
To this point in living?
I held my breath
And you said something

And I am doing nothing wrong
Riding in your car
Your radio playing
We sing up to the eighth floor
A rooftop, Manhattan
One in the morning
When you said something
That I've never forgotten
You said something
You said something
You said something
That was really important3Embed
