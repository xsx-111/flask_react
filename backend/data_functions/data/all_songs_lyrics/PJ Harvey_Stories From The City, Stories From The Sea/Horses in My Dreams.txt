Horses in My Dreams Lyrics
Horses in my dreams
Like waves, like the sea
They pull out of here
They pull, they are free

Rode a horse around the world
Along the tracks of a train
Broke the record, found the gold
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear

Horses in my dreams
Like waves, like the sea
On the tracks of a train
Set myself free again

I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear
I have pulled myself clear2Embed
