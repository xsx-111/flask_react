This Wicked Tongue Lyrics
This wicked tongue says
God is a million miles away
This wicked tongue says
He can't see my day to day
This wicked tongue says
Go on taste everything
And this wicked tongue says
You know you're not really living

And it stares into the sun
And it flies from star to star
Cursing everyone
In my ringing ears

And the noise is as much as I could bear
And the noise is as much as I could bear
And the noise is as much as I could bear
And the noise is as much as I could bear

So I asked her where's the heart?
In the rubbish heap of man
And I asked her where's the soul?
And the silence rang and rang and rang and rang and rang
So I stare into the sun
And I fly from star to star
Cursing everyone
In my ringing ears

And the noise is as much as I could bear
And the noise is as much as I could bear
And the noise is as much as I could bear
And the noise is as much as I could bear

"I give up," he said
"I give up, you win
Creation, baby, has failed again"
"I give up," he said
"I give up, you win
"Creation, baby, has failed again"
"Creation, baby, has failed again"
"Creation, baby, has failed again"
"Creation, baby, has failed again"
"Creation, baby, has failed again"Embed
