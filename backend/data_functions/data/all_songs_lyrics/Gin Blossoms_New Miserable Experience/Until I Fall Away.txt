Until I Fall Away Lyrics
I want to tell if I am or I am not myself
It's hard to know how far or if at all could go
Waiting far too long for something I forgot was wrong
I don't know all the answers I think that I'll find
Or have it within the time but it's all that I'll have in mind

Until I fall away
That won't keep us waiting long
Until I fall away
I don't know what to do anymore
Until I fall away

My fear pretend that I'll never be in love again
It's real to me but not like these fools and not like this scene
I won't find or have it within the time
If it's all rusted and fade in the spot where we fell
Where I thought I'd left behind
It's loose now but we could try

When there's no good answers
To those new questions
Another personal disaster
There's nowhere to go but down1Embed
