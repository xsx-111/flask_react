Allison Road LyricsI've lost my mind
On what I'd find
And all of the pressure that I left behind
On Allison Road
Fools in the rain
If the sun gets through
Fires in the heaven of the eyes I knew
On Allison Road
Dark clouds fall in when the moon was near
Birds fly by A.M. in her bedroom stare
There's no tellin' what I might find
I couldn't see I was lost at the time
On Allison Road
Yeah I didn't know I was lost at the time
On Allison Road
So she fills up her sails
With my wasted breath
And each one's more wasted than the others you can bet
On Allison Road
Now I can't hide (on Allison Road)
So why not drive (on Allison Road)
I know I want to love her but I can't decide
On Allison Road
And I didn't know I was lost at the time
Eyes in the sun where the road wasn't wide
And I went looking for an exit sign
All I wanted to find tonight
On Allison Road
Yeah I didn't know I was lost at the time
On Allison Road
I've lost my mind
If the sun gets through
Fires in the heaven of the eyes I knew
On Allison Road
On Allison Road (On Allison Road)
