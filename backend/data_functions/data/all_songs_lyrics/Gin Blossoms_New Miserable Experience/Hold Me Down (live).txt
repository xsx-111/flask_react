Hold Me Down (live) LyricsSo I guess I must have just been dreaming
When I thought I heard myself say no
And anyway it looks like no one heard me
So here I go
'Cause when you're in the company of strangers
Or with the strangers you call friends
You know before you start
Just how its gonna end
And so remember when those doors swing open
And all the drinks are passed around
Anytime the pickings look too easy
Hold me down
I can't remember why I like this feeling
When it always seems to let me down
Soon I find I'm searching for the exit
From the ground
And if I think the room is turning faster
And I think the music is too loud
By then I'll have another broken story
Let me out
And so remember when those doors swing open
And all the drinks are passed around
When half the party moves into the bathroom
Hold me down
If you're at the tail end of the evening
And Dr. Feel Good comes around
Anytime the pickings look too easy
Hold me down
Down and I want back up
Down and I've gone too far
Well I guess I must have just been reeling
When I felt myself begin to fall
I realized I'm bounding down the hallway
Off the walls
And if my bed was standing in the corner
I could just fall into it right now
Know that id be starin at the ceiling
Going round and round
And so remember when those doors swing open
And all the drinks are passed around
When half the party moves into the bathroom
Hold me down
Or if youre at the tail end of the evening
And that good feeling comes around
Anytime the pickings look too easy
Hold me down
Down and I want back up
Down and I've gone too far
Know that I'll never be back home
Down and I've gone too farEmbed
