29 LyricsTime won't stand by forever
If I know it's true
And I've learned not to say never
Else I'll seem the fool
29, you'd think I'd know better
Living like a kid
Cause when my lies may seem less than clever
It's when I fall for it
Only time will tell
If wishing wells
Can bring us anything
Fade like scenes
From childhood dreams
Forgotten memories
Some rides don't have much of a finish
That's the ride I took
Through good and bad and straight through indifferent
Without a second look
There's no intentions worthy of mention
If we never try
So hang your hopes on rusted out hinges
Take 'em for a ride
Only time will tell
If wishing wells
Will bring us anything
Fade like scenes
From childhood dreams
Forgotten memories
Some rides don't have much of a finish
That's the ride I took
Through good and bad and straight through indifferent
Without a second look
Only time will tell
If wishing wells
Will bring us anything
Fade like scenes
From childhood dreams
Forgotten memoriesEmbed
