Mrs. Rita (live) LyricsI can see it in her letters on the paper with her pen
Her response is getting stranger
Think she's coming round again
So tell me, Mrs. Rita, what's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me why do lovers come and go
Is she coming round for me once again
Around or was that the end
I just hope she's coming round again
I've been keeping myself busy with my books and with my tapes
And every day's much better since I've slowed my drinking pace
There's no swimming in the bottle
It's just someplace we all drown
I lost myself in sorrow, I've lost my confidence in doubt
Is she coming round for me once again
Around or was that the end
I just hope she's coming round again
Get in the car and drive through town
Down the block and back around
Pretending that she's there with me, we drive
Gone forever
Well, my patience keeps me plaintive, my high hopes keep me alone
My lover's will is shaken
I wish she would just come home
So tell me, Mrs. Rita, what's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me why do lovers come and go
Is she coming round for me once again
Around or was that the end
I just hope she's coming round again
I just hope she's coming round...Embed
