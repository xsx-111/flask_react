Cajun Song LyricsWell, she'll be leavin today i do know
So far away
I'm feelin so blue and it shows
In every single way
Once that girl, she was mine
For such a short time
We used to spend every night
Now all i do is cry
They say, that you can't miss
Somethin that you've never had
So tell me why
Why i could feel so bad
Well we used to walk down the path
Just like lovers do
She'd hold my hand and we'd laugh
And i'd stare in her eyes - they were blue, ooh
Once that girl she was mine
For such a short time
We used to spend every night
Now all i do is cry
They say, that you can't miss
Somethin' that you've never had
So tell me, why
Why i should feel so bad...Embed
