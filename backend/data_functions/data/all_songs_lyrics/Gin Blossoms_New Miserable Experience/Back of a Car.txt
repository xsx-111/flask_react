Back of a Car LyricsSitting in the back of a car
Music so loud can't tell a thing
Thinking 'bout what to say
But I can't find the lines
You know I love you a lot
Just don't know, should I not?
Waiting for a brighter day
But I can't find a way
I'll go on and on with you
Like to fall and lie with you
I love you, too
Wo wo wo
Baby, I'm too afraid
Just don't know if it's okay
Trying to get away
From everything
Why don't you take me home
It's gone too far inside this car
I know I'll feel a whole lot more
When I get alone
I'll go on and on with you
Like to fall and lie with you
I love you, too
Wo wo wo
Sitting in the back of a car
Music so loud can't tell a thing
Thinking 'bout what to say
BUt I can't find the linesEmbed
