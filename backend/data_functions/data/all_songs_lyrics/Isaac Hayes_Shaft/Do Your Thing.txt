Do Your Thing LyricsIf the music make you move
Cause you can dig the groove
Then groove on, groove on
If you feel like you wanna make love
Under the stars above
Love on, love on
If there's something you wanna say
And talkin' is the only way
Rap on, oh, rap on
Cause whatever you do
Oh, you've got to do your thing
If you feel like you wanna scream
Cause that's your way of lettin' off steam
Scream on, scream on
If you feel like you wanna sing
Cause singing is your thing
Sing on, sing on
If you wanna make love all night
And you feel it's right
Right on, right on
Cause whatever you do, oh
You've got to do your thing
Do your thing...1Embed
