Sweet Pain Lyrics
Ahh!

My leathers fit tight around me
Whip is always beside me
You want the same thing every day
I'll teach you love a different way

You'll learn to love me and my

Sweet pain
My love will drive you insane
Sweet pain
My love will drive you insane
And pain has got it's reason
And if you don't stop your teasing, baby
I'm gonna show you now
You'll get to love it anyhow, anyhow

And you'll get to love me and my
Sweet pain
My love will drive you insane
Ah, sweet pain
My love will drive you insane
Ah, you get to love me any way I say
Ah, you get to love me and my sweet pain
Ahh!
Oh

Pain has got it's reason
You find it pleasing, yes you do, yes you do
And I'm gonna show you now
You'll get to love it anyhow, anyhow

And you'll get to love me and my

Sweet pain
My love will drive you insane
Ah, sweet pain
My love will drive you insane
Sweet pain, my love will drive you insane
Sweet pain, my love will drive you insane
Ahh, sweet pain (sweet pain), my love will drive you insane
Sweet pain (sweet pain), my love will drive you insane
Sweet pain (sweet pain), my love will drive you insane
Sweet pain (sweet pain)1Embed
