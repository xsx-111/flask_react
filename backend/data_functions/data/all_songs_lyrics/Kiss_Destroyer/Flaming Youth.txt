Flaming Youth Lyrics
Woah yeah!

My parents think I'm crazy
And they hate the things I do
I'm stupid and I'm lazy
Man, if they only knew

How flaming youth
Will set the world on fire
Flaming youth our flag is flying
Higher and higher and higher
My uniform is leather
And my power is my age
I'm getting it together
To break out of my cage

'Cause flaming youth
Will set the world on fire
Flaming youth
Will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, our flag is flying
Higher and higher and higher

Flaming youth, will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher
And higher and higher and higher
And higher and higher and higher!Embed
