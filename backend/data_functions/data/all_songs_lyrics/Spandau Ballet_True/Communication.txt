Communication LyricsCommunication always leaves me incomplete
The grass is greener, but it's grown beneath my feet
Love inspiration is a message on a wing
But I have left it in the words you'll never sing
Communication let me down
And I'm left here
Communication let me down
And I'm left here, I'm left here again!
Telex or tell me, but it's always second-hand
I'm incognito but no rendezvous's been planned
Dictate or relay, I could send it to your home
"Return to Sender" - I could sing it down the phone!
Communication let me down
But I'm left here
Communication let me down
But I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I
(Dictate!)
(Relay!)
I'm sitting here, waiting by the telephone
Waiting for the bell to ring
Short change, fumble
Dial-a-heart trouble
And I ain't got time for searching through the rubble, oh no!
Well, I know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Communication let me down
And I'm left here
Communication let me down
And I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!) 7x1Embed
