Lifeline LyricsChanging her colors she's off to the shore
She rides the soul train and he fight the law
There's a power in his voice and it makes her feel so sure
So live and let live in love
One day he'll build a statue with his hands
So gentle when he tries to understand
This subterfuge he never really planned now you're living
In the lifeline we're moving
In the lifeline we're walking
In the lifeline we're throwing
So live and let live in love
Exchanging their letters their exits begun
With deathless precision he's aiming his gun
A democracy of sorts that justifies the sun
So live and let die in love
Neither has the ghost of a chance
Those decisions only can be made once
You never really know just what you're giving till you're living
In the lifeline we're moving
In the lifeline we're walking
In the lifeline we're throwing
So live and let live in love
He could have built a statue with his hands
So gentle when he tried to understand
You never really know just what you're giving now you're living
In the lifeline we're moving
In the lifeline we're walking
In the lifeline we're throwing to you
But I'm not living
(So live and let live in love)
Lifeline
In the lifeline
In the lifeline
(So live and let live in love)
Lifeline
In the lifeline
In the lifeline
(So live and let live in love)
