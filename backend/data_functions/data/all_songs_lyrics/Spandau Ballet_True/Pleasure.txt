Pleasure LyricsPleasure's in my car
Even in the bar, as I'm searching
Oh, in the love that's strong
Breathing in the song, I'm learning
I'm learning
Pleasures in the sand
Warm within the hand, she's holding
It is on the screen
Adventures at nineteen, I'm searching
I am searching in my heart
Pleasure in my heart
Never let us part for pleasure
Oh, pleasure
Work, work today
Never let them pay for pleasure
Leave or lose her from my heart
Pleasure is your name
I accept the blame for falling
It is down the phone
Living in your home, I'm calling
I am calling
Pleasure is a word
When a love is left unheard
It's burning
It is on the screen
Adventures at nineteen, I'm searching
I am searching in my heart
Pleasure in my heart
Never let us part for pleasure
Oh, pleasure
Work, work today
Never let them pay for pleasure
Leave or lose her from my heart
Why did you feel
Like breaking my heart?
What made you feel
Like breaking my heart tonight?
Now I am crying
Now I am crying
Now I am crying
Now I am crying
Pleasure in my heart
Never let us part for pleasure
Oh, pleasure
Work, work today
Never let them pay for pleasure
Leave or lose her from my heartEmbed
