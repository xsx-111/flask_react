My Way of Giving Lyrics
I've been told it's just a matter of time
Before you meet someone who opens your eyes
But time's on my side so nevertheless
I know the pain of too much happiness

It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
And what more would you have me do

Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt
And if at times it seems our love won't work
I tell you, honey, you must surely realise
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes, oh

It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
And what more would you have me do

Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt
And if at times it seems our love won't work
I tell you, honey, you must surely realise
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes
It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
And what more would you have me doEmbed
