Cut Across Shorty Lyrics
Woo!

Now a country boy named Shorty
And a city boy named Dan
Had to prove who could run the fastest
To wed Miss Lucy's hand
Now Dan had all the money
And he also had the looks
But Shorty musta had that something boys
That can't be found in books, woo

"Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across"
That's what Miss Lucy said
"Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across
You know it's you that I wanna wed," woo

Wait a minute
Now Dan had been in training
About a week before the race
He made up his mind old Shorty
Would end in second place
You know Dan with his long legs flying
He left Shorty far behind him
Shorty heard him holler out
Miss Lucy that you'll soon be mine
"Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across"
That's what Miss Lucy said
"Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across
It's you that I wanna wed," woo


But Shorty wasn't worried
There was a smile upon his face
'Cause old Lucy had fixed the race
And just like that old story
About the turtle and the hare, you know that thing
When Danny crossed over the finish line
He found Shorty waiting there, woo

"Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across"
That's what Miss Lucy said
"Won't you cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across
You know it's you that I wanna wed"
It's you that I wanna wed, no no
And oh Lord, it's you I wanna wed, woohoo
Haha, yeah, wooEmbed
