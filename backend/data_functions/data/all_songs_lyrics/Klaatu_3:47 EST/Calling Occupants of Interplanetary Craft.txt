Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft Lyrics

In your mind you have capacities, you know
To telepath messages through the vast unknown
Please close your eyes and concentrate
With every thought you think
Upon the recitation we're about to sing

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary
Most extraordinary craft

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary
Most extraordinary craft

You've been observing our Earth
And we'd like to make a contact with you
We are your friends
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary
Ultra-emissaries

We've been observing your Earth
And one night we'll make a contact with you
We are your friends

Calling occupants of interplanetary
Quite extraordinary craft

And please come in peace we beseech you
Only a landing will teach them
Our Earth may never survive
So do come, we beg you
Please interstellar policeman
Won't you give us a sign
Give us a sign that we've reached you
A-ooooooh

With your mind you have ability to form
And transmit thought energy
Far beyond the norm
You close your eyes, you concentrate
Together, that's the way
To send the message
We declare World Contact Day

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary
Most extraordinary craft

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Calling occupants
Calling occupants
Calling occupants
Calling occupants
Calling occupants of interplanetary
Most extraordinary craft
We are your friends1Embed
