Sir Bodsworth Rugglesby III LyricsSir Bodsworth Rugglesby III
(John Woloschuk)

Well do you get the itchin' to
Trek about the latitudes
You do?
Well, likely you're a chip off old Sir Rugglesby
Well, he was quite a sporting sort
Behind his cup o' tea he'd snort
"I'll wager on the line
Ten thousand pounds and five
I'm the only man who'll ever get to hell and come back alive."

Now in the fall of '49
He skipped across the seven brine
This time looking for a berth in naval history
'Twas never heard nor seen again (Never seen again)
Officially presumed is dead
But the words he left behind
Still echo through my mind
"I'm the only man who'll ever get to hell and come back alive."
(He's the only man who'd ever get to)
Hell and come back alive
So off he went around the world

Then one night while tripping down the English coast
The moon was whiter than a ghost, almost
When I heard a voice yell through a megaphone
(And thereupon) And thereupon the midnight sea
A signal lamp signaled me
I could feel me blood run cold
As the message did decode
"I'm the only man who's ever been to hell and come back alive."
Well who else could it be
But good old Rugglesby?
(He's the only man who'd ever get to)
Hell and come back alive
Yes he's the only man who's (He's the only one)
Ever gone and been to (Who's been and gone)
To hell and come back
Hell and come back
To hell and come back alive (Oh, to hell and come back alive)
Only one who's been to (Oh, ho ho)
Hell and come back
To hell and come back
To hell and come back alive (The only one who's been to)
Hell and come back
To hell and come back
To hell and come back alive
