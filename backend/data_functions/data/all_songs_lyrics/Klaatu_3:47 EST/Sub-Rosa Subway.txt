Sub-Rosa Subway LyricsBack in 1870
Just beneath the Great White Way
Alfred Beach worked secretly
Risking all to ride a dream
His wind machine
His wind machine
New York City and the morning sun
Were awoken by the strangest sound
Reportedly as far as Washington
The tremors shook the earth as Alfie
Blew underground
Blew underground
He blew underground
Ahh, all aboard sub-rosa subway
Had you wondered who's been digging under Broadway?
It's Alfred
It's Alfred
It's Alfred
Poor Al, oh no, Al
As for America's first subway
The public scoffed, "it's far too rude"
One station filled with Victoria's age
From frescoed walls and goldfish fountains
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes, ahh
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes, ahh
To Brahmsian tunes, ahh
To Brahmsian tunes, ahh
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes, ahh
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes
To Brahmsian tunes1Embed
