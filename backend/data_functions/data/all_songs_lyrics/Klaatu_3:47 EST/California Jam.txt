California Jam LyricsHodad made the scene
Totin' a six-pack of cold cola
A stogie smokin' in hand
A-groovin' in his sandals
California's on my mind
Surf 'n' sand setting in the sun
California's on my mind
One day you're gonna be
A place in our memory
Na na na na na na
When Woody hit the dunes
Flying foxtails and Old Glory
Rubber ripped the sand
He gunned a souped-down Stingray
Hey, hey
Ah, California
She's in Mythical Malibu
Sitting on the ocean
Good-bye Mythical Malibu
The San Andreas Misfortune
Will claim the lives of sons and wives
The headlines will fill page after page
California's on my mind
Surf 'n' sand setting in the sun
In the sun, in the sun
In the setting sun
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
One day you're gonna be
One sweet memory
Oh yeah
California
Swingin' on the beach
To the sounds of their time
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
