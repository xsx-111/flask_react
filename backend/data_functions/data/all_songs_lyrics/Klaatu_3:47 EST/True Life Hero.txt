True Life Hero LyricsThe last time I went swimmin'
A started to drown and my head ... it went down
And then, the lifeguard he jumped in
Grabbed hold of my hair and he pulled me to ground
He was a true life hero
Friend of every man an child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild
I wonder what it would be like
To be the ultra maroon who was first on the moon
Cos' who could help but dislike
A man, it is known, has the guts of a prune
Wanna be a true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild
I could never be like him
I could never be strong cos' I'm always wrong
So I'll just sit here thinkin'
How nice it would be if it only was me
Who was a true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild
Yes I really do think it'd be wild
I really do think it'd be wildEmbed
