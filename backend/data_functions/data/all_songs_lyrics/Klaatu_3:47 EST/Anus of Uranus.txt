Anus of Uranus Lyrics(Dee Long)
Late last night while wishing on a star
Down from the sky came a man in a car
He said, "Get in Jackson, c'mon let's go for a ride"
What a sight
Sitting in the cockpit, strapped down in a chair
I said, "Hey, tell me what's that over there?"
He said, "Meet my computer"
He's a friendly son-of-a-gun and we're having fun
Playing cards on Venus in a cloudy room
Pass a glass of ammonia, I got to get off soon
Sunbathing on Mercury or jamming on Jupiter
Which do you prefer?
It's getting pretty late, I got to go home
Nice to have met you, what's your telephone?
Maybe soon I'll call you if I can afford the fare
It's long distance out there
Anus of Uranus, he's a friend of mine
He's a first rate party an a real fine time
Anus of Uranus, he's a friend of mine
He's first rate party and a real fine timeEmbed
