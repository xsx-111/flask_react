Rising Tide LyricsColor your skin with gold and the violence remains
Cover your eyes with rose but the stain remains
Will you escape your life with all the walls you build?
Smother your will and lead you into fashion...
Morning comes in the dream before we rise
When we linger side by side
It's my heart that speaks this time:
We will ride the rising tide
Color your skin with gold and the violence remains
Cover your eyes with rose but the stain remains
Will you repair your life with all the holes you fill?
Smother your will and drain you of your passion
Morning comes in the dream before we rise
When we linger side by side
It's my heart that speaks this time:
We will ride the rising tide
Color your skin with gold and the violence remains
Cover your eyes with rose but the stain remains
Will you defend your life and all the hope you feel?
Or smother your will and lead you into fashion...
Morning comes in the dream before we rise
When we linger side by side
It's my heart that speaks this time:
We will ride the rising tide
