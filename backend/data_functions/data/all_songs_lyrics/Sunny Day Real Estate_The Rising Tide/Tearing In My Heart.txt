Tearing In My Heart LyricsTearing in my heart when the world falls apart
And it's almost too hard
Tearing in your mind, how the pain makes you blind
When it's all said and done
Tearing in my heart, a mistake from the start
And it's almost too hard
Tarry in my mind, i'll repay you another time
When it's all said and done
Tearing in your bones when the road left you alone
And it's almost too hard
Tarry in my soul and you help make me whole
When it's all said and done
Tearing in my heart when the world falls apart
And it's almost too hard
Tarry in my soul and you help make me whole
When it's all said and doneEmbed
