Killed By An Angel Lyrics
Welcome to the lonesome world of Abel
Where every brother's knife is set to slay you
And paranoia keeps you healthy
Crooked deals can keep you wealthy
Serum vials to help you when you're sad

Every other face is bent and broken
Wrap your teeth around the only game in town
Made you clothes from insulation
Break your day for pay and ration
Hide
Hide
Hide

Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Relax and all these whores will lick the membrane
Just a touch, a stain, a hole in your brain
It's cold when you remove the nails
Beg for more when all else fails
Serum vials to help you when you're sad

Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle

The way the sea reflects the sun
Long gone
And all the miracles of love
Long gone
You hold your heart out in your hand
One last long sigh gone
One last long sigh gone
When you see the sores you can't believe them
Pathogenic lovers in a basement cell
Dirty white sheets cut up in strips
Cracks in the mirror, and your mind slips
Serum vials to help you when you're sad

Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle

Killed by an angel
