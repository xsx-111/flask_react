The Ocean LyricsAll around
I see you're under my skin
Cruel to say
I've known the best of my life
Never again to hear
The rivers' song so clear
Everyday's another scene
The world around and everything for you
An open door a cauldron of
Waves rush in through every house for all
So they say another lie:
'Love's a rumor
But love will die'
We're lost and wandering
Deep in the ocean
There lies a wave for you
When you hit the ground
It's hard to speak
But its who you are
A shining star
Go
Tell the millions begin!
We'll run through the fields
The turning of wheels
Down with the buildings
Worlds on your shoulders
Climb through the wasteland
Wait for the sky to remind you
These things are true
Everyday's another scene
The world around and everything for you
An open door a cauldron of
Waves rush in through every house for all
So they say another lie:
'Love's a rumor
But love will die'
We're lost and wandering
Deep in the ocean
There lies a wave for you
Whenyou hit the ground
It's hard to speak
But its who you are
A shining star
Go
Tell the millions begin!
We'll run through the fields
The turning of wheels
Down with the buildings
Worlds on your shoulders
Climb through the wasteland
Wait for the sky to remind you
These things are true
