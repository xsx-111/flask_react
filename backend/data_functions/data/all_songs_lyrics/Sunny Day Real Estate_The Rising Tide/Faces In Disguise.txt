Faces In Disguise LyricsThese fears come rushing in when I enter here
Another layer on my back
A blazing fire where our glances meet
The largest feeling towering over me
Faces in disguise
Not a trace of desire
I long to take you a secret place
Where we could lay aside our past
We'd throw the world away with all it's pain
To shine like stars through storm and clouds and
Rain
Faces in disguise
Not a trace of desire
(Cold faces in disguise)
(Not a trace of desire)
Go face the day
Go and see new things
Go face the day
But you'll remember me...
I see a tear inside when you're turned away
Another wound that I'd take back
If I could fill your heart just once and then
I'd take you now where we could live again
Faces in disguise
Not a trace of desire
(Cold faces in disguise)
(Not a trace of desire)
Go face the day
Go and see new things
Go face the day
But you'll remember me...
Faces in disguise
Not a trace of desire
(cold faces in disguise)
(not a trace of desire)Embed
