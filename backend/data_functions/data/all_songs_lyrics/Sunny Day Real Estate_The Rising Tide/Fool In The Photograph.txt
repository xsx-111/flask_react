Fool In The Photograph LyricsMe and the fool in the photograph
A soul many times revealed
The scars only have concealed
I wonder how many days I'll bleed
With the words I refuse to form
Now I will be free
But lately I refuse you
With these arms I will break through you
Wait only to see you far removed
No more the fool in the photograph
That night chained in your embrace
Day dawned and I saw your face
I wonder how many days I'll bleed
With the words I begin to form:
Now I will be free
Lately I refuse you
With these arms I will break through you
Wait only to see you far removed
Wasting time you tell the story still
Made your mind you're chasing the moon
Making scars among the glory
Still you're pulling down
Wasting time you tell the story
Some kind of magic
I've waited here all too long...Embed
