A Crippling Blow Lyrics
Here in my house, time is sweet
I hear the children playing in the street
Out where the hot winds blowing gentle breeze

I don't need time, I don't need time
No, I can get by myself
I don't need time, I don't know why
The summer wind did not tell
I scramble on line and I know that I
Will never be calm and well
But I can get by in the meantime by myself

He's a real winner, all over they say
Sleeping in the lazy afternoon
A danger to their daughters they assume

I don't need time, I don't need time
No, I can get by myself
I don't need time, I don't know why
The summer wind did not tell
I scramble on line and I know that I
Will never be calm and well
But I can get by in the meantime by myself
Deal me a crippling blow
Steal me from under my clothes
A crippling blow

I don't need time, I don't need time
No, I can get by myself
I don't need time, I don't know why
The summer wind did not tell
I scramble on line and I know that I
Will never be calm and well
But I can get by in the meantime by myself
Lord I can get by in the meantime by myself

I can get by in the meantime by myselfEmbed
