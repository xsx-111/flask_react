A Dustland Fairytale Lyrics
A Dustland fairytale beginning with just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looked just like you'd want him to, some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade

Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was lookin' for a night gown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she'd always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinkin' ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know, the mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
We're drawbridges closin'
Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide
Out where the dreams all hide

Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide7Embed
