Down Side of Me Lyrics
Maybe I
Could tell you that it's no big deal
Maybe I can aim this high
Or maybe I could eat my words

Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same
Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same

I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used to
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)

Maybe you
Could tell 'em that you stayed the course
Maybe I could clear my view
Or maybe I should eat my words

Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same
Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used to
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used to

Keep you away from the down side of me
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
You can wrap up your hopes and release them to me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
You would be, you would be, you would be
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
All I see
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)

And I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used to
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used toEmbed
