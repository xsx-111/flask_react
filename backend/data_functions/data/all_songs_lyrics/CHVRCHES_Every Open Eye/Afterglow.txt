Afterglow Lyrics
All of the black and white
All of the contours
Are laid out before me now
To leave a trace
With all of the light and shape
We take up our own space
I'll find my own way back
Back to the past tense

A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side
And I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side
And I should know

All of the empty thoughts
All of the outlines
Are laid out before us now
To leave a trace
All of your words and mine
They keep returning
I'll find my own way back
Back to the silence
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side
And I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side
And I should know

I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can2Embed
