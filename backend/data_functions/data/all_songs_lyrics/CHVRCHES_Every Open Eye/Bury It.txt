Bury It Lyrics
Cover up, cover up
Cover up that you're ruthless
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's ever gonna notice
And I am catching on and I am seeing red
How about I prove I'm right
And raise it overhead?

I never promised you
Anything I couldn't do
We tried to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me
You would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above

Reaching, reaching for
Reaching for my resistance
Nobody, nobody
Nobody sees it at a distance
And I am catching up and I am seeing red
How about I throw my weight
And raise it overhead?
I never promised you
Anything I couldn't do
We tried to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me
You would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above


I never promised you
Anything I couldn't do
We tried to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me
You would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above4Embed
