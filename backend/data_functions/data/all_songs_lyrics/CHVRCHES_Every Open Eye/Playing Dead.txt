Playing Dead Lyrics
(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)
(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)

No more excuses and no more playing dead
There are no silver linings in anything you said
If you keep on denying and I could stay away
We could hold up our hands, say we don't want it, we don't need it

If I give more than enough ground, will you claim it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down
And if I try to pretend that I don't hear it
You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go
If I give more than enough ground, will you leave it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down
And if I try to pretend that I don't see it
You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go

(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)
(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)
No more distractions and no more staying still
I am chasing the skyline much more than you ever will
You can keep to your story and I could stick to mine
We could hold up our hands, say we don't want it, we don't need it

If I give more than enough ground, will you claim it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down
And if I try to pretend that I don't hear it
You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go
If I give more than enough ground, will you leave it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down
And if I try to pretend that I don't see it
You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go

(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)
(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)
(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)
(Go-go-go-down-go-go-go-go-go-go)

If I give more than enough ground, will you claim it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down
And if I try to pretend that I don't hear it
You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go
If I give more than enough ground, will you leave it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down
And if I try to pretend that I don't see it
You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go
