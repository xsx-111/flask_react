Heathen Child LyricsHey little Moo Moo
Light as a rainbow
Happy as an asteroid
Crashed in the bathtub
Yeah sittin in the bathtub
Her full of her fingers
Her full of her fingers
Yeah sittin in the bathtub
Says, I'm scared and lonely
Says, I'm scared and lonely
Never see no one
Says, I'm scared and lonely
Here come the Wolfman
Here come no one
Sayin hey little Moo Moo
Sittin in the bathtub
My heathen child!
She's a heathen child!
Yeah she's a heathen child!
She's a real real wild child!
She got a little powder
She got a little gun
She got a little poison got a little gun
Sitting in the bathtub
Sucking her thumb
Says, I don't care about Buddha
Care about Krishna
Don't care about Allah
I don't care about any of them
Sitting in the bathtub
Sucking her thumb
Cause she's a heathen child!
She's a heathen child!
Yeah she's a heathen child!
She's a real real wild child!
Poor little Moo Moo
Papped and Monroed
Got a little powder
Got a little gun
Sittin in the bathtub
Having some fun
She was raised by beasts
And photographed by vultures
Here come the Wolfman
The Abominable Snowman
Got a little poison
Got a little gun
Sittin in the bathtub
Waitin for the Wolfman to come!
You think your great big husband will protect you
You are wrong!
You think your little wife will protect you
You are wrong!
You think your children will protect you
You are wrong!
You think your government will protect you
You are wrong!
She don't care about Allah
She is the Allah!
She don't care about Buddha
She is the Buddha!
Cause she's a heathen child!
She's a heathen child!
Yeah she's a heathen child!
She's a heathen child!
(spoken)
Someone left the bathtub running!
Someone left the bathtub running!
Gimme the money!
A wild child
A wild child
A real wild childEmbed
