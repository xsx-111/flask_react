What I Know LyricsYes I Know
I know it
From the day
That I was born
Yeah I know
From the time
I went to school
Yeah I know
From the Time
Was a teenager
I know
From the time
I got married
Hey I Know
A million things
Gonna happen to me
In rooms that are much like this
But it will never be enough
(You better come over here)
Cause yeah I know
I know
Never
Ever
