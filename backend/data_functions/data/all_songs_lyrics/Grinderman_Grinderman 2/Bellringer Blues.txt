Bellringer Blues Lyrics
I saw my old friend Gabriel
Down the perimeter ringing a bell
I said hello
Hey man is there something wrong?
Where has everybody gone?
I don't know
Well I put a rag across my mouth
And I went out
Yeah moving slow
What are you doing he said to me
I'm looking for my company
He said don't bother no

Well, Next thing you know when I took a look
Gabe was trying to sell me a book
But I got no dough
He said "Check it out It's going cheap
Check it out it's going cheap"
"Ok I'll give it a go"
Well, I read that book - every page
And then I put it away
Said "I don't think so
It makes slaves of all of womankind
And corpses of the men
And I, I just don't know"
And we care a little bit
We get scared a little bit
Of those two cold dead eyes
That stare a little bit
And we cry a little bit
And we get by a little bit
Yeah, let your tears
All come falling down
Put me on a big white steed
Ride it up and down your street
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
Wrapped in a crimson coat
Sail me in a great big boat
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
I'll sail around the waters for you
Kill your sons and daughters for you
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
Put me on a big white horse
Send me down to Banbury Cross
(Will the soul survive? I don't know)
Oh yeah
(Will the soul survive?)
It's okay Joe, its time to go
(Will the soul survive?)
It's okay Joe, its time to go
(Will the soul survive?)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
(Will the soul survive?)
It's okay Joe, its time to go
(Will the soul survive?)
(Will the soul survive?)2Embed
