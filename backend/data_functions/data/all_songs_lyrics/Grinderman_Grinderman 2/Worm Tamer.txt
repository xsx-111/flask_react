Worm Tamer Lyrics
You know they call my girl the Snake Charmer
Here she comes rising with the yellow dawn
You know I would do nothing to ever harm her
I guess that I've loved you for too long

You know they call my girl the Worm Tamer
She cracks lightning like a viper's tongue
She leaves me every night and who can blame her?
I guess that I've loved you for too long

For too long
For too long
For too long

You know they call my girl the Serpent Wrangler
Eating inchworms down by the bill-a-bong
I spent all night trying to untangle her
I guess that I've loved you for too long

For too long
For too long
For too long
You know they call my baby the Mambo Rider
I cry storms of tears til the rising of the dawn
And you know I'm only happy when I'm inside her
Yeah, I guess that I've just loved you for too long

For too long
For too long
For too long
For too long
For too long

Well, my baby calls me the Loch Ness Monster
Two great big humps and then I'm gone
But actually I am the Abominable Snowman
And I guess that I've loved you for too longEmbed
