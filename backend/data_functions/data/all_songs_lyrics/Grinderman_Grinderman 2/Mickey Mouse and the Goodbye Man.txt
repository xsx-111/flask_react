Mickey Mouse and the Goodbye Man Lyrics
I woke up this morning
I thought what am I doing here?
My brother, he starts raging!
Watch him rising, see him howling!
And he sucked her and sucked her dry
And he bit at me and said goodbye
Up on the twenty-ninth floor

I was lying there with just my brother
We could hear someone rattling the locks
I was lying there with just my brother
Do you think that it might be the cops?
We sucked her and sucked her dry
I was Mickey Mouse
He was the Big Bad Wolf!

Next thing you know
I'm looking down below
See a lupine child
With her hair on fire
Little burning girl!
Looking up at me!
Running to the elevator!
Getting in the elevator!
Sixth floor! Seventh floor!
Eight floor! Nine!
Come on baby
Blow my mind!
I woke up this morning and he was gone
There were posters in the airports and the stations
We took shelter under her body
We sucked her and sucked her dry
He kissed me and he kissed me and said goodbye

Well no time at all
She's walking down the hall
A bat-faced girl
With dynamite curls
Ringing the bell
Banging on the door
Looking up at me
Looking up at me
Walking like travelator
Jumping in the elevator
Twenty-two! Twenty-four!
Twenty-six! Twenty-nine!
Come on baby
Blow my mind!Embed
