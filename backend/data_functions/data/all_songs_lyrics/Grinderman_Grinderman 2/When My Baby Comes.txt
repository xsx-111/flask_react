When My Baby Comes Lyrics
Thank God we don't get all our hurts at once
That would be a really really bad thing
When my baby comes
Thank God we don't get all our olds at the one time
(Uh listen to me talking in my hospital gown!)
When my baby comes
Best thing about this place are the showers
The worst thing is the visiting hours
(Hey, careful of the carpet!)
When my baby comes
They had pistols and they had guns
They threw me on the ground and they entered into me
(I was only fifteen!)
When my baby comes

Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?

She got hands as white as milk
And she weaves a loop of spider's silk that glistens
When my baby comes
There is an ancient question behind her eyes
That I can't even begin to describe
(Hey hey, listen don't do that on the carpet!)
When my baby comes
Does anyone out there wasted their lives?
On booze and drugs and husbands and wives and making money?
When my baby comes
Well, they had pistols and they had guns
My skirt above my head I was so much older
When I crawled out from under their mushroom cloud
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Just how long you gonna be my baby?
Until you come?
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comes
When she comesEmbed
