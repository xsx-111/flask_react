The Apparition Lyrics
Now I'm here, can you see me?
'Cause I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold
Tell me you can feel me, 'cause I'm here
Here I am, can you see me?
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to
Only in my dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
Through life
There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you?
Thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say
In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one, right now

In a rooms full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
Looking in?
You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to
It's true


You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does
Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened
When we die, wouldn't it?
There are some who're wise
There are some who are born na√Øve
I believe that there are some
That must have lived before, don't you?
As for me, well, I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not
An open and shut case

Extra sensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on
And travel through space and time?
You know I feel so elated
'Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You, don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
One day1Embed
