The Fugitive Lyrics

On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I made no sound
Waiting for the mist
To cover all around
I carefully picked my time
Then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about
Then off again
Being at the wrong place
And at the wrong time
Suspected of a hit
That was my crime

I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack
Ever moving  onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun

I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name


Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never be the same
But if I ever prove
My innocence someday
I've got to get them all to make them pay
I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name2Embed
