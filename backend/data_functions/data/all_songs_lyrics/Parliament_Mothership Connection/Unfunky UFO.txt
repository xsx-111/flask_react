Unfunky UFO Lyrics
You've got all that is really needed
To save a dying world from its funkless hell

Stupidly I forced a smile
My composure was secure
I wore a silly grin from ear to ear
A smile they saw right through
Oh, but then like a streak of lightning it came
Filling my brain with this pain
Without saying a word this voice I heard
"Give up the funk, you punk"

Unfunky kind of UFO
(From the sun)
Here from the sun
(You've got the groove)
You've got the groove and we want some
(Unfunky and obsolete)
We're unfunky and we're obsolete
(And out of time)
And we're out of time
Gonna take your funk and make it mine
("Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh")

You could feel so much better
If you would show me how to funk like you do


Deep in pain I called the names
Of some funkified friends of mine
And they were on the road and gettin' it on
And groovin' for hours live
Oh, like a streak of lightning it came
Filling my brain with pain
Without saying a word, this voice I heard
"Give up the funk, you punk"

("Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh")
×4

I don't know where but they were near
They took me by surprise
They crept upon me early this morning
Right before my eyes and they were saying
("Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet old music")
×2
