Mothership Connection (Star Child) Lyrics
Well, all right, Starchild
Citizens of the universe, recording angels
We have returned to claim the pyramids
Partying on the mothership
I am the mothership connection

Gettin' down in 3D, light year groovin'
All right, hear any noise
Ain't nobody but me and the boys
Gettin' down, hit it fellas

If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
All right, all right, starchild here

Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the Mothership
Loose booty, doin' the bump
Hustle on over here

Ain't nothing but a party, y'all

Face it even your memory banks
Have forgotten this funk
Mothership connection
Home of the p. funk, the bomb

Doin' it in 3D
Let me put on my sunglasses here
So I can see what I'm doing

When you hear seats rumble
You will hear your conscience grumble
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
You have overcome for I am here

Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Are you hip to Easter Island?
The Bermuda Triangle?
Well, all right
Ain't nothing but a party

Starchild here, citizens of the universe
I bring forth to you
The good time on the mothership
Are you hip? Sing, fellas


Starchild here, doin' it in 3D
So good, it's good to me
Hit the band

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming forth to carry you home

Swing low, time to move on
Light years in time, ahead of our time
Free your mind and come fly
With me, it's hip on the mothership groovin'
