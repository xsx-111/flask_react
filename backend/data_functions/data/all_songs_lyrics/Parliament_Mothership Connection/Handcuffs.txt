Handcuffs Lyrics
Oh, do I have to put my handcuffs on you, mama?
Do I have to keep you under lock and key?
Do I have to put handcuffs on you, mama?
Now we both know that's not how it should be

Do I have to put my handcuffs on you, mama?
You're a sweet fine sexy woman and you're good to a man
Cause if I have to put my handcuffs on you, mama
I hope that you will understand

If I have to keep you barefoot and pregnant
Oh, to keep you here in my world
(Lay down, girl) lay down and take off-a your shoes
Cause I'm a-gonna do to you
What it is I got to do

If we've been fighting like you say that we do
I know you won't mind, if I be possessive, now would you?
Your creature-like lovin', you know it is to blame
That's why I can ask you and not even feel ashamed

Do I have to put my handcuffs on you, mama?
Are you susceptible to flattery and games? ("lord, and the games")
Do I have to put my handcuffs on you, mama?
Will you submit to the first human who calls your name?
Cause if I have to put my handcuffs on you, mama
Don't you know I know, that that would be uncool
Do I have to put my handcuffs on you, mama?
I don't mind, I'll offer the moon, yeah
Yeah, I'll be the fool
I don't care about lookin' like some kinda chauvanistic whatever
All who call me that can go to hell
If I find that I need some help
Gonna put on my chastity belt
What it is, I got to do
