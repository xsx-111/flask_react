Desert of Song Lyrics
The radio's stopped tuning
The static is forbidden
The chords quit strumming
But we found our new home
It will rain - falls so slow
It will rain down here

The drums quit thumping
These tones are forbidden
The throat can’t start singing
The scarecrow is watching
It will rain, falls so slow
It will rain down here
It will rain, falls so slow
It will rain down here

Here, we’re awake in the desert of song
The silence broken
Here, we’re awake in the
The silence is broken
Silence is broken
Silence is broken
Here we sing
Sing with the fear
Fear: the control tower
The new sun comes by the hour
Ghosts slowly disappear in the fog
Silence the suffering
We’ve built back the age-old sound of song
Sound of song
Sound of song

Here we sing
Sing with the fear

Here, we’re awake in the desert of song
The silence broken
Here, we’re awake in the
Silence is broken
Silence is broken
Silence is broken
Here we sing
Sing with the fearEmbed
