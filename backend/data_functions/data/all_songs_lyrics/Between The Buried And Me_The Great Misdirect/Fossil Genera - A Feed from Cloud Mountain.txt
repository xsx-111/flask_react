Fossil Genera - A Feed from Cloud Mountain Lyrics
Sweet candy populous, a worry free entrance into the world's history
Never underestimate, never think beyond their thoughts
The satellites have been tapped and Cloud Mountain will carry on the commands of our ancestors
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries, hearing every breath, watching every disease
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries, hearing every breath, watching every disease
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries, hearing every breath, watching every disease
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries, hearing every breath, watching every disease
(You must accept this truth)

The leaders are driving to the farthest retreat
Sit back, relax, enjoy the ride
They have been speaking for years
Every night while you're asleep they have been discussing what the future holds for us all
The outer space takeover
The outer space takeover
Worlds collide in a dreary pre-determined idea
Brought by our fellow night owls
Their stories have been mocked
Their ideas have been crushed, but after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out
Their ideas have been crushed, but after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out
A government overthrown
Take control, every idea we will think from here on out
We have come to tell you all
That we could have prepared for this
We have come to tell you all
That we could have prepared for this
We have come to tell you all
That we could have prepared for this
For this

The apocalypse (at least our apocalypse) will happen sooner than we think
If we don't read the journals our station has prepared for you all
We call ourselves the "night owls"
We've roamed the earth for years and kept your world afloat
We've made it so you stay comfortable in your precious homes
While you sleep, we discuss
Discuss our future, your future
While you sleep, we discuss
Discuss our future, your future

Our journals give detailed instructions on the machines and weapons we must build
These are weapons that none of you would even begin to think could harm the outside world
Everything you know is false
Your first instinct is now your last
Like I've said before, we have been discussing and planning this for decades (Trust is essential)
We don't have time to explain everything, but just know that everything will soon change
Trust us and we will all be safe
We are the new government
Trust us and we will all be safe
We are the new government
Trust us and we will all be safe
We are the new government

In simple times we must take control
With simple skies we create more sky
A simple land we must change, for man is god
A simple life we must break, move forward
How fast we grow
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on

We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
How fast we grow1Embed
