Disease, Injury, Madness Lyrics
Don't think, don't speak, I will do this for you
Every natural thought or feeling you've ever had will change tonight
Don't think, don't speak, I will do this for you
Trust the pedestal, for now we become a higher being

I am your new mind
I am your new you
I am your new sin, I am your new lust
I am for you now

Control and collapse, collide
Control and collapse, collide
Control and collapse, collide
Control and collapse, collide

A letter plagued by a twisted word (slave)
You will become mine, for there are no more options
There will not be a sweet consolation
This is what is supposed to happen
A predetermined destiny put in motion by my stronger power
Power, you are me

I sit on this dirty floor, a weak mind for a cause
A cause I do not know, don't know what to live for
A compliment I've never heard, a comfort I've never felt
It's here, even though it won't last for long

Sit down, stand up please
Lay down, drink this please
You'll be in peace soon
A tribe within itself
A vision I will display to blind the caring
I have regrets
A tribe within itself
A vision I will display to blind the caring
Too late

I am a cult by definition
I am a friend by first impression
My task, to recycle this earth
To not repeat human history
Start from scratch, rid every sound
Deconstruct, deconstruct all
I’ve bid every method into the hands of my employees
I have saved you
Now you will follow my journey, my destiny
Tonight’s your death, resurrect my new you
Resurrect my new you
I am a cult by definition
I will end this human world
This world is shit and I have proved this with my followers
Fuck humanity, end life
You are now dead, and I soon will be
You are now dead
Disease, injury
Disease, injury, madnessEmbed
