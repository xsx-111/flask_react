Swim to the Moon Lyrics

It’s been a long night, away from it all
The grabbing authority of my peers
The rusty cage that never seems to open
When can I escape?
When can I swim to the moon?
I’ve heard this expression my entire life
Never realized how peaceful a statement it is
I’ve heard this expression my entire life
Never realized how peaceful a statement it is

All alone on the worlds waters, here I am
The sun’s slowly drifting past the edge of the world
All alone on the worlds waters, here I am
The sun’s slowly drifting past the edge of the world
I’m the loneliest boat on this entire body of water
Rest will give my awakening purpose
This is why I have come here in the first place
A peace I have never felt, a life I did not want to live
I will awake through sleep
The drifting drifter, look into the picture

No more panic, no more regret
No more hoping for a new mess
Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon

I awake with a cool breeze blowing through my dirty hair
Rested, stable, a first
A caffeine junkie’s longest wish: peace and quiet
No wake ups, no expectations
A strange feeling, suddenly drifting
No wake ups, no expectations
A strange feeling, suddenly drifting


This “As Seen on TV” anchor is just another lie, I guess
Hoping for something not there
Filling a void that I can’t quite put my finger on
Filling a void

This loneliness I always seek
I’m in the middle of black water
No sign of human life in any direction
The most peaceful event of my life
Seems to have typically turned into a struggle
I’m in the middle of black water, no sign of human life
Panic takes over my body
Panic takes over my body

I have indeed floated due to a non-reversible decision to flee
Just for a day I told myself
My survival skills were lost years ago
Here I am: no food, no clean water
And this extremely embarrassing attempt at a “get away outfit”
This is an inevitable death, inevitable death

Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon


Look into the picture
Look into the picture
Look into the picture
Look into the picture
This is what I lived to be
This very moment is the first time in my life that I’ve felt pure joy

Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon

Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon

Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moonEmbed
