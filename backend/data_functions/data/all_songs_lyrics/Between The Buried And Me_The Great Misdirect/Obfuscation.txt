Obfuscation Lyrics
From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem
An entire existence revolving around what we can’t acknowledge
From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem, as they seem
A brain malfunction we’ll never admit as defeat, defeat
A constant determination to find truths, to find truths, to find reason
To find reason, to find truths, to find comfort
An unspoken religion in being the all dominant
All dominant, all dominant
This is what we call a brain
This is what we call a brain
This is what we call a brain
This is what we call a brain
A brain

This step will allow, allow the universe to run its course
We have a short ticket and a lot is in hiding
So let’s take in what we can for now
Just like here on Earth, a notion we do comprehend
Hide what “others” can’t understand
The universe is the biggest, biggest threat
Overachiever that commands attention
Brute force of hysterical, hysterical reasonings
There will always be a Marfa
Close one eye
Step to the side
Close one eye
Step to the side

As humans, we could never be content with knowing all
Yet we can’t be content with the fact that our brains will never know
A mental surgery, a never-ending journey, a technological drawback
Pushing us further from our natural minds
There will always exist a Kryptos
Even things created by other humans should be considered
In the experiment of an entire species of understanding

A magician’s pure joy
A mind bend for the common folk
Follow the straight line
A full house watching what we can’t see
The ultimate deceiver

Close one eye
Step to the side
Step to the side
We will always be part of the great misdirect
Stepping in and stepping out
We will always be part of the great misdirect
