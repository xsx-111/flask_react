Walk All Over You Lyrics
Out of my way, I'm a-running high
Take a chance with me and a-give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world don't know
'Cause I ain't looking for overflow
Oh baby, I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels, let down your hair

Paradise ain't far from there

I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, baby
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
And, there, you thought you'd seen it all
We're rising, falling like the sea
You're looking so good, under me

I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, to you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you

Moanin', groanin', stirrin' it up
So, gimme the stage, I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light

Tonight is gonna be that night

I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, baby
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you2Embed
