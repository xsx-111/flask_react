What You Were Lyrics
They said
You were a mystery
I know
You can’t fool me

But still I cave in
I gave you my heart
I cave in
I gave you my heart

Well hang on, hang on
I know you don’t think I know
Well hold on, hold on
But I know but I know but I know

I always knew what you were
I always knew what you were

You came along
You came along
I got into your car
You came along
I knew I was wrong
I knew I would die
But still I cave in
I gave you my heart
I cave in
I gave you my heart

Well hang on, hang on
I know you don’t think I know
Well hold on, hold on
But I know but I know but I know

I always knew what you were
I always knew what you were

Well hang on, hang on
I know you don’t think I know
Well hold on, hold on
But I know but I know but I know

I always knew what you were
I always knew what you were3Embed
