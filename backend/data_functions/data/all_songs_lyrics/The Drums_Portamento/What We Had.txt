What We Had Lyrics
And there are some things that you have to let go
And there are things, honey, that you and I only know

But she'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had


And she'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had


And she'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we hadEmbed
