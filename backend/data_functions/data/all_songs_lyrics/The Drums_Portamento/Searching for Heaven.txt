Searching for Heaven Lyrics
And I can’t meet you tonight
I can’t meet you tonight
I found the difference between
What I wanted it to be
And what it will always be
The things I used to feel I don’t feel anymore
The things I used to say I don’t say anymore
I drop my hands down slowly
Because what I was searching for
Cannot be found

We were searching for heaven
We were searching for heaven
We were searching for heaven
Will we dream again
Will we dream againEmbed
