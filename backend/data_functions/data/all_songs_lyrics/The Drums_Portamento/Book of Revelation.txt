Book of Revelation Lyrics
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin

Oh, darling
You are the son of an evil man
I know you hate yourself
But you’re nothing like him
And it’s over now
You can pick yourself off the ground
'Cause you’re cool now
You’re nothing like him

I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell
I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell

And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin
Oh, let it begin
Let it begin
Let it begin

Oh, we were a pretty thing
But you’re full of fear
Well, not here
No, never here
You can love them
You can hate them
You never wronged them
So you don’t owe them

I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell
I’ve seen the world
And there’s no heaven and there’s no hell

And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them
You can love them, you can hate them
You never wronged them, so you don’t owe them

And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
And I believe
That when we die, we die
So let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight2Embed
