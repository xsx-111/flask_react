Blue Stripes Lyrics
Don't look away
From me
Don't look away
From me

You must be tired
You're workin' hard
And I'm happy you told me
You don't believe in hell

You don't have to be alone, it's sickening
What you want is a family (Aah-oh)

Don't look away
From me
Don't look away
From me

Oh you were a quiet child
You were a sweet boy
And even when they beat you down
You never dropped your sword
You don't have to be alone, it's sickening
What you want is a family (Aah-oh)

Don't look away
From me
Don't look away
From me

You got your blue stripes, you got your blue stripes
You got your blue stripes, around your new girl
You got your blue stripes, you got your blue stripes
You got your blue stripes, around your new girl
You got your blue stripes, you got your blue stripes
You got your blue stripes, around your new girl
You got your blue stripes, you got your blue stripes
You got your blue stripes, around your new girl
You got your blue stripes, you got your blue stripes
You got your blue stripes, around your new girl
You got your blue stripes, you got your blue stripes
You got your blue stripes, around your new girl

Don't look away
From me
Don't look away
From me
Don't look away
From meEmbed
