If He Likes It Let Him Do It Lyrics
If he forgets you
He forgets you for good
If you wanna feel
Better start searching some more
Because it was a happy time
Now it’s winter time
And you’re cold

If he likes it let him do it
If he likes it let him do it

I could never be a soldier
So I won’t make you stand so tall
And tonight’s the night
When there’s light in your eyes
And you say goodbye
Or I die
