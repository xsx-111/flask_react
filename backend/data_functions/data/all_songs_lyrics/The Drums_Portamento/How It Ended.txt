How It Ended Lyrics
Those days when I would sit around with you
There's nothing like it
And even when my heart was black and blue
There's nothing like it
And everything before and after you
It doesn't cut it

So do you remember the old times
Those were the only times, the only times

I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here

You never have to say that you were wrong
I know I'd do it all again
Even if it was wrong
And I could write a thousand more songs about you
Before this one's done
The next one's begun
So do you remember the old times
Those were the only times, the only times

I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here

And how will this end
And when will my life begin
Again, again, again, again

So do you remember the old times
Those were the only times, the only times

I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here4Embed
