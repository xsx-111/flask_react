Money Lyrics
Before I die, I'd like to do something nice
Take my hand, and I'll take it for a ride
You hit me yesterday, because I made you cry
So before we die, I'd like to do something nice

I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money

And if I had a car I would trade in my car
If I had a gun I would trade in my gun
Honey, we ran from the country when we rushed to the city
And now there's nothin' to be done
There's nothin' to be done
There's nothin' to be done
There's nothin' to be done

I want to buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money

And I wanna buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
And I want to buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money23Embed
