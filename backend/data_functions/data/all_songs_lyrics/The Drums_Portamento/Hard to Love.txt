Hard to Love Lyrics
Tell me why when you look me in the eye
Do I feel like I want to die?
I've been at work all day in the pouring rain
Just to give you something you'll forget

And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love

You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
But you're hard to love

And I don't know why after all this time
Every single song I sing is about you
And you walk away, you just walk away
But I still make your bed, and you still leave me for dead

And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love

You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
But you're hard to love
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away

And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love

You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love4Embed
