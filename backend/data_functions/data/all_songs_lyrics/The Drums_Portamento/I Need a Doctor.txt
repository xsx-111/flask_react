I Need a Doctor Lyrics
You’re like a child and I like that
You’re always sleeping on my doorstep
And you’re such a pretty thing
And I like that

You’re like a child and I like that
You’re always pushing me so close to death
And it’s such a stupid thing
But I like that

But you torture me
And you ruin me

I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you
That night you put your lipstick on me
I felt stupid so I drank to get dizzy
And when you fell asleep
I threw a tambourine at your face
And of course I missed
Cause I always miss
Yeah I always miss
Yeah I always miss

But you torture me
And you ruin me

I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Feels so bad
Feels so bad
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you1Embed
