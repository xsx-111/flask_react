In the Cold Lyrics
I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you again
And I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you again

And I don’t really understand
What you’re after
Cause I was looking for you
Only looking for you

We used to feel
Like the world was passing us by
But now it’s only you that’s passing me by
It’s only you that’s passing me by
It's only you that's passing me by
It's only you that's passing me by

I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you again
And I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you againEmbed
