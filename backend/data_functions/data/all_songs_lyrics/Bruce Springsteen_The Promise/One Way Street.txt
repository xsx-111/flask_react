One Way Street Lyrics
If the sun should fall from the sky tomorrow
If the rain brings the tears to your eye, I would share your sorrow
But you must go if you can't take the heat, our love was fine, our love was sweet
But we was walking on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street
Well I'm not with all those guys, who rode out in your eyes
Sometimes, ya sometimes, I can't forget your lines
But hold the train, just come today, and for your wrong, well you must pay
And we're walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street
If I'm old my darlin' eye, I must confess
That this can't be love, no I must be a man possessed
When I look in your eyes so bright, your walkin' and your dress fits you just right
But we were walking on a dead end, running down a one way street
Well their's a man, could change the things, he feels inside
If for once I, could turn and make it swallow some of my pride
But for the wrongs, oh yes we must pay, so its bye bye baby today
And we'll go walking on that wildside, runnin' down a one way street
Yeah when I think, of all the girls, that I have I missed
Well I know I, would give them up, for just one kiss
That's nn..we, we are the same kind, and to leave you baby, I have to go blind

Oh when we're walking on the wildside, running down a one way street
Oh oh yes we are, we'll keep walking on that bad side, running down that one way street
Ohh yes we will, we'll keep walking on that bad side, running down a one way streetEmbed
