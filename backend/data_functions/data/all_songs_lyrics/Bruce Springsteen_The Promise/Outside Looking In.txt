Outside Looking In Lyrics
It's all over now, the thing we had
I ain't sorry, babe, I just feel mad
You walk real pretty and you talk real fine
But night after night babe I'm on the line
My life's the same story
Again and again
I' m on the outside looking in
On the outside looking in

Well everyday just brings the same
You go out looking for some strange new games
Pretty soon them games ain't fun anymore
And it's something else that you're looking for
You've got all the answers, you and your friends
And I'm on the outside looking in
Yes I'm on the outside looking in

Now you've got the pretty things you want
The sins of the angels baby they will haunt
Those pretty eyes that they all adore
But baby not me, not anymore
I do what I want to
I'll be what I am
I'm on the outside looking in
Yeah I'm on the outside looking in (I'm on the outside looking in)
Baby yes I am (I'm on the outside looking in)
Ah baby yes I am (I'm on the outside looking in)
Well baby I'm on the outside looking inEmbed
