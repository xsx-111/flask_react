Framed LyricsI was walkin' down the street mindin' my own affair
When two policemen grabbed me, unaware
He says "Your name Henry?", I says "Why sure"
He says "You're the boy I've been lookin' for"
I was framed, framed
I was blamed, framed
Well, I never knew nothin'
But I always get framed
Oh, framed
They took me in the lineup and let those bright lights shine
There were ten poor souls like me in that line
I knew I was a victim of someone's evil plan
When a stool pigeon walked in says "There's your man"
I was framed, framed
I was blamed
Oh, framed, framed, framed
Well, I never knew nothin'
But I always get framed
Well, the prosecutor turned and started a-prosecutin' me
Man, that cat didn't give me the one, but the third degree
He says "Where were you on the night of July 1953?"
"Man, I was just home just a-tweedly-dee"
I was framed, oh. framed
I was blamed
Oh, framed, framed, framed
Well, I never knew nothin'
But I always get framed
Oh, framed
Oh, framedEmbed
