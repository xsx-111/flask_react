Hi-tone Lyrics
Hi-Tone, Hi-Tone

All the fellas call my baby Hi-Tone, Hi-Tone
They all think she's always acting Hi-Tone, Hi-Tone
Sweet sixteen doesn't wear jeans
Walks around the campus like a high school queen
That's why all the fellas think she's Hi-Tone

But when I'm the only one around
She lets her hair down
She's just-a boppin' baby
And a crazy little clown
She may be shy with the other guy
But when she's with me, oh, my!

Let the other fellas call her Hi-Tone, Hi-Tone
They all think she's always acting Hi-Tone, Hi-Tone
'Cause when we're alone
She's all of my own
And that's why I love Hi-Tone

But when I'm the only one around
She lets her hair down
She's just-a boppin' baby
And a crazy little clown
She may be shy with the other guy
But when she's with me, oh, my!
Let the other fellas call her Hi-Tone, Hi-Tone
They all think she's always acting Hi-Tone, Hi-Tone
'Cause when we're alone
She's all of my own
And that's why I love Hi-Tone

'Cause when we're alone
She's all of my own
And that's why I love Hi-ToneEmbed
