In a Turkish Town Lyrics
There across the sea
Waits my fair loved one
In a Turkish town
Waiting there for me

And I know that someday
We'll live and love
So the mystic Turks say
From the stars up above

So wait there, my loved one, I'm coming home
To my little Turkish girl in a Turkish town
To my little Turkish girl in a Turkish town


So wait there, my loved one, I'm coming home
To my little Turkish girl in a Turkish town
To my little Turkish girl in a Turkish townEmbed
