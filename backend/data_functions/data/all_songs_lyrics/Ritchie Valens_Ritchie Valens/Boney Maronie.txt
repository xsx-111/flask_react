Boney Maronie Lyrics
Well, I got a girl name Boney Maronie
Well, she's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Oughta see her rock 'n' roll with blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bone

Well, I love her, she loves me
Whoa, how happy now we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree

Well, I told her mama, and I told her papa, too
Well, just exactly what I'm gonna do
Get married on a night of June
And rock 'n' roll by silvery moon

Well, I love her, she loves me
Whoa, how happy now, we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree


She's my one and only, she's my heart desire
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
Ev'rybody turns when my baby goes by
She's somethin' to see that really catches the eye
Well, I love her, and she loves me
Whoa, how happy, now we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple treeEmbed
