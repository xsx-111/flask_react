Bluebirds Over the Mountain LyricsBluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me
Boy and girl they fell in love
Each was like the heavens above
He looked in her eyes of blue
She vowed to him that she'd be true
Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me
I miss you, oh can't you see?
You're the only girl for me
Soon you're gone
And I'm all alone
Come on, baby
Come back home
Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me
Well-well-well
Bring my baby back to me
Well-well-well
Bring my baby back to me
Well-well-well
Bring my baby back to meEmbed
