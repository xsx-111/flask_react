Ooh My Head LyricsWell, yeah, now, now, baby
Let's just go all night long
Well, on, on ,on, on, darlin'
I just want to go on more
There won't be no tutti frutti
No, not at all
C'mon, baby, just rock, rock, rock
Well, now, now, now, now, honey
We gonna rock all night
Well, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
We're just gonna go fine
Well, on, on, on, on, darlin'
Ooh, my head
Well, Boney Moronie, Peggy Sue, yeah
Ain't gonna be around no more
Well, on now, little, little darlin'
We just gonna party some more
But I love, love you darlin'
Ooh, my head (Now, let's go)
Well, now, now, now, now, baby
Keep me rockin' on and on
Well, I just hear you talkin'
All day 'n' all night long
Well, now
Ooh, my head
Alright, well
Rock it now
C'mon, boy
My head is tiredEmbed
