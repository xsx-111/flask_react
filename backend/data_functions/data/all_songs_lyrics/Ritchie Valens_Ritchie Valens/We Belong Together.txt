We Belong Together LyricsYou're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternity
You're mine
Your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me
For eternity
You're mine, my baby
And you'll always be
I swear by everything I own
You'll always, always be mine
You're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternityEmbed
