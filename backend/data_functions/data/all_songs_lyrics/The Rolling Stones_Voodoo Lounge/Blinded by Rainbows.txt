Blinded by Rainbows Lyrics
Did you ever feel the pain that he felt upon the cross?
Did you ever feel the knife tearing flesh that's oh so soft?
Did you ever touch the night? Did you ever count the cost?
Do you hide away the fear? Put down paradise as lost?

Yeah, you're blinded by rainbows, watching the wind blow
Blinded by rainbows
Do you dream at night? Do you sleep at night?
I doubt it

Did you ever feel the blast as the Semtex bomb goes off?
Do you ever hear the screams as the limbs are all torn off?
Did you ever kiss the child who just saw his father shot?
Do you ever shed a tear as the war drags on and on?
Did you ever touch the night or is it just another job?
Do you fear the final hours? Put down Paradise as lost?

Yeah, you're blinded by rainbows and faces in windows
Blinded by rainbows
Do you dream at night? Do you sleep at night?
I doubt it
Mhmm, yeah

Do you ever fear the night? Could it be the war is lost?
Do you fear the final hour? Do you kneel before the cross?

You're blinded by rainbows and watching the wind blow
Blinded by rainbows
Do you dream at night? Do you scream at night?
Do you smell the fear? Is your conscience clear?
Are you caked in sweat? Are your clothes all wet?
Do you see the light? Is the end in sight?
See the face of Christ? Enter Paradise?
I doubt itEmbed
