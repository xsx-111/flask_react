Sweethearts Together Lyrics
Sweethearts together
We've only just begun
Sweethearts together
We'll take life as it comes
Sweethearts forever
Two hearts together as one

Everybody needs someone
To tell their troubles to
To share the pain and laughter
In a world beset with fools
To help you with your ups and downs
Someone to heal your wounds
So we're

Sweethearts together
Where two hearts beat as one
Sweethearts together
We've only just begun
Sweethearts forever
Two hearts together as one
As one
Everyone so cynical
And says that love won't last
Think about your future
Stop living in the past
Time's not standing still
So stop looking through those tinted glasses

Sweethearts together
We've only just begun
Sweethearts together
So glad I've found someone
Sweethearts forever
Two hearts together as one
As one


Love is never easy
It's never silky smooth
There's always something tempting
In the wilderness of youth
But I will stay right by your side
The truth will out, you'll realize
We're
Sweethearts together
We've only just begun
Sweethearts together
So glad I've found someone
Sweethearts forever
Two hearts together as one
As one

As one
As one
Baby, as one
Sweethearts togetherEmbed
