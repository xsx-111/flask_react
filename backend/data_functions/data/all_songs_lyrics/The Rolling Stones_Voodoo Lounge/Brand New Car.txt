Brand New Car Lyrics
I got a brand new car
And I, I like to drive real hard
I, I got a brand new car
And I'm, I'm feeling good so far

Take her on the highway for a little spin
I want to see the kind of shape she's in
And I, I got a brand new star
Jack her up baby, go on, open the hood
I want to check if the oil smells good
Mmm, smells like caviar

Mmm, give her some stick
Push her too far, right to the brink

Hear the motor running, yeah, she's right in sync
Tell me if she's thirsty, would she like a drink?
And I'm stopping at this bar
Slinking like a panther, you can hear her purr
Touch her on the seat, go on, feel the fur
And I, I got a brand new star
Yeah, that's right
Mmm, fill her with juice
Foot to the floor, take some abuse

Oh I, I got a brand new car
And I, I drive her in the dark, yeah
And I, I got a brand new car
Mmm, I think I'll stop and park
Alright
I, mmm mmm mmm mmm
I sip my best cigar
C'mon, come with me
I get my credit card
C'mon, come on with me
C'mon
C'mon and let me
I'll let you drive it
I'll let you drive itEmbed
