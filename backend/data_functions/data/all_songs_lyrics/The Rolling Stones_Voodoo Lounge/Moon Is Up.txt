Moon Is Up Lyrics
The moon is up, the sun is down
You can't have it both ways round
Ooh babe, won't you listen to me
We are worlds apart, you see

Mmm, where are you now?
Mmm, crying out loud
Where did you go when I needed you?

The sun sinks behind the clouds
And hides his tears without a sound
The moon looks on reflectively
So spare a thought for you and me

Mmm, where are you now?
Mmm, dark are the clouds
Where did you go when I needed you?


The moon is up, the sky is black
I'll sail away and won't come back
The sun goes down, the stars will rise
And dance across the darkened skies
Mmm, the sun goes down, the moon comes up
The moon is up, the sun goes down
And you can't have it both ways 'round
So come on babe, and listen to me
'Cause we are worlds apart, you see

The sun goes down
The moon comes up
The sun goes downEmbed
