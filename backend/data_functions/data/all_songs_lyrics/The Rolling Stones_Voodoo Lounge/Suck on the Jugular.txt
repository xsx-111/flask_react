Suck on the Jugular Lyrics
Been keeping cool been lying low
Been dancing smooth and dancing slow
Keeping myself to myself, my nose is clean
But I'm a man, not a machine

All get together and feel alright
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and rock all night
(All get together and rock all night)
All get together and feel alright
(All get together and feel alright)

Get ready, for sure
Okay, let's go
Suck on the jugular

Love to change my shape and change my name
Want to get out of myself for a while, don't feel no shame
I love men to be men and women women
On special occasions, diving and dipping

All get together and feel alright
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and fuck all night
(All get together and fuck all night)
All right
Get ready, for sure
Okay, let's go
Suck on the jugular

Yes

Okay, let's go
Alright, oh no
Uh-huh, alright
Alright

Let's live lasciviously down in the muck
And when tonight's over, you're gonna watch me blow
And self-destruct

All get together and feel alright
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and feel alright
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and rock all night
(All get together and rock all night)
All get together and feel alright
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and rock
All get together and rock
All get together and rock
All get together and rock all night
All get together and feel alright
(All get together and feel alright)
(All get together and rock all night)
(All get together and rock all night)Embed
