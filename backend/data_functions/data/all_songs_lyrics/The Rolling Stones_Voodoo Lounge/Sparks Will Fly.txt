Sparks Will Fly Lyrics
You'd better grease up, I'm coming back
Gonna catch fire, pyromaniac
You better shape up, you better get set
Gonna burn up in the smoke of a jet

Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back to you, baby
Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back to you baby
Ooh, you're gonna find out
Oh, gonna scream and shout
Ah, we're gonna pierce through this drought
Sparks will fly, yeah, sparks will fly

I'm gonna stand back, the flames are high
I better get help, can't stop the fire
Bell's going to ring, hear the alarms
Better tell the fire chief to quit playing cards

Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Ooh, I'm gonna step on the gas
Um, I want to get there really fast
Ooh, I wanna fuck your sweet ass
Sparks will fly
Sharks will cry
Sparks will fly
I had a good sniff around
Along old hunting grounds
But I have never found
A woman so hot

The sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Hey, sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Ooh, my fingers are crossed
Hay, the time that we lost
Hey, I'm in total chaos
And sparks will fly
Sparks will fly

Oh yeah
Sparks will fly
Sparks will fly, yeah
Sparks will fly (Back on you, baby)
Sparks will fly (Back on you, baby)
Sparks will fly (Sparks will fly)
Come on, come on (Sparks will fly)
Come on, come on, come on, come on (Sparks will fly)
Oh yeah, sparks will fly, oh yeahEmbed
