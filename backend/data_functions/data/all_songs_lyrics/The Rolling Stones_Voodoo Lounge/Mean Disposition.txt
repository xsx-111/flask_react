Mean Disposition Lyrics
I'm getting wise to you, you're going to see
I'm going to work on you the way you worked on me
I got a sharper aim and you're in my sights
If I'm going to go, I'm going in a blaze of lights

And in this crazy world of hit and run
There are no laws here, just a loaded gun

She's got a mean disposition
Got a big shooter too
She's got a mean disposition
Really make a mess, really make a mess out of you

I never close my eyes, I never sleep
I'm staying on my guard, waiting for my flesh to creep
And I never trusted you and you never trusted me
I'll do a deal with you, if you'll do a deal with me

For me the nightmare's only just begun
There is no law here, just a loaded gun
She's got a mean disposition
Got a big shooter too
She's got a mean disposition
Got a bad attitude
She's got a mean disposition
Going to cut you half, going to cut you half in two
Alright


I'm going have to stand my ground like Crockett at the Alamo
I'm going to draw the line, one of us has got to go

She's got a mean disposition
Got a big shooter too
She's got a mean disposition
Got a bad attitude
She's got a mean disposition
Going to make a mess out of you
She's got a mean disposition
Going to cut you half, going to cut you half in twoEmbed
