I Go Wild Lyrics
You whipped me, I'm hurting
Abused me for certain
And slavery should not exist
Is this what I get, a poison kiss?
Without you I'm dead meat
I'm a raggedy dog dying in the streets
Of a god-forsaken shanty town
Where gangs of children are hunted down

I go wild when you're in my face
I go wild when I taste your taste
I go wild and I, I go insane
I get sick, somebody stop this pain

You left me, I'm brain dead
I'm feeling nothing, strapped to my bed
On life support, tubes in my nose
Tubes in my arms, shot full of holes

I go wild when you're in my face
I go wild when I taste your taste
I go wild and act like a goat
And I, I get sick, lumps in my throat
I go wild
I go wild
I go crazy, I go insane
I get sick, somebody stop this pain

And the doctor says you'll be okay
And if you'd only stay away
From femme fatales and dirty bitches
And daylight drabs and night time witches
And working girls and blue stockings
And dance hall babes and body poppers
And waitresses with broken noses, checkout girls striking poses
Politicians' garish wives with alcoholic cunts like knives

I go wild
I go wild
I go wild
I go wild
I go wild when you're in my face
I go wild, entranced in a state of grace
I go wild when you treat me bad
I go wild, raving mad

I go wild for you
I go wild for you
I go wild
I go wild
I go wild
I go wildEmbed
