Thru and Thru Lyrics
You know that we do take away
We deliver, too
Open twenty-four hours, babe
Just waiting on a call from you
Waiting on a call from you

Well, I'm in the Yellow Pages
You just take a look
Look me up under Services
You know it's just an open book
Babe, it's just an open book, yeah
It's just an open book
But baby

Any minute, any hour
I'm waiting on a call from you
And you know this heart is constant
I'm your lover, baby, through and through
Lover, baby, through and through
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh

I only found out yesterday
I heard it on the news
What I heard really pissed me off
'Cause now I got those fucking blues
I got those awesome blues
Babe, I got those nothing blues
But any minute, any hour
I'm waiting on a call from you
And you know this heart is constant, babe
I'm your lover, baby, through and through
Your lover, baby, through and through

You know that we do take away
But we deliver too
We're open twenty-four hours for you
'Cause we're waiting on a call from you
Ooh, waiting on a call from you

Ooh but any minute, baby, any hour
I'm waiting on a call from you
Yeah, you know that this heart is constant
I'm your lover, baby, through and through
Lover, baby, through and through
Yeah, lover, baby, through and through
I was your lover, baby, through and through
Baby, through and through, oh yeah
Open twenty-four hours for you
Ooh, it's under Services
I'm waiting, waiting on a call from you
Waiting on a call from youEmbed
