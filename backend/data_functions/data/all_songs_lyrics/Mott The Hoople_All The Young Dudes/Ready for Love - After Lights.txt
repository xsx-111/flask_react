Ready for Love / After Lights LyricsWalking down the rocky road
Wondering where my life is leading
Rolling on to the bitter end
Finding out along the way
What it takes to keep love living
You should know how it feels my friend
Ooh, want you to stay
Ooh, want you today
And I'm ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let go, you know I'm ready for you
Don't you be slow you know what I'm going to do
Give it to me, you know what I'm talking of
Give it to me, I'm ready for love
Now I'm on my feet again
Better things are bound to happen
All my dues surely must be paid
Many miles and many tears
Times were hard but now they're changing
You should know that I'm not afraid
Ooh, want you to stay
Ooh, want you today
I'm ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let go you know I'm ready for you
Don't be slow, you know what I'm going to do
Why don't you give it to me, you know what I'm talking of
Give it to me, I'm ready for love
Oh, I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ahh, ahh, woohEmbed
