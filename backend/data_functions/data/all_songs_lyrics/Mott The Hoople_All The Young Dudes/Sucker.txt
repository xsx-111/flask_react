Sucker LyricsHi there your friendly neighbourhood sadist want to take you for a ride
Come on tell me 'bout the nights that I make you cry
Two tiny purple hands crawling out across the floor
All I could hear was a voice "Give me more more more"
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
She knows its right in her heart I never fail
She's a sucker
Oh
Oh
God help the woman who's late for work I get a green light flashing red
Like a superstar (brass town?) queen who's crown I bled
Now I just ran out of aspirin for an aching head
So I guess I'll have to do it just one more time instead
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
She knows its right in her heart I never fail
She's a sucker
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Good games play games no names well that's alright if you can stand the pain
You can smoke my cigar all night through the link in your chain
Stand up baby, it's time to go
Well look what's here maybe if we do it slow
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
My baby call me when she want a tale
