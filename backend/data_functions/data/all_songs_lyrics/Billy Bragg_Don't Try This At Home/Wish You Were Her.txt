Wish You Were Her LyricsThere's a girl sleeping in my bed
And I'm singing unwritten songs in my head
She provided bittersweet company
I confided how much you mean to me
And this time
It's gonna take a train to pull me through
Some brief distraction from your memory
Is all that I hoped that she might be
And as I let her warm her feet on me
Wish you were her
That I wanted you to be my wife
Is the worst kept secret of my life
Everyone knows, even my friend here
I've just whispered your name in her ear
And this time
It's gonna take a train to pull me through
Some brief distraction from your memory
Is all that I hoped that she might be
And as I ask her how she takes her tea
Wish you were her
Her
I wish you were herEmbed
