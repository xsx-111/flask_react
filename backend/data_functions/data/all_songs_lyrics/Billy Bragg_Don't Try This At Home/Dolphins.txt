Dolphins LyricsSometimes I think about
Saturday's child
And all about the time
We were running wild
I've been searching
For the dolphins in the sea
And sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me
This world may never change
The way it's been
And all the ways of war
Won't change it back again
I'm not the one to tell
This world how to get along
I only know that peace will come
When all our hate is gone
This world may never changeEmbed
