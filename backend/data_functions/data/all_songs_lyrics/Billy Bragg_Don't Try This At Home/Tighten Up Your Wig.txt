Tighten Up Your Wig LyricsThere is power in a union
A union between two people
And their fruits, the family
When you're raising a family
You're raising a consciousness can't you see?
When you're raising a family
You're raising a consciousness can't you see?
Raise up your family
Not through intimidation but through liberation
A child doesn't start to learn at school
In family life teaches him or her the rules
When you're raising a family
You're raising a consciousness can't you see?
When you're raising a family
You're raising a consciousness can't you see?
(Think about it)
You have to educate from the outset
You can't buy it at no factory outlet
So step off and tighten up your wife
Rave up Woody Dee
Heal thyself
Rave up
When you're raising a family you're
Raising a consciousness can't you see
When you're raising a family
You're raising a consciousness can't you see
When you're raising a family
You're raising a consciousness can't you see?
When you're raising a family
You're raising a consciousness can't you see?
(Think about it)
