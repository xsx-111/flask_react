MBH LyricsI hate you
When I see you on the street
Acting hard, thinking on your feet
Treating me like some piece of meat
I forgive you, the things you do, forgive me too
I love you
But nothing I can say will change
If you admit you feel the same
Did you just ask me why I'm acting strange
I forgive you, the things you do, forgive me tooEmbed
