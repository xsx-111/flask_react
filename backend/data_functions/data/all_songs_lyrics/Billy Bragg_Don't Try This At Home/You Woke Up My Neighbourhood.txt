You Woke Up My Neighbourhood LyricsAs I wait for sleep to drag me under
In the evening gloom I sit and wonder
The words I should have said to you
The things I always meant to do
The bad dreams that all came true
You woke up my neighbourhood
Night after night we would row
You woke up my neighbourhood
Things are pretty quiet 'round here now
When I think of how we were together
I know we couldn't be like that forever
Beneath the Seven Sister stars
The night we let it go too far
I slept out in the car
You woke up my neighbourhood
Night after night we would row
You woke up my neighbourhood
Things are pretty quiet 'round here now
I remember skipping on the porch till it grew cold
I remember feeling like I was eight years old
Somersaults across the lawn
Singing dancing up till dawn
Every now and then we'd have a row
You woke up my neighbourhood
Things are pretty quiet round here now
You woke up my neighbourhood
Night after night we would row
You woke up my neighbourhood
Things are pretty quiet 'round here nowEmbed
