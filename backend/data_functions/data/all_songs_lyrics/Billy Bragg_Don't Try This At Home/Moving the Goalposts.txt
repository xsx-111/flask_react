Moving the Goalposts LyricsI put on my raincoat to make it rain
And sure enough the skies opened up again
I dreamed of you as I walked to the shops
You were dancing with the wallies on Top Of The Pops
Once in a while
Gennady Gerasimov drops his smile
And you can see that his aim's
A portfolio pregnant with gains
He's been up all night
Moving the goalposts
Like a jackdaw with a fiery brand
Spread the news all over this land
Robin Hood and his Merry Men
Are never, never, never coming back again
I don't believe that love should be pain
So could you please rub my back again
I think it's safe to leave tham in the park
Let's blow out the candles and kiss in the dark
Heavens above
Can this sticky stuff really be love!
Don't get dressed yet
Not yet
We've been up all night
Moving the goalpostsEmbed
