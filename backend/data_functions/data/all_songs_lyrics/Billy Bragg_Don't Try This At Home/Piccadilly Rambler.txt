Piccadilly Rambler LyricsI'm the Piccadilly Rambler
The streets are my pillow
Up Shaftesbury Avenue
Down Leicester Square
I roam and I rove over London's fair city
'Til some jolly policeman says
"Hey, piss off outta there"
In a precinctal alleyway
Where the rain cannot find me
The cold wind and cold-hearted
Leave my body alone
I sleep and I dream
Of my sweet independence
And the freedom I've squandered
Since I left my sad home
I'm thе Piccadilly Rambler
The streets are my pillow
Up Shaftеsbury Avenue
Down Leicester Square
I'll happily toast
To your health and good fortune
So don't begrudge me a drink
If you've a penny to spare
If you've a penny to spareEmbed
