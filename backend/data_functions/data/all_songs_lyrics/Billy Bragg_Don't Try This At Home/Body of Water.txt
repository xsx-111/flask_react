Body of Water LyricsI will cross this body of water
If you promise you won't try this at home
You're where you want to be
Where am I, I'm up a tree
I had a hurt attack
Rolled away, now I'm bouncing back
Forgive me for feeling sick
I think I just got up too quick
Is this the consequence
Of an out of bed experience
Where I'm from the sun don't shine
We keeps the light on all the time
I walk upon the ground we dream about
You finding out about it now
But you are clever never to be found
Summer could take a hint
Seeing you in a floral print
Oh, to become a pearl
In the wordy world of the Cornflake GirlEmbed
