This Gulf Between Us LyricsWho will come to carry me home?
Carry me over the river
Must I face this all on my own?
Face the lies and the gulf between us
Face the lies and the gulf between us
Dawn breaks over the squares and the parks
But the sunlight cannot find me
No warmth filters down through the dark
That lies in the gulf between us
That lies in this gulf between us
Please don't hand me your sympathy
If only to ease your conscience
I'm sure you'd rather step over me
Than cross this gulf between us
Step across this gulf between usEmbed
