Write About Love LyricsI know a spell
That would make you well
Write about love
It could be in any tense, but it must make sense
I know a trick
Forget that you are sick
Write about love
It could be in any form, hand it to me in the morning
I hate my job, I’m working way too much
(Every day I’m stuck in an office)
At one o’clock, I take my lunch up on the roof
The city’s right below, I write about a man
He’s intellectual and he’s hot, but he understands
The seconds move on (if you watch the clock)
And the sky grows dull (if you’re looking up)
And the girls move from thrill to thrill on the tightrope walk
(On the tightrope walk)
I hate my job, I’m working way too much
(Every day I’m stuck in an office)
At one o’clock, I take my lunch up on the roof
The city’s right below, I write about a man
He’s intellectual and he’s hot, but he understands
I know a way (so you know the way)
Get on your skinny knees and pray (maybe not today)
You’ve got to see the dream through the windows and the trees of your living room (of your living room)
You’ve got to see the dream through the windows and the trees of your living roomEmbed
