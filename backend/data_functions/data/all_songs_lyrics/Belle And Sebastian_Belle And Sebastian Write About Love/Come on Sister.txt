Come on Sister LyricsSix in the morning, the men started working
I can't sleep, no, I can't sleep
I keep feeling the lights so I think I should get up and call you
Going to find you
And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were
Everyone loves you; the boy in the corner
The postman, the policeman
It does me no good to keep looking ahead
At your future adoration
And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
I've seen all kinds of strangers, the rich and the famous
They don't count, no, they don't count
Now I'm back on my beat on the same greasy street
There's an angel on my shoulder
Saying, "Ho
Have you ever said an honest word?"
Saying, "Yo
Have you ever said a pretty word?"
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you can never go back
Faith
Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes and the hours of your life
You could love
After all that's what you're looking for
You can love
It's a currency unspoken of
But it's hard to form a good opinion
If you're going to look at me that way
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you can never go back
Faith
Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes and the hours of your lifeEmbed
