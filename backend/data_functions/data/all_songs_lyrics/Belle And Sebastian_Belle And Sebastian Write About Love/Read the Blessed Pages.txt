Read the Blessed Pages Lyrics
Love and pain and sorrow
Keep the band together
She was like my soulmate
Whispered in my ear
Love was playing music
It was all we wanted
Making plastic records
Of our history

How I knew it mattered
To a certain person
Heard the boy in London
Called out from the crowd
Said something that echoes
To me ten years later
Wishing that he still called
Like he called that night

Pulling songs from thin air
Pulling songs from bridges
Smell the air in small towns
Where the train line stops
Ever will I love you
Now your chapter's over
Ever will I love you
You were good to me
Now a pain in memory
Is a cherished story
Moan about the present
Venerate the past
Love is like a novel
Read the blessed pages
Did I do my best dear?
That is all you askEmbed
