Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John Lyrics
What a waste, I could have been your lover
What a waste, I could have been your friend
Perfect love is like the blossom that fades so quick
When it’s blowing up a storm in May

Travel south until your skin gets warmer
Travel south until your skin turns brown
Put a language in your head and get on a train
And then come back to the one you love

Yeah, you’re great, you’re just part
Of this lifetime of dreaming
That extends to the heart
Of this long summer feeling

Quiet night, you see the TVs glowing
Quiet night, you hear the walls are awake
Me and you are getting out of the party crowd
Can I see what’s underneath your bed?

Can I stay until the milkman’s working?
Can I stay until the café awakes?
Do you hate me in the light, did you get a fright
When you looked across from where you lay?
Yeah you’re great, you’re just part
Of this lifetime of dreaming
That extends to the heart
Of this long summer feeling
All the history of boys
I invent in my head
Little Lou, Ugly Jack
Prophet John

All the history of boys
I invent in my head
Little Lou, Ugly Jack
Prophet John

What a waste, I could have been your lover
What a waste, I could have been your friend3Embed
