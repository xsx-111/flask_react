The Ghost of Rockschool LyricsI've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
But it all disappears and then I wake up
Was it too late, was it just your fate?
There's a demon that waits at the garden gate
If you get past him maybe Lawrence and Phil
Will be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool
Everything hums as the blue heart turns
And the blue girl's dawn is when the sun goes down
My story tonight is from your solitude heights
I got a window on your constellation
Master I love from the ground above
As the stars below as my memory flows
Every picture frame is beating louder than time
Every clock in the hall is bending slowly
She's in her tower and she's beautiful, sure
The quicker you learn she has no soul to discern
At least no business of yours, you bear the vacuum of scars
She was put there to tempt you like the perfume of flowers
I've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
I've seen God shining out from her reflection
I've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in the puddles and the lane beside houses
I've seen God shining out from her reflectionEmbed
