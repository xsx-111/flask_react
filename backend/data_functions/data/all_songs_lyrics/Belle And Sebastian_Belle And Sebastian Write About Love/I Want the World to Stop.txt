I Want the World to Stop Lyrics
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (give me the understanding)
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning, give me the afternoon
The night, the night...

Let me step out of my shell
That's wrapped in sheets of milky winter disorder
Let me feel the air again, the talk of friends
The mind of someone my equal

I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (give me the understanding)
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning, give me the afternoon
The night...! the night...!

Tinseltown has followed me
From Tinseltown to grey adorable city by the docks;
The girls are walking, moving air, the sun hangs low
The girls don’t care as they paint themselves at dusk
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (give me the afternoon)
The night...! the night...!

Towns’ and cities’ populations up and grow;
The workers move to the suburbs
In between I watch and go;
I run alongside rush hour traffic, a prayer for every car


I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (give me the understanding)
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning, give me the afternoon
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (give me the understanding)
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (give me the afternoon)
The night...! the night...!

I want to write a message to you
Everyday at 10 o'clock in the evening
Yellow pearl my city is
This is your art, this is your Balzac, your Brookside, and your Bach2Embed
