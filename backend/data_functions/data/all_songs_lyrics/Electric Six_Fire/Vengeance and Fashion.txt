Vengeance and Fashion Lyrics
I saw fire when I looked in my lover's eyes, woah
I saw the devil dressed up in disguise, woah
And you know it gets hotter than a microwave oven
When you and I commence the lovin'
And you like what I'm doin'
And I like what I'm doin' to you
And everybody's happy, happy tonight

I'm a man and I'm torn between vengeance and fashion, woah
And I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up in the passion, woah
And you know that my suit cost more than your house
I'm a scoundrel, a lover, a murderous louse
And I look good in your bed
And you think that I'm lookin' good
And everybody's happy, happy tonight

She's a girl and she's got some really crazy ideas, man, woah
She wants to push the button and execute this innocent man, woah
And you know she's depressed in her wedding dress
She's gonna have her rings removed
And I like the way she's lookin'
Yeah, she's lookin' like a hundred dollars
And everybody's happy, happy tonightEmbed
