Danger! High Voltage Lyrics
Fire in the disco, fire in the Taco Bell
Fire in the disco, fire in the gates of Hell
Don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire, it's my desire
Don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire, it's my desire

Danger! Danger! High voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
Danger! Danger! High voltage
When we touch, when we kiss, when we touch
Danger! Danger! High voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
Danger! Danger! High voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
When we touch, when we kiss

Well, don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire
Don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire

Danger! Danger! High voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
Danger! Danger! It's high voltage
When we touch, when we kiss, when we touch
Danger! Danger! High voltage
When we touch, when we kiss, when we kiss
Danger! Danger! High Voltage!
When we touch, when we kiss
When we touch, when we kiss
No more!
Fire in the disco, fire in the disco
Fire in the Taco Bell
Fire in the disco, fire in the disco
Fire in the gates of Hell
The gates of Hell1Embed
