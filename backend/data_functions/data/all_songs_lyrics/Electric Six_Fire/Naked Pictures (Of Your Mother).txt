Naked Pictures (Of Your Mother) Lyrics
Well, nobody wants to burn in Hell
But everybody's got a soul to sell
When I was young my mama gave me some advice
She said "Boy, don't you know everybody's got a price?"

I make lots of money, I make more money than you
I drive around in my limo, that's what I was born to do
And I might like you better if we fought together
If it's not to be, you know that I got somethin' better for you:

Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother, GO
Solo!

I dropped a bomb on Japan
I was a hostage in Iran
I'm the ugly American
Now I'm a government man
A government man!
And I make lots of money, I make more money than you
I drive around in my limo, that's what I was born to do
And I might like you better if we fought together
If it's not to be, you know that I got somethin' better for you:

Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother, GOEmbed
