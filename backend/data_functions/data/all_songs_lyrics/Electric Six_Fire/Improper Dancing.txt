Improper Dancing Lyrics
Everybody's doin'
What they shouldn't be doin'
Everybody's doin' it
In the middle of the street
Everybody's movin'
What they shouldn't be movin'
Everybody's movin' it
In the middle of the street

Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Somebody better notify the chief of police

Everybody's freakin'
Who they shouldn't be freakin'
Everybody's freakin'
In the middle of the street
Everybody's showin'
What they shouldn't be showin'
Everybody's showin' it
In the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Man, those people must have demons livin' in their feet

And I want to reach into the fire of your heart
And I want to program all those beats right from the start
Have you ever been to New York City?

Now music starts to play (play)
Bodies start to sway (sway)
Devil is the DJ
In the middle of the street
Beats are droppin'
Bodies rockin'
Hearts are stoppin'
Electric shockin'
I can't believe what I'm seein'
In the middle of the street

Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Somebody better notify the chief of police
Stop...
Continue!
