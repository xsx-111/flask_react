Getting Into the Jam Lyrics
I'm looking in the mirror and I know I'm a man
And I know she's a girl and she's looking for a man
We've got sexy plans
C'mon!

I'm getting into the jam
I'm getting into the jam
I can feel the jam
Yeah I can feel the jam
Woo!

Drivin' in my car
We're going to the bar
Met her at the bar
Gonna take her to my car
We're gonna make it in my car
C'mon!

I'm getting into the jam
I'm getting into the jam
I can feel the jam
Yeah I can feel the jam
I'm getting into the jam
I'm getting into the jam
I can feel the jam
Yeah I can feel the jam
I'm a man!
I'm getting in to the jam
Yeah I'm a man
I'm getting in to the jam
In to the jam
Now hear me out!
Eeehy! eeehy-oo! eeehy! Come on!
I'm getting into the jam
I'm getting into the jam
I can feel the jam
Yeah I can feel the jam
I'm getting into the jam
I'm getting into the jam
I can feel the jam
Yeah I can feel the jam
Woo!Embed
