Electric Demons in Love Lyrics
I got so much love, I don't know where to put it
I feel so good, I don't know what to do
And I don't mind the forces of evil
If they bring me closer to you

Now baby's in the kitchen and she's fixing up supper
She drank all the wine and now she's drinking some more
She's cutting up the chicken and she's dancing 'round the fire
She shuffles her feet on the linoleum floor

She said "We're starting a fire"
Electric demons in love, oh my
We're starting a fire
Electric demons in love, oh my

I went down to the banks of the river
I went down and I went for a swim
I went down and she pushed me under
And I can't remember where I'd been, no

Now I ain't educated but I sure ain't stupid
And I know what is wrong and I know what is right
Don't give me your religion or the US government
I met my baby in the darkness of the night
I said I met my baby in the darkness of the night
I met my baby in the darkness of the night
Blood on her dress and feathers from a dove
She said "You can't believe everything you see here"
We're starting a fire
Electric demons in love

(We're starting a fire) Electric demons in love
(We're starting a fire) Electric demons in love
(We're starting a fire) Electric demons in love
(We're starting a fire) In loveEmbed
