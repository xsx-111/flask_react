I Invented the Night Lyrics
Hey little kitty with your tail dragging on the floor
You could have a following in every town that you go

But you remember what you said to me
That you are nothing without me

'Cause I invented the night
Yeah I invented the night
In my laboratory using lust and lies

Hey little birdie, fly until your wings desert you
And when you come down, come down on me
'Cause you know I will never hurt you

But maybe once or twice I'll ruffle your feathers
'Cause you said we should always be together

'Cause I invented the night
Yeah I invented the night
Mixing elements of the strangest kind
And should your invention be destroyed in a fire
John, it's only Monday
I gave you Tuesday night and Wednesday night
And Thursday night and Friday night
The weekend is a sea of electric light
Turn it on!

Hey little doggy, always looking for a bigger bone
Try to see how many times that you can run away from home

But in the end you always come back to me
'Cause you are nothing without me

'Cause I invented the night
Yeah I invented the night
Mixing elements of the strangest kindEmbed
