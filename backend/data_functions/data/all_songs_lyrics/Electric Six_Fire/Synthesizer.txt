Synthesizer Lyrics
You can shake it all around
You can go up and down
You can lose what you found
But you can't ignore my techno
You can go west or east
Confess your sins to a priest
You can slay the wicked beast
But you can't ignore my techno

You can go to the doctor
You can cough in his face
Infect the whole human race
But you can't ignore my techno
You can laugh, you can cry
You can live, you can die
Spend your days asking why
But you can't ignore my techno

You can trip on my synthesizer
Electronic world for every boy and every girl
You can trip on my synthesizer
Alien technology unto the world will set us free
Be all that you can be
Just as long as you are free
You were blind and now you see
That which is my techno

You can trip on my synthesizer
Electronic world for every boy and every girl
You can trip on my synthesizer
Alien technology unto the world will set us free

You can trip on my
You can trip on my
You can trip on my
You can trip, you can trip
You can trip on my synthesizer
You can trip on my synthesizer
Let's goEmbed
