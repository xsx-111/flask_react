Dance Commander LyricsYou must obey the dance commander
Givin' out the order for fun
You must obey the dance commander
You know that he's the only one
Who gives the orders here
Alright
Who gives the orders here
Alright
It would be awesome
If we could dance
It would be awesome, yeah
Let's take the chance
It would be awesome, yeah
Let's start the show
Because you never know
You never know
You never know until you go
Alright
Alright
Who gives the orders here?
Alright
Who gives the orders here?
The lines are drawn, the orders are in
The dance commander's ready to sin
Radio message from HQ
Dance commander, we love you
Let's get this party started right, y'all
Let's get this party started right
I went to the store to get more
Fire... to start the war
Everybody in this club is whack
I feel like I'm headed straight for a heart attack
Girls are pretty
Girls are nice
Take your chances
Roll the dice
Take your chances...
It would be awesome
If we could dance
It would be awesome, yeah
Let's take the chance
It would be awesome, yeah
Let's start the show
Because you never know
You never know
You never know until you go
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
I wanna make it last forever
Ooo, baby!
Alright
Alright
You must obey the dance commander
You must obey the dance commander
You must obey the dance commander
You must obey the dance commander
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on...Embed
