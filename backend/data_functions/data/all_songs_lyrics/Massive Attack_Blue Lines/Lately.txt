Lately Lyrics
Summertime always gives me the blues
Thinking about the things we used to do
Watching lovers in the park making love so free
And now I realize there's only me

Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?

You've been acting like a cat on a hot tin roof
Something's on your mind that you can't share
You never used to hide your feelings for me
Keeping secrets I don't understand

Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?

I used to synchronize it with your body
Making it so tight, never letting go
I used to synchronize it with your body
Making it so tight, never letting go
Lately, baby, where, where did we go wrong?
Lately, lately, lately, lately
Lately, baby, where did we go wrong, where did we go wrong?
Missed your touch, missed your touch1Embed
