One Love Lyrics
It's you I love and not another
And I know our love will last forever
You I love and not another
And I know we'll always be together
Some men have one love, two and three love
Four and five and six love

But I believe in one love
I believe in one love
Baby girl, do you love me?

Some men don't feel secure
Unless they have a woman on each arm
They have to play the field, prove they have charm
They say don't lay your eggs in one basket
If the basket should fall all your eggs'll be broken

But I believe in one love
I believe in one love
Oh, girl, I believe in one love
I believe in one love
It's not the everyday you'll find the woman of your dreams
Who will always be there no matter how bad things seems
Ever so faithful, ever so sure
No man could ever ask for more

I believe in one love
I believe in one love, oh, girl
I believe in one love
I believe, girl, oh yeah
In one love, in one love
In one love, in one love
I believe, I believe, I believe in one love
I believe in one love
I believe in one love, in one love3Embed
