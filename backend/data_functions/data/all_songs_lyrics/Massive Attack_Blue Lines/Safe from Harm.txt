Safe from Harm Lyrics
Midnight rockers, city slickers
Gunmen and maniacs
All will feature on the freak show
And I can't do nothing 'bout that, no

But if you hurt what's mine
I'll sure as hell retaliate

Serious, infectious, and dan-
Serious, in-, serious, infectious, and dangerous

You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight
You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight

Serious, in-, serious, in-
Serious, infectious, and dangerous
Friends and enemies, I find it's contagious
I was looking back to see if you were looking back at me
To see me looking back at you
Lucky dippers, crazy chancers
Seems to be moving fast
What happened to the niceties of my childhood days?
Well I can't do nothing 'bout that, no

But if you hurt what's mine
I'll sure as hell retaliate

I was, I was, I was looking back to see if you were
I was looking, I was
I was looking back to see if you were looking back at me
To see me looking back at you

You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight
You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight

Se-, serious, se-, serious
Serious, infectious, and dangerous
Friends and enemies, I find it's contagious
And they're spreading through your system like a virus
Yes, the trouble in the end, it makes you anxious
I was looking, I was
I was looking back to see if you were looking back at me
To see me looking back at you
I was, I was
I was looking back to see if you were looking back at me
To see me looking back at you
But if you hurt what's mine
I'll sure as hell retaliate

You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight
You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight3Embed
