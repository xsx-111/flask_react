You Keep It All In Lyrics
You know your problem?
You keep it all in
You know your problem?
You keep it all in

That's right
The conversation we had last night
When all I wanted to do was knife you in the heart
I kept it all in

You know your problem?
You keep it all in
You know your problem?
You keep it all in

Midnight
A husband getting ready to fight
A daughter sleeps alone with the light turned on, she hears
But keeps it all in

Just like that murder in '73
Just like that robbery in '62
With all these things that have happened to me
I kept them all in
So why do you keep on telling me now?

Ah, ah
Ah, ah

You know your problem?
You keep it all in
You know your problem?
You keep it all in

That's sweet
That conversation we had last week
When you gagged and bound me up to my seat--you're right, I do
I keep it all in

Just like that murder in '73
Just like that robbery in '62
With all these things that have happened to me
I kept them all in

I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in, now, now, now, people
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in, ah
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in, now, now, now people
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)
I kept it all in, alright
(Ba, ba-da-ba-da ba)Embed
