Oh Blackpool Lyrics

I wasn't sure if it was Marx or Hitler
That was in this year
I hadn't been to Brighton for a while
So it wasn't too clear
So imagine my surprise
When I opened my eyes
To find it was the liberals who
Were hip to sloganeer

I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride
I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride


So help me out
So help me out
So Blackpool, help me out; so Scarborough, pull me through
So help me out
They wore enamel badges of
David Steel on their sleeves
And nuclear power, no thanks
Not sure and yes please
And their faces were two fold
And their teeth they were gold
And they wore their pinstripe suits
With a rip at the knee

I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride
I'm out tonight and can't decide
Between Soviet hip or British pride


So help me out
So help me out
So Blackpool, help me out; so Scarborough, help me out
So help me out
