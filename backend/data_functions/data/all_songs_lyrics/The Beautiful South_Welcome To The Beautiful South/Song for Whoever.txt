Song for Whoever Lyrics
I love you from the bottom
Of my pencil case
I love you in the songs
I write and sing
Love you because (Love you)
You put me in my rightful place (Love you)
(Ah, ah, ah) And I love the PRS cheques
That you bring

Cheap, never cheap
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep
When you've gone upstairs
I'll creep and write it all down
Down, down
Down

Oh Shirley, oh Deborah
Oh Julie, oh Jane
Wrote so many songs about you
I forget your name (I forget your name)
Jennifer, Alison, Philippa, Sue
Deborah, Annabel, too (I forget your name)
Jennifer, Alison, Philippa, Sue
Deborah, Annabel, too (I forget your name)

I love you from the bottom
Of my pencil case
I love the way you never
Ask me why
I love to write about (Love you)
Each wrinkle on your face (Love you)
(Ah ah ah) And I love you till my fountain
Pen runs dry

Deep, so deep
The number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep
So cry, lovey, cry
Cry, cry
Cry
Oh Cathy, oh Alison
Oh Philippa, oh Sue
You made me so much money
I wrote this song for you (I wrote this song for you)

Jennifer, Alison, Philippa, Sue
Deborah, Annabel, too (I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Philippa, Sue
Deborah, Annabel, too (For you)


Oh Cathy, oh Alison
Oh Philippa, oh Sue
You made me so much money
I wrote this song for you (I wrote this song for you)

Jennifer, Alison, Philippa, Sue (For you)
Deborah, Annabel, too (I wrote this song for you)
Jennifer, Alison, Philippa, Sue (For you)
Deborah, Annabel, too (For you)
For you, for you
For you
For you, for you
I wrote this song for you

So let me talk about Mary, a sad story
Turned her grief into glory
Talk about Mary, a sad story
Turned her grief into glory
Late at night, in the typewriter light
Ripped his ribbon to shreds
Late at night, in the typewriter light
She ripped his ribbon to shreds

So let me talk about Mary, a sad story (Oh, Mary)
I turned her grief into glory
So let me talk about Mary, a sad story (Oh, Julie)
I turned her grief into gory
Late at night, in the typewriter light (Oh, Cathy)
Ripped his ribbon to shreds
Late at night, in the typewriter light (Oh, Audrey)
She ripped his ribbon to shreds

Oh, let me talk about Mary, a sad, sad, sad story (Oh, Mary)
Turned her grief into glory (Oh, Jennifer)
Let me talk about Mary, a sad story (Oh, Julie)
Turned her grief into glory (Oh, Philippa)
Late at night, in the typewriter light (Oh, Cathy)
Ripped his ribbon to shreds (Oh, Jennifer)
Late at night, in the typewriter light (Oh, Cathy)
She ripped his ribbon to shreds (Oh, Alison)

I wrote this song for you1Embed
