Love Is... Lyrics
Ooh, you care, you really, really care
From the first twelve inch I made to the colour of my underwear
And ooh, you know, you really, really know
Inside, outside in, from head to toe

But where were you in the colder days?
I'd like to know, I'd like to know
And where will you be in years to come?
I'd like to know, I'd like to know

So don't beg and don't plead
You can't have the heart you made bleed
You're in love with fame
So whilst we love, please don't scream my name

Don't scream my name
Don't scream my name
Don't scream my name

You're my friends, my only real friends
But I'd like to know where you'll be when the party ends
I remember your face, the dance was slow
'Easy' by The Commodores and you said no
But where were you in the colder days?
I'd like to know, I'd like to know
And where will you be in years to come?
I'd like to know, I'd like to know

So don't beg and don't plead
You can't have the heart you made bleed
You're in love with fame
So whilst we love, please don't scream my name

Don't scream my name
Don't scream my name
Don't scream my name
Don't scream my name
Don't scream my name

So here's an invitation to this caring nation
Twenty-five years from now, will you come to my cremation?
Sherry or beer, family and friends
Will you be there? Will you be there?
No fame, no fortune, no name in lights
Will you be there? Will you be there?
(Don't scream my name)
So here's an invitation to this caring nation
Twenty-five years from now, will you come to my cremation?
(Don't scream my name)
Sherry or beer, family and friends
Will you be there? Will you be there?
(Don't scream my name)
No fame, no fortune, no name in lights
Will you be there? Will you be there?

(Don't scream my name)
So here's an invitation to this caring nation
(Don't scream my name)
Twenty-five years from now, will you come to my cremation?
(Don't scream my name)
Sherry or beer, family and friends
(Don't scream my name)
Will you be there? Will you be there?
(Don't scream my name)
No fame, no fortune, no name in lights
(Don't scream my name)
Will you be there? Will you be there? Will you be there?
Ba-da da-da!
