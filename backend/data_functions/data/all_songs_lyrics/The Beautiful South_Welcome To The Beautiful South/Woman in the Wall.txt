Woman in the Wall Lyrics
He was just a social drinker, but social every night
He enjoyed a pint or two or three or four
She was just a silent thinker, silent every night
He'd enjoyed the thought of killing her before
Well, he was very rarely drunk but very rarely sober (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
And he didn't think the problem was his drink (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
But he only knew his problem when he knocked her over (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
And when the rotting flesh began to stink (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

Cry freedom for the woman in the wall
Cry freedom, for she has no voice at all

I hear her cry all day, all night
I hear her voice from deep within the wall
Made a cross from knitting needles, made a grave from hoover bags
Especially for the woman in the wall

She'd knitted him a jumper with dominoes on
So he wore it every day in every week
Pretended to himself that she hadn't really gone
And pretended that he thought he heard her speak
At last it seemed that he was really winning (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
And he felt that he had some sort of grip (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
But all of his new life was sent a-spinning (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
When the rotting wall began to drip (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

Cry freedom for the woman in the wall
Cry freedom, for she has no voice at all

I hear her cry all day, all night
I hear her voice from deep within the wall
Made a cross from knitting needles, made a grave from hoover bags
Especially for the woman in the wall

In the wall
In the wall
In the wall

Cry freedom for the woman in the wall
Cry freedom, for she has no voice at all

I hear her cry all day, all night
I hear her voice from deep within the wall
Made a cross from knitting needles, made a grave from hoover bags
Especially for the woman in the wall
In the wall
In the wall
In the wall

In the wall
In the wall
In the wall


In the wall
In the wallEmbed
