Polio LyricsWe were drawn with a brush
Where the slightest wink draws the shades
Notator anesthesia
You would know that I really need ya
Revelator looks like you
Revelator talks like you
With all these things that they say
Strive to answer at the straight
All these years are getting late
So put me out I'm so fooled
I'm so fooled with the sightings of you
Revelator looks like you
Revelator talks like you
Reveltator used to be
Revelator got to me
With all the things that they say
Lines race to my face
Cracking, lacking center I suppose
Notator anesthesia
You know that, that I really need ya
Wheels above my head, you with a
Burnished breath
One Saturday on the lake, you know I
Couldn't wait
Revelator looks like you
Revelator talks like you
Reveltator used to be
Reveltator got to me
With all the things that they sayEmbed
