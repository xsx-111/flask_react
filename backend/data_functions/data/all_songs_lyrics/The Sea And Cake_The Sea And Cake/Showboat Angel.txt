Showboat Angel LyricsAh we don't love
We don't care
We don't know
We don't fight
We don't care
Showboat angel when you're saving me
Stay put angel you're no mystery
Up to no show with a grin and I wasn't left out
Up to now show with a grin I slept in
Hopefully we'll be surprised so sweet to bury those lies
Deep on the east side
Tired of the sun coming up
Deep on the west side
Tired of the sun going down
One day maybe I just won't seem to get up
Showboat angel please on me
Showboat angel please on me
Sorry I forgot to say please on me
It shouldn't be happier that way
So sad such a story inked upon the shattered wing
So sad such a story we shouldn't even begin
Deep on the east side
Tired of the sun coming up
Deep on the west side
Tired of the sun going down
One day maybe I just won't seem to get up
Oh what say please on me
It shouldn't be happier that way
So sad such a story inked upon the shattered wing
So sad such a story we shouldn't even begin
I believe it so
Because you keepin' up with all these lies
Always on me
Showboat angel you're crazy
When you're saving meEmbed
