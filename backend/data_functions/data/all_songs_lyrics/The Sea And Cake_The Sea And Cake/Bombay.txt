Bombay LyricsSugarly please be wrecking
Sugarly please be wrecking
Sugarly please be wrecking
The now city loves us all
Come with me shyly
Continental, continental
Man you so Bombay, what you say
You know I'll drive
Ain't it a shame that you hate me
Ain't it a shame that you hate me
Wanted nothing the day I arrived
Ain't it a shame that you hate me
I'm so tired
No more lies
Ain't it a shame that you hate me
Sugarly please be wrecking
Sugarly
The now city loves us all
The now city loves us all
The now city loves us all
The now city loves us all
Sugarly please be wrecking
