Bring My Car I Feel to Smash It LyricsBring my car I feel to smash it
I'm salted and used so you try me
The stately solemn and lovely tonic
And near the river's mouth
We are so crown dead
The shallowly is where you want to lie
As we stay clear the river's mouth
Bring my car I feel to smash it
I'm salting and used so you try me
Such things were never meant to be
When I'm really richer
It seems too far and I can't be bothered
Near the river's mouth
Near the river's mouth
Near the river's mouth
Near the river's mouth
Stay dear we've got to get out
Some things were never meant to be
So you try me, so you try me
Bring my car I feel to smash it
I'm salted and used so you try me
I'm so hurtful and choose to lose
But I choose not to care
Oh baby yeah
And near the river's mouth
And near the river's mouth
Near the river's mouth
Stay dear we've got to get outEmbed
