Lost in Autumn LyricsI could believe that it's true
The many ways that I never had you
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't light
So won't you smile ah he's treasure
You should love me forever
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't light
I was running with the hot eyes
So slow you're going
Lost in autumn
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't light
Candles wouldn't lightEmbed
