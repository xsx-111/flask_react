Choice Blanket LyricsRiver wanders out of land
Ocean waves spank the sand
Tripping over mountains
Laughing at the sea
Water hold me under
Fill your lungs with ether
The ship is going under
Splintered, broken hull
When it goes we all go down
Together, together
What's all this water for
Twenty sailors maybe more
Water breathing warm and heavy
Fantastic salt and sour
Salt and sour
Slow motion dancing drowned
Tides turn the lines around
The rain that falls will soak us all
Twenty million going down, going down, going down
Ooh
Mother's say, we don't run ooh we hide
Mother's say, we don't run ooh we hide
Mother's say, we don't run ooh we hide
Mother's say, we don't run ooh we hide
Mother's say, we don't run ooh we hide
Mother's say, we don't run ooh we hide
Mother's say, we don't run ooh we hideEmbed
