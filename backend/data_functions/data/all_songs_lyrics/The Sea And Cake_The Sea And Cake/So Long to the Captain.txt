So Long to the Captain LyricsI was
On my way to the captain
So long
Remember the captain
Do we
Recall the way you put me through the door
So long
Rambo to the captain
Stay with me
Only til the storm leaves
Stay with me
So many day just sort of slipped away
So long
So long to the captain
Do we
Recall the way you put me to the door
Look now it's about to happen
So long to the captain
So long
So long to the captain
Oooohhh
Yeahh
I'm better off lonely
I'm better off lonely
Wheel to captain?
Oh the sounds
Smoke jumpin from fingertips
Smoke slips through the blue lips
Oh and ?
I'm better off lonely
Oh
I'm better off lonely
I'm better off lonelyEmbed
