Jacking the Ball LyricsCertain nation bows to the young
Nothing is wicked, everything's fun
You got some money, do it right
We are jacking the ball
One tear amazingly
One tear amazingly
We are jacking the ball
Winter is over, what should we do?
Hazing loveless fall into
Tiny breaks for every day
We are jacking the ball
One tear amazingly
One tear amazingly
We are jacking the ball
Fell unto the memory
Just don't stay too long
The last word was meant to be
We are jacking the ball
One tear amazingly
One tear amazingly
We are jacking the ballEmbed
