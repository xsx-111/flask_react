Flat Lay the Water LyricsFlat lay the waters to catch the sun
So hardly
We could only run
Turning eyes like I'm crazy
So you
So you like a shady
His girl we like a lot
Spent time
Always spending afterthoughts
Moving always like a tear
Come and see me
Watch me shout from here
Have you always felt so close
In chaos
THe trouble is it makes us
Still we breathe
Just as one
The notion
The notion's just as fun
Flat lay the waters to catch the sun
Hours spent as afterthoughts
Flat lay the waters to catch the sun
So hardly
We could only run
Turning eyes like I'm crazy
So you
So you like a shady
His girl we like a lot
Spent time
Hours spent as afterthoughts
In this room still divided
Steam rise
Steam rise from your eyes
We surround the exosphere
Forever
We just never win
Flat lay the waters to catch the sun
Hours spent as afterthoughtsEmbed
