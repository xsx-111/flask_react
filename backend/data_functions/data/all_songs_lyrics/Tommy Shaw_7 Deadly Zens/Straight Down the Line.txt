Straight Down the Line Lyrics
You bought a one way ticket
And you headed down to Mexico
Said you were gonna find the answers
To the questions I don't know
You can't help yourself
It's not someone else
When you look in the mirror
Tell me what do you see
Are you thinking of me?
Yeah

You've got a new age guru
Sitting cross-legged on the floor
You're selling some kind of Voodoo
But I think he only wants to score
You can't help yourself
No there's no one else
Take a good look around now
Tell me what do you see
Are you thinking of me
Yeah yeah yeah
Straight down the line
You'll find the answer
Straight down the line
You know I believe
When all's said and done
You'll be the one
Straight down the line

You met a Hollywood agent
With a big house on the hill
He says he's gonna leave his wife
But you know that he never will
You can't help yourself
No there's no one else
When you look in the mirror
Tell me what do you see
Are you thinking of me
Yeah yeah yeah

Straight down the line
You'll know the answer
Straight down the line
You know I believe
When all's said and done
You'll be the one
Straight down the line, oh yeah
Straight down the line, oh yeah
Is it time to make a reservation (Make a reservation)
Do you need a ride to take you home (Take you home)
Or will it always be
Destination unknown
Do you need a little recreation (Recreation)
A little something that will feed your soul (Feed your soul)
Don't you love it
When you finally find your way home
Oh yeah
Straight down the line
Straight down the line

Straight down the line
You'll find the answer
Straight down the line
You know I believe
When all's said and done
You'll be the one

Time ain't wasted
Time ain't wasted
When I spend my time with you
Time ain't wasted
Time ain't wasted
Straight down the line, oh yeah
Straight down the line (Straight down the line)
Yeah (Straight)
Straight down the line1Embed
