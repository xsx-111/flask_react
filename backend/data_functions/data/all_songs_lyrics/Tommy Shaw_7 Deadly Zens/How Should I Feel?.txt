How Should I Feel? LyricsI've been thinking about your number
In the middle of the night
Trying to remember
From somewhere in my head
Without turning on the light
Everybody has an answer
To this problem that I have
Yeah it seems so easy
Tumbling from their lips
I just have to laugh
I call your name
And I am healed
I look for an answer
Tell me how should I feel
I've been pulling out your pictures
Now I pulling out my hair
And I'm looking for the answer
In the bottom of a bottle
But I can't find it there
I call your name
And I am healed
I look for an answer
Tell me how should I feel
I'd love to ask you tonight
But your lips arе sealed
If I can't be lonеly tonight
Tell me how should I feel
I would love to change the world
And I would love to change the world
And I would love to
I call your name
And I am healed
I look for an answer
Tell me how should I feel
I'd love to ask you tonight
But your lips are sealed
If I can't be lonely tonight
Tell me how should I feel
If I could change the world tonight
If I could change the world tonight
If I could change the world tonight
If I could change the world tonight
I would love to change the world
Love to change the worldEmbed
