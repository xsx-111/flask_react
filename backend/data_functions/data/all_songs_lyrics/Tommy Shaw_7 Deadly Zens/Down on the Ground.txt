Down on the Ground LyricsI thought what I was hearing
Was the sound of mission bells
Perhaps it was a mission
Not from heaven but from hell
I lay down my body
On the fertile ground I fell
All the things seemed clear to me
I never felt so well
But when the night was over
And the morning sun burned through
And I listened for the mission bells
But a dissonance rang through
You shook me up
You shook me down
But you won't keep me
Down on the ground
Your love is strong
But I've been down too long
Why you wanna keep on
Doing me wrong
I thought what I was hearing
Was the voice of my old friend
I poured out my feelings
And I felt healed again
I held that door open
And said why don't you stay
You're tired and you're hungry
I thought I heard you say
So you sat down at my table
I closed my eyes as you prayed
While you filled your every pocket
With the living I had made
You shook me up
You shook me down
But you won't keep me
Down on the ground
Your love is strong
But I've been down too long
Why you wanna keep on
Doing me wrong
Be careful who you follow
Be suspicious of the messenger
I was moments from the gates of insanity
I had followed a mirror of my vanity
I stood naked stripped of my humanity
And I cried to the heavens
God get me out of here!
Just this time
Please get me out of here
Be careful who you follow
Be suspicious of the messenger
Who will comfort and divide you
Pretend to be beside you
But he'll always be a stranger
When you find yourself in danger
When you're lost and in the dark
Listen to your heart
You shook me up
You shook me down
But you won't keep me
Down on the ground
Your love is strong
But I've been down too long
Why you wanna keep on
Doing me wrongEmbed
