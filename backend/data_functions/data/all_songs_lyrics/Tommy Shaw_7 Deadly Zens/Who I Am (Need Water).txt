Who I Am (Need Water) Lyrics- Who Am I -
Someone hurt you bad and that's for sure
But they won't ever hurt you any more
Somewhere down the road it will be gone
But until that day you just have to carry on
Every time you trip and lose your step
You complain and cry that you need help
But help is gone you just don't know it yet
The race is on and you never placed your bet
So you cry cry cry
All night long
You say why why why
Is my love gone
Say please please
Help me if you can
Call someone and ask them who I am
Who I am
Your eyes feel like a camera in your head
And somehow you just stumbled onto the set
The movie's just too real to walk away
But the end is coming
And the bad guy's gonna pay
So you cry cry cry
All night long
And say where where where
Did I go wrong
You say please please
Help me if you can
Why don't you call someone and ask them
Who I am, who I am
Call someone and ask them who I am
You want to know you better ask somebody
So you cry cry cry
All night long
You say why why why
Is my love gone
Say please please
Help me if you can
Why don't you call someone and ask them
Who I am, who I am
Call someone and ask them who I am
Call someone and ask them who I am
