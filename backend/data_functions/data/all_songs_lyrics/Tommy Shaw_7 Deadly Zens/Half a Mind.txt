Half a Mind LyricsYou said you were leaving
On the very next train
This little town had got you down
And you wouldn't be back again
Yeah and I believed you
My world stood still
You said you had a half a mind
To let me know the way you feel
When it comes to leaving
I've done my share
Trouble would come
But you'd never find me there
You said you were leaving
So many times
And every time I tried to find
A way I could survive
I felt so lonely
All the times I cried
Now you say that I should see
How everything has changed inside you
When it comes to changing
I never saw the need
I never thought about anyone but me
Can't we see the past is gone
Half a mind from here
Where the seeds of love can grow
We'll gather it as we go
We'll never know
How lucky we are
Casting our fate
To the wind and the stars
And gather the love as we go
Gather the love as we go
Gather the love as we go
You said you were leaving
On the very next train
Those little things had got you down
And you wouldn't be coming back again
When it comes to leaving
I've done my share
Trouble would come
But you'd never find me there
Can't we see the past is gone
Half a mind from here
Where the seeds of love can grow
We'll gather it as we go
Gather the love
Gather the love
Gather the love as we go
I believed you
My world stood stillEmbed
