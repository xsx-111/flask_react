In This Night LyricsI wanna be the hero
I wanna be the man
I want to be the one who pulls you through
When nobody can
Come on baby
I'm ready right now
Yeah who knows
Maybe I'm the one
Gonna make you scream out loud
I'll be here
Right by your side
I won't leave
You alone in this night
Shake loose of those chains
Of your sad remains
You're gonna look back someday
And find it was growing pains
I wanna get to know you
Gotta let me try
You got to let me show
I understand how you feel inside
Come on baby
Open up for me
You might be surprised
To find how easy it can be
I'll be here
Right by your side
I won't leave
You alone in this night
You ride shotgun
Let's see how you feel
You might just find you enjoy the ride
With me at the wheel
I wanna drive you
On down the road
We won't ever look back
Cause we're never coming back
No more, no more, no more
I'll be here
Right by your side
And I won't leave you
Alone on this ride
I won't leave
You alone in this nightEmbed
