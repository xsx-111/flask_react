A Place to Call My Own LyricsHold the lamplight to the night
See the empty streets
Rolling out of sight
Turn a deaf ear to the din
Ignore the hunger pangs
Bundle up against the wind
Still I believe
Someone waits for me
A place to call my own
Somewhere to be from
A shelter from the storm
Where I'll be safe and warm
A future built on stone
A place to call my own
And once there was a time
I had no fear at all
None that I recall
No future there to taunt
No history to haunt me
No monsters in the wall
Still I believe
Someone waits for me
Oh, a place to call my own
Somewhere to be from
A shelter from the storm
Where I'll be safe and warm
Of wood and bricks and stone
Oh, a place to call my own
Somewhere to be from
A shelter from the storm
Where I'll be safe and warm
A future built on stone
A place to call my ownEmbed
