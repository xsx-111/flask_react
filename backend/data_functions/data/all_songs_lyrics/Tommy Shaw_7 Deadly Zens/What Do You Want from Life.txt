What Do You Want from Life LyricsYou can't eat
And you can't sleep
You fell in love
And you feel too deep
But it wasn't returned
And now you been burned
Oh yeah
You can't go out
You're in such a slump
You need to shout
But you're down in the dumps
It won't do any good
Till you find your way out of the woods
All she did for you
Was let you be an idiot
What else could she do
Everyone knew but you weren't ready yet
Hey now
What do you want from life
What do you want from love
What do you want from me
Hey now
What do you want from life
What do you want from love
What do you want from me, me, me
I feel your pain
I've been there before
Standing in the rain
In the dark outside her door
Feeling like the fool that you are
All she did for you
Was make you feel
Like a millionaire
What else could you do
If you had it for real
You'd give it all away to her
Hey now
What do you want from life
What do you want from love
What do you want from me
Hey now
What do you want from life
What do you want from love
What do you want from me, me, meEmbed
