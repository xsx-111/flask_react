Diamond Lyrics"See you boys later"
"All right"
"Play hard"
My friends are all detectives
They liked to be protective
'Cause they knew I was the marrying kind
But this time they were helpless
Their Police skills were useless
They knew I'd never pay them any mind
She was shinny
She was bright
If that spelled trouble
Well all right
Guess we'll just have to wait and see
She looked like a diamond to me
Love's already hard enough
But when your heart gets tough
You can miss the simple things
You walk right past a rose
As if you never had a nose
Then one day
A little bell rings
Nothing matters anymore
Time to get up off the floor
Time to end this misery
Yeah she looked like a diamond to me
After all my years in this place
My fears slip slowly into space
Nothing but blue sky above
And a sky writer writes the word love
Angels must have been on guard
'Cause man it hit me hard
It was the real thing after all
And I was looking up to see
If she was looking back at me
Yeah I knew she saw me fall
She'd been shattered once before
But that won't happen any more
Broken glass ain't what I see
She looked like a diamond all right
She looked like a light in the night
She looked like a diamond to me
Gonna let it shine shine shine all nightEmbed
