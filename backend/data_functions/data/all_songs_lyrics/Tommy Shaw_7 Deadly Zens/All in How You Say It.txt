All in How You Say It LyricsAngel of my heart
I wanna see you again
But I've got to get a glimpse
Every now and then
But if you stay
In the garden too long
You might get caught
Singing a loser's song
I guess you've got to learn your lesson
Every now and then
When you find someone who's messing
With your thinking
And even if your intuition
Says you might get hurt
I know, I know
It's all in how you say it
Does anybody here
Love you more than I do
Does anybody see
What I'm seeing in you
I guess you've got to learn your lesson
Every now and then
I know, I know
It's all in how you say it
Angel of my heart
You're a good man's friend
But I've got to get a glimpse
Every now and then
I could tell you a story
That I used to know
Take you to places
Where the trade winds blow
I guess you've got to learn your lesson
Every now and then
When you find someone who's messing
With your thinking
And even if your intuition
Says you might get hurt
I know, I know
It's all in how you say itEmbed
