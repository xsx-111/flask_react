Inspiration (Mona Lisa) Lyrics- Inspiration -
You say anything is possible
I say I believe what you believe
If you say it, I'd say it is true
I dream and in my dreams I think of you
So real, it's like the way I turn to you
When I awake
I wanna see you there all the time
'Cause I need your inspiration
I need your guiding light
This is my invitation
Come on and be my world tonight
There's a place
Where everything is beautiful
Love rules and everything is do-able
But that world seems such a vision away
I give up everything I ever had
Walk away, leave this crazy life behind
If I knew that you'd be the one by my side
I need your inspiration
I need your guiding light
This is my invitation
Come on and be my world tonight
And I would run through the gauntlet
I would scream in the Vatican
I would laugh my resignation
I would dance naked in the sand under moonlight
Every brick and every stone and shingle laid
Every dream and every little plan we make
We'll build a world more beautiful
Than anyone has ever made
I need your inspiration
I need your guiding light
This is my invitation
Come on and be my world tonight

All the leaves are...
How many days?
How many...yeah, yeah
The most wonderful thing you've ever seen before
Oh!

All the leaves are...

Oh yeah
All the leaves are...
The most wonderful thing you've ever seen
Oh! Oh!

The most wonderful thing you've ever seen
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
The most wonderful thing you've ever seen
Oh! Oh!
How many days?Embed
