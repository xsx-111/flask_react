Echoes Round the Sun LyricsIs it strange
Is it bleak
That conversations through
Hear it blip
On this spot
Now there's only me and you
Collective kind
You will find
All your thoughts
Are out of mind
Where does it start
Where will it end
And how will we be moved
On a rock
Spinning through
And echoes round the sun
Echoes Round the Sun
Echoes Round the Sun
On a rock
Spinning through
And echoes round the Sun
Echoes Round the Sun
Echoes Round the Sun
On a rock
Spinning through
And echoes round the Sun
Where is up
When we go down
Floating through the void
Getting lost
Getting found
Now there's only me and you
Where does it start
Where will it end
And how will we be moved
On a rock
Spinning through
And echoes round the sun
Echoes Round the Sun
Echoes Round the Sun
On a rock
Spinning through
And echoes round the sun
Echoes Round the sun
Echoes Round the Sun
On a rock
Spinning through
And echoes round the sun
Echoes round the sun
Echoes round the sun
On a rock
Spinning through
And echoes round the sun
You and me on the spot...Embed
