Push It Along LyricsPush it along, push it along
Baby gonna ride the train
Ride baby
Push it along, push it along
Baby gonna ride the train
Ride baby
The desert moon is full and it lights the sand
I feel the loving touch of an invisible hand
And all across the sky I can see his eyes
Lift me up and let my soul just fly
Push it along, push it along
Baby gonna ride the train
Ride baby
Push it along, push it along
Baby gonna ride the train
Ride baby
Push it along, push it along
Baby gonna ride the train
Ride baby
Through desert winds that know no reason
Where the only sound is of the season
The heat of the day, the cool of the evening
Are the only measures of what I'm feeling
Told what to think
Told what to feel
Told what to see
Told what to be
We're all used to this, We're all used to that
All stand in a field in a scarecrows' hat
Push it along, push it along
Baby gonna ride the train
Ride baby...Embed
