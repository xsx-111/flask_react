Invisible LyricsI'm Invisible
I Float across the floor
You can't even see me
I drift through walls and tables
But you still don't believe me
I'm not one to give up
But I feel I'm at a loss
To you I'm invisible
Pass through doors and windows
And you won't even know it
There was a time
You thought every hair on my body was alive
And so it was
Now you can't even see
They're graying in time
I'm not one to give up
But I feel I'm at a loss
But the world doesn't grow any darker
I just feel the colour drain from me
As I become invisible
I'm invisible
I skim across the floor
You can't even see me
I make a joke
And toss a line
To no one there who can see me alive
I don't want to give up
But I feel I'm at a loss
I'm Invisible
Packing up, baby...
Shaking up babyEmbed
