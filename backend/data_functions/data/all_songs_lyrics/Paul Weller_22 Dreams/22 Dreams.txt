22 Dreams LyricsI had 22 dreams last night
And you were 21
The last one I saved for myself
Just to save my soul
I get consumed by your fire and grace
I lose control when I’m in that place
I had 22 dreams last night
I had 44 films to watch
But only one contained
The mysteries of your secret smile
The rest were dull and plain
You woke me up with a loving kiss
I remember all the things I missed
You lose so much with the darkness gone
I fell in love with the morning sun
I had 22 dreams last night
I had 22 dreams last night
And you were 21
That’s an awful lot of dreams
That’s enough for anyoneEmbed
