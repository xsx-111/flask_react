Have You Made Up Your Mind LyricsThere's smoke rings running through your hair
There's a look in your eyes
I see a glimpse of smile on your face
But I know that smile ain't mine
How a fool begins...
They say everything has a place and time
But this ain't one of those times
Feel there's something in the air
Just don't know why, I don't know why
What a fool I've been
Oh, what a fool I've been
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
So easily
There's a love light breaking through the dawn
But where will I be when morning comes?
I feel it, feel it in my bones
Just don't know where my feet will go
What a fool I've been
Oh, what a fool I've been
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
They say there's a time and place for everything
But this ain't one of those times
What a fool I've been
Oh, what a fool I've been
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up my mind for me?
So easily...
(made up your mind) Have you made up your mind, baby?
(made up your mind) Have you made up your mind...Embed
