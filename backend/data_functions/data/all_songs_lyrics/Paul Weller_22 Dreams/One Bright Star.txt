One Bright Star LyricsI want you
I only want you
You're the one bright star, in my eyes
I only need you
I only need you
You're the one bright star, shine for me
Without you
I feel nothing
My one bright star, shine for me
I love you
I only love you
You're the one bright star, in my life
I need you
I only need you
You're the one bright star, shine for me
Without you
I feel nothing
My one bright star, shine for meEmbed
