Black River LyricsBlack River
Black River
Black River
The story's still unfolding
And like a river rolling
It's always moving like a tide
Seemingly unchanging
But, of course nothing stays the same
You'll see...
Black River
Black River
Black River
And if I scratch the surface
And try to look to learn it
Oh what fantastic worlds I'll find
Stay with me forever
Buried deep inside my mind
You'll see...
Sha la la, la la
I'm casting out my line
Although its floating back
Who knows what I'll find
We'll see...
It's early in the morning
I watched a raindrop falling
So slender, tender, from a leaf
It stays with me forever
Buried deep inside of me
You'll see...
Black River
Black River
Black River
Black River
Black River
Black River
Black River... You drifterEmbed
