All I Wanna Do (Is Be with You) LyricsI'm not out to convince you
But draw upon your mind
I'm not out to rinse you
You know I'm not that kind
All I wanna do is, be with you
All I wanna do is, be with you
I'm not here to begin ya
I'm neither clever nor confused
I'm not looking to steal ya
Don't want you feeling used
All I wanna do is, be with you
All I wanna do is, be with you
I bathe in dust
I feel the most
I twist and turn, turn
I'm lost and found
In the moment
In a single, moment
I'm not out to chain you
And lead you forward from behind
I'm not here to claim you
You know I'm not that kind
All I wanna do is, be with you
All I wanna do is, be with you
Be with you, be with you
Be with you
All I wanna do is, be with you
With you
Be with youEmbed
