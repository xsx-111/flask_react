Light Nights LyricsCome out to play
Now the light nights are here
We'll swing and sway
Now the light nights are here
Have a dance
Now the light nights are here
We'll love
Now the light nights are here
Over me
Come and stay with me
Run away with me
Come out to play
Now the light nights are here
And we'll wish we'd go
Neither of us knows
Now the days are getting longer
Our thoughts are getting stronger
Come out to play
Now the light nights are here
Come away with me
Come and stay with me
Run away with me
Love me til the next dawning
Make me feel that I'm wanted
I've been so very frozen
Make me feel that I'm chosen
Come out to play
Now the light nights are here
We'll swing and say
Now the light nights are here
Hold us
Now the light nights are here
Now we'll love
Now the light nights are hereEmbed
