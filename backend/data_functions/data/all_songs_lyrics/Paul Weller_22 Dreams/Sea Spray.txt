Sea Spray LyricsCarry me home, carry me home
You old Sea Spray
Carry me home, carry me home
You old Sea Spray
Like the million stars before you
You shine through the strictest curfew
Not listening to the rules of no one
Just wanna lay it on one
Can you never see what I can see?
Carry me home, carry me home
You old Sea Spray
Carry me home, carry me home
You old soft spray
Carry me home
You old sea spray
Sweep me up and take me with you
To see the things that stand before you
Show me all this world has for me
I want all that life can show me
I can only be what God can see
Till he comes to carry you home...
Carry me home, carry me home
You old sea spray
Carry me home, carry me home
You old sea spray...Embed
