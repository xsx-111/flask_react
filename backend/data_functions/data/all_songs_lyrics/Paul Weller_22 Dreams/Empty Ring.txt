Empty Ring LyricsCareful not to end up fighting no one
Still battling on, when all your enemies are gone
Making you look dumb and stupid
In an empty ring
What would it matter to you?
If the punch you always planned
Was right there in your hand
With no one there to see it land
In an empty ring
The taste of fear of fortune
The smell of toil and sweat
But if the crowd ain't there  to see it
It's just another memory
Just a memory
In an empty ring
The words of wisdom fail you
In the time it takes to fall
But if the crowd ain't there to see it
It's just another memory
Just another memory
In an empty ring
Will the world to listen to you
Still rattling on
But the war has been won
You just don't know when to give up
Do you?
In an empty ringEmbed
