Compass Lyrics
Only today inside your compass needle has stood still
Only today my eyes are open widely
A forest house covered in the shadows, it can't be seen if you got no feathers
A forest house covered with the golden leaves
Only because your smiling face, I can feel safe here
Morning is bringing colored lights all over
A forest house covered in the shadows, it can't be seen if you got no feathers
A forest house covered with the golden leaves

Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves inside them
Winter gloves and navy coats
Tattered books and nothing more
Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves sleeping by the fire

Voices are loud inside our hearts, but they are so quite in ears
Nothing can make our little boat float further
A forest house covered in the shadows, it can't be seen if you got no feathers
A forest house covered with the golden leaves

Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves inside them
Winter gloves and navy coats
Tattered books and nothing more
Days go by in lonely rooms
We can hide ourselves sleeping by the fireEmbed
