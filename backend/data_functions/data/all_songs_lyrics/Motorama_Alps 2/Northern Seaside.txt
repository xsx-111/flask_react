Northern Seaside Lyrics
I am alone, throwing stones to the dark
Thousand lights on a ship stern glow
Following my eyes
Before the dawn, all of us gone to their homes
Before the dawn, I will be far from this place

I am alone, watching birds flying above
With an empty map, with no thoughts in my head
I was watching them flying above
Before the dawn, seasons are changing too fast
Before the dawn, I will be far from this place3Embed
