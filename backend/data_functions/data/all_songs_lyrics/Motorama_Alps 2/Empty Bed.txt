Empty Bed Lyrics
Down from the country road
To the waterwheel
You were standing on a giant stone
In your grandpa's coat

I, I can't see you in my dreams
I don't know why
I, I can't see you in my dreams
I don't know why

You know that I will do my best
Just to see you there
Just to see you there
In my best suit I will lie in bed
Just to see you there
Just to see you there

Fear is walking by your side
So close to thee

I, I can't see you in my dreams
I don't know whyEmbed
