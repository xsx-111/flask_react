Hunters Lyrics
Run! With two branches in hands
To the house in the forest where your father once lived
Through the leaves, down the hill with white rabbits and owls
And she said: there is no hunters here

Run! With a picture in hand
To the house in the forest where your father once lived
Through the leaves, down the hill with white rabbits and owls
And she said and he said: there is no hunters here!
Hunters here!

And my clothes are completely wet
Will you tell not to worry?
There's a taste in my mouth of a cedar
And my clothes are completely wet
Will you tell not to worry?
There's a taste in my mouth of a cedar

Can you see foliage in her head?
Can you see diamonds in her hair?
Can you see foliage in my head?
Can you see diamonds in your hair?
Can you see foliage in my head?
Can you see diamonds in your hand?
Can you see foliage in my head?
Can you see diamonds in my hand?Embed
