Japanese Buffalo Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five, six
There was a guy, and his name was Johnny B
The loudest man in the land

Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Uh-huh

How many more times you cross the line
Run for days with eager eyes
Screaming smile left alone
These crazy things you do
In the forest of your mind
Haunted by the loss of time
Feet stuck frozen in the snow
These crazy things you do

Shame, shame, shame
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Shame, shame, shame
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Uh-huh

Japanese from head to toe
Red to green, green to gold
Waiting on that buffalo
These crazy things you do
These crazy things you do

Shame, shame, shame
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Shame, shame, shame
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart, and in your mind
Put me always aside
Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules or just leave it alone
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
That your heart has turned to stone
Now your heart's turned to stone

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart and in your mind
Put me always aside
Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame2Embed
