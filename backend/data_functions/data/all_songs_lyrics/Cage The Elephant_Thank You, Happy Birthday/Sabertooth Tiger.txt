Sabertooth Tiger Lyrics
On the other side of town lives a saber-tooth tiger
Paints a real good picture, he's an excellent liar

His mouth is full of sand and he's dying to meet you
His mouth is full of sand, he's just dying to meet you
On the other side of town lives a saber-tooth tiger

Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Got a bullet in your back, run away from the beast

Colder than an ice cube and faster than the fastest cheetah
He's hiding in the kitchen, he's a right-brain eater

His mouth is full of sand, he's just dying to meet you
His mouth is full of sand and he's dying to meet you
On the other side of town lives a saber-tooth tiger

Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Got a bullet in your back, run away from the beast
He's a saber-tooth tiger

Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Run away, and you're shaking at the knees
Run away, run away, run away from the beast
Got a bullet in your back, run away from the beast2Embed
