2024 Lyrics
Fall into that black hole, honey
Looking up from your eyes
Everything that you ever wanted
You fight, but why?
Fold it up just like a piece of paper
Take your sweet little time
You can write on the sidewalk
But you’ll find it’s not right

And now you’re walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see
That there’s something more
Yeah, there’s something more
That’s why you’re so bored
Oh, there’s something more

And now I'm standing at your front door
Nowhere better to be
But I can see you tie your own shoelaces
You bleed
Fall in love just like a newborn baby
Blonde hair and blue eyes
Taking pictures with your Polaroid camera
You're fine, it's right
And now you’re walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see
That there’s something more
Yeah, there’s something more
That’s why you’re so bored
Oh, there’s something more

And now you’re walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see
That there’s something more
Yeah, there’s something more
That’s why you’re so bored
Oh, there’s something more1Embed
