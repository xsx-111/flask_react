Flow Lyrics
Looking out my window
Wonder how it came to be
Feels just like a tempo
Lifted by a gentle breeze
Ugly as a suitcase
I can see it stretch for days
Hanging on a sunset
Softly trampled by the rain

Way too long
Hold on, hold on
Dead and gone
So long, hold on
Way too long
Hold on, hold on
Dead and gone
So long, hold on
So long, hold on

Looking out my window
Trying to find a hiding place
Climb into the tree tops
Watch it all just drift away
 (x2)
Way too long
Hold on, hold on
Dead and gone
So long, hold on
Way too long
Hold on, hold on
Dead and gone
So long, hold on
So long, hold on

*Hidden Track  (Right Before My Eyes)
Timber shakes these trails; they all derail
Phony, false, and frail
An empty ocean lost our way with no direction home
Golden needles, names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
And nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation

Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take it anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh
Holding dirty hands over the flames
Getting pleasure from the pain
Softly screaming the pistol that you raised has spoken
Golden needles names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
Well nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation

Everything I thought I knew fell to the side
Time went on and on I couldn't see past my own eyes
Past my eyes
