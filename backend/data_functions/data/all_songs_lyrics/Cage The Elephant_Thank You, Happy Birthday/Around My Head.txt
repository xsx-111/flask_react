Around My Head Lyrics
I don't know why I got these feelings, yeah
I just can't seem to get away from
Can you dig it?
You will never see it
No, you won't find it falling off my tongue
I take it downtown, finally lose it

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night, you
Got me tangled like a braid, tie-twisted
I don't think it's fair

Do you?
You

Out here on the flip side
You know I took the long way round
Cause all I really am is a homemade elevator
Blinded by your sunshine
Put you on a plane to Par√≠
Lay my cards down on the table
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair

Can't find a reason for these feeling
Clouding up above me
This guy, he told me
Said he's gonna send me something lovely
But even still, at times I wonder
What you're thinking of me
You're probably sure I lost my mind
Oh, mind, oh, mind, oh, mind, oh, mind

I don't think it's very nice to
Walk around my head all night, you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
I don't think it's very polite to
Walk around my head all night, you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
Ah! Ooh
Ah! Ooh
Ah! Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh!7Embed
