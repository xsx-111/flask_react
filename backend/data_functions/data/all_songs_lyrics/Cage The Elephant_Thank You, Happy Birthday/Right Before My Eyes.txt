Right Before My Eyes LyricsTimber shakes these trails; they all derail
Phony, false, and frail
An empty ocean lost our way with no direction home
Golden needles, names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
No, nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation

Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes, uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take it anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind, uh-huh
Holding dirty hands over the flames
Getting pleasure from the pain
Softly screaming the pistol that you raised has spoken
Golden needles names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
No, nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation

Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take it anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh
Everything I thought I knew fell to the side
Time went on and on I couldn't see past my own eyes
Past my eyes
Past my eyes
Past my eyes

Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take it anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh6Embed
