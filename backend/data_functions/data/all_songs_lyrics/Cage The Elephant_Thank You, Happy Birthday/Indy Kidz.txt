Indy Kidz LyricsI want to be just like you
I've got these pictures keep on rolling around my head
I want to hang them on the wall above my bed
And it's so easy to step aside and walk in line like all the rest
I never did that well on tests
I don't watch TV cause it's just a box of lies
It makes me want to stick a tooth pick in my mind
While the world goes down the drain I eat my popcorn from the bag
Some people say that I've gone mad
(I got to go down to the school house
And, and get some shoes
And get the right haircut
And the shoes, and, and, and...
The right haircut, the right haircut)
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
So cool, yea
So cool, yea
You're so cool
I want be just like you
You're so cool
I want to be just like you
I want to be just like you, yea
You're so cool
Yea, so cool
Yea, so cool
So cool
So cool2Embed
