Sell Yourself Lyrics
Well, I tried to paint my mind
But now I'm stuck here in the middle
Got this scalpel in my hand
I'm operating on this riddle
Got my tongue in a tied knot
On my forehead placed a label
Took all my inspiration
Carved your name into the table

Don't talk about me
Let's talk about you
I know your type, I know exactly what you wanna do
And if the money's right you think I'd just agree
So sad to see you torn apart by all this selfish greed
So sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, don't need to fight
You need to sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself

All my memories shard, lifted, cut, and snipped into little pieces
Choking on your cancer, waiting on the new releases
No more need to operate, you already fooled the masses
Nothing left to give you, you already fooled the masses
Don't talk about me
Let's talk about you
I know your type, I know exactly what you wanna do
And if the money's right you think I'd just agree
So sad to see you torn apart by all this selfish greed
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, don't need to fight
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself

Sell yourself
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, don't need to fight
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself
Sell yourself
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, don't need to fight
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself
Sell yourself
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself, don't need to fight
Sell yourself, don't be a fool
Sell yourself
