Next Level Lyrics

Yo
Many questions (like)
I got many questions (like)

Can you ever see the day made men make other men famous?
May they put in the papers
May 1st I'll be waiting on a favour
But my birthday a month later
And Lord knows when reality checks
We're so cold we don't wanna be dressed
It's all gold and vests
Got our legs, toes, and chests
Tattooed so we don't forget
That we know some s***
(And ooo I got a feeling)
I'm feeling what you're feeling
When Facebook asks me
Whats on my mind?
Phase 1 is the audacity to give you a lie like
I'm doing good, living better
New iPhone C, S, or Whatever
Could be the letter
I got it and you know it
Took a screenshot just to show that
I'm on the Next Level
Over the years, over the years
(I've grown)
Over my fears, over my peers
(And I know)
Not many hear, or listen to a rapper
Or any other human being in a Hyundai Sonata but
Tumetoka mbali, so funny wakinishuku juu ya gari
But itafika Nyali, nitafika Diani
New profile picture on the beach with my mami, yani
Everywhere we go must be recorded nowadays
Your boys gotta know you stylish
Born to be a star it's in our sub-conscious
And everywhere we are adverts accomplish this
Kids (Kids)
Open your eyes
We brainwashed and I just hope it all dries
Even Oprah lies
Mums at the show hoping to drive off (off)
In a new surprise, cause they want the next level

I just keep on moving
Forward
I'm on the next level
And when you try catch up guess what? (guess what?)
I just keep on moving on up
And when you try catch guess what? (guess what?)
I'm on the nextEmbed
