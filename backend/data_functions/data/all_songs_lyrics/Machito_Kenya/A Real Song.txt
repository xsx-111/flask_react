A Real Song Lyrics
I never know where to begin
When I write these rhymes
Recite these lines
But I trust my grind
Fulltime
I'm going in
Cause in life you find
Two types of minds
The do shxts
And those behind
I'm like

Choose wisely
I come through in Nikes
And just do it
Might lose slightly
Flow so stupid
They view nightly
And you can ask Mykie
Even before
I had ID
Most your people
Would ask about me yeah
Hol up
Yeah, yeah
I bet this music take you down
Like no bungie
Rest in peace
To all the comfy
Rappers who've be making money
I hope y'all learning something
From me
When the road get bumpy
Don't crack under pressure
Humpty Dumpty
Each track has a message
Y'all have to trust me
I'm back with a vision
That y'all must all see
Brown Child
That may sound weird
Till you get my vibe
And what you hear is basic
I got a whole damn year
Just to make you
Face it I'm tight
They like my name gon stick
Where the angels fly
Sky high
And when they hear a rapper
Sing
They don't believe
This is a real song
But I'm like let me do my thing
We outchea and I'm still strong
Still strong

Who is this?
I am what the confused miss
Like a lion
Stuck in a mule's pit
When they dying
It will make news quick
Flick Click click
Zoom
Back the elephant in the room
And they knew
With a brand new tune
I'd prove my point
Unlike these spoons
Ebu
Please move for the few
Of us artists
Who've been making true progress
In a way that you confess
They can never do
Unless
Whats that?
Wapatiwe racks on racks on racks
Lakini their tracks
Are wack and thats
The reason I had to
Come on back
Yeah
This is a real song
A real song
And I'm still strong
And still going
