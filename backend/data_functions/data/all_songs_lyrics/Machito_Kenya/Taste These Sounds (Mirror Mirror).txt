Taste These Sounds (Mirror Mirror) Lyrics

It's nice, very nice
Forget Xbox

And love that's light
But it's dark in my kitchen
So I'm thinking, using wisdom
Leo nita hata chicken?
Vile ni ki-finger licking, Good!
Kile's been killed by KPLC
Failed PS3, Plans
But I'll make you dance
I'm going to make you dance dance
Ay! Mwana mberi vayaye
Umeto-to-toka mbali
Now you're flow, flow, flow is kali hadi
Kina nani want to throw, throw you a party
And promo-mo-mote your kazi
Ndunga Coat, coat, coat na shati, shati
(Speech! Speech!)
Umm, Really like, like, like to thank you
Hope I'm holding the mic like I'm meant to
Every stroke of a line with my pencil (Pencil)
Is nothing special
But they want it all over the town
Ain't no denying once you try it
Taste These sounds
Taste These sounds
Taste These sounds
Ain't no denying once you try it
Taste These sounds
Taste These sounds
Taste These sounds
Ain't no denying once you try it

Eeish Bwana
Wacheni na Pineapple Crumble
Jameni we're inside the jungle
Way to many are stuck on the puzzle
(I'm gone!)
Scrambo
Back when I was in Class 4
Now I light up the dance floors
On the mic and started a fashion
(Apple!)
Imekulwa na Samsung
Now everybody has got one
Make the movie
I can get Popcorn
Wats up man, with the plan?
And if there's something you don't understand
Then say it now, right?
Taste these sounds
Taste these sounds
Taste these sounds
Taste these sounds


Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all

And what I'm trying to say
You should let the song play
And let it hit your right brain
Forget about your pains
Your troubles taken away
Then better teach your left brain
This is more exciting
And I been working for days and days
But that  don't matter
Cause it's worth the look on their face
Ati a rapper could be living faster
Pockets fatter
Ma nyama platters
On top of that
My music's in his new Passat
And that's why
I been doing it doing it well
Even the grown guys are like
Who is this ? Who is this ?
Well, I won't lie
Not all of good music will sell
But how does this song make you feel?
Enjoy you're meal
