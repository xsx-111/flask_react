Man Made Machine Lyrics
Welcome to the (Man Made Machine)
This something special this the (Man Made Machine)
You are now listening to the (Man Made Machine)
And you should really pay attention to the (Man Made Machine)

Ok MC on that new thing, always keep it moving
Still trying to teach the world change
Grab a mood ring
It could be the new bling
Who knew I'd know when?
Learn to trust and obey in your old friend
They tried to choke him
Threw me in the ocean
Now that I'm floating
Trynna cop a boat man
So cut the ropes and
Telescopes will show
Which way we should flow now
Cause it's time to go
Regular


And Nairobi taught me well
Yes you taught me well
Work hard, Less play
And if you can tell
I'm way past paid
But I keep it shelved
Me no Kanye
West is where we dwell
Bungoma
We are all over
Border to border
Just like a soda
So when they order
Eight crates the Coca
Cola taste
Will always be good
Will always feel great


They like "TAIO TAIO
We've be waiting so, waiting so, waiting so, waiting so
Long for this"
They like "TAIO TAIO
Hope you making more, making more, making more, making more
Keep making more of this"
They like "TAIO TAIO
We've be waiting so, waiting so, waiting so, waiting so
Long for this"
They like "TAIO TAIO
Hope you making more, making more, making more, making more
Keep making more of this"
They like
Ati, Ati ulipotea wapi? (Wapi?) Wapi? (Wapi?) Weva?
Ati, Ati ulipotea wapi? (Wapi?) Wapi? (Wapi?) Weva?
(Oh no no no, Wakhungu where did you go?)
Ati, Ati ulipotea wapi? (Wapi?) Wapi? (Wapi?) Weva?
(Oh no no no, Wakhungu where did you go?)
