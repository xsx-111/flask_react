Are You Alone? LyricsRed wine and sleeping pills
You’re gonna die so you say, but you’re here still
You feel okay; you’re just tired of the feelings you have for yourself
Cheap sex and sad films
I’m gonna leave so I say but I’m here still
I feel okay; I’m just tired of the things that I’ve already tried
Man if you lose your balance, you will fall
Do you hear what I’m saying, or not at all?

Are you alone? What do you say?
I don’t know what I would not do to know
2C-I and 2C-B
Crash your car; lie down in the street
Falling asleep ‘cause you’re so tired that the world doesn’t spin anymore
What’s the point of a sad, sad song?
Do you hear me or not at all?

Are you alone? What do you say?
I don’t know what I would not do to knowEmbed
