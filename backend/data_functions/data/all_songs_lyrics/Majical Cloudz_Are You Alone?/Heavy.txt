Heavy LyricsSo in our love
I'm broken, I feel it, I am
But I know
You hear me, you see me, you can
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
I am
I am
I'm not heavy
I'm nothing, you lift me, you can
I feel unsteady
You hear me, just give me your hand
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
You gotta learn to love me
Cause I am what I am
I am
I am2Embed
