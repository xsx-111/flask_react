Disappeared LyricsThose that forever disappear
All I want is for you to talk to me
The way you used to do
Your old hymns don't touch my face
My heart moves in a new place
I am out of practice falling into love
Remember when we used to say
"I don't know" and it was okay
I am going back to knowing nothing now
Those that forever disappear
All I want is for you to talk to me
The way you used to do
If you won't be seen again
I hope you know you were my friend
And in my head the world will never hurt youEmbed
