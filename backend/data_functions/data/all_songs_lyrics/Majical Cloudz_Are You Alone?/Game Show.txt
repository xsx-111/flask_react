Game Show LyricsYou show yourself to whoever's watching
It's real, it's all true
You make a show out of your feelings
Tell me, do you feel it too
I think I know what point you're proving
You're right, they're in love with you
They know your name, they play your game
Tell me, is it really you
As I see you move in and out of the picture
I look, I don't want to
You really are a shooting star
That crashed when your game is through
You don't know what you're doing
You don't, you really don't
And if it's so hard to tell me so
Then I guess you don't want to
You don't know what you're doing
You don't, you really don't
And if it's so hard to be alone
Then I guess you don't want toEmbed
