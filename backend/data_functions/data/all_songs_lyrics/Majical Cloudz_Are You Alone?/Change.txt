Change LyricsToday I felt no good
I wasted all my time
Don't ever ask me why
Don't ever ask me why
You tell me why we're here
I think about it all the time
Don't ever ask me why
Don't ever ask me why
I want to believe in everything you say
But I'm already feeling change
I want to believe in everything you say
The space inside my head
Is working round the clock
And it won't ever stop
And it won't ever stop
The one you are today
Is you until you rot
And it won't ever stop
And it won't ever stop
I want to believe in everything you say
But I'm already feeling change
I want to believe in everything you say
But I'm already feeling change
I am feeling change
I am feeling change
I want to believe in everything you sayEmbed
