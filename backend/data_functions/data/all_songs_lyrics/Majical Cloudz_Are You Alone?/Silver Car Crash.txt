Silver Car Crash Lyrics
I never show it
But I am always laughing
I want to kiss you
Inside a car thatâ€™s crashing
And we will both die laughing
Cause there is nothing left to do
And we will both die laughing
While I am holding onto you

I will be honest
I am afraid of love
If I'm not perfect
Then it will let me starve
But I am always perfect
When I am holding onto you
And I know love is worth it
I am in perfect love with you

I want to show you
The funny dream I'm having
My head splits open
For all the camera's flashing
But I am dead already
And I am bleeding onto you
I hope you won't forget me
I am so hopelessly for youEmbed
