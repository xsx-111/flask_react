Easier Said Than Done LyricsWhen you're in love it doesn't hurt
When you're alone it gets much worse
You say it's stupid to be upset
You smoke another cigarette
Why would you wanna hide
We will see you through
And what about your life
When everyone else goes to bed
I see you walking in my head
The way you move seems so assured
I look again and I'm not sure
Why would you wanna lie
I've been an easy friend
And what about your life
Why would you wanna die
It's easier said than done
And what about my love
What about my loveEmbed
