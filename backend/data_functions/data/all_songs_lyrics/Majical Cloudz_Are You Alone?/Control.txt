Control LyricsWill you let me change
I want to but I think you want me the same
And I know that it's not a game
I want to move really slow
And while I dance can I tell you about control
Of my body in the eyes of my soul
Would you control me
Would you lock me up and then never set me free
Would you, I am on my knees
Is this going too slow
You think so but we won't speed it up, no no
Cause I like it when the song goes slow
Can I try to be you
Can I dress up in your clothes and be somebody new
Can I dance in a pair of your shoesEmbed
