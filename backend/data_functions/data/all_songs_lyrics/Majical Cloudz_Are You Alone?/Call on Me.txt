Call on Me LyricsCall on me
Come up with me
In this lifelong dream you are first in my mind
I am your friend till the end of your life
In the warm dream
I cannot believe
In 1988 we were born, we survived
At the moment I sing, we're alive
Call on me
Come down with me
There is love for you now
If you want, I will try
To extract what is true in my life
In the cold blue
We are standing below
The moon disappears, there is light all around
I am your friend till I lie in the ground
Like a long ending
In a film I have seen
We will ride up that hill, put a tear in their eyes
I remember how it ends, we survive
And the audience sighs
