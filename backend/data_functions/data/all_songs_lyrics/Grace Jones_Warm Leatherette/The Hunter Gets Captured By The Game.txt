The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game LyricsEvery day brings change
And the world puts on a new face
Certain things rearrange
And the world seems like a new place
Secretly I've been trailing you
Like a fox that preys on a rabbit
I had to get you and so I knew
I'd have to learn all your ways and all your habits
Oh, the catch that I was after
Then I looked up and I was in your arms
And it seemed baby, baby I got captured
What's this whole world coming to?
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game
I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
But love hit me like a sudden slap
Just one of your kisses and baby I knew it
Oh, my plans didn't work out like I thought
'Cause I had laid this here trap for you
But it seems baby, baby I got caught
What's this whole world coming to?
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game
Oh, the catch that I was after
Then I looked up and I was in your arms
And it seemed baby, baby I got captured
What's this whole world coming to?
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game
I don't let me, I don't know
And I don't let me, let me know
I don't let me, I don't know
I don't let me, let me go
I don't let me, I don't know
Oh, the catch that I was after
Then I looked up and I was in your arms
And it seemed baby, baby I got captured
What's this whole world coming to?
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the gameEmbed
