Private Life LyricsJ'en ai marre with your theatrics; your acting's a drag
It's ok on TV, but you can turn it off
Your marriage is a tragedy, but it's not my concern
I'm very superficial, I hate everything official
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Sentimental gestures only bore me to death
You've made a desperate appeal, now save your breath
Attachment to obligation, regret shit that's so wet
And your sex life complications are not my fascinations
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Oh!
You asked my advice; I say use the door
But you're still clinging to somebody you deplore
And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail?
I just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Oh!
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out1Embed
