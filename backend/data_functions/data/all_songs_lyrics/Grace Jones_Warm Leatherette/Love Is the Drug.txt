Love Is the Drug LyricsAin't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell
Aggravated - spare for days
Stroll downtown the red light place
Jump up bubble up - what in store
Love is the drug and I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl and the beat goes on
Stitched up tight, can't shake free
Love is the drug, got a hook on me
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I thinking of
Yeah, can you see?
Love is the drug for me
Ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell
Late that night I park my car
Stake my place in the singles bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor
Lumber up, limbo down
The locked embrace, the stumble round
I say go, he say yes
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest
Yeah, catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I thinking of
Yeah, can you see?
Love is the drug for me
Ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell
Aggravated - spare for days
Stroll downtown the red light place
Jump up bubble up - what in store
Love is the drug and I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl and the beat goes on
Stitched up tight, can shake free
Love is the drug, got a hook on me
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I thinking of
Oh oh, can you see?
Love is the drug for me
Yeah, catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I thinking of
Oh oh, can you see?
Love is the drug for me
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I thinking of
Yeah, can you see?
Love is the drug for me
Oh Ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell
Yeah, catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I thinking of
Oh yeah, can you see?
Love is the drug for me
Gota get that buzz/drug
Give it to me, baby, (?)
Got to have itEmbed
