Warm Leatherette LyricsWarm Leatherette
See the breaking glass
Beneath the underpass
Warm Leatherette
Feel the crushing steel
Feel the steering wheel
Warm Leatherette melts
On your burning flesh
You can see your reflection
On the luminescent dash
Warm Leatherette
A tear of petrol
Is in your eye
The hand brake
Penetrates your thigh
A tear of petrol
Is in your eye
Quick let's make love
Before we die
On Warm Leatherette
Join the carcrash setEmbed
