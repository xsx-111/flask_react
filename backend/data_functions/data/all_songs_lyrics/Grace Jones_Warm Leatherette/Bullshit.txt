Bullshit LyricsAnd if I wander down the wrong road
It's alright baby, just let me go
If I get tired of all those assholes
It's alright cause' I want them to know
I'm sick and tired of all this bullshit
Rough shit, same shit
Hey Jesus come on down and save us, save us, rave on
And on the road I ride through Richmond
Rich man, You know the business I'm in
And feeling sorry, makes me feel mad
Someday, uh baby, I play to win
I'm sick and tired of all this bullshit
Rough shit, same shit
Can't Jesus come on down and save us, save us, rave on
I'm sick and tired of all this bullshit
Same shit, wrong shit
Hey Jesus come on down and save us, save us, rave on
And if I wander down the wrong road
It's alright honey, just let me go
If I get tired of all those assholes
It's alright cause' I want them to know
I'm sick and tired of all this bullshit
Rough shit, same shit
Hey Jesus come on down and save us, save us, rave onEmbed
