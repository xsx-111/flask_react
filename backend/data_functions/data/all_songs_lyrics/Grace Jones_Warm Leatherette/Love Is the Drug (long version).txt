Love Is the Drug (long version) Lyrics't ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
't ain't no big thing, the toll of the bell
Aggravated, spare for days
I troll down town the redlight place
Jump up, bubble up
What's in store
Love is the drug and I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl where the beat goes on
Stiched up tight, can't shake free
Love is the drug got a hook on me
Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see, love is the drug for me
Oooh, oooh
Late at night I parked my car
Staked my place in the singles bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor
Lumbered up, limbo down
The locked embrace, stumble round
I say go, she say yes
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest
Oh, catch the buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug got a hook on me
Oh, catch the buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see, love is the drug for me
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
...
Oooh, oooh
Love is, love is, love is the drugEmbed
