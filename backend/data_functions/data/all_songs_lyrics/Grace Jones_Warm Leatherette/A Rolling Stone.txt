A Rolling Stone Lyrics
I've been livin' my life just like a rolling stone
When I needed your love, baby, you're always gone

In my life I know that something is missing
Grains of sand is really all you've been giving
I need more loving baby, I need more kissing
Now I want more of what you got

They say a rolling stone never gathers no moss
One day you will slow down and find that love is lost

In my life I know that something is missing
Grains of sand is really all you've been giving
But, I need more loving baby, I need more kissing
Now I want more of what you got
Now I want more of what you got

In a field, watch a flower grow
Love is just the same
All it needs is tender love and care
Behind the  it's cold and bare
Now I want more of what you got
Now I want more of what you got
In my life I know that something is missing
Baby, grains of sand is really all you've been giving
I need more loving baby, I need more kissing
Now I want more of what you got
Now I want more of what you got

Now I want more of what you gotEmbed
