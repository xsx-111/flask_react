Giddy Up! Lyrics
So in the morning (Giddy up!)
And in the evening (Giddy up!)
We take the matter (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
When times are hardy (Giddy up!)
We throw a party (Giddy up!)
We climb that ladder (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)

Now look at all the fag, Now look at all of us
This town's not big enough, not for the both of us
We fight and disagree, we get so tired, see
We just a fusion baby, be the solution baby

Our only way to reconsile
Is to get back in the saddle, for a little ride
Giddy up now

So in the morning (Giddy up!)
And in the evening (Giddy up!)
We take the matter (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
When times are hardy (Giddy up!)
We throw a party (Giddy up!)
We climb that ladder (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
Now look at silly me, now look at silly you
Avoid 'em problems girl, They'll only make us all sore
But I must say as such that I don't mind too much
Like we fight it hun, ride off in to the sun

Our only way to reconsile
Is to get back in the saddle, for a litte ride
Giddy up now

So in the morning (Giddy up!)
And in the evening (Giddy up!)
We take the matter (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
When times are hardy (Giddy up!)
We throw a party (Giddy up!)
We climb that ladder (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
(Instrumental Break)

Our only way to reconsile
Is to get back in the saddle, for a litte ride
Giddy up now
So in the morning (Giddy up!)
And in the evening (Giddy up!)
We take the matter (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
When times are hardy (Giddy up!)
We throw a party (Giddy up!)
We climb that ladder (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
So in the morning (Giddy up!)
And in the evening (Giddy up!)
We take the matter (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)
When times are hardy (Giddy up!)
We throw a party (Giddy up!)
We climb that ladder (Giddy up!)
Back in the saddle (Giddy up!)

Giddy up!
Giddy up!
Giddy up!
Giddy up!Embed
