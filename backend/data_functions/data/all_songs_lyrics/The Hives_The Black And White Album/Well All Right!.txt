Well All Right! LyricsYeah
Oh!
Yeah
You got the...
Yeah
Troubles but...
Yeah
I'll get help
Yeah
Yeah!
Yeah
Yeah
Help me!
Yeah
Well All right! I know just what you mean
Well All right! And I know that it might seem
Well All right! I should have better things to do
Well All right! I'm so sick of it, this won't do
First in line but last to know
Move too fast but think too slow
People see me and they go...
You want help? You gotta ask for help and I ain't gonna give you help cause I can't help myself either
I need help!
And when you hear this, It's time to turn the pages
Everyone's a loser in the modern world
Look at all the sad and gloomy little boys and girls
All of you got troubles all of you got...
Shake the chips off your shoulders here is how it goes
Juggling chainsaws with just one hand
Falling down the stairs with a marching band
Swim across the ocean in a concrete suit
Trying to grow a beard but still look cute
On and on the world spins round
It's enough to get you down
But I don't worry cause sometimes you just have to...
Whoooo Hoooo!
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Well All right! I know just what you mean
Well All right! And I know that it might seem
Well All right! I should have better things to do
Well All right! I'm so sick of it, this won't do
First in line but last to know
Move too fast but think too slow
People see me and they go... scuse me!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
Whoo Hoo!
(I need help)
Everyone's a loser in the modern world
Look at all the sad and gloomy little boys and girls
I know all you got troubles all you got is...
Shake the chips off your shoulders here is how it goes...
Whoooo Hoooo!Embed
