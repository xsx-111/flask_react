Square One Here I Come Lyrics
Well, Don't have no money cause I don't have a job
Don't have a job cause I ain't got no skills
Ain't got no skills cause I was not trained
I wasn't trained cause I didn't go to school
Didn't go to school cause nobody told me
Nobody told me cause nobody knew shit
No, nobody knew shit cause nobody knows nothing
Nobody knows nothing and that's just it, What can you do?

You get what's given to you!
Square one here I come, here I come square one!
Square one here I come, here I come square one!

Don't have a home cause I don't pay no bills
Don't pay no bills cause nobody pays me
Nobody pays me cause I don't go to no work
Don't go to no work and that's just it, What can you do?

You get what's given to you!
Square one here I come, here I come square one!
Square one here I come, here I come square one!
I know what you say to me but baby it can wait
I just stop and take a look around and realize it's too late

No job!
No skills!
No money!
No nothing!
No nothing cause I want it for free
I want it for free all that is coming to me
So I look real hard for somebody to blame
Somebody to blame or an easy way out
An easy way out cause it ain't what's fun
The place that starts with a square and ends with a one, What can you do?

You get what's given to you!
Square one here I come, here I come square one!
Square one here I come, here I come square one!

Get down, you feel stupid!
Don't try, you can't do it!
Can't win! Don't you forget it!
You missed out and get what's given to you!Embed
