Try It Again Lyrics
Doo wacko!

Here's to you honey
But I'm out of your league
Never gonna pass me
'Cause I'm out of your league, your league
Your league
Lookie here baby
You're coming my way
But I move like a landslide
So get out of my way and stay away

Up from the floor on the count of ten
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again

Up and down and around again
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again
Up and down and around again
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again
All right!
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Time to learn a lesson
Like Pavlov's dog
If same-ing isn't working
Why don't you different instead, instead, instead
Like Samson and Delilah
Attila and the Hunns
You're ready for a new round
Don't it look like it's gonna be fun, be fun

Up from the floor on the count of ten
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again

Up and down and around again
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again
Up and down and around again
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again

They say the definition of madness
Is doing the same thing
And expecting a different result...
That's right!
Doo wacko! Up and down
Doo wacko! Down and up
Doo wacko! Round for round
Doo wacko! Hit the ground
Doo wacko! Up and down
Doo wacko!
Ah you get up, you get down and you try it again
Down and up
Doo wacko!
Ah you get up, you get down and you try it again
Round for round
Doo wacko!
Ah you get up, you get down and you try it again
Hit the ground
Doo wacko!
Ah you get up, you get down and you try it again
Ah you get up, you get down and you try it again
Ah you get up, you get down and you try it again
Ah you get up, you get down and you try it againEmbed
