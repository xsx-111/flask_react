T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S. LyricsI know that it has been a long time coming
Your bought your tickets, you waited in line
You were walking and now you find yourself running
To get closer to the giant neon sign
Allow me to
Give you a clue
You're looking at black and white
Seeing our name in lights
Gonna make you feel alright
Cause baby we're here all night
We rule the world
This is our world
T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S
You hold your breath and now it's silent
The humming of the amps is all you hear
Introducing for the fourth time running
Cause if you don't know we'll make it very clear
Ooooooooohhh
You know it's true
You're looking at black and white
Seeing our name in lights
Gonna make you feel alright
Cause baby we're here all night
We rule the world
This is our world
T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S
When you're all ripped up around a quarter to ten
Gonna piece you back together by eleven and then
When you sweated it out and you're all soaking wet
Then we'll do it again
We rule the world
This is our world
T.H.E.H.I.V.E.SEmbed
