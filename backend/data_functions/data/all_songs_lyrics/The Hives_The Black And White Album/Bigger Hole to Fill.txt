Bigger Hole to Fill LyricsLook out!
I pet the cat along the whiskers
And always go along the grain
You'll never see me in the deep end
If I ain't got nothing to gain
Don't serve the fool or act the donkey
If you allow me to explain
Guy who fights for causes, worthy of a fool
Is a fool to fight for causes, that's the golden rule
I take it to the table, know all no fix no how
But if I'm gonna do it, I ain't gonna do it now
Got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill
No I ain't got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill
Got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill
No I ain't got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill- Got a bigger hole to fill
You see I have a proper education
I use enough to get me by
I got the answers to all problems
But I ain't even gonna try
Work hard and be honest
Take chances and stay true
Just add it to the list of things that I ain't gonna do
Wherever there is a question, blurry answer's here to find
I say I'm gonna help you but I'm gonna change my mind
Got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill
No I ain't got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill
Got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill
No I ain't got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill- Got a bigger hole to fill
Got a bigger hole to fill (x3)
I got no time to spill- ohohoh
He's got no time to spill
He's got a bigger hole to fill
I got a bigger hole to fill
No he's got no time to spill
Cuz I got a bigger hole to fill
Got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fill
No I ain't got no time to spill
I got a bigger hole to fillEmbed
