Puppet on a String LyricsLike a puppet on a string
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
Like a puppet on a string
Like a puppet on a string
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
You´ve got your education
From just hanging around
You´ve got your brain
From a hole in the ground
You come out up look around
For will of your own
But you´re mine
Yeaaahhhh
Like a puppet on a string (4x)
With porcelain eyes
And the mind of the monkey
Rode in to town
On the back and what
Looked like dead donkey
So I do to you what a
Proper puppetmaster´s to do
Can you tell?
Yeaahhh
Like a puppet on a string
(like a puppet on a string)
Like a puppet on a string
(it´s like a puppet on a string)
Like a puppet on a string
(like a puppet on a string)
Like a puppet on a string
You´ve got your education
From just hanging around
You´ve got your brain
From a hole in the ground
You come out up look around
For will of your own
But you´re mind
Yeaaahhhh
Like a puppet on a string
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
Like a puppet on a string
Like a puppet on a string
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
Like a puppet on a string
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
Like a puppet on a string
Like a puppet on a string
You hold on tight
You hold on tight
You hold on tightEmbed
