Hey Little World LyricsIt was on a cold dark night, born into this world
They couldn't tell back then, is it a boy or a girl?
Has since then been a story, of uncertainty
It was claimed ?a child?, that he would never be free
Hey little world! you know what you're getting
Oh please little world, It's kicking your head in
Whatcha gonna do? Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Grow up advance to nothing
Live in a house of clay
He didn't know back then
But they liked it that way
He didn't do what they told him
He never did what they said
Try to tell him your wrong again and
Is this what you get?
Hey little world! you know what you're getting
Oh please little world, It's kicking your head in
Whatcha gonna do? Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Take it to your mother
Now as the starlets are scraping
Now he's as wide as the sea
And when you look all around you
He is what you see
All around the bed
He's gonna make sure you heard
Hey little world! you know what you're getting
Oh please little world, It's kicking your head in
He's got them all lined up and they're ready to go
They're all lined up and that's what he saw
Hey little world, back in the ocean again
Whatcha gonna do? Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Whatcha gonna do? Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Anyone of you? Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Hey little world, back in the ocean again?
I said hey little world, back in the ocean again?Embed
