Return the Favour LyricsWell we'd talk and talk and talk about it
But talk would do no good
We have little to next to nothing to talk about
And we'd talk and talk and talk around it
But talk would do no good
We have little to next to nothing to talk about
So nothing went from nothing then
And then back to the nothing I expected when
I return the favour
Is it time to go home?
Ooh ooh
Now we can talk and talk and talk about it
Talk until we're blue
It's just a big jug full of stupid passing thru
It's like a boxer's goodbye, I'll see you Cassius Clayter
In French Mohammad, oui!
Yeah we have little to next to nothing to talk about
So nothing went from nothing then
And then back to the nothing I expected when
I return the favour
Is it time to go home?
It's a waste of time and a waste of space
It's just taproom talk through a drunken haze
I return the favour
Guess it's time to go home
Ooh ooh
I got my mind made up and it's getting clear
There's better things to go than staying here
I return the favour
And leave on my own
Ooh oohEmbed
