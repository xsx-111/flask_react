You Got It All... Wrong Lyrics
You wanna dance you really wanna let it go
You want it bad, but this time they told you to go, you want it
You try it fast when you really should do it slow
You got it bad and it's time I told you no, you're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did, so just let it go (Oh no!)

You wanna laugh and you really wanna let them know
You're so relaxed and you really gonna let it show, you want it
Do you recall when we were two of a kind
But you chose your way, and I chose mine, you're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did, so just let it go

(Oh no!) Remote controlled, but you got it all
(Oh no!) You stand ten feet tall 'cause you got it all
(Oh no!) Remote controlled, but you got it all and you got it all
But you got it all wrong!
We had a laugh, but it turned into a cough
We got along, but now I wanna get off, you're on it
I was a kid when I did what you do
I put a lid on and thought that's it, I'm through, you're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did, so just let it go

(Oh no!) Remote controlled, but you got it all
(Oh no!) You stand ten feet tall 'cause you got it all
(Oh no!) Remote controlled, but you got it all
(Oh no!) You stand ten feet tall 'cause you got it all
(Oh no!) And when I say you lose it, you don't believe it at all
(Oh no!) It's such a long way to fall, the writing's on the wall
(Oh no!) But when I said you'd lose it, I can't even recall
(Oh no!) If it was the best of all, your brain a bit too small

Because you got it all, you got it all, you got it all
But you got it all wrong!Embed
