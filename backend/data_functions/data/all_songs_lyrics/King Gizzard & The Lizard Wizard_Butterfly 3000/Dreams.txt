Dreams Lyrics
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel awake in the night
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel tired in the day
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna run away
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna run and hide
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only like it when I can't see
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only need the castle in the air
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna keep my eyes glazed
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel alive in a daze

I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna wake up in my dream

I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel awake in the night
I only wanna wake up in my drĞµam
I only feel tired in the day
I only wanna wake up in my drĞµam
I only wanna run away
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna run and hide
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only like it when I can't see
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only need the castle in the air
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna keep my eyes glazed
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only feel alive in a daze
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna wake up in my dream
I only wanna wake up in my dream1Embed
