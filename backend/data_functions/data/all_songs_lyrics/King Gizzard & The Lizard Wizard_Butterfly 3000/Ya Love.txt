Ya Love Lyrics
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love

I can't wait to be underneath your spell
I can't wait to spin the carousel
I can't wait for you to sweep us up
I just can't wait to feel

Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love

Your love is just a state of mind in mine
Are we here? Don't know, but I don't mind

I can't wait to go to someplace with ya
I can't wait to go on adventures
I can't wait for us to pick you up
I just can't wait to feel
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love

Your love is like a dream inside a dream
Relax, close your eyes and be with me

I can't wait to be underneath your spell
I can't wait to spin the carousel
I can't wait for you to sweep us up
I just can't wait to feel-2Embed
