Yours Lyrics
Did you know he's yours?
He's the wheel you steer
Tomorrow, still yours
You can lean on him forever

Your man in the sky
Your bird's lullaby
Your dream in a dream
Your blue butterfly
Your winged Frankenstein
Materialised
As a figment of
Dream personified

Did you know he's yours?
Your security
Tomorrow, still yours
You can count on him forever

He's yours

Did you know he's yours?
He's the wheel you steer
Tomorrow, still yours
You can lean on him forever

Your third sleeping eye
Your friend in your mind
Can make a vision
So real and refined
Like lifetime knowledge
Travelling ether
From a godly cloud
To the believer

Did you know he's yours?
When you fall asleep
Tomorrow, still yours
He's a gentle breeze
Forever, he's yours
Did you know he's yours?2Embed
