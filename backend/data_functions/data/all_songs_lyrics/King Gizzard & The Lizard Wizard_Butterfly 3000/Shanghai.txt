Shanghai Lyrics
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

Okay, let me trace my steps
Pour a drink, let's recap the sequence
One minute, you're swigging on a green tea
Next minute, floating on a pillow in a den
From there, it gets a little hazy
Like a camera out of focus shaking
Slow motion in the club free-falling
Through my seat, hit the floor transforming
Undergoing complete metamorphous
From a moth caterpillar to chrysalis
Spinning in a silken house, like a spider spins a web
I'm a well-known insect
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

Flying through the Yu Garden to the People's Square
That's where you find your happiness
With a little too much Szechuan in the pot
Sending sensational content
Neck stuck from looking up
At the high-rise buildings trying to caress
Enlightenment through an out-of-body experience
You're thriving in this environment
Come find me on almost every continent
Cold-blooded, but I can't stand the Antarctic
Guess I've been born again overnight
(Born again overnight)
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight4Embed
