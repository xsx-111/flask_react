-your love

Butterfly 3000

Hope that I am worthy of your love
Hope I am deserving of your love
Hope you can brush off the powers that be
Hope I can empower femininity
Hope I can teach you how to be mostly happy
Hope you don't let the world crush you
For it is beautiful out there and there's a lot to see
Hope I can teach you to see the splendour of the moment
Hope you can see the beauty within the grim world's ugly mess
