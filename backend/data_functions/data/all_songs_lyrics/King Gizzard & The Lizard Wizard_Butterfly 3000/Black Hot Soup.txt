Black Hot Soup Lyrics
Seething pot filled with hot liquid up to the top
Spinning ball with molten core of iron ore, what's it for?

Staring out in the dissonance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup in the distance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup engulfing me (Black hot soup)

Infinity is in a dream inside a dream
You can achieve reality
It gets better (It gets better)
It gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin
Floating above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me (Bettеr when you're with me)
Hеre in my own reality with you (Better when you're with me, better when you're with me)

Colossal fireball falling for an endless floor
Warming wall is moving blind to open shores and open minds

Staring out in the dissonance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup in the distance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup engulfing me (Black hot soup)
Infinity is in a dream inside a dream
You can achieve reality
It gets better (It gets better)
It gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin
Floating above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me (Better when you're with me)
Here in my own reality with you (Better when you're with me, better when you're with me)

Staring out in the dissonance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup in the distance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup engulfing me (Black hot soup), woo!
(Black hot soup)

Infinity is in a dream inside a dream
You can achieve reality
It gets better (It gets better)
It gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin
Floating above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me (Better when you're with me)
Here in my own reality with you (Better when you're with me, better when you're with me)
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
(Black hot soup, black hot soup)
(Black hot soup, black hot soup)
(Black hot soup, black hot soup)2Embed
