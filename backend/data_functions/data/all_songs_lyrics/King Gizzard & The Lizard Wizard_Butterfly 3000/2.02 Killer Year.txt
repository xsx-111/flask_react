2.02 Killer Year Lyrics
Woo!

It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone
It's coming up, beach boys
The weather's getting messed about
You better bring boards down
The waves are bigger than a house

2.02, killer year
No fear, proceed without blame
No shame
Playing games with lives unborn
No scorn
Not torn between just and fucked up
We've stuffed up
Time to pick up

Woo!
It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown еveryone
It's coming up, beach boys
Thе weather's getting messed about
You better bring boards down
The waves are bigger than a house

2.02, killer year
The year that broke our broken wheel
Is it enough that we're a speck
Of dust speeding through a void of stuff?
We teeter on an axe edge

Water signage, never read it
How pathetic, coinciding
Mystifying, steep declining
Too little, too late to contemplate
Gotta make moves, cannot wait
Need to recreate a clean slate
Plan B, C and D
However many needs to be to keep us free in ecstasy
It's easier to swallow hiding in your burrow
No need to wallow in your sorrows
Woo!
It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone2Embed
