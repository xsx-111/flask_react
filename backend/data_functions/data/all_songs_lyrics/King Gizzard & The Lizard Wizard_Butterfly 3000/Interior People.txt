Interior People Lyrics
Just on the down-low
I'm feeling pretty low
Some days, I feel fine
Others, I don’t know
I got a sensory road block
I'm in a binary mind lock
So I'm dancing in lockstep
To music that I can’t hear, yeah

Failing farmer, toxic crop
Two white hearts to shake shit up
Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the drywall inside my skull

Interior people
A lens flare in my subconscious
The gap of death, I no longer fear
The interior people

I keep thinking someone
Is standing beside me
When I turn to grab them
They jump back inside of me
They tell me to do things
And so does the radio
And learn from the satellite
That orbits my shadow, yeah
Instigate the paradigm
Play the game and drink the wine
Communicate with the afterglow that radiates between the wall
Failing farmer, toxic crop
Two white hearts to shake shit up
Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the drywall inside my skull

Interior people
A lens flare in my subconscious
The gap of death, I no longer fear
The interior peopleEmbed
