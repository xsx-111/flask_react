Revelations Lyrics
You know what to do, you know what I did
Since you know everything, just clue me in
I am such a wreck, I am such a mess
I know what I know, why don't you fill in the rest?
I will bring it down, I will make it bad
While you're feeling proud, why don't you help me?

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in, I don't want to live without
Your revelations, revelations

You know what to say, you know what I said
You know what I dream sleeping in my bed
You hold all the keys, you know all the roads
Why don't you guide me in if I'm such a lost soul?
I'll spin it 'round, I will make you ill
Since I'm so broken down, why don't you fix me?

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in, I don't want to live without
Your revelations, revelations
I am haunted when I am sleeping
Try to give without receiving
It's in the apple bite, it's in the days and nights
In the afterlife we'll meet

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in, I don't want to live without
Your revelations, revelations

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in, I don't want to live without
Your revelations, revelations1Embed
