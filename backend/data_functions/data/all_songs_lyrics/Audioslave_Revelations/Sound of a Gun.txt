Sound of a Gun Lyrics
In the here and now I wait
Down among the young and the old
With the moon and the ground I play
With my children in my home
This is for the daughters and sons
Of forgotten ones, learning how to stand
This is for the innocent unknowns
Buried in the sand

All running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun
Until you're weary
Running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun

From the crack in the blackness I wake
It's getting closer every night
And my city, the playground, is a battleground
Between the wrong and the right
I could run free as a child, I was safe and wild
Naked and unarmed
Now I'm grown and safe in my home
But some will never stop
Running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun
Until you're weary
Running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun


The open mouth of the city
Swallowed up the town
With that same old concrete
That I still walk down
And it seemingly put a shine
On this place when I was young
And maybe I just don't see it now

Running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun
Until I'm weary
Running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun

Running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun
Running from the sound of a gun
Running from, running from the sound of a gunEmbed
