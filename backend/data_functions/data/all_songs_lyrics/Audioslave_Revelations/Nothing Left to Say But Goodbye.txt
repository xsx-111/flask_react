Nothing Left to Say But Goodbye Lyrics
Just like a rescue of a stray dog in the rain
I was hungry when you found me
And you could tell by my tail and my rib cage
What was once around me

I've been chased by a rain cloud
I was lost and nearly drowned
And kicked around but now I'm found
And I won't run away

Bless your heart you gave me a home
And a new start, and I will leave you never
Sleep at your feet and stand guard
At your front door, I will keep things together

I've been chased by a rain cloud
I was lost and nearly drowned
And kicked around but now I'm found
And I won't run away

I killed myself, threw away my mental health
But nobody was blinking an eye
Backyard, basement, falling on the pavement
Nothing left to say but goodbye
Nothing left to say but goodbye
It's true I ran away before but be sure
I am no tail-chaser
I know a good thing when it throws me a bone
I'm your best friend forever
I've been chased by a rain cloud
I was lost and nearly drowned
And kicked around but now I'm found
And I won't run away2Embed
