One and the Same Lyrics
Well, they don't hate you, you know they love you
But they're going to come, kill you
They don't mean you any harm
It's just what they do
Could be your mother
Could be your father
Or your best friend
In the world

But just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)
Just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)

You wear a mask with a target
Keep you're enemies closer
You fall in love from a great height
Now the easy part's over
Choose your battles
Not your soldiers
You know they'll show
Their colors
But just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)
Just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)

But just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)
Just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)

But just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)
Just like blood and rain
Love and pain are one and the same (one and the same)1Embed
