Wide Awake Lyrics
You can look a hurricane right in the eye
1200 people dead or left to die
Follow the leaders, were it an eye for an eye
We'll all be blind, deaf or murdered, this I'm sure
In this uncertain time

So come and pull the sheet over my eyes
So I can sleep tonight despite what I've seen today
I find you guilty of the crime of sleeping at a time
When you should have been wide awake

Down on the road the world is floating by
The poor and undefended left behind
While you're somewhere trading lives for oil
As if the whole world were blind, hey

So come and pull the sheet over my eyes
So I can sleep tonight despite what I've seen today
I find you guilty of the crime of sleeping at a time
When you should have been wide awake

So come and pull the sheet over my eyes
So I can sleep tonight despite what I've seen today
I find you guilty of the crime of sleeping at a time
When you should have been wide awake
Wide awake
Wide awake
Wide awake
