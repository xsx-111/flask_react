Broken City Lyrics
My city sleeps by the side of a freeway
A city of scraps
In the winter time she wore a yellow coat
Now there's nothing on her back
If a building falls you wouldn't care to notice
Unless you were in it
And then no one cares about climbing stairs
Nothing at the top no more

Outside tripping in the broken city
Outside kicking in the broken city
I watch her bleed and crack
Outside tripping in the broken city
Outside kicking in the broken city
There's nothing wrong with that

Now the snow falls down
Like it's falling on an ocean, dead and empty
By the railroad tracks
Where they used to go and come
Now they don't come back
You can hear the rust growing up the throughways
Down the alleys
Where they stole this town from the frontier
I can see them trying to steal it back
Outside tripping in the broken city
Outside kicking in the broken city
I watch her bleed and crack
Outside tripping in the broken city
Outside kicking in the broken city
There's nothing wrong with that

Now the sun won't shine
On this part of the map anymore
When it's cold outside
I see it hide behind the smokestacks
Nothing grows there, no gold rush
No miner, no revolution behind her
And the shipyard is a graveyard
No one will be trying to find her

Outside tripping in the broken city
Outside kicking in the broken city
I watch her bleed and crack
Outside tripping in the broken city
Outside kicking in the broken city
There's nothing wrong with that
Nothing wrong with that
Outside tripping in the broken city, yeah
Hey, outside tripping in the broken city
Hey, outside tripping in the broken city
Outside, outside
Outside, outside
Outside, outside
