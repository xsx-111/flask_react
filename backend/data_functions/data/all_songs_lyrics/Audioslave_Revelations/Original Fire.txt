Original Fire Lyrics
The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on
The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on

The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on
The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on

With a pen in one hand, taking a stand, drugged on kerosene
84 and 5 would find us something to believe
Right or wrong with dirty hands on wires
Singing songs in discord choirs
Screaming in Braille
No temptress prize could ever yield anything so real

The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on
The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on

Golden soldiers born much older than they'll ever live to be
Diving into a sea of hands in a long forgotten city
Here the rain falls forever after
And the swinging vines hang dead in rafters
Blood rush to your head induces laughter endlessly
The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on
The original fire has died and long gone but the riot inside moves on

Can't explain it, it was something to see
Can't contain something ever real, ever real
Ever real
Can't explain it, it was something to see
Can't contain something so ever real, ever real
Ever real

The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on
The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on

The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on
The original fire has died and gone but the riot inside moves on1Embed
