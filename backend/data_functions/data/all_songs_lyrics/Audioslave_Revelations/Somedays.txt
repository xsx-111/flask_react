Somedays Lyrics
Somedays, somedays
Somedays just ain't so easy

Wake up, look around
Just before your feet hit the ground
Where they make the oil and street
Is where you stand and where you sleep
Black and whites, alarms and lights
Plain clothes and Miranda Rights
At the right place but in the wrong life
Somedays just ain't so easy

Somedays, somedays
Somedays, somedays just ain't so easy
Somedays, somedays
Somedays, somedays just ain't so easy

It's not the fault of anyone
As we revolve around the sun
We sleep beneath the same sky
But we all see it through different eyes
So if you go or if you stay
Standing still if you walk away
If you bend or if you break
Somedays just ain't so easy
Somedays, somedays
Somedays, somedays just ain't so easy
Somedays, somedays
Somedays, somedays just ain't so easy
Just ain't so easy, ooh yeah

Someone may have done you right or done you wrong
Nobody say it's so easy, yeah
I don't care for somedays
Someone may have done you right or done you wrong
Kept it down from the day you were born
There's no need to apologize for the riot in your eyes
Because somedays just ain't so easy, hey

Somedays, somedays
Somedays, somedays just ain't so easy
Somedays, somedays
Somedays, somedays just ain't so easyEmbed
