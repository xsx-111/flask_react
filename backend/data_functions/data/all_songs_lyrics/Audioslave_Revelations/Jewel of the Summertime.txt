Jewel of the Summertime Lyrics
When I was 18
I didn't know pain when the sun was high
Burnt face, shadow's erased
And I knew I'd be alright
Left that behind me, uh huh
Something blinded me, uh huh
You're reminding me, uh huh
Of a better space and time, miles away

The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime

When I turned 21
I saw the sun falling out of sight
All that I met were dark silhouettes
Stumbling in the night
Then we collided, uh huh
And I finally, uh huh
Got a light on me, uh huh
Now I'm bathing in the bright ultraviolet rays
The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime

I left that behind me, uh, huh
But something blinded me, uh, huh
You're reminding me, uh, huh
Of a better space and time, miles away

The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime

The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertime, the jewel of the summertime
The jewel of the summertimeEmbed
