Until We Fall Lyrics
I walk the streets without I regret
I stood alone and watched myself fall apart
Answered the voices in my head
Slipped through the chainlink of a broken heart

And when I'm tired of feeling black
Spread the wings upon your back
Take us high above it all
And stroke your feathers 'till we fall
Back down again

Bought everything that sounded good
I understand that I've been misunderstood

And when I'm tired of feeling black
Spread the wings upon your back
Take us high above it all
And stroke your feathers 'till we fall
Back down again

What do you feel before you think?
What do you see before you blink?
Who do you battle in your dreams?
Who strokes your feathers 'till you scream?
And when I'm tired of feeling black
Spread the wings upon your back
Take us high above it all
And stroke your feathers until we fall
Back down againEmbed
