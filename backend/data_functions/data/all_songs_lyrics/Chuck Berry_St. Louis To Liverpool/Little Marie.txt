Little Marie Lyrics
Yes, oh yes, Long Distance, I'll accept the charge, I'll pay
Which loved one is calling me, I did not hear you say
Both are deep within my heart, her Mom and my Marie
It's so good to hear your voice from Memphis, Tennessee

Oh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know
Surely, you have not forgot how much I love you so
If you would remember, Dear and sometimes talk to me
Maybe that would reunite our home in Tennessee


Last time I saw you, just before I had to leave
You did not want to see me off and promised not to grieve
My heart was torn apart as I looked back at my Marie
And there the pieces still remain with you in Tennessee

I guess I should stop talking, after all you placed the call
But anyway that I can help, you know I'll help you all
Then she spoke and asked me to come back and see Marie
And live together in our home in Memphis, TennesseeEmbed
