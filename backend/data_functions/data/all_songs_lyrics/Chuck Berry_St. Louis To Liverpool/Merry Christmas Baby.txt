Merry Christmas Baby Lyrics
Merry Christmas baby
You really did treat me nice

Bought me a hi-fi for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
Well I'm feeling mighty fine
I got good music on my radio
Well I feel so fine
I got good music on my radio
Yes I want to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe
Santa came down the chimney
About a half past three
Left all these pretty presents
That you see before me
Merry Christmas baby
You really been good to me
I will always love you baby
Now I'm happy as I can beEmbed
