Things I Used to Do Lyrics
The things that I used to do
Lord I won't do no more

I used to sit and hold your hand, baby
Begging you, not today

I used to search all night for you baby
And my search always anything

Yeah, and I new alone again, darling
You was out somewhere with your other man

I'm going to send you back to your mother, baby
Or I'm going back to my family too

Nothing I ever do pleases you, darling
Or I just can't get along with youEmbed
