Nadine (Is It You?) Lyrics
As I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walkin' up the street
I shouted to the driver, "Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus"

Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you, darling, you got something else to do

I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to something new

Downtown searching for her, looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty-dollar bill and told him, "Catch that yellow cab"
Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to something new

She moves around like a wayward summer breeze
"Go, driver, go, go, catch her, pretty please"
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you, darling, you're up to something newEmbed
