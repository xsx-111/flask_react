Go Bobby Soxer Lyrics
Bobby band a-rocking
And the bobby soxer's doing the twist
It's a bobby soxer beat
And you can rock it any way you wish
Work out, bobby soxer, you can
Wiggle like a whimsical fish

Go, go, bobby soxer

When the weekend comes
You'll be right back rocking some more
Bobby soxer dancing
But she keeps peeping on the stand
Bobby soxer's got a crush
On a beatle in the bobby band
Love bug sure going to bite her
If the beatle even wave his hand
Twist on, bobby soxer
But don't forget the bobby rule
It's getting late, bobby soxer
And the teacher teaching you in school
And tomorrow morning, bobby soxer
You'll be back in schoolEmbed
