Homegrown LyricsProbably the thought of angels playing with my time will fade
No ones gonna say anything for me cause there all at home where they stayed
Build up and squash between an air of beauty is what we all should breathe
And here you see is believers...
Fill in the pages of tomorrow's yet to be
Well life is changing slowly with it inside me
Homegrowns the way that it should be
If we are really going to see
Homegrown is the way that it should be
Seeminglessly endless nights of summer passing slow
The world surrounds me getting smaller homegrown let it grow
Step further down the line carry on everything's just take your time
Step further down the line carry on everything's gonna be just fine
Homegrowns the way that it should be
If we are really going to see
Homegrown is the way that it should be
Homegrown is the way that it should be
It should be..
Homegrowns the way that it should be
If we are really going to see
Homegrown is the way that it should
Homegrown is the way that it should beEmbed
