Long Life LyricsJack you've spreading round for so long, now I'm so tired
The only thing you can go and do is get yourself fired
And with your pay cheque, just like the last one
When tonight's through it will be gone and so will I
This is been a long life, now mine is nearly through
I've had a lot of time to think now I must speak to you
Tell me am I dreaming as I look around
We can't afford a descent life for those with their feet on the ground
I feel it my duty to try and pass it on
This wisdom I've acquired..
I understand the nature of life
As well as any soul left living
As well as any man still alive
You said there's an answer for a hundred years or two
It came in a dream one night, wisdom only comes to a few
This is been a long life now mine is nearly through
And if I'd have the my again, I'd spend it all with you
I feel it my duty to try and pass it on
This wisdom I've acquired..
I understand the nature of life
As well as any soul left living
As well as any man still alive
Dreams exist in dreamland, my passion fails to show
My eyes no longer sparkle, desire begins to slow
Comfort peace slips beyond my imagination
It's your life they demand for little appreciation
It's all well and good when it's understood, we can beat them if we try
It's all well and good when it's understood, we can beat them if we try
This is been a long life, now mine is nearly through
I've had a lot of time to think now I must speak to you
This is been a long life now mine is nearly through
And if I'd have my time again I'd spend it all with you
Everyone will be together to hear the word to the wiseEmbed
