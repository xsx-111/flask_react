In A Room LyricsIn a room there's no other faces
Don't know why I'm feeling like this
Tell me lies, I won't believe them
Why don't it always turn out right?
If we are together again
Surely this will never end
These times have changed this is never gone before
I'm waiting for you behind the door
In a room there's no other faces
I sit alone here let through the night
In a room, we're slowly wasting
I don't belong here, it don't seem right
If we are together again
Surely this will never end
These times have changed this is never gone before
I'm waiting for you behind the door
She lies sleeping in a half filled bed, her eyes
No longer study her emptiness
In a room there's only so much space (So much space)
Two souls playing in loneliness
I've thrown away the key
I've gone and locked myself in for good
No one can reach me
No one hears my voice anymore
Not anymore...
If we are together again
Surely it will never end?
These times have changed this is never gone before
I'm waiting for you behind the door
If we are together again
Surely it will never end?
These times have changed this is never gone before
I'm waiting for you behind the door
If we are together again
Oooh
Surely this will never end
Oooh
If we are together again
Oooh
Surely this will never end
Oooh
If we are together again
Oooh
Surely this will never end
