U.K.R.I.P. LyricsDry as you are, crippled leaves, snipped at your prime no longer breathes
Your fragrance is faint to my nose, wish I could paint what no longer grows
Where you stood is a mystery to me, the dead carnation is all I see
I'm beginning to understand
I'm getting wiser every day
This country is not United and the Kingdom's past away
Shall we start all over again, I don't know, I don't know
Bleaching light of the moon, clears just streets into my room
The dark cloak of paranoia feels warm just to annoy you
Stop longing for how it used be, stop looking for how it's gonna be
I'm beginning to understand
I'm getting wiser every day
This country is not United and the Kingdom's past away
Shall we start all over again, I don't know, I don't know
The keys is timing, don't do what they want
No matter what you're revealing, don't do what they want
Don't get low , don't let go
X12 times
Don't get low, don't let go !
Don't get low, don't let go !
