Good Enough Lyrics
I've got an aching in my bones
I've been exposed to what I want to see
The fuse is burning somewhere
It's drenched in heat, it's where I long to be

There's always two sides, you don't have to suffer
If this is heaven, then send me to hell
So stay in the light, don't take your eyes from the prize
Hey, there goes the bell

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see
If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see

Sing a song as the sun does rise
If you don't ask questions and you don't know why
There's a bridge to the other side
Don't take your eyes from the prize

There's always two sides, you don't have to suffer
If this is heaven, then send me to hell
So stay in the light, don't take your eyes from the prize
Hey, there goes the bell
If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see
If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough it's true, it's what I want to see

There's always two sides, you don't have to suffer
If this is heaven, then send me to hell
So stay in the light, don't take your eyes from the prize
Hey, there goes the bell
You'd like me to buy you mind
The situation may you never find

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see
If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see
If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to seeEmbed
