One Of Those Rivers LyricsLet's not worry about, what we haven't got
And let's not choose the life, that will have the cost
As long as you and I can live happily
Then surely all I want is staring back at me
I'm so excited, now that you agree
That we're not perfect and I'm glad you see
That living for today
And whatever comes our way
And when you're not around I'll just think of you
And when I'm feeling down all that I can do
Is wipe away my tears, for you my dear
From the rooftops, I see houses, I see counties that board the sea
In the distance, foreign mountains, one of those rivers calling me
Mist all around, now there's nothing to see
I'm feeble from the pain that my life's gonna be
I'm leaving tomorrow for a good hotel
One with a view where I can sleep well
And when I'm lying down I'll just think of you
And wipe away my tears for you my dear
From the rooftops, I see houses, I see counties that board the sea
In the distance, foreign mountains, one of those rivers calling me
I'm trying to find the force that drives the flower
I'm trying to stay on course till my final hour
Maybe we can all glimpse eternity
But what do I care when there's you and me
And when you're not around all that I can do
And when I'm feeling down all that I can do
Is wipe away my tears for you my dear
From the rooftops, I see houses, I see counties that board the sea
In the distance, foreign mountains, one of those rivers calling me

It's not a cloudy day in sight
There's new horizons shining brightEmbed
