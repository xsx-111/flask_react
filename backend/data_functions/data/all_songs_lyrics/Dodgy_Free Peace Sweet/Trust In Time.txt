Trust In Time LyricsIf I gave you everything and told you what you wanted all of the time
If I took away your doubt and gave you no reasons then you could be mine
If we talk as openly as the skies then they never have to be any lies
And I will never talk down to you
Just look at all the rage and what we've neglected to trust in time
And we're taught in this world to do what we're expected well that's just fine
If we talk as openly as the skies then we'd never have to be any lies
And I will never talk down to ya
I'll never talk down to ya
Don't you ever promise me what you could never feel
Dishonesty will always make me talk down to ya
If we talk as openly as the skies then we'd never have to be any lies
If we hold on to some kind of truth then they'd never have to see any proof
And I will never talk down to ya
I'll never talk down to ya
I'll never talk down to ya
