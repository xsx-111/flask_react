Prey For Drinking LyricsI'm a traveler who's unwanted, I'm a dolphin in the sea
I'm a woman on a tube-train late at night, I'm the scenic scenery
I broaden my horizons, when I went down with the sun
I asked myself some questions, the outcome were not fun
I'm all the unwanted children, I'm the sparkle in mummies eyes
I'm old and forgot a lot bout love, I'm the tears that you cry
I'm the old and I'm the frail, I'm the young and ever free
I'm a leading politician who sucks with a brand new policy
I'm religious, prey for drinking
I'm a pope of all I've seen
Trying to survive to keep it alive
Welcome to the family !
I'm religious, prey for drinking
It's the pope we've always seen
I'm trying to survive working 9 to 5
Welcome to the family !
Yeahhe
I'm a traveler who's unwanted, I'm a dolphin in the sea
I'm a woman on a tube-train late at night, I'm the scenic scenery
I broaden my horizons, when I went down with the sun
I asked myself some questions, the outcome were not fun
I'm all the unwanted children, I'm the sparkle in mummies eyes
I'm old and forgot a lot bout love, I'm the tears that you cry
I'm the old and I'm the frail, I'm the young and ever free
I'm a leading politician who sucks with a cheeky policy
I broaden my horizons, when I went down with the sun
I asked myself some questions, the outcome were not fun
So it's good to be back, it's been so long
I've been away, I've been a fool
It took me some times to realise
That this place won't change
I'm religious, prey for drinking
I'm a pope of all I've seen
Trying to survive to keep it alive
Welcome to the family !
I'm religious, prey for drinking
It's the pope we've always seen
I'm trying to survive working 9 to 5
Welcome to the family !
Oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
