Jack The Lad LyricsThere's nothing left for you now except to hang out with the guys
Now everyone can fear you, no one dare look in your eyes
When trouble follows your every move, the description always fits your face
You'll have me sure gonna have to prove, the failure you'll have to take
And as the night goes on, the stories unfold
Tales of how many drinks you can hold
How many pigs it took to hold you down
And how many thieves it takes to steal the town
I can't be bothered with him, he's gonna treat me this way
I'm in the back seat and your never going my way
What does he have to treat me bad
There's no more chances for Jack The Lad
No one ever confronted you, you're never without a crowd
The thought had never cross your mind to do your mother proud
Mugging's your speciality on which you all have bailed
I do believe it's the reason, for this life you'd be even insane
And as the night goes on, the stories unfold
Tales of how many drinks you can hold
How many pigs it took to hold you down
And how many thieves it takes to steal the town
I can't be bothered with him, he's gonna treat me this way
I'm in the back seat and your never going my way
What does he have to treat me bad
I can't be bothered with him, he's gonna treat me this way
I'm in the back seat and your never going my way
What does he have to treat me bad
There's no more chances for Jack The LadEmbed
