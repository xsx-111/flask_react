Found You LyricsWe should know better
We should know why
Selling mother nature for a price
I'll be taking through a trouble some time
I see the end of the line through desperation
I keep on walking now I know this is mine
And I'll be just in time for celebration
I found you now I know that it's true
I was down and my love performed a lack of trying
You lift me up to a fresh piece of air
And I've never been there now I'm flying
We should know better said mother nature
We should know better, we should know why
She makes me right, she's unknowing
She never closes her eyes, she's inspiration
I couldn't get any better even if I try
I found you now I know that it's true
I was down and my love performed a lack of trying
You lift me up to a fresh piece of air
And I've never been there now I'm flying
We should know better
We should know why
Selling mother nature for a price
We should know better
We should know why
I search a sure life, I found how to call mine
I found you and now I'm certain
We should know better, we should know why
The lonely road to my horizon is stretching now in front of me
So worn my heart is, that's not so hard to take this exile away
Found you know I know that it's true
I was down on my love from a lack of trying
You lift me up to a fresh piece of air
And I've never been there and I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
We should know better
We should know why
Selling mother nature for a price
We should know better
Selling mother nature for a price
We should know better
We should know whyEmbed
