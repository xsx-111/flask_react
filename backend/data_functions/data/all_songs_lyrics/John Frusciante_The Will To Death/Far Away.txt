Far Away LyricsOoh away-ah
Ooh away-ah
Wo-oh
I can't disguise the things I do
And things I say have a way of hurting you
I'm over there
These dreams are all I have left
I've nothing to spare
They're all I have
Ooh away-ah
Ooh away-ah
I can't pretend to be who I'm not
And there are things you need from me
I haven't got
No way but to end
Pick up the pieces of our lives
And maybe love again
Yeah
There's only one way for things to be
Between you and me
There's only one way for things to be
Between you and me
There's only one way for things to be
Between you and meEmbed
