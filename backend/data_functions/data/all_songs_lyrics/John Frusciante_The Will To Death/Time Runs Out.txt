Time Runs Out Lyrics
I didn't lose you
In those fights I fought
I don't owe anyone
I've been sleeping all night
These times I recall

They come out
They come clean
I've been asleep
On top of myself
I was born in the morning
I died at night
I was found in a mirror, baby
They couldn't get me out
In these times time runs out
It runs out

Daydreams run along her
Feelings are goners
I've been sleeping
Once and for all
Mirrors are water
A symbol of what death's not
Catch my meaning
Once and for all
I'm the ceiling
I'm the wall
You can't stand inside with me
But the reverse of me is where you must be
In truths place is lies
The mistakes you try

Someone must be sleeping because all is quiet
Is there nothing in the mirror when you shut the light
The dark
The light
The dark
The lightEmbed
