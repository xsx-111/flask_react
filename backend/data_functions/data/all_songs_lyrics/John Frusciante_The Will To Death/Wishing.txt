Wishing LyricsDo you throw it in the well
Wishing you had someone to tell
What it was that you wished for
So it couldn't come true anymore
I have thrown so much away
These times die and stay alive
I have gone and I've stayed
And though both happened
At the same time
I know which one I like
And which one I hate
You never change to fire if you're ice
Even if you melt on a table and dry
And that table is burned
I'll tell you why
â€˜Cause you stayed by going away
And life changes not you
Life changes not you
Every time is contained in now
Now is the one time anything happens
Though one moments shot
In infinity's rounds
Now is the one time
Anything happens hereEmbed
