A Loop Lyrics
No one makes a loop around me
No one 'round here makes a decision
No one makes a loop around me

Everybody's trying to leave
Millions left this place before us
Now we all want to leave
Also

Restless angels fall on a slide
Leading to the doom that's before them
I have seen that feelings can't wait
To arise
Icicles are flames in this city
Everything is what it is not
Each thing diametrically opposed
To itself

I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
Ahh
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
Ooh
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
Ahhhh
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
Oooohhh
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
I can't wait for life
Aaaaaahhh
I can't waitEmbed
