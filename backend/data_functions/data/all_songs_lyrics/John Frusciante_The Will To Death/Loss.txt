Loss Lyrics
We make the music that divides you
It's handed down as a thing to cry to
And all my wars they treat you kindly
There's nothing more important that I see
There was a time when all was empty
Unorganized; a clog; a death scene
Things opened up and there's so many
Paths to walk; ports of entry

Now that I'm gone
Now that I'm long gone
This minute has come and gone
I never said to do anything but forget me
I can't be lost
I've learned everything from loss
For what's gained there's an inner cost
I won't pay it I never would

We left the seasons back in Long Town
There was a hint of sadness going round
We met the brothers who drove arrows
And shot assumptions wide and narrow
I know I mean what I'm forgetting
We give for everything we're getting
A lot that hasn't been put away
It's building up for that fateful someday
Now that I'm gone
Now that I'm long gone
This minute has come and gone
I never said to do anything but forget me
When it seems I'm around
Check again what's up and what's down
Many silences make a sound
I'm before the equation and I'm the answerEmbed
