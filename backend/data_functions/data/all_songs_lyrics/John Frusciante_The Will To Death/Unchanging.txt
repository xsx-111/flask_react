Unchanging Lyrics
And we will show that wherever you are
That is where all time starts
It's a pleasure to die
A pleasure to be gone
Into the sky we move on

Life is unchanging
It let me go
Life gave me up
And I have no control
I have no control

Everything goes a way that I do not
I clean up the clouds I ride
I've never been up where I see the others climb
Seems like it must be nice

Laughter's an ugly friend of mine
We share the best and worst of times
Everyone goes where they belong
Nobody goes elsewhere
Never much thought goes to being
Right or wrong
Right or wrongEmbed
