An Exercise Lyrics
Learning there's nothing to gain from advice
Hey doubt, come on around any time
Anyhow mistakes are what lead you through life
Down and out's only if you think up and in's right
I've gone along with the sins that are versions of you
But guidelines were all I had time to get through

It's like reading of love that's gone wrong
If time was laid out like that
Everything would occur at once
And all the laws were laid down twice
And the clouds were doubled in the sky
And being tall meant lacking height
And being wrong meant being right

You're perfect
You fit snuggly right in the lie
One host is going to teach how to die
Lay down
The darkness tonight is so bright
Reasons
There's one for each time cars collide
I hear that telling moments divide
And the only important moments
Are the in between times
And being confused is an exercise
I'm missing your thoughts tonight
But we reach out to what's out of our sightEmbed
