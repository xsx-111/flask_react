A Doubt Lyrics
Everyone speaks at the same time
Everyone wonders "Who am I?"
It'd be sad to blow through time
We never go through the sky
We never know when to die

Lean in to walk
We dreamed up tonight
Lean in to walk
We dreamed up tonight
We dreamed up tonight

We all choose to live life
We confuse how with why
Everyday is lost as it goes by
These moments don't compute
And I wind up next to you
And all that I need is a doubt
That's all one that feeds the mouth
One simple means is to leave it by the door
One time to play is the time you play for
And you never set a limit
Lean in to walk
There's nothing missing from life
Lean in to walk
There's nothing missing from life
There's nothing missing from life

Lean in to walk
There's nothing missing from life
Lean in to walk
We dreamed up tonight
We dreamed up tonight
Don't ever set a limitEmbed
