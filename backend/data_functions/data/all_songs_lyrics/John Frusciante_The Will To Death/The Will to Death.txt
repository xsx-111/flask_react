The Will to Death Lyrics
And they're thought to be lies, but we saw them, saw them
We looked right in their eyes, right at them, at them
Pinning space to the world, we slaughtered, slaughtered
Not a sound to be heard, we're awful, awful

And have you seen how they run out of gas?
They beat the pain, they sing in the rain
Endless and formless, they fly to the end
And back to the beginning again

Have you put them aside your crazy thoughts and dreams
No, they're a part of me and they all mean one thing
The will to death is what keeps me alive, it's one step away, step away
Limitations are set only then can we go all the way, all the way

And have you seen how the cars when they pass?
They come your way and then they're speeding away
Coming to you and then going away
But for them nothing changed, for them nothing changed
