Europa LyricsFinally I’m coming home
The satellites they guide me
Around your moon
They take me in
And I’m shouting out
They take me in
And onto your shores
They take me there
And I’m crying out
Crying out to satellites to take me
Cry and I’ll be saved - no way out
Cry and I’ll have known
No way to live my life
Another way
Europa lift me up and take me
The day of red light
Pulls me out
From behind the sun
And on to your moon
The day of red light marks my way
The day of red light marks my own
It takes me there and on to your shores
The day of red light - marks my way
Take me out of your thoughts
I am home to the sky
On my way to Europa
Looking down
Never to be the light of day to you
Just to Europa
Crying out for homeEmbed
