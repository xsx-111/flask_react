Au Pays Natal LyricsDescending
An orbit gone wrong
Europa rely
Europa will rely
The monolith is calling me
The monolith is calling me
Living on the ideal of
Borrowed time
Living on your own
The darkness of the light
The silence in between
I remember your eyes
And softness of the skin
Living on your own
Borrowed time
The monolith is calling me
The names of all the ones I loved
No time in space
No day or night to know
How long I’ve been away from your home
How long – I’ve drifted away - I’ve drifted away
An orbit gone wrong
The shell of a man
Has lost his form again
The shell of man
Forgotten form
An orbit gone wrong
Descending
An orbit gone wrong
Borrowed time
Can't show me
Monolith is calling
Descending, the names of
My own memories
This shell of a man has forgotten
His human form at last
Shell of a man forgotten
His human form again
Look to the sky for Mary
Bleed up to the light
Shell of a man forgotten
His human form at last
Shell of man
Forgotten human form
Your dream died today
Turn it around
Crumbling odds
You failed me
Turn it around
Crumbling down
You failed me
Shell of a man forgotten, bleed up to the light
Shell of a man forgotten his human form again
Shell of a man Europa - lift me up
Shell of man, turning over, your dream died today
Shell of man has forgotten human form - you failed me
Shell of man, forgotten human form
Shell of man, your dream died today
Shell of man forgotten
Shell of man. Living on borrowed timeEmbed
