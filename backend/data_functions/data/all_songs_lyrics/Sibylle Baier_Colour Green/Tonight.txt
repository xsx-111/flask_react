Tonight LyricsTonight, when I came home from work, hurt
Tonight, when I came home from work
There he, unforeseen
Sat in my kitchen, buttering himself a bread and the cat was on his knee and smiled at me
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
There he, unforseen
Passed the guitar and said I battered my car right now, won't you please give me your tune
We had change of the moon
We had change of the moon
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
There he, unforseen
Changed in an easy chair
And said what's that sorrow you bear and I could tell him he understood
He gently took my arm
He listened to my tears till dawn
I dedicate this song to you
Tonight
We had change of the moon
We had change of the moon
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, tonight
