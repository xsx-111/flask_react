Wim LyricsDo you know Wim?
He likes cities and I like him
Do you know Wim?
Oh, just go and take an inner city train
And play a game and you'll meet him
Wim
Do you know Wim?
He likes cities and I like him
Do you know Wim?
He likes cities, you'll find him
By the slot machines, realizing dreams
It seems a very outstanding mark
That he writes a color postcard
Twice a week, go and seek for him
Want to meet him
Wim
Do you know Wim?
He likes cities and I like him
Do you know Wim?
He likes cities and I like him
Do you know Wim?
Oh, just go and see a cinema show
In the first row and watch him cry, him
Wim
Sometimes he's not the same
Sometimes he takes a plane to Vienna
Maybe he's filled up with pain
Oh, it's a shame
That you don't know Wim
He likes cities and I like him
That you don't know Wim
He likes cities and I like him
Oh, I do know Wim
I do know Wim
He likes cities
I like himEmbed
