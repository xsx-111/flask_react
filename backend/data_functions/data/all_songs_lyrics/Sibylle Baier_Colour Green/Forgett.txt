Forgett Lyrics
Forgett came in my house yesterday
My house that's on decay
Where roof and tapestry is rotten
Where the fire place isn't getting hot
And everything's forgotten

Forgett came in my house yesterday
Don't know if he wanna stay
He lays him down like a child
In a garden that's run pretty wild
And we laugh at each other's smile

I understood in my life
That never anybody else could change one's drive
But you have to prove by your own heart and head
And though I know I'm not out of the woods yet
I feel so good

Forgett came in my house yesterday
My house that's not for sale
Since we had that sweet tea together
Since he sits in that leather sofa
Since we're together
Forgett came in my house yesterday
My house that's on decay
Where roof and tapestry is rotten
Where the fire place isn't getting hot
And everything's forgotten

Forgett came in my house yesterday2Embed
