Driving LyricsDriving to flight number 107
With you sitting by my side
First-class blue sky and a melody brand new
Almost makes me cry
Don't know why
Smile at your smile
Time is one past eleven
You're passing me a piece of apple pie
Oh, it almost makes us cry
Don't know why
Don't know why
Go make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
Make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
Driving to flight number 107
With you sitting by my side
Nine miles are not too long for a farewell with you
And I close my eyes
Hold you fast
And when you ask me "woman, don't be sad"
Oh, it really makes me cry
Don't know why
Don't know why
Go make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
Make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
Make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
Go make a signEmbed
