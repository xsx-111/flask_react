Girl LyricsWho knows the things?
The one who knows
What are you dreaming of?
Of opened breast
Girl, where did you stay so long?
Girl, where did you stay so long?
I feel strong
The answer she gave simply was
"I'll show you where the lilies grow at the banks of Italy"
There, you eased my mind
Girl
Girl
Girl, you were so kind at the banks of Italy
