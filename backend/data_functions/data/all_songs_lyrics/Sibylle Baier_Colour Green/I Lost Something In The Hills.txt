I Lost Something In The Hills LyricsEvery time I shed tears
In the last past years
When I pass through the hills
Oh, what images return
Oh, I yearn
For the roots of the woods
That origin of all my strong and strange moods
I lost something in the hills
I lost something in the hills
I grew up in declivities
Others grow up in cities
Where first love and soul takes rise
There where times in my life
When I felt mad and deprived
And only the slopes gave me hope
When I pass through the leg high grass, I shall die
Under the jasmine, I shall die
In the elder tree
I need not try to prepare for a new coming day
Where is it that fills the deepness I feel?
You will say I'm not Robin the Hood
But how could I hide from top to foot
That I lost something in the hills
I lost something in the hills
Oh, I lost something in the hills
Now I lean on my window sill
And I cry, though it's silly
And I'm dreaming of off and away
Oh, I know further west these hills exist
Marked by apple trees
Marked by a straight brook
That leads me wherever I want it to
Well I lost something in the hills
I lost something in the hills
Oh, I lost something in the hills10Embed
