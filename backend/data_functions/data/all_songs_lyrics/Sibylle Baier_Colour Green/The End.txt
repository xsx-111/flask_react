The End LyricsIt's the end
Friend of mine
It's the end
Friend of mine
Time is over
Where we could simply say "I love you"
Now you open the door
Leave me crying
Trying to embrace you again
Trying to face this damn situation
Man, I can't
It's the end
Friend of mine
It's the end
Sweet friend of mine
Dear friend, I cannot tell the reasons why
We started well, good time
Give me some wine when you open the door
You seem hurt, do try to speak a word to me
What on earth could really go wrong with you and me?
Yet, it's the end
Friend of mine
It's the end
Sweet friend of mine
Time seems to be over
Where we could simply say "I love you"
Now you open the door
I feel cold
Why can't I hold you in my arms?
Told you that life is short but love is old
It's the end
Friend of mine
It's the end
