Softly LyricsSoftly, in the wintertime
Softly, when we're about to dine
Softly, in my heart of mine, I talk to you
Has anybody of you two
Got half a mind to go to the zoo?
Tonight, won't you think we had fun?
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son, one by one
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son, one by one
Softly, in the wintertime
Softly, when it goes towards nine
Softly, in my heart of mine, I talk to you
Go feed the dog and cat, and then go
To bed and have your right own dream
Now be well off and start with the sun
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son, one by one
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son, one by one
Softly, in the wintertime
Softly, when day's gonna shine
Softly, in my heart of mine, I talk to you
About my actual favourite matter
That's how to live and laugh and feel better
I cut the bread for them and they run
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
Off and away, they set out for living
Love them if ever they come, wherever they're gone
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son, one by one
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son
My daughter, my son, one by one
