Colour Green LyricsI'd been a girl and one dream
Frequented my late afternoon
Saw me in New York City
Wearing a sweater colour green
So one night I sat down on a chair and knitted there
Hmmm
Years after trying to live a woman's life
Hmmm
I met a friend who had a red haired wife
She said to me, "Woman, I like your clothes."
"Come on and let us try both and take tender care
But when you need help I will be there."
Hmmm
Memories and seasons achieve their affairs
Sometime in April, the sweater I wear...
Sometime in April, a letter I wrote...
Dear friend I think of you on the top of Empire State
Hmmm
Dear friend I'm lonesome
Dear friend I've been well
How do you spell your name?
The city has changed me
I'm no longer the same
Wrote to me, "Woman, I'd like to stay
Liberty statue has got so many stairs
But when you need help, I will be there."
Hmmm
I'd been a girl and one dream
Frequented my late afternoon
Saw me in New York City
Wearing the sweater colour green2Embed
