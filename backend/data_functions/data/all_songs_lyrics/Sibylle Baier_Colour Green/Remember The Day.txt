Remember The Day LyricsRemember the day
When I left home to buy some food
Myself in that painful February mood
I did what I could
Remember that day
When I left home to just buy some food
Considering if one shouldn't die or if one should
Sun was high
And I found me on the road to Genoa
Did you ever drive in a moonstruck constitution?
And find to reach a seaport and down there is a solution
You should if you could
There slowly, slowly, I no longer thought of what is good or what is not
There simply was the water's smell and remoteness
I only stood and watched that old, cold ocean
In tender and bright, full, unspeakable emotion
I did what I could
All was good2Embed
