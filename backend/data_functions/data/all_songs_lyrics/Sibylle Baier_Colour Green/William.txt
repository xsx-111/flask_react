William LyricsWilliam was said to be a bad boy
Met him behind the leaf of a door
William was the saddest boy I ever saw
Talked to me
Talked to me
With his invisible tears
William was driving a dark blue car
At the moment but I'm sure he will change in a white one soon
Talk to me
Talk to me
Let us have a green one too
Promptly I took a fancy
For spending the rest of my days and nights with that boy
Talk to me
Talk to me
Let us have a brandy or two
Old as the hills are those
Who live and believe and believe
And those of pure heart and head
William must have a chorus in his heart and lilacs in his shoes
William is the sweetest boy I ever saw
Talk to me
Talk to me
Let us have a baby or two
Now that bad boy is away from me
But I don't mind that very much
Cause when he back again
Talk to me
Talk to me
Let us have another day or three1Embed
