Give Me A Smile LyricsGive me a smile
Close your eyes
Don't say a word
Give me a smile
And stay and weave me your part of tenderness
Give me a little smile while I lie by your side
Beyond words we rest
So leave the best unsaid
And give me your smile, for the while
May it guide us through the dark
Give me a little smile while you lie by my side
Beyond words we rest
So leave the best unsaid1Embed
