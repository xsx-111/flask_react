Forget About LyricsYou made me forget about
Have, want, exert
And all of a sudden, I feel proud
Of being, without saying a word
You made me forget about
Past and pain
Time, you washed out
Like a soft, sudden, summer rain
You do me good
You do me
So good, you made me forget about
Hmmm
You made me forget about
Have, want and exert
And all of a sudden, I found out
Oh, it's beautiful, the way you wear your shirt
You do me good, you made me forget about
