Milk Is My Sugar LyricsMilk is my sugar
Sweet grovelling
Thy shall convert me
My favourite sin
Meat makes it snappy
Snap back and thigh
Good work for pellow
I'm so alive
Milk is my sugar
It makes me happy
Milk is my sugar sweet(x8)
Watch me be naughty
So cruel for fun
Slick in the picture
Wait for the one
Not for your finger (no)
Slide ride too kind
(cause) milk is my sugar
Sweet nevermind
Milk is my sugar
It makes me happy
Milk is my sugar
