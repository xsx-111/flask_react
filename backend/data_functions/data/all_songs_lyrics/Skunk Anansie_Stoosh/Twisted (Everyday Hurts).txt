Twisted (Everyday Hurts) LyricsI cried on my blood day
There was nothing that I could hold on to
Just a line could have helped
Remind me of you, of you
I screamed till the blood came
I was living in a cloud of hope
Lover's kiss then they make a wish to the end
They pretend
'cause everyday hurts a little more
And everyday hurts a little more
And i'll do anything, yes i'll do anything
To belong to be strong
To say there's nothing wrong
Everyday hurts a little more
Yes everyday hurts a little more
And i'll be anything, yes i'll be anything
To belong to be strong
To say there's nothing wrong
Everyday hurts
Everyday hurts
Everyday hurts
I cried in the sunlight
Would I fake all the times I loved you
Just a play in a game I twisted with you, with you
I need to believe you
Sacrificed all the lies we made up
How we kissed
Then we made our wish to the end
To the end
(repeat chorus)
Time made me confide in you
So contrived were the words you sold me
Now nothing can swallow
The feeling so shallow inside
(repeat chorus)Embed
