All I Want LyricsAll I want is a mirror
So I can see this so
Called brighter day
I'm watching all the
World crawl back again
Watching how it blows
Itself away
That's all I want (x4)
All I want is destruction
Wanna see it crumble
Beneath my toes
Smell the way my sore
Eyes burn away
That's all I can have
Today
All you want is to be me
So you can screw me up
And don't give a damn
('cos I'm a) crazy
Little daisy too vile to
Breathe
I'm everything you want
