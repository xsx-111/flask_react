Brazen (Weep) LyricsI called you brazen
Called you whore right to your face
And watched you silently
And publicly disgraced
I didn't notice
When you strengthened like a vice
That you were trembling
And burned beneath the ice
Ooh, ooh
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
You said a prayer
And I betrayed you with a kiss
You never realized
That all had come to this
So keep your dignity
Don't throw it all to waste
Stronger feelings
Than you've ever learned to face
Ooh, ooh
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oooooh
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Oh why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Oooh
(Nah nah nah nah nah)
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Weep
