Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good) Lyrics
I hope you're feeling happy now
I see you feel no pain at all it seems
I wonder what you're doin' now
I wonder if you think of me at all
Do you still play the same moves now?
Or are those special moods for someone else?
I hope you're feeling happy now

Just because you feel good
It doesn't make you right, oh no
Just because you feel good
Still want you here tonight

Does laughter still discover you?
I see through all those smiles that look so right
Do you still have the same friends now
To smoke away your problems and your life?
Oh, how do you remember me
The one that made you laugh until you cried?
I hope you're feeling happy now

Just because you feel good
Doesn't make you right, oh no
Just because you feel good
Still want you here tonight, I want you

Oh no
Just because you feel good
Doesn't make you right, oh no
Just because you feel good
Still want you here tonight, I want you
Just because you feel good
Doesn't make you right, oh no
Just because you feel good
Still want you here tonight, I want you

I wonder what you're doing now
I hope you're feeling happy now
I wonder what you're doing now
I hope you're feeling happy nowEmbed
