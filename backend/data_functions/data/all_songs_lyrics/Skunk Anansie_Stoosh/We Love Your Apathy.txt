We Love Your Apathy LyricsThe sweeter the taste I love it
Eaten your gutted spine
All of your thoughts I have them
Spitting them out, sublime
(cos') I am the god of power
Political to the core
Governments Roll their heads out
The beast always wants some more
I love it, he loves it
We love your apathy
We crush your lame spirit
We love your apathy
Love-er-ly
I have the information
(that) keeps you from knowing me
I abuse you, as you watch me
And you always vote me in
The poorer you are the better
That gives me more control
Cos I am the brute that hates you
(and I'm) loving it to the bone
I love it, he loves it
We love your apathy
We crush your lame spirit
We love your apathy
Why don't you wait till you bleed
Why don't you wait for the cause
And I'll and I'll
And I'll and I will watch you
I'll wait, I'll wait, for you
I'll wait, I'll wait, for you
I love it, he loves it
We love your apathy
We crush your lame spirit
We love your apathy
(2x)
(why don't you wait)
I love it, he loves it
We love your apathy
(why don't you wait)
We crush your lame spirit
We love your apathy
(2x fadeout)Embed
