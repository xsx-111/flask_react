Infidelity (Only You) LyricsLost infidelity, we never
Said a word
So black and white you see
It's all the lies we've heard
In my mind nothing makes sense
I'm nothing you can't have
Cracked up to disagree, that's
All we've ever had
You, only you, only you
Only you can't be the one x2
Wanna copy/paste copy/paste
Your secret smile so quaint
In memories fortold
Laughing so viciously
Your concience has been sold
In my face there's no more joy
I'm all i should be
Cracked infidelity, is all you
Are to me
You, only you, only you
Only you can't be the one
Be the one x4
We don't talk anymore x2
We don't care anymore x2Embed
