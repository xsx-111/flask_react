Rattlesnake LyricsLet's go hang out in a mall
Or a morgue
A smorgasbord
Let's go hang out in a church
We'll go find lurch
Then we'll haul ass down through the abbey
Is it money, is it fame
What's in a name, shame?
Is it money, is it fame
Or were they always this lame?
It's a crazy, crazy mixed up town
But it's the rattlesnake I fear
In another place, in another time
I'd be drivin' trucks my dear, dear, dear
Let's go hang out in a bar
It's not too far
We'll take my car
We'll lay flowers at the grave of jesco white
The sinner's saint
The rack is full and so are we
Of laughing gas and ennui
It's a crazy, crazy mixed up town
But it's the rattlesnake I fear
In another place, in another time
I'd be drivin' trucks my dear
I'd be skinnin' hunted deer, deer, deer
(SOLO)
It's a crazy, crazy mixed up town
But it's the rattlesnake I fear
In another place, in another time
I'd be drivin' trucks my dear
I'd be skinnin' hunted deer, deer, deer, deerEmbed
