Ghost LyricsEverybody has a ghost
Everybody has a ghost who sings like you do
Yours is not like mine, it's alright, keep it up
Boy loses rib in New Orleans
He can't help eyein' up the whores
Under the bridge
Boy loses rib and lets a hellified cry into the dark
Where did I go wrong?
Where did I go wrong?
I never needed this before
I need a woman to help me feel
Everybody has the dream
Everybody has the dream
Like a world tattoo
Yours is not like mine, it's alright, keep it up
The scalped dives into the skin
Good doctors never leave a scar
No proof again
I'll take the myth, you take the blood
It's all the same to the world dreamer
It's all the same in the end
Where did I go wrong?
I never needed this before
I need a woman to help me feel
Feel, feel
(SOLO)
Everybody has a ghost
Everybody has a ghost who sings like you do
Yours is not like mine, it's alright, keep it up
Boy loses rib in New Orleans
He trades some ether for a chance
Under the bridge
Boy loses rib as he's summoned to the mud
Flat on his back
Cryin' where did I go wrong?
Where did I go wrong?
I never needed this before
I need a woman to help me feel
Feel, feel
Where did I go wrong?
I never needed this before
I need a woman to help me feel
Feel, feelEmbed
