Insomnia And The Hole In The Universe LyricsMy brother kicked his feet to sleep
My brother kicked his feet to sleep
My brother kicked his feet to sleep and I sang the dirge song
My brother never missed a beat
My brother kicked his feet to sleep
My brother kicked his feet to sleep and I sang the dirge song
My brother kicked his feet to sleep
My brother kicked his feet to sleep, sweet feet
My brother kicked his feet to sleep and I sang the dirge song
Angel, don't you have some bagels in my oven?
Lady, don't you know a man when you see one?
Crazy lady with the shiny shoes, where are you?
Kick your feet and calm the space that makes you hollow
Little swami's got his bowl to eat
Little swami always walks his beat, sweet feet
Little swami's got his bowl to eat and I sing the dirge song
It's amazing how they come to see
The little swami with his bowl to eat, sweet feet
The little swami only wears a sheet and won't sing the dirge song
Angel, don't you have some bagels in my oven?
Lady, don't you know a man when you see one?
Crazy lady now with the shiny shoes, where are you?
Kick your feet and calm the space that makes you hollow
Hollow, hollow
Anal, tight-assed soldier with that dogged heart
Put down your gun
We are ready to explode, we gotta take it smart and take it slow
(SOLO)
Angel, don't you have some bagels in my oven?
Lady, don't you know a man when you see one?
Crazy lady now with the shiny shoes, where are you?
Kick your feet and calm the space that makes you hollow
Angel, don't you...hollow
Angel, don't you...hollow
Angel, don't you...
Angel, don't you...Embed
