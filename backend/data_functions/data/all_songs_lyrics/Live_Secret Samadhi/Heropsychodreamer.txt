Heropsychodreamer LyricsI'll kill you in my dreams
I turn the other cheek during the day
I'll kill you all
The subculture of my dreams
Is waiting for me to fall asleep
I know you're scared, you should be
I know you' re scared
Hero
This attic of my mind
These feelings I can't hide
I can't share
I feel alone, ah yeah
The subconcious keeps me here
I fell in love with a balladeer
I saw your tongue, it licked my heart
They called you queer
Hero
Dreamer
Hero
They called you queer
They called you queer
They called you queer
They called you queerEmbed
