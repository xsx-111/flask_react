Unsheathed LyricsThe baby's not screaming enough
The singer's not singing enough
Ramana's not breathing, to us
Behold the unsheathing, it's love
The blade is not ready to cut
It's dull from our thinking, it's rough
Free love is a world I can't linger too long in
Free love was just another party for the hippies to ruin
Behold the unsheathing, it's love
Behold the unsheathing, it's love
Free love is a knife through the jugular vein son
Free love, I can't afford to add up what you fuckers are made of
Free love is a world we can't linger too long in
Free love was just another party for the hippies to ruinEmbed
