Merica LyricsLooks like america's dropped her load
She was ready to explode
I could not see her from up here
Cuz she was lyin' in the road
My head's in the ground
I can't make a sound
My head's in the ground
Looks like america's dropped her load
She tried to call me on the telephone
"everything is fine, now the baby's here!"
She'll have to handle this one on her own
My head's in the ground
I can't make a sound
The priests were all stoned
California was in my mind
And love was a game that we played
My head's in the ground
I can't make a sound
The priests were all stoned
The fact that you moaned
My head's in the ground (repeat)Embed
