Ghetto of My Mind LyricsSaving all my money all week long
So I can go out driving with you
Down on Hollywood Boulevard
On friday night, dressed right
I don't take no trouble smoke at the wall
But I still have that leopard-skin hat
That you gave me way back
Before it was cool
And they took it to school
Here in the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind
Y aqui, the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind
Hey we wild it up, wild it up
I like to dance with my rooner
Cuz when we dance I feel like
We are who we've meant to be
He puts his arms around me
I put my arms around him
And I feel satisfied and free
One night I tried my bandanna around his wrists
And we started to sway and it felt so good
And he said " looky here mamma, looky here
I think I better just see you
Safely out of the neighborhood"
That is to say
The ghetto
The ghetto of my mind
Y aqui, the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind
Hey we wild it up, wild it up
Outside my window the noise is all I've got
There are no stars in the sky
Just the sirens and queens
Breaking glass down in the parking lot
That's the world where I live
Sometimes I wonder, oh how can I go on ?
But I know that the world you make inside your head
That's the one you see around, that's what I said
And the one you see
Is the one you make
Inside of the ghetto
The ghetto of your mind
Y aqui, the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind
Hey we wild it up, wild it upEmbed
