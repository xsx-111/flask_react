Satellites Lyrics
Well we were born forever
We are twinned in a fugitive mind
Friends should stay together and
Light the world with the fugitive kind

So you keep talking in many languages
Telling us the way you feel
Don't stop confiding in the road you're on
Don't quit, you're walking satellites

I just saw you walking
Ice was reading fortunes in the moonlight
Things he could not tell you
You'll never read it more than you will tonight

So you keep talking in many languages
Telling us the way you feel
Don't stop confiding in the road you're on
Don't quit, you're walking satellites

Ah, walking satellites
Ah, she laughs satellites
Ah, a room filled with satellites
Ah, walking satellites
We were born forever
Tunneled into the fugitive night
Friends must stay together
Code the world with the fugitive light

I just saw you walking
Ice was reading fortunes by the moonlight
Casting runes on the rooftops and alleys
You'll never read it more than you will tonight

So you keep talking in many languages
Telling us the way you feel
Don't stop confiding in the road you're on
Don't quit, you're walking satellites

Ah, walking satellites
Ah, she laughs satellites
Ah, a room filled with satellites
Ah, walking satellites
Walking satellites
Satellites
Walking satellites
Ah
Ah
Ah
