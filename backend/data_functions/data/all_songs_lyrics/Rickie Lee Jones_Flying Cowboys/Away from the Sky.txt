Away from the Sky LyricsFor all that it cost him
He never did complain
The chicken-headed man
Feathering the rain
But the last bus is tired
And everybody's gone
The horses are waiting
In the middle of the lawn
Gone for the rodeo
Gone from the tundra, gal
It's after the fair
Is it bleeding out of you?
"Come into my trailer
We'll toast a little bread
Oh look, you've left a hole
Where you laid on my bed"
He said
But you keep what you can keep
When you dive into the deep
There's year after frozen year
That's where I saved you there
Oh, away from the sky X4
But everybody's gone now
It's after the fair
And the horses are painted
With the waiting of the lawn
You turn the carousel on
When th elights have closed down
And watch your ponies run
Through the middle of town
So there ya go, little gal, there ya go
Gone from the tundra now
It's after the fair
That's where I ...
Over the fences again
And the vacuums in the hall
And the planes up in the air
That's where I hear you best
Oh, away from the sky X4Embed
