Rodeo Girl LyricsOut on the range
The quiet, endless still
Where the wild S.S.I
Whispers from these hills
It's a petrified forest
Trailer parks and fords
And there ain't no goin' back
Rodeo girl
Saddle up
There's no more credit in this bank
Try your luck
Up in the East
Down in the West
Hold on tight
To the pony that you love the best
There's a medicine at the gate
And a number on your back
And this world is all jacked up like a cadillac
Painted by a rodeo girl
There's a medicine at the gate
And a number on your back
And this world is all jacked up like a cadillac
Painted by a rodeo girl
Rodeo girl, rodeo girl
Count all the boxcars
The blue and white stars
That fall for ya rodeo girl
You're lost in the desert
And it's too hot to think
You gotta know about the milk truck
If you want a drink
And when the cowboy's sing
Bobby sands and the bear
You can wet your lips
In the cool pools of despair
Up in the East
Down in the West
Hold on tight
Now you gotta be better than the best
There's a medicine at the gate
And a number on your back
This world is all jacked up like a cadillac
Painted by a rodeo girl
There's a medicine at the gate
And a number on your back
This world is all jacked up like a cadillac
Painted by a rodeo girl
