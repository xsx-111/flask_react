Ghost Train LyricsWell I decided to take the bus
It was about 6:05
Cuz I could hardly walk
In fact, I was just barely alive
Under the bridges and over the street
Now every shadow that I meet
They all know my name
And they whisper
" What's a matter hon
Don't you know you're riding on the ghost train"
Jupiter Ray on the bus
I remember when Jupiter came to town
He was one of the best of us
Oh, that stuff can really take you down
Hey, Jupiter Ray is on the bus
I remember when Jupiter was alive
Come to think of it
You all have a strange translucence in your eyes
What's a matter son?
Don't you know you're riding on the ghost train
You just buy your ticket
And get on board
This train don't stop
Cuz we like to ride, ride ride ride
We just wanna ride, ride ride ride
Ding goes the trolley
Bang goes the bell
Somebody call my second cousin
I'm not feeling very well
This is where little blondes check-in their furs
This is where little blondes check-in their hat
Don't worry about where you were at
We took care of that
Mr Driver is this my stop ?
Mr Driver tell me how to get off
Any way you can, any way
Come back into the light
You wanna get to heaven
Take the devil by the hand
And you slide right into the promised land
Cuz this could be the night
And this could be the gate
Everybody's waitin' for you darlin'
So don't be late
What's a matter honey ?
Didn't you pay your money for the ghost train ?
Well I decided to take the bus
It was about 6:05
Cuz I could hardly walk
In fact, I was just barely aliveEmbed
