I Was Born to Love You Lyrics
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day (Day, day, day, day, day)
Alright, hey-hey!

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity, ah
I'd kill for your love

So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me
An amazing feeling
Coming through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life

I want to love you
I love every little thing about you
I want to love you, love you, love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) Yes, I was born to love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) To love you
Every single day, day, day, day, day of my life


An amazing feeling
Coming through
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life, yeah
I was born to love you
Every single day (Day, day) of my life

Go, Woo, I love you babe (Hey!)
(Born to love you)
Yes, I was born to love you, Hey!
I want to love you
Love you, love you
I want to love you, hey, yeah!
(Ha ha ha ha ha, it's magic!)
(What? Ha ha ha ha)
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
I want to love you (It's magic!)
(Love you, love you)
Yeah, give it to me8Embed
