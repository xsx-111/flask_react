Let Me Live Lyrics
Three, four

Take a peace of my heart
Ooh ooh, take a piece of my soul
(Ooh, ooh) Let me live
Oh yeah

Why don't you take
Another little piece of my heart?
Why don't you take it
And break it and tear it all apart?
All I do is give, all you do is take
Baby, why don't you
Give me a brand new start?

So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand new start

Why don't you take
Another little piece of my soul?
Why don't you shape it
And shake it 'til you're really in control?
All you do is take, all I do is give
All that I'm askin' is a chance to live
(So let me live) so let me live
(Leave me alone) let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me
Make a brand new start

And it's a (long hard struggle)
But you can always depend on me
And if you're (ever in trouble) hey!
You know where I will be

Why don't you take
Another little piece of my life?
Why don't you twist it
And turn it and cut it like a knife?
All you do is live, all I do is die
Why can't we just
Be friends, stop livin' a lie?

So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby
(Why don't you give a little love?)

(Go for it, baby)

Let me live
Please let me live
Oh yeah baby, let me live
And make a brand new start

In your heart, oh baby
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Please let me live
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Oh, why don't you
Take another piece
(Take another piece of my heart)

Oh yeah baby
Make a brand new start
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Baby, Baby
All you do is take
(Let me live) Ooh ooh, let me live
(Oh yeah, yeah) Let me live5Embed
