Too Much Love Will Kill You Lyrics
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home and I've been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh, I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you if you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster, 'cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Ooh, how would it be if you were standing in my shoes?
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Oh, yes!

Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy, you're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time


Yes, too much love will kill you, it'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you and you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul, but here it comes again
Too much love will kill you

In the end
