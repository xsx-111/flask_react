My Life Has Been Saved Lyrics
This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we go, telling lies
Here we go (here we go)


We're right back
Where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray, hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page, oh
Oh Lord, I thank you for my
My life has been saved
My life, my life has been saved
My life, my life
My life has been saved2Embed
