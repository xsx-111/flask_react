Suicide Blonde LyricsAnd there is no world wrapping me up
I've got a view from the valley
Living well but we're dying young
To bankrupt a blue sky
I saw the post office from the book
On my way to the west side
Going broke but I'm feeling good
I brought my girl to keep me with it
She's a suicide blonde
Dyed by her own hand
Suicide blonde
She's part of the big plan
Got a job at the DMV
And a call from my father
Got my news from the CNN
Like sheep to the slaughter
Watched the planes landing from the roof
Of my tree house in Burbank
Had that dream I was taking off
I brought my girl to keep me with it
She's a suicide blonde
Dyed by her own hand
Suicide blonde
She's part of the big plan
I've got a girl
Got a girl
Got a girl to keep me with it
She's a suicide blonde
Dyed by her own hand
Suicide blonde
She's part of the big planEmbed
