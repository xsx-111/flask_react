Annie, Use Your Telescope LyricsIt started feeling like October
I got stranded on the road
You know where to find me
Anytime you want me Annie
Annie, use your telescope
So they made my life into a movie
As if I could forget those years
But I know where the time's gone
Just how well my mind's been wandering
Annie, use your telescope
Telescope
Annie, use your telescope
When it's late, don't stop looking
Where my eyes turn to glass
When it's late, don't stop
Annie, I will make it
Hello? Is there anybody out there?
Hello? I'm only getting farther, oh
It started feeling like October
Annie, use your telescope
Telescope
When it's late, don't stop looking
(Annie, use your telescope)
Where my eyes turn to glass
When it's late, don't stop
(Annie, use your telescope)
Annie, I will make it back
When it's late, don't stop looking
(Annie, use your telescope)
Where my eyes turn to glass
When it's late, don't stop
Annie, I will make it
(your telescope)
Annie, I will make it
(your telescope)
Annie, I will make it
Annie, I will make it1Embed
