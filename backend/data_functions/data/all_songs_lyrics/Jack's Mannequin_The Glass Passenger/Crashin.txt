Crashin Lyrics
I wanna hear some music
Now that they're driving us all underground
Not the radio music, or their satellite singing this
In this town, in this town

I wanna hear some music
And with the rock stars all flicker and fade
Power radio music, I'm a ghost overground
On, on parade

And even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no one listening
And even if I find the strength to stand
Doesn't mean I won't go missing
And the world will come
Crashing

I wanna hear some music
I have been waiting down here for so long
Trying to write this big music
With your breath on my face
But now, now you're gone
And even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no one listening
And even if I find the strength to stand
Doesn't mean I won't go missing
And the world will come
Crashing

And the whole world comes
Down, down-wards
And all the water on this broken town
The freeway's just like veins without a heart
And the world just comes
Crashing
And the whole world comes
Crashing

And even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no one listening
And even if I find the strength to stand
Doesn't mean I won't go on
And even if your voice comes back again
Maybe there'll be no one listening
And even if you find the strength to stand
It doesn't mean you won't go missing

And the world will come
Crashing
And the words will come
Crashing
And the music comes
Crashing
Down on me
Down on me
And the words will come
Crashing
And the words will come
Crashing
Down on me
So down on me...Embed
