Hammer And Strings (A Lullaby) LyricsThese hammers and strings been following me around
From a box filled garage to the dark punk rock clubs
Of 1000 American towns
And my friend calls me up
She says, how have you been? I say dear I've been well
Yeah, the money's coming but I miss you like hell
I still hear you in this old piano, yeah
She says Andy I know that we don't talk as much
But I still hear your ghost in these old punk rock clubs
Come on, write me a song, give me something to trust
Just promise you won't let it be, just the keys that you touch
Give me something to believe in, a breath from the breathing
So write it down, I don't think that I'll close my eyes
'Cause lately I'm not dreaming so what's the point in sleeping?
It's just that at night I've got nowhere to hide
So I write you a lullaby, a lullaby
These hammers and strings been following me around
Behind passenger vans through the snow, dirt and sands
Of 1000 American towns
And my friend calls me up with her heart heavy still
She says Andy the doctor's prescribed me the pills
But I know I'm not crazy, I just lost my will
So why am I, why am I taking them still?
I need something to believe in, a breath from the breathing
So write it down, I don't think that I'll close my eyes
'Cause lately I'm not dreaming so what's the point in sleeping?
It's just that at night I've got nowhere to hide
To the sleepless this is my reply, I will write you a lullaby, a lullaby
Give me something to believe in
So write it down, I don't think that I'll close my eyes
'Cause lately I'm not dreaming so what's the point in sleeping?
It's just that at night I've got nowhere to hide
To the sleepless this is my reply I'll write you a lullaby
A lullaby, a lullaby, a lullabyEmbed
