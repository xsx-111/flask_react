The Resolution Lyrics
There's a lot that I don't know
There's a lot that I'm still learning
When I think I'm letting go
I find my body it's still burning
And you hold me down
And you've got me living in the past
Come on and pick me up
Somebody clear the wreckage from the blast

I'm alive
But I don't need a witness
To know that I survive
I'm not looking for forgiveness
Yeah I just need light
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution

And the bars are finally closed
So I tried living in the moment
'Till the moment it just froze
And I felt sick and so alone
I could hear the sound
Of your voice still ringing in my ear
I'm going underground
But you'll find me anywhere I fear
I'm alive
But I don't need a witness
To know that I survive
I'm not looking for forgiveness
Yeah I just need light
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution

It's a long road back from hell
Some stories I will never tell
Annie I'm almost home
And you hold me down
Yeah you hold me down

I'm alive
But I don't need a witness
To know that I survive
I'm not looking for forgiveness
Yeah I just need light
I need light in the dark as I search for the resolution1Embed
