Orphans LyricsI'm looking for a sign
My spirits faded
She holds on like a vine
Patterns and traffic
That sound just like my heart racing the dark
In time to catch you
No one should let you
Go wandering off into the night
You're not an orphan
I keep waiting for my breath
To come back never
So take what I have left
Patterns and traffic
That pulse just like my heart racing the dark
In time to catch you
No one should let you
Go wandering off into the night
You're not an orphan
Right there to catch you
I won't forget you
But now you wander into the night
But you're no orphan
You're not an orphan
I never thought the day would come
They tell me that you've finally run
I guess you always said you would somedayEmbed
