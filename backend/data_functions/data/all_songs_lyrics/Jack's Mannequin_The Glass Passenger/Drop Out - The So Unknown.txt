Drop Out - The So Unknown LyricsI will give you this confession
I am taking you with me
Where we can contemplate our chemistry
And your eyes were lined with questions
With the blood rushing the waves
To take this feeling with us
To our graves
I get the feeling we're so misdirected
I get the feeling we have lost control
Tune in I'll turn you to the new religion
We're dropping out into the so unknown
And we won't wake up on Sunday
So I'm building us a church
Where we can sleep in
With the gods at work
And our friends will write us letters
They'll never understand why we don't call
We're hiding out until the empire falls
Let it fall
I get the feeling we're so misdirected
I get the feeling we have lost control
Tune in I'll turn you to the new religion
We're dropping out into the so unknown
If we have lost control
We're drifting slow into the so unknown
If we have lost control
We're drifting slow until we drop out
And I'll give you this confession
I am taking you with me
I get the feeling we're so misdirected
I get the feeling we have lost control
Tune in I'll turn you to the new religion
We're dropping out into the so unknown
I get the feeling we got disconnected
I get the feeling we have lost control
Tune in I'll turn you to the new religion
We're dropping out into the so unknownEmbed
