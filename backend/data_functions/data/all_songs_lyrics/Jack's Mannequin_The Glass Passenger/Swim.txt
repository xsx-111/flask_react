Swim Lyrics
You gotta swim, swim for your life
Swim for the music that saves you
When you're not so sure you'll survive
You gotta swim and swim when it hurts
The whole world is watching
You haven't come this far to fall off the earth

The currents will pull you away from your love
Just keep your head above

I found a tidal wave begging to tear down the dawn
Memories like bullets, they fired at me from a gun
Crack in the armor, yeah
I swim for brighter days despite the absence of sun
Choking on saltwater
I'm not giving in, I swim

You gotta swim through nights that won't end
Swim for your families, your lovers, your sisters
And brothers, and friends
Yeah, you gotta swim through wars without cause
Swim for the lost politicians
Who don't see their greed as a flaw
The currents will pull us away from our love
Just keep your head above

I found a tidal wave begging to tear down the dawn
Memories like bullets, they fired at me from a gun
Crack in the armor, yeah
I swim for brighter days despite the absence of sun
Choking on saltwater
I'm not giving in
But I'm not giving in, I swim

You gotta swim, swim in the dark
There's no shame in drifting
Feel the tide shifting and wait for the spark
Yeah, you gotta swim, don't let yourself sink
Just find the horizon
I promise you, it's not as far as you think
The currents will drag us away from our love
Just keep your head above

Just keep your head above, swim
Just keep your head above, swim, swim
Just keep your head above, swim2Embed
