Spinning LyricsI'm keeping quiet till there's no more sirens
Lately it's hard to keep the hinges on
With all the noise
I'll find my words when there is no one talking
The room is spinning I have got no choice
Be patient I am getting to the point
I can't remember when the earth turned slowly
So I just wait here with the lights turned out again
I lost my place but I can't stop this story
I'll find my way but until then I'm only spinning
I'm keeping quiet till the phone stops ringing
Lately it's hard to disconnect
I just want something real
I'll find my words if I can just stop thinking
The room is spinning I have got no choice
Be patient I am getting to the point
I can't remember when the earth turned slowly
So I just wait here with the lights turned out again
I lost my place but I can't stop this story
I'll find my way but until then I'm only spinning
Spin beneath the rooftop
Hold on
Wait until the room stops
Spinning
I can't remember when the earth turned slowly
So I just wait here with the lights turned out again
I lost my place but I can't stop this story
I'll find my way but in the end we're only
I keep forgetting when the earth turned slowly
So I just wait until the lights come on again
I lost my place but I can't stop this story
I'll find my way but until then I'm only spinning1Embed
