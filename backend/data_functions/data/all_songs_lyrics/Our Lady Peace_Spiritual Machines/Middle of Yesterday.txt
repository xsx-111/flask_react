Middle of Yesterday LyricsYou feel the love
You feel the past
It's all the things you thought you had
Oh, well I woke up in hell today
I woke up depressed and drained
But that's okay 'cause
I promised not to hurt you again
And apparently I'm to blame
But apparently I've been framed
By a memory that won't help
Me when it's happening
Out of the mind
Out of the soul
Out of the light
Out of control

Standing in the middle of yesterday
Where it all went wrong
Where we made mistakes
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say
But it won't be long
And it will be okay
Hey....
Well I promised you I would change
I'm an asshole and I'm ashamed
I'm upset 'cause I betrayed everything that you gave
Will you ever let me explain
Can I beg you to let me stay
Don't quit me 'cause
I'll never let this happen....
Out of the mind
Out of the soul
Out of the light
Out of control
Standing in the middle of yesterday
Where it all went wrong
Where we made mistakes
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say
But it won't be long
And it will be okay
You feel the love
You feel the past
It's all the things you thought you had
You feel the love
You feel the past
It's all the things you thought you had
All the things you thought you had
Chorus x2
Oh, i'm gonna make it up to you
Make it up to you
Make it up to you, oh oh
Make it up to you
Make it up to you
Make it up to you, oh ohEmbed
