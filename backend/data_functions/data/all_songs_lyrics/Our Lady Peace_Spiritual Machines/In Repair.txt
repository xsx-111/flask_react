In Repair LyricsWell it's good to know that you'll be okay
I've been waiting for this
And I'll be there to sit while you pray
No one's blaming me
I'm not supposed to wait
When they open up your heart
Oh I-
I have been good
I understood
Like a machine, I'll fix you
From the start
I'm in repair
The life that we share
I know that
I'll be lost in
But we're always in repair
Lock the door, lock the door
Lock the door, lock the door
Lock the door, lock the door
And it's good to know that you'll drive away
From this car crash nightmare
And I'll be there to help you again
And there's no danger
We're just killing time again
Until they order up new parts
Oh I-
I have been good
I understood
Like a machine, I'll fix you
From the start
I'm in repair
The life that we share
I know that
I'll be lost in
But we're always in repair
Take this time to figure it out
Know the wire, the fuse, the things that you doubt
The wheels, the air, the metal, the mouth
Something, something, something
Oh I-
I have been good
I understood
Like a machine, I'll fix you
From the start
I'm in repair
The life that we share
I know that
I'll be lost in
Oh I-
I have been good
I understood
Like a machine, I'll fix you
From the start
I'm in repair
The life that we share
I know that
I'll be lost in
But we're always in repair
Lock the door, lock the door
Lock the door, lock the door
Lock the door, lock the doorEmbed
