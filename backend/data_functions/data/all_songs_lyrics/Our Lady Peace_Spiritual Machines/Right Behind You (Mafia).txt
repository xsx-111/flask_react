Right Behind You (Mafia) LyricsYou, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
You haven't seen the world outside for days
You sleep, you hope
You wait
Imagination disappears
And all the dreams you have, you save
Confrontation like a mirror
They try to take your mind away
Hey, hey
I don't know, but I believe in yesterday
And what it means to bleed
And know that you're okay
Are you waiting?
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
Bombarded by the atmosphere
You breathe, you choke, you breathe again
Conversation disappears
You realize they're not all your friends
The panic of the future rears
You dig, you jerk
You find another way
Hey, hey
I don't know, but I believe in yesterday
And what it means to bleed
And know that you're okay
Are you waiting?
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
You opened up my veins, now I don't feel the same
No, no, no
You opened up my brain, now I won't be replaced
No, no, no
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what
I'm always right there behind youEmbed
