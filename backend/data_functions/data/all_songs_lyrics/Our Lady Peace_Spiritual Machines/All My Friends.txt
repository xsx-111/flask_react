All My Friends LyricsAll my friends alone on a hill
They're just looking down with violent
Minds out on loan
They're just not equipped
Insistence we
Hope for the best
We're not making sense
In silence
Wait for the day
When they're better than
In this silence
I'm not buying but
You're not faking
I'm not
I guess we better hold on again
This time
We won't understand again
I'm not waiting for some sense
This time
We won't understand again
I'm not waiting for..
Still they sit alone on a hill
Their mechanical thoughts
Have left them out on their own
They're not buying thisEmbed
