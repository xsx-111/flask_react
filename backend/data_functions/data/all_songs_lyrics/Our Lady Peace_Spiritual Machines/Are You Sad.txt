Are You Sad LyricsYour life has seemed so hard
It's been dried up angels that can't keep guard
And I'm trying to reach your hand, but
I'm on fire - I never planned to
Fade...away. Stay with me
Oh, just stop pretending
When they say you're nothing
Are you sad?
Are you holding yourself?
Are you locked in your room?
You shouldn't be
Are you sad?
Are you holding yourself?
Are you locked in your room?
You shouldn't be
I'm drowning inside your head, help
Me to answer, help understand, why
It's been so long since we talked
Like friends, oh please forgive
Me, i'm just a man
Who's made
Mistakes
Wait... for me
Just stop pretending
When they say you're nothing
Are you sad?
Are you holding yourself?
Are you locked in your room?
You shouldn't be
Are you sad?
Are you holding yourself?
Are you locked in your room?
You shouldn't be!
Oh oh ohhh (x7)
Are you sad?
Are you holding yourself?
Are you locked in your room?
You shouldn't be...Embed
