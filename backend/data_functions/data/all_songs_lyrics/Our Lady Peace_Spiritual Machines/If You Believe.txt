If You Believe LyricsSo, you made up your mind
You're tired of trying
Time to be scared
And oh you wanted to fly
You can't close your eyes
Time to beware
But if you believe in the world I'm calling
And if you belong in the world I saw
And if you believe in the world I'm calling
You'd be strong
So you wasted your time
You willed it goodbye
Time to be scared
And oh you thought you could buy
Your last peace of mind
Time to beware
But if you believe in the world I'm calling
If you belong in the world I saw
If you believe in the world I'm calling
You'll feel strong
If you believe in the world I'm calling
If you belong in the world I saw
If you believe in the world I'm calling
You'd be strong
And if you believe in the world I'm calling
If you belong in the world I know
If you believe in the world I'm calling
You'd be strong
If you believe in the world I'm calling
If you belong in the world I know
If you believe in the world I'm calling
World I'm calling oh oh
If you believe in the world I'm calling
If you belong in the world I know
If you believe in the world I'm calling
You'd be strong
If you believe in the world I'm calling
If you belong in the world I saw
If you believe in the world I'm calling
You'd be strong
If you believe in the world I'm calling
If you believeEmbed
