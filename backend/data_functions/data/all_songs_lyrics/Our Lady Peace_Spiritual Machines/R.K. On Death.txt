R.K. On Death LyricsTake death for example:
A great deal of our effort goes into avoiding it
We make extraordinary efforts to delay it
And often consider it's intrusion a tragic event
Yet, we find it hard to live without it
Death gives meaning to our lives
It gives importance and value to time
Time would become meaningless if there were too much of it
If death were indefinitely put off, the human psyche would end up...
Well, like the gambler in the Twilight Zone episodeEmbed
