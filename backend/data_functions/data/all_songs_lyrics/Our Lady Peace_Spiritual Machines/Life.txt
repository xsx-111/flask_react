Life LyricsHow many times have you been pushed around?
Is anybody there?
Does anybody care?
And how many times have your friends let you down?
Is anybody there
Did anybody stare?
Oh
And how many times have your friends let you down?
Just open up your heart
Just open up your mind
And how many times has your faith slipped away?
Well is anybody safe?
Does anybody pray?
Oh life is waiting for you
It's all messed up but we're alive
Oh life is waiting for you
It's all messed up but we'll survive
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, (2X)
And how many days have you just slept away?
Is everybody high?
Is everyone afraid?
And how many times have you wished you were strong?
Have they ever seen your heart?
Have they ever seen your pain?
Oh life is waiting for you
It's all messed up but we're alive
Oh life is waiting for you
It's all messed up but we'll survive
She gets high, she gets lost
She gets drowned by the cost
Twice a day, every week
And all of her life
She gets high, she gets lost
She gets drowned by the cost
Twice a day, every week
And all of her life
Life is waiting for you
It's all messed up but we're alive
Oh life is waiting for you
It's all messed up but we'll survive
Oh life is waiting for you
It's all messed up but we're alive
Oh life is waiting for you, oh
It's all messed up but we're alive
It's all messed up but we'll survive
It's all messed up but we're alive
It's all messed up but I will, I will survive...Embed
