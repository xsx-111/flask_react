Made To Heal LyricsI gave up on you
And your exercise
And the world that I knew
Then
I fell back on you
Cause I need more time
And I need an excuse
I'm a thief, a liar, an angel in the fire
I'm a king, a drug, the push that comes to shove
I'm a freak, a star, I'm everything you are
I'm your Jesus, I'm your pride
Made to heal
We're made to heal
We're made to heal
We're made to heal
I depend on you
For the wings of life
And the air that you move
And
I defended you
For this one last time
And the nerves you abuse
I'm a thief, a liar, an angel in the fire
I'm a king, a drug, the push that comes to shove
I'm a freak, a star, I'm everything you are
I'm your Jesus, I'm your pride
Made to heal
We're made to heal
We're made to heal
We're made to heal
You opened up my way
I'm alone in bed
You're old enough to say
I'm a thief, a liar, an angel in the fire
I'm a king, a drug, the push that comes to shove
I'm a freak, a star, I'm everything you are
I'm your Jesus, Jesus...
Made to heal
We're made to heal
We're made to heal
We're made to healEmbed
