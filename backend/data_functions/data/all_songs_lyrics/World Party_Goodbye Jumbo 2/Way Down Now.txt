Way Down Now LyricsInside my TV eye
Never stop to wonder why I'm
Way down now
I'm way down now
Some faceless get on the screen
The most honest man I've ever seen
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
Won't you show me something true today
C'mon and show me anything but this
She took us by the hand
Hell was the promised land I'm
Way down now I'm
I'm way down now
I'm lying by the road
Because she cut off all my clothes
I'm way down now
Way down now
Won't you show me something true today
C'mon and show me anything but this
Inside my future eye
What I see just makes me cry
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
The clocks will all run backwards
All the sheep will have two heads
And Thursday night and Friday
Will be on Tuesday night instead
And all lthe times will keep on changing
And the movement will increase
There's something about the living babe
That sends me off my feet
There's breeding in the sewers
And the rats are on their way
They're clouding up the images of perfect day
And I know I'm not alone
And I know I'm not alone
And I know I'm not alone
Anything but this
Can you hear me I said
Inside my TV eye
I never stop to wonder why
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
Then some faceless get comes on my screen
The most honest man I've ever seen
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
Something new! Something true!
