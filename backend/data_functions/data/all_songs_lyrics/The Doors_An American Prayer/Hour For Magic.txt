Hour For Magic LyricsResident mockery
Give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight and velvet hour
We of arabic pleasure's breed
We of sundome and the night
Give us a creed
To believe
A night of Lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
Hundred hues
A rich Mandala
For me and you
And for your silky
Pillowed house
A head, wisdom
And a bed
Troubled decree
Resilent mockery
Has claimed thee
We used to believe
In the good old days
We still receive
In little ways
The Things of Kindness
And unsporting brow
Forget and allowEmbed
