Breathe LyricsBreathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!
Corporate corpses with self-served denial
The raping of the land
Collapse
The lungs malfunction
They never learned to breathe
Breathe!
Rusted syringes and half-life disposals
A burial at sea
Waste water graveyard
Swimming in disease
Breathe!
This is the world
It's not working
This is deserved
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Children gasping the second-hand air
Dance of desperation
We cut through toxic lies with truth
We breathe
Breathe!
This is the world
The clock's ticking
Is this deserved?
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Hope springs eternal but where's the conviction?
Action mistaken for lip service paid
All this concern is the true contradiction
The world is insane
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!
This is the world
If there's no future
Is this deserved?
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!...
(Hope springs eternal...)2Embed
