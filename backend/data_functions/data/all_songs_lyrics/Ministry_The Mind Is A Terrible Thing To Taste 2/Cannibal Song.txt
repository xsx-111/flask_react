Cannibal Song LyricsDehumanize
Lobotomize
Thrown into a cell
Swallow your pride
In an infant mind
Thrown into a cell
A punishment fit
For a crippled mind
Don't do that to me
Criminals, subordinates, all laughing at me
Life is hell
Forever fighting
A deficient mind
We're all left alone and poisoned
A sickening trap
A sight worth seeing
Dehumanize
Lobotomize
Thrown into a cell
Swallow your pride
In an infant mind
(The mind is a labyrinth)
Don't do that to me
Don't do that to me
Force-fed from birth
Time frozen, fearfully
You know what I said
Hideous in strength
Thrown into a cell
A punishment fit
For a crippled mindEmbed
