Never Believe LyricsIs anybody here?
Is everybody here?
The service is about to begin!
I make my servant by fires insidious
Instead of the laughter, there's the last of the separated jewels
I'll make dust of the whole damned wall
I'll make hovels for all the worms
I left off my hands to save these idiot bastards
Bastards!
Me and cellmate have lost again for ever
The sun shines and I breathe 'my father...'
I want so much to remove your past
And deliver your neurotic flesh from evil
Grab this giant's hand
Grab this giant's hand
Grab this giant's hand
Grab this giant's hand
But I'm only allowed to touch what I know
And all that I know are hypocrites
Liars and witches who burned in the name of human fear
You will never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
We haven't much time left
Evening will come
And with it the equivalent
Of devil's animals
With fear to come
They ask of us favors we cannot fulfill
They ask, curse at us, and we smile
Caught in conviction
A crowd of senseless individuals
Will go further than both love and greed
As the clear salvation -- the future is here!
You will never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe
Never believe...Embed
