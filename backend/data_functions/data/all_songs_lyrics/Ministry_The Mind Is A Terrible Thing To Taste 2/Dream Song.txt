Dream Song Lyrics
When you're, dreaming you're alive

The dreams are back, once more and infinite. And our thin reasoning gives way to ground. This has always been
There I was over me, as I ran for cover, with lines forming in. But I was already there

Oh I had this dream one night I was like, I was lying on my   stupid futon couch foldout bed. And ummm, it was like really hot, like it just started summer, and it was really hot and I had like no fan or anything. I was lying there and I had this weirdest, weirdest, weirdest like nightmare. I had this nightmare where they're like, they're like dreams but they're not dreams they're like real, ya know? They're like, you feel as though you're alive when you're dreaming, you think you're alive when you're dreaming. I had this dream where this angel was coming up, like up my fire escape cause I don't have bars on my windows cause I don't believe in bars on windows. And she was there in my room, lying there and she came and she kissed me and I woke up and I must've come
Do you believe in angels?
