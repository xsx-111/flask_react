So What Lyrics(You have had all that money can give you, but that wasn't enough. You became a thrill seeker.)
(Thrill seeker... thrill seeker... thrill seeker... thrill seeker...)
(Kill for a thrill)
(Assassin)
(This thrill-seeking became the one great thing in your life, piling on thrill on another until... the murder. Kill for the love of killing.)
(Kill me.)
(Kill for a thrill. The thrill-seeker comes from all walks of life... comes from the home... the home where the parents are too busy to train their children respect.)
(Respect) x11
(¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué!)
Scum sucking depravity debauched!
Anal fuck-fest, thrill Olympics
Savage, scourge, supply and sanctify
So what? (So what?) So what? (So what?)
So what? (So what?) So what? (So what?)
(¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué!)
(Thrill-seeker. Kill for a thrill.)
(Assassin)

(Assassin)
(¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué!)
You said it!
Sedatives supplied become laxatives
My eyes shit out lies
I only kill to know I'm alive
So what? (So what?) So what? (So what?)
So what? (So what?) So what? (So what?)
(¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué!)
(Kill for a thrill.)
(Assassin)
(Some people think newspapers exaggarate juvenile crime, or that it's confined mostly to large cities. Juvenile deliquencies on the rise... thus apparent something has gone wrong with the environment. Adults create the world children live in. Juvenile delinquency is always rooted in adult delinquency, and in this process parents play the key role. When children grow up among adults who refuse to recognize anything that is fine or good or worthy of respect...)
(¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué! ¡Qué!)
So what, it's your problem to learn to live with
Destroy us, or make us saints
We don't care, it's not our fault that we were born too late
A screaming headache on the brow of the state
Killing time is appropriate
To make a mess and fuck all the rest, we say, we say
So what? (So what?) So what? (So what?)
So what? (So what?) So what?
(¡Qué!)
(Respect, respect)
(Kill for a thrill.)
(Assassin, assassin)
(Assassin, assassin)
(Assassin, assassin)

(¡Qué!)
Now I know what is right
I'll kill them all if I like
I'm a timebomb inside
No one listens to reason
It's too late and I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!
(So what?) (So what?) I'm ready to fight!2Embed
