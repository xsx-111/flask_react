Deeper Underground Lyrics
You know they gonna bring it down, yeah
They gonna wreck it down, yeah

Something's come to rock me
And I can't keep my head
I get nervous in the New York City streets
Where my legacy treads
I know I'm better off standing in the shadows
Far from humans with guns
But now it's too late, there's no escape
From what they have done
Come on!

I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town
I'm going deeper underground
(There's too much panic in this town)

Well I got to go deeper
Got to go much deeper
They gonna wreck it down, yeah
They gonna bring it down
Some people with a pocket full of money
And an eye full of hate
Take a pleasure in destruction of the very thing
That they tried to create
Somebody tell me why does all mankind
Only tamper and touch?
Have a habit where they
Bite off more than they can chew
And now it's too much


I'm going
I'm going
I'm going deeper underground (x4)


I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town
I'm going deeper underground
I'm going deeper underground
I'm going deeper underground
I'm going deeper underground
They're gonna bring it down, yeahEmbed
