Black Capricorn Day Lyrics
Hey, hey, ah-hah-hah-hah, baby
Hey, hey, let the rain come down on me
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

I see people and they're craving blood
And I'm so rarely understood
But I don't know what they want from me
It's gonna take some time just to let them see

I'm going through a black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though you wanna check me out
I'm not the man to
Play, play, play, play

Hey, hey
Don't you see I'm the not the man to play
Hey, hey
No way you can play with me today
Hey, hey
Just let me sing to ya, Capricorn day
Hey, hey
My heart is a pincer, and the sky is black
And I can feel cold steel, when I turn my back
It stings like needles, with a jagged tongue
You know, this rain reminds me of when I was so young
I never had any of those

Black (hey)
Capricorn days
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though you wanna check me out
I'm not the man to
Play, play, play, play

It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black
I'm stuck on the highway leading straight to hell
Like any other drifter with a soul to sell
You know I'm dealing with the devil in everyone I meet
And their faces tell a story that life is so sweet

And I'm going through a black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though you wanna check me out
I'm not the man to
Play, play, play, play
No, no, no
Black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way, got to get this way
Black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though you wanna check me out
Wanna check me out
I'm not the man to play
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me, it's just too black for me
