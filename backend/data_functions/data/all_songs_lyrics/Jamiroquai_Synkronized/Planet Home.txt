Planet Home Lyrics
You know, there's no place like Planet Home
Nowhere else I'd rather be
It's the only place I know
Where you can witness tragedy
But there's no time to wonder now
About who is right or wrong
Gonna need some help to get things straight
So come on, bring your voice along
Cause sure enough

There's no place like Planet Home
I wanna go there
If only we could make it right
Planet Home
I wanna go there

This blue sphere of shattered dreams
Is heading for destruction
Illusions drip from every seam
It's just death, war and corruption
I heard there was a promised land
On Planet Home
2000 years have been and gone
But still we don't know
Can't you see that
There's no place like Planet Home
I wanna go there
If only we could make it right
Planet Home
I wanna go there
(I wanna go there, baby)
Find yourselves some peace on
Planet Home
I wanna go there
Anything's in reach on
Planet Home
Planet Home

Woo! No place like it!
Planet Home is blue and green, beautiful for you to see (x3)
Planet Home is blue and green
I wanna go there (x2)
(Planet Home)
I wanna go there...
(Planet Home)

There's no place like Planet Home
I wanna go there
If only we could make it right
Planet Home
I wanna go there (Hey, I really wanna go now)
Find yourselves some peace on
Planet Home
I wanna go there
(I wanna go there, baby)
Anything's in reach on
(You know that anything's in reach on...)
Planet Home
I wanna go thereEmbed
