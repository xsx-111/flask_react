Where Do We Go From Here? LyricsThat's the way love goes
Well, it change you inside out
And then it flows
To the places unfamiliar, yeah
Let me tell, I'm hot for you
You're so hot for me, so get on, girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm hot for you, you're hot for me
So get on, I wanna get it on with you
I'm sendin' you a message
I hope you got the sense to read between the lines
You know that on the back it says that
For me you never seem to find the time
Come on, I've waited for your phone calls
But you must be uptown havin' fun
And when you do that thing you do, I get so exited too
But you never think to ask me if I wanna come with you
So honey, where do we go from here?
You know, baby
I've been tryin' to find out
But I'm still some way from knowin'
You know I am, come on
It's not exactly clear, no, no
The love you should be givin' me
Is the love you're rarely showin'
That's the way love goes, that's the way
That's the way it goes for me and you
Come on, let me tell you now
I feel you're pushin' me out
Soon I'm gonna lose my patience, girl
I can't understand what you're about
'Cause there's no communication
Oh, you say you love to love me, love to love me
But you always keep your distance
So honey, strike me off your list
If your love comes with a twist
'Cause I want the part that lingered
On my lips when we first kissed
Say do you love me, if you do
Tell me somethin' and make it true
Do you love me I need to know
Now, baby can't you tell me where we're gonna go?
Where do we go from here
I've been trying to find out
But I'm still some way from knowin'
Hey, it's not exactly clear, no, no
The love you should be givin' me
But the love you're never showin'
Now that's the, that's the way love goes, yeah
And where it's takin' us
Well, we don't know, we don't know
So lets move straight on ahead
And tow in the line between us, girl
I think I'd sooner make this love dead
Than waste all my time on you, yeah
I'm wastin' all my time
I'm gonna learn, learn, learn
That's the way love goes, that's the way
It's gonna hurt me so bad but I won't let it show
I get the feelin' that it's gonna
Tear out my mind till I can no longer breath
I know I'm gonna learn, learn, learn
That's the way love goes
Where do we go from here?
I've been tryin' to find out
But I'm still some way from knowin'
Hey, it's not exactly clear
The love you should be giving me
But the love you're never showin'
Hey, but that's the way love goes, yeah
You know that, that's the way love goes
I'm so hot for you, I'm so hot for you
Honey, I'm so hot for youEmbed
