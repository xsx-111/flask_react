Butterfly LyricsLittle butterfly, come back to me

Everything that I want
Is written on your face
(I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it)
So take me where you want to
It's your love that I chase
(I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it)
Now you got something so beautiful
(I want it, I want it)
And the way you move me baby
It's like no other girl

I feel like I'm a butterfly in June
So colour in my wings, and let me hold your hand
I could be the sun and you could be my moon
But all you ever say is catch me if you can
Feel like a butterfly
Searching in the summer sky
A perfect love's so hard to find, yeah, yeah
Little butterfly, come back to me (x4)
Honey
You're pushing a condition
And I don't mind
(I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it)
I think you're my addiction
But that's alright
(I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it)
That's alright
You got to slow down
I can't keep up with you
(I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it)
And all the other butterflies
They don't love like we do
(I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it)

I feel like I'm a butterfly in June
So colour in my wings, and let me hold your hand
I could be the sun and you could be my moon
But all you ever say is catch me if you can
Feel like a butterfly
Searching in the summer sky
A perfect love's so hard to find
Little butterfly, come back to me (x4)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (x2)
Oh, little butterflyEmbed
