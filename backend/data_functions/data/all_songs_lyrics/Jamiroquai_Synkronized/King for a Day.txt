King for a Day Lyrics
There's no way
I'm coming back to you
I just stopped to say
That everything we did is through
You tried to undermine
The better ranges of my nature
But soon you're going to find
You should have started talking straighter

Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry, babe
To see you go to ground

Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I hope you're happy that way

There's no hope
For peace and reconciliation
You're quick to play your hand
But what you haven't learnt is patience
So look before you leap
To tell the world your coloured story
It's clear your talk is cheap
Do anything to get your glories
So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
You're so sure inside, you've got something to
Shout about

Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

And there's no love
Ever to be lost between us
I guess this is because
The damage you've done is so grievous
So I hang my head
To dwell on what might have been
But what you left instead
Pieces of a broken dream

Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry, babe
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
You're so sure inside, you've got something to
Something to shout about

Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

Don't you see that
You're only king for a day
You must believe that...1Embed
