Soul Education Lyrics
I didn't have no time for school
Spent my days breaking the rules and regulations
And in between me having fun
All the teachers told me, "Son, get an education"
So I held my badge of freedom
Dressed like a man fit for all seasons, hey
I'm stepping out, so cut me loose
And as Mama waved goodbye
Tears were welling in her eyes, but she don't need them
I turned to her and said

Got my soul education
You know it's stitched into the clothes that I wear
Got my life information
Upon the breeze that's blowing through my hair
Got a pocketful of rainbows, oh
And a sky to put them in, so blue
So let the music come and save you
I've found a god that I can pray to
Deep inside my soul
Hey!
See you're mind you can pollute
But there's no substitute for intuition, there's no superstition
So if you find you're petrified
To let some natural law apply
Then there's a whole lot missing, baby, yeah
See, I know I'm blessed celestially
Got a direct link with destiny, yeah
Don't ask me why, I'm in the sky
And if there's green wax in your eyes
Something money just can't buy
Hey, rags to riches, babes to bitches
Brother, I don't mind, cause I got my

Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do (x3)

I know I've got my soul education
You know that it's stitched into the clothes that I wear
I've got my life information
Upon the wind that's blowing through my hair
I know I've got a pocketful of rainbows, hey, hey
And a sky to put them in, so blue
So let that music come and save you, yeah
I know I've found a god that I can pray to
And it's deep inside my soul

I've got my soul education
You know that it's stitched into the clothes that I wear
I've got my life information
Hey, upon the breeze that's blowing through my hair
I know I've got a pocketful of rainbows
And a sky to put them in, so blue
So let that music come and save you
I know I've found a god, I know I've found a god that I, I know I've found a god that I can pray to, yeah
Just let that music come and save you
I know I've found a god, I know I've found a god I can pray to, hey
Let that music come and save you1Embed
