Falling Lyrics
Sometimes in the morning
When I wake up I shed a tear
I'm hopin' come the night time
You'll open the door and reappear

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racin' when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or am I waiting in vain?
Somebody help me 'cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You, you, you're the one, for your love
I think that I would do anything
Yeah, you, you, you, you
You're the one, for your love
I think that I would do anything

I miss you, I wanna kiss you
The sweet scent of roses is in your hair
See sometimes when I get lonely
I still feel you beside me when you're not there
I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racin' when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or am I waiting in vain?
Somebody help me 'cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You, you, you're the one, for your love
I think that I would do anything
Yeah, you, you, you, you, you
You are the one, for your love
I think that I would do anything
You're the one for your love
I think that I would do anything, you know, yeah
You, you, you're the one and for your love
I think that I, I think that I would do anything

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racin' when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or am I waiting in vain?
Somebody help me 'cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again
Help me, oh can't you help me?
I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in love with youEmbed
