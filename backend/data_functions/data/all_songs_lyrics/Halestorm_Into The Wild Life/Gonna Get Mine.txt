Gonna Get Mine Lyrics
Naked pictures on my telephone
All my secrets that you weren't supposed to know
That I sleep just fine every single night
'Cause I got a filthy that you will never find

And everybody wants to know what I got going on below
And everybody wants to see, but they'll never get all of me

Na na nananana
I get what I want and I’m gonna get mine
Na na nananana
I get what I want and I’m gonna get mine
I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine, I'ma get
I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine

Uninvited to my fantasy
So get the fuck out of my legacy
I'm pleadin' guilty
And my fate's been sent
And if I had to do it all over
I’d do it, do it, do it, do it again
Na na nananana
I get what I want and I’m gonna get mine
Na na nananana
Yeah yeah I’m doing just fine
I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine, I'ma get
I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine, I'ma get
I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine, I'ma get
I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine, I'ma get

And everybody wants to know what I got going on below
And everybody wants to see, but they'll never get all of me

Na na nananana, I get what I want and I’m gonna get mine
Na na nananana, I get what I want and I’m gonna get mine
Na na nananana, I get what I want and I’m gonna get mine
Na na nananana, I get what I want and I’m gonna get mineEmbed
