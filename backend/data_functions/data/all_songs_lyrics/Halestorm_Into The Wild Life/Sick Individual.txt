Sick Individual Lyrics
Do you think, that you know, what I am, but you don't
'Cause I say, what you can't, and I do, what you won't
I like it loud, wear it proud like a crown upon my head
I'll always be this way till the day that I'm dead

'Cause I'm a sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called whatever the fuck I want, want, want
I'm unusual
Ain't taking no shit, gonna drink this sip till I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called whatever the fuck I want

Would you, like to know, what I'd do if I got you alone
Would I sigh, would I beg, would I bleed, would I sulk
I don't talk the talk 'cause I walk the walk and I shake it for you just like this
Singing la da da da la da da da da
Singing kiss, I need a list

'Cause I'm a sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called whatever the fuck I want, want, want
I'm unusual
Ain't taking no shit, gonna drink this sip till I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called whatever the fuck I want
So come a little bit closer, baby
'Cause I'm wanting you
So what are you gonna do?
Come a little bit closer, honey
Gonna have my way with you
You

'Cause I'm a sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called whatever the fuck I want, want, want
I'm unusual
Ain't taking no shit, gonna drink this sip till I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called whatever the fuck I want, want, want

Oh yeah yeah
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
I'm livin' it up, not giving a what
Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called whatever the fuck I wantEmbed
