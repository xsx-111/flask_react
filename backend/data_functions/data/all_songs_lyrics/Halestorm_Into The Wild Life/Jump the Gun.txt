Jump the Gun Lyrics
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

Boot on the start line, pistol in the air
'Quila in the glass and a cold, dead stare
Two minutes in baby, make your move
If you won't do it, I'll do it for you
I ain't waitin' on you, no
I ain't waitin' for you

I jump the gun
Oh here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, I wasn't looking for a friend
Now we’re kissing under covers and it's all just because I jumped the gun

Whoa whoa whoa whoa

Checkers on the flag, time to pay the tab
Hoppin' in a cab, it's time to be bad
Cigarette smoke, lipstick on your face
My place or yours, I’m good either way
Oh, babe, my meter's runnin'
Oh, baby, are you coming?
I jump the gun
Oh here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun I wasn't looking for a friend
Now we’re kissing under covers and it's all just because
I jump the gun
Oh here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun I wasn't looking for a friend
Now we're kissing under covers and it’s all just because I jumped the gun

Whoa whoa whoa whoa (I jumped the gun)

(One, two, three)
Woke up in the morning, pounding in my head
Three empty bottles, no sheets on the bed
Baby rolled over and this is what he said
He said: “Babe I think I love you”

Oh, I jump the gun
Oh here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, I wasn't looking for a friend
Now we’re kissing under covers and it's all just because I
Jumped the gun
Oh, here I go again
I'm the one
Don't know when to say when
Here for fun, I wasn't looking for a friend
Now we're kissing under covers and it's all just because
I couldn't keep in my pocket
Lit the fuse to the rocket
And I'm sinnin' while I'm winnin'
That's the end and the beginning
And we'll see the rising sun
Because I jumped the gun
Whoa whoa
I jumped the gun
Whoa whoa
Boot on the start line, pistol in the air
'Quila in the glass, oh here I go againEmbed
