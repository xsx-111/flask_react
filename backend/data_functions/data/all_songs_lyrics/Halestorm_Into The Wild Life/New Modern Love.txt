New Modern Love Lyrics
I've got a forbidden love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up
I've got a new modern love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up

I won't pretend that I don't feel the way I feel
I can't forget the taste of something that's real
Step into my closet and maybe you'll find
Something that'll scare you
Something that you like
Your old familiar logic is poison on your lips
There's nothing in the water
That's just the way it is

I've got a forbidden love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up
I've got an uncommon love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up
I don't care if you don't want it
'Cause I, I, I got it
I don't care if you don't get it
'Cause I, I still want it
I've got a new modern love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up, no
You can't rewire these circuits any other way
Yeah, you can twist the signal
The message is the same
Step out of your bubble and
Maybe you will find
Something that'll save you
Something that you like
Your old familiar logic is poison on your lips
There's nothing in the water
It's just the way it is

I've got a forbidden love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up
I've got an uncommon love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up
I don't care if you don't want it
'Cause I, I, I got it
I don't care if you don't get it
'Cause I, I still want it
I've got a new modern love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up, no
Step into my closet and maybe you'll find
Something that'll scare you
Something that you like
There's something that you like
There's something that you like

I don't care if you don't want it
'Cause I, I got it
I don't care if you don't get it
'Cause I, I still want it
I've got a new modern love
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up, no

Not giving it up
Not giving it up, no
I'm not giving it up
Not giving it up, no2Embed
