Mayhem Lyrics
I'm so bored with
This world that spins around me
Used to make me dizzy
And I'm so tired of these boys that hang around me
Used to drive me crazy

A little mayhem never hurt anyone
When I'm gonna get some?
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
Where I'm gonna get some?
A little mayhem never hurt anyone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?

Cruel intentions
Winds me in a spiral
I'm waiting to unravel
Twisted motives
Lock me in a circle
I'm dying to untangle

A little mayhem never hurt anyone
When I'm gonna get some?
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
Where I'm gonna get some?
A little mayhem never hurt anyone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?
I wanna feel the chaos
I wanna hear the uproar
A little pandemonium
I know I'm not the only one
I wanna be thrown away
I wanna feel the wall shake
I wanna feel the wall shake
I wanna feel the wall shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, oh

One, two, three, four, oh
Looking for some mayhem
Need a little mayhem
Oh, need a little mayhem
Looking for some mayhem
Looking for some mayhem
Yeah
Yeah
Need a little mayhem
Want to hear some mayhem
YeahEmbed
