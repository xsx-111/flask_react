Unapologetic Lyrics
Whiskey
Give it to me straight
Straight and strong
We’ll drink until it’s gone
Dirty
I got a dirty mouth
Say what I want to say
Can’t wash it away

Well I’m high steppin’ out of the box
Getting out of the cage, I’m busting the lock
Oh yeah, oh-oh
I’m not scared, I ain’t trying to be
Won’t give nothing less than all of me
Oh-oh, Oh yeah

Because I’m unapologetic
Unapologetic with you tonight
Nothing to hide
Oh yeah, I'm unapologetic
Unapologetic, turn on the light
All of the lights
And I’ll take you as you are
And we’ll burn like the stars
Give me, give me something real
Don’t play no games, no masquerade
‘Cause it’s last call, it’s closing time
I think I’m gonna let you read my mind
Oh yeah, yeah, every little piece of me

Because I’m unapologetic
Unapologetic with you tonight
Nothing to hide
Oh yeah, I'm unapologetic
Unapologetic, turn on the light
All of the lights
And I’ll take you as you are
We're burning like the stars, oh

I’ll give you every piece of me
I’ll give you every piece of you
Babe, there’s nothing you can say
To make me throw it all away
I won’t give nothing less of me
Nothing less than all of me

Because I’m unapologetic
Unapologetic with you tonight
Nothing to hide
Oh yeah, I'm unapologetic
Unapologetic, turn on the light
All of the lights
And I’ll take you as you are
We're burning like the stars
I’ll take you as you are
We’re burning like the stars
Oh yeah1Embed
