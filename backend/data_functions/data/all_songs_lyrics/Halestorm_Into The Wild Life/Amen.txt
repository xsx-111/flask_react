Amen Lyrics
Can I get a
Uh-ho
Can I get a
Uh-ho
Can I get a
Uh-ho
Can I get a

A fire's gotta burn
The world is gonna turn
A rain has gotta fall
Fate is gonna call
But I just keep on breathing
Long as my heart is beating

Someone's gotta hate
It's never gonna change
Gets harder every day (Uh-ho)
It's a hell of a place
To keep your heart from freezing (Uh-ho)
To keep yourself believing

But I won't run
I'm not afraid
I'll look 'em in the eye
Gonna hear me say
It's
My life, my love
My sex, my drug, my lust
My god it ain't no sin
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
My grace, my church
My pain, my tears, my hurt
My god, I'll say it again
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?

Life has gotta kill
Faith is gonna blind
Hope is gonna fade
The truth is gonna lie
Sometimes there's no reason
To justify the meaning

But I won't run
I'm not ashamed
It's gonna take more than this for me to break
My life, my love
My sex, my drug, my lust
My god it ain't no sin
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
My grace, my church
My pain, my tears, my hurt
My god, I'll say it again
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?

My life, my love, my sex, my drug
My lust

My life, my love
My sex, my drug, my lust
My god it ain't no sin
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
My grace, my church
My pain, my tears, my hurt
My god, I'll say it again
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?
Yeah yeah yeah
Can I get an Amen?
Can I get an
Can I get an Amen?3Embed
