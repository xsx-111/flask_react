Dear Daughter Lyrics
Dear daughter
Hold your head up high
There's a world outside that's passing by
Dear daughter
Never lose yourself
Remember that you're like nobody else

Life throws you into the unknown
And you feel like you're out there all alone

These are words that every girl should have a chance to hear
There will be love, there will be pain
There will be hope, there will be fear
And through it all, year after year
Stand or fall I will be right here for you

Dear daughter
Don't worry about those stupid girls
If they try to bring you down
It's cause they're scared and insecure
Dear daughter
Don't change for any man
Even if he promises the stars
And takes you by the hand
Life throws you into the unknown
And you feel like you're out there all alone

These are words that every girl should have a chance to hear
There will be love, there will be pain
There will be hope, there will be fear
And through it all, year after year
Stand or fall I will be right here for you

Dear daughter
I was just like you
And just like me you're gonna make it through

These are words that every girl should have a chance to hear
There will be love, there will be pain
There will be hope, there will be fear
And through it all, year after year
Stand or fall I will be right here
And after all I will be be right here for you2Embed
