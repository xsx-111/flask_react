Scream Lyrics
Seeds in my head
Visions in red
All that I dreamed
And all that I’ve bled
My mind is a gun
I won’t be outdone
Say what you want
While I shoot for the sun

All you doubters and haters, actors, and fakers
I don’t have time for you, woah
You’re feeding the fire that’s taking me higher
Coming like a cannonball

Oh, it’s kicking down your door
Kicking down your door
Oh, so what you waiting for
What you waiting for
Scream
Scream
Scream
Till they hear your
Scream
Step out of the haze
Sleep walkers awake
The pills that they give
You don’t have to take
Don’t want to see light
They cover our eyes
Yesterday’s dead
Tomorrow’s alive

All you movers and shakers
Freaks and hell raisers
We’re climbing over your walls
You’re feeding the fire that’s taking us higher
Coming like a cannonball

Oh, it’s kicking down your door
Kicking down your door
So what you waiting for
What you waiting for
Scream
Scream
Scream
Till they hear your
Scream
Scream
Scream
Till they hear your
Scream
Oh, it’s kicking down your door
Kicking down your door
So what you waiting for
What you waiting for
Scream
Scream
Scream
Till they hear your
Scream
Scream
Scream
Till they hear your
