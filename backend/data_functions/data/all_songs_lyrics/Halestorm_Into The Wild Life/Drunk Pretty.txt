Drunk Pretty Lyrics
I woke up looking like a walk of shame
Pillowcase covered in red lip stain
Bottom of the barrel, beauty queen
Caught like a cat, caught like a cat
Caught like a cat in a fishnet dream

Hungover and underdressed
You love the way that I'm unimpressed
I'm a perfect ten, but I'm coming down
You're seeing double 'cause I'm a knockout

(Drunk pretty!) A touch too much
(Drunk pretty!) Such a lovely lush
(Drunk pretty!) Don't you wish you were mine
Never looked so fine, fine, fine

Don't ask me to walk a straight line
The morning after is where I shine, where I shine
A crooked smile with a quick dial
I run like mascara, but I do it in style
But I do it in style
Hungover and underdressed
You love the way that I'm unimpressed
I'm a perfect ten, but I'm coming down
You're seeing double 'cause I'm a knockout

(Drunk pretty) A touch too much
(Drunk pretty) Such a lovely lush
(Drunk pretty) Don't you wish you were mine
Never looked so fine, fine, fine

Fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine

(Drunk pretty) A touch too much
(Drunk pretty) Such a lovely lush
(Drunk pretty) Don't you wish you were mine
(Drunk pretty) I never looked so fine

(Drunk pretty) A touch too much
(Drunk pretty) Such a lovely lush
(Drunk pretty) Don't you wish you were mine
Never looked so fine, fine
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
FineEmbed
