The Reckoning Lyrics
Cross my heart, broke your promise, told me lies
Why did you
Watch me suffer, make me feel like I deserved to
Everybody takes, everybody breaks somebody's heart, leaving someone alone
But this felt more like you ripping flesh from bone
You made a mess out of me
Where do I begin?
You'll pay for your sins

Like a reckoning
You never saw it coming
I'm the reaper outside your door
You took everything made me feel less than nothing
I'm getting what I came for
Like the sound of falling stars crashing in the dark
I said a prayer and buried your name
And up through the ashes I rose like wildfire

The reckoning

I gave you more than my heart could hope for
You misused it
Scraped up every piece that fell to the floor
When you tore through it
Laying me to ruin
You knew what you were doing
Leaving me to skin and bone
But trusting you was no one's fault but my own
You get what you give
So take your last breath
'fore I lay you to rest
Like a reckoning
You never saw it coming
I'm the reaper outside your door
You took everything made me feel less than nothing
I'm getting what I came for
Like the sound of falling stars crashing in the dark
I said a prayer and buried your name
And up through the ashes I rose like wildfire

I should have known better than that
I should have known all along
I should have known better than that
I should have known
But now I'm moving on

Like a reckoning
You never saw it coming
I'm the reaper outside your door
You took everything made me feel less than nothing
I'm getting what I came for
Like the sound of falling stars crashing in the dark
I said a prayer and buried your name
And up through the ashes I rose like wildfire
The reckoning
You never saw it coming
You never saw me coming
The reckoning
I'm the reaper outside your door
I am the reckoning
For every wrong you did to me
I am the reckoning1Embed
