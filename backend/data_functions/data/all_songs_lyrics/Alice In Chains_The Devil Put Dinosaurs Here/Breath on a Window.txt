Breath on a Window Lyrics
Mended fence along the road
Barely holding together
Mapless zone the road signs hold
Keep ahead of the weather
Long past time to close dead eyes
Find a break in the highway
Out here I'm invisible
Very few going my way

Breath on a window
Showing tic-tac-toe
Rear view reflecting
There ain't nobody home

Ghost town strip of misery
I ain't feeling no better
Road kill heart inside of me
Follow it to the letter
Sundown brings a welcome change
Everything that's hiding
More at home in landscapes strange
Are you selling? I'm buying
Breath on a window
Showing tic-tac-toe
Rear view reflecting
There ain't nobody home
Cigarette burn holes
Outline an old soul
Connect the dot scribbling
And you would never know

Failed to heed the signal
Thought you got through just in time
Crashing hard upon your ego
Penetrated from the side

I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday4Embed
