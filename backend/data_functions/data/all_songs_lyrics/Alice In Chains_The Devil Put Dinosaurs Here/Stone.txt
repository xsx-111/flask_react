Stone Lyrics
I know you think I'm wrong
But I'm not your tour guide
Have a guess, I don't let you look inside

Cold, dry, stone

What makes you want to carve your initials in me?
Rained and weathered, erasing, hard to read
Find me distant, outwardly rough, obscene

Cold, dry, stone

Cold and dry, a stone
Cold and dry, a stone

I'm not a cornerstone in a palace for you
Time will bring your very own hard truth
Not to worry, ice covered rocks still move

Cold and dry, a stone
Cold and dry, a stone3Embed
