The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here Lyrics
Come to me, I'll fill the hole
Why would I be lying?
End fan, all planned out
Offering a wonderful
Peace of mind worth buying
Bow down, last round up

I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got an imaginary friend

The devil put dinosaurs here
Jesus don't like a queer
The devil put dinosaurs here
No problem with faith, just fear

Promise those who've gone before
Waiting on you flying
Leading, receiving us
I'm as flawed as any man
Look at me, I'm smiling
Drink me, eat me up
I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got an imaginary friend

The devil put dinosaurs here
Jesus don't like a queer
The devil put dinosaurs here
No problem with faith just fear

I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got an imaginary friend

The devil put dinosaurs here
Jesus don't like a queer
The devil put dinosaurs here
No problem with faith, fear
