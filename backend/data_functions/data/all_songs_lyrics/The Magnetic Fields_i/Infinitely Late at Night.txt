Infinitely Late at Night LyricsIt was infinitely late at night
The stars are still out there, but they're all out of light
Don't worry about me, I'll be alright
It's just infinitely late at night
It's still getting later and later and later
I feel like I'm in a falling elevator
I'd kill for a drink, but I can't find the waiter
I really believe he's gone home
Oh God, I wish I could go home
But it's infinitely late at night
Is this a blackout or am I losing my sight?
It should have been noon now, the sun should be bright
But it's infinitely...
The hour on the bar clock, it isn't finite
It's all black and white, without the white
It's just infinitely late at nightEmbed
