Dreaming LyricsI've sworn, my love
I've been reborn, my love
Don't be forlorn, my love
I've torn my heart
Do not mourn my depart
I've been reborn, my love
I'm watching you
There's nothing they can do
Now, I'm reborn, my love
Yeah, you must believe
You'll live on without me
I'm leaving all my love

I am awake and you are only dreaming
You'll be okay and you will find some meaning
You will not break, though, you'll buckle with feelings
I am awake and you are only dreaming
Don't fear my friend 'cause there is no real end
I've been reborn, my love
I'm happy here, I have nothing to fear
I'm getting all the love, oh, yeah
So, shed a tear for all the happy years
And just move on, my love
I'll ride this cloud and when your time comes 'round
We'll need all our love
