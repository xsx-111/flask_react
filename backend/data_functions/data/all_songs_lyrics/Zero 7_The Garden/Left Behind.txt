Left Behind LyricsCleaning up the things, she left behind
Are you on, to find, some peace of mind?
Are you, aware, of the mess, you left, behind?
Scared to think away the cheer
Looking back in a mirror
It all becomes clear
The views are not the same
I see sun, you see rain
Cleaning up the mess, you left behindEmbed
