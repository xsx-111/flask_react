Prologue:
In a very distant future, the last generation of planet earth
Has come to a point where they cannot breed anymore
When everybody had lost their faith, a child was born
But no one could be the father, except for a god
This child was a gift from the skies of life-divine or...
Another sky is young
Another frozen future has passed
Another breed, another cast
The rivers will run, brought to life by the sun
The circle is still unbroken
Oh, what a sight to see
Reborn life, destined for all eternity
Hail the king!
For he has chosen not to drain
The god-sent child
A gift from the skies of life divine
Now we know
A glimpse of hope grows inside
A change of tide
Answered prayers of survival
Miracles
The offspring of the unknown gods
Beautifies
The aura of this dying breed
So they succeed
In their quest for continued time
Celebrate
The knowledge of the everlasting, never-dying
Cursed to be walking in the shadows of death for a lifetime
No more fears for what the years will bring
Rebuild the shattered dream
And now a brighter future has come
Another end remains undone
And an era begins
Bringing life free from sins
Oh it's a token, the circle is broken
(The drop of blood from her mouth slowly fell down to the ground
The child inside dried her out. The king's beloved is no more.)
The chosen one felt the time had come
To show the world what had grown within
This day of life
A sacred moment in time
When joy and pain collide
It takes a life to create a life
Now she's gone
Anger and hate
Fear and despair fills up his mind
In search for answers he can't find
What god would end a life so pure
She was the one worth dying for
Alone with princess angel-sent
Her eyes so blue, my hate relents
Her destiny is in my hands
She was born to rule these desert lands
A sacrifice
A life arises
When one love has come, another dies
I let her go and I do not know
Where to find her soul
So alone
Oh, does she hold the power?
Is she a blessing from the skies?
Is this the answer
To where the secret lies?
And in her eyes I see a light is shining through
I feel that there is hope for a world so brave and new
Many seasons have changed
And the king is old and weak
The princess has come of age
But still the gift of life they seek
In the chambers of crimson sleep
In this vault of souls to reap
The future lies in the hands of the shrewd
Or the earth will die in solitude
The darkest night, the enchanted skies were united in a storm
Unholiness and all that's unblessed appeared in another form
Like a raging plague, all across the land all women gave birth to man
Raped by the wind, and forced to bring life to the hundred bastard sons
The unholy ones will give
Strength for all evil to live
And the fires of death burn high
The time has come for the king to die
A whole world is mourning
The loss of their king
In sorrow a new day dawning
Now the princess is their everything
A procession to the chambers
Where they kiss their fathers ring
But can you hear the angel
Of sadness sing?
With broken wings
And with death came disorder
Who were they now to obey?
No leader, no followers
No trust, no faith
The princess is too young to tame a land
A new king must be chosen
In search for such a man of trust
There will be contradictions
Coming forth on desert ground
The incarnation of a king in sleep profound
Another self-proclaimed king
Set to rule in the new empire
On a mission to save the forsaken ones
And to re-light the dying fire
The crowd was confused and divided in two
A battle was about to begin
Another man with a will as strong
Declared a war to win
His army of believers was
Faithful, mighty and brave
Set to capture the liar
To forever enslave
His troops were marching
On to the battlefield
To set this world on fire
His forces are never giving yield
War!
Massacres abound
They fought for what would be a blood-stained crown
Utter chaos supreme
The sand absorbs the color of dawn
Nevermore
Shall they dream
Nevermore
The years went by under a blood-red sky
The king still suppress the rebellion lie
He is the one, the self-chosen son
Master of the throne he rules upon
The sacred child awakened
From her crystal sleep
And the earth was shaking
And the people prayed for their souls to keep
The light of day is flowing
Into her virgin eyes
Oh, the sun is stolen
A dark formation in the skies
Unites the powers in her eyes
Her soul's inhaling all the living light
Bringing on the dark, eternal night
Gathering evil in all its
Might
Seven years
Purity
Innocence
Dignity
Hail
Hail the queen!
Ruling supreme
She is queen alone
In the human zone
Dethroned the king pure
The masses were assured
She fought without a sword
She regained their hope and faith
Draining the liar in the crimson water
To bring him eternal pain
His soul is slaughtered
Eternalizing pain
Scream in silence
None shall hear his cries encaged
The unroyal king
Surrendered to the child of life divine
A hundred fortnights passed
But still no signs of aging
Her endless youth, amazed
The world was raging
A shattered race
In this broken land
This child came to restore
Like an order from the gods
The queen and all the children gathered around
The chambers where the elder ones are joined in sleep profound
In wrath they crush the tanks of crystal glass
The crimson water gushed on to the ground
In the unholy mac...eration
Their souls no longer cried
Die!
Their gift of life denied
She drinks the life-blood from the feebled man
Empty bodies, soul-drained by the virgin queen
Finally given the pleasure to die
She aligns
The hate inside their hearts
Her chosen knights
Will make sure all life departs
Soon comes the end of all
She watched a chamber fall
She heard her master call
"Live my words, oh, sacred child
You're soon to leave this world defiled."
"Then what awaits me my lord?"
"Trust me my child
Your wishes shall not be ignored."
And then he spoke his mind
Now his will is hers
"The earth shall fall
The eternal curse
Is cast on the sands they walk
Now you must use your power
Show the human race you are the one
Use their trust forever
And then deceive their weakened minds
Fool them to destroy themselves in hopelessness
Belie their seeds, belie their dreams
Hope has ceased to be."
The people worshiped their queen
Such beauty before her time was unseen
Their were fooled by her presence and disguise
Faithfully they listened
And swallowed all her lies
"The times are changing
Re-arranging he pattern of our lives
So let your heart stop beating
Beneath this twisted sky."
They were embraced by sadness
But not afraid to die
"So pass this sacred dagger
And let yourself fly free
So pretend you are dreaming
And rise above this world of you and me."
Liar!
All those who died with you by their side were denied
Access to the higher ground
Betrayal!
Eternal detest from the ones left unblessed, so possessed
Their last caress was your knife in their hearts
Fed from her deed
Watching them bleed
In her own conceit
A world to delete, lies at her feet
Her demon inside
Do no longer hide
Showing its face of hate and disgrace
Leaving their savior unpraised
The ones who didn't follow
Now sharing this moment of grief
The end of their own existence?
In death they had no belief
Despite all the faith in their queen
They couldn't believe what they had seen
What was the reason to this sacrifice?
Nothing is gained from this great demise
After the ordeal we know
She has the powers to deceive us all
But their dream of sons and daughters
Has made them standing tall
For the king had showed them it could be done
When his woman gave birth to the sacred one
But is she of man, made of flesh and blood
Or is she the offspring of the unholy
God?
A leader was chosen
To unveil the hidden truth
The brave ones were gathered
The strongest were sent to the queen
Her reason to be must be known
After many moons
The troops reach the temple of their majesty
Guarded by a hundred faithful knights
There is no escape
There's no entry to her sacred halls
Is our vision true or false?
They tried to find the answer
But they were led astray
Into a maze of slumber
Far from the light of day
The riddle remained unanswered
The queen could read ones mind
Make sure that none will find
The reason for her mission here
The highness writhe in anger
Her trust had been betrayed
The queen was filled with anger
Her decisions have been made
She would unleash her hate
Destined to devastate
She heard her demons roar
Marching into war
The spirit of their beloved king has spoke unto his men
He came to bring a message of great importance and trust
"The gift from the gods has come to cover the world in dust
Her forces are closing in to your sanctuary
So use your imagination to end her reign
Remember these words, and be strong!"
The chosen few
Were sacrificed for the others life
They were the bait
They would seal the soldiers' fate
A massive grave
To break the soldiers' spell
The forces fell into the abyss
Never to rise again
Towards the queen
The last of the brave ones wandered
To terminate
This creature non-divine
The loss of troops
Forced her powers to release
The magic uncontrolled
That had wasted a thousand souls
The palace controlled by demons
Is the heart of all evil possessed
By the queen and her unholy servants
"If we destroy it, the earth will be ours
And it will bring us eternal existence
We'll pray for the gift of breeding
This is a game we can't concede
It is worth all the blood we may bleed."
We must close the gate
So she can't return
We'll seal her fate
Watch her temple burn
And we will capture her soul
In the chambers of crimson sleep
And there she will suffer eternally
For what she has done to man
We fought our way into her dwelling-place
We searched the corridors of this infernal maze
To seek our enemy, the one to slay
We are the ones, we will not obey
A disillusioned servant
With great knowledge in her secrets
We found him walking aimlessly
Trying to find his peace
He said: "Cover her eyes
They are the root of her inhuman forces
Then she's just the child you thought she was
Disconnect all her sources."
They found a way to blind her
And it could cost some lives
But they must seal the entry
From where all evil derives
Two of the brave ones were sent to distract her
While the others made their way to behind her throne
She saw her enemies for the last time
As their leader covered her eyes
We saw the return of innocence
The symbol of purity we once knew
We carried her to the chambers
To forever lock-up her soul
We uncovered her eyes in the crimson waters
Eternalize the mind(?)
And now the reborn earth
Blessed with the gift of birth
Can see her in this cage
That eternally preserves her rage
They captured all her soldiers
And forever encaged their cries
They had found a new leader to worship
A king with her clear-blue eyes5Embed
