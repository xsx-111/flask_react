Star of Sirius LyricsAbove the colour of amber stained evening
An audience danced
Led by a showering hand that brings water
An audience danced
Led by a showering hand that brings water
To both sea and land
Unlock the door of night
Nebulous bright
Again renewed by the vessels of Isis
You're ready to fly
Although the journey is still far from ended
You gaze at the sky
Above the cloudless night
Nebulous bright
He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star
He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star
Again renewed by the vessels of Isis
You're ready to fly
He who knows love knows who you are
Worlds you may find lit by a star...Embed
