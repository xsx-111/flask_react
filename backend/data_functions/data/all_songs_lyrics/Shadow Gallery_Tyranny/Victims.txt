Victims LyricsDowntown I walk
Through New York City so hot
The summer swelter melting
Got things on my mind right now
In the alleys that I take
They just don't give up an inch
I turned and saw it all
I watched him fall
I tried to catch him
But they knocked me out cold too
"Babylon" he cried
The cost in flesh and blood is rising high
Things are falling apart, it all seems
Bleeding in the gutter
The waste of random acts of violence
Where's the Savior to rescue our dreams?
Desperation's crawling
We're victims of a world that's gone so wrong!
Hours later when I woke
I was lying in some darkened basement rescue mission
They're tending to my needs and my wounds
They were such a sorry lot
The very bottom of the social ladder
I just caught myself before I cried
They've nothing at all
But they're the only ones there to help
Eden's sin's alive
Stalking me, stalking everyone
Things are falling apart, it all seems
Tears that speak in volumes
The eyes of all these hopeless people
Where's the Savior to rescue our dreams?
Desperation's crawling
On victims of a power-hungry world!Embed
