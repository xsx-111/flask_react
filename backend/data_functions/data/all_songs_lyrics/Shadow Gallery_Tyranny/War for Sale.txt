War for Sale LyricsTime came to leave
You know there's something
About the principle of what goes on behind the scenes
The military machine
The way they led me on
Stiletto in the sand
Thrusted down in anger
Bloody to the handle
Diamond red
Machines of mass destruction
Well, I helped to design them
The guilt of children's blood stains on my hands
The word from the board room
Our boys in Tehran have scored
How long â€˜till we realize the truth?
The bottom line of defense and world security
The bankers and the ministry of arms
Just cut the deal and the war is on
The village burned the desert set ablaze
Who are these men with their fingers in everybody's pie?
Big rockets and their profiles all the rage
Their business plan calls for war for sale
Please understand
Until I saw all this
I never thought about the Third World trampled under wheels
Out in the streets and in the fields
I simply questioned it all
Stiletto in the sand
Fingers on the triggers
Tempers boiling over
Bleed them red
Machines of mass destruction
Oh, why did I design them?
The guilt of children's blood stains on my hands
Napalm and land mines
Nobody left alive
How long 'til we realize the truth?
The bottom line of defense and world security
The bankers and the ministry of arms
Just cut the deal and the war is on
The market screams a recommended buy
The contract's in - Don't just sit there, get your broker on the line
Big money left their morals far behind
Guess what we've got - we got war for sale!
How long 'til we realize the truth?
The bottom line of defense and world security
The bankers and the ministry of arms
Just cut the deal and the war is on
The village burned, the desert set ablaze
Who are these men with their fingers in everybody's pie?
Then freedom's ring departed from today
There's just no doubt - we got war for sale!Embed
