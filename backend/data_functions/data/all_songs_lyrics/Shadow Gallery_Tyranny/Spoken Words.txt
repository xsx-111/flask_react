Spoken Words Lyrics: There I was all alone all by myself
And you were just a ghost behind a screen
The few short months we spent
Long-distance late nights, just the two of us
I've grown to picture you
I've pictured you with me
: There are things I've just not told you
Works of treason wrought by these very hands
I've been scared for me, now I'm scared for you
And so it's best I say farewell
: No, no, no
Where you're going, I will be there
And every time you reach out, I'm there
Where you're going, I will be there
Oh, you've got to believe me
I'll never go away
You listen close: I've got to run and hide myself away
I think I may have brought them to their knees
There were your thoughts
Oh, how they drew me in
I need to be with you
I've nowhere else to turn
: All through my life I've had such an emptiness
That no one could ever fill
Somehow your dreams, they've touched my life
You see, I think I'd like to try
: Where you're going, I will be there
And every time you reach out, I'm there
Where you're going, I will be there
Now you've got to believe me
I'll never go away
: Our only hope I would say
Is to rendezvous somewhere far away
Just decipher the location that I send
Now I think that they are on to you
Our time has come
: Where you're going, I will be there
And every time you reach out, I'm there
Where you're going, I will be there
Now you've got to believe me
I'll never go away
