Hope For Us? LyricsToo late for us now?
I sat alone and I spoke out loud
On this darkened afternoon
The windows to my room
A solemn shutter on the world
Where I used to laugh and dream
For the first time in so long I make
My way down to the street and watch
The people as they pass
Outside I breathe the air
And all around fall shadows of despair
I wonder is there hope for us
A place where we can all be free
I wonder is there life inside a soul that dies?
I wonder is there hope for us
To lift me up I don't know when
I'll see the sun again
I'd like to feel alive
Just one more time
Headlines on the floor
Today's bitterness is the calling card
The commercial masquerade
The goods all on parade
The needs of life are charming toys
We've gone deaf from all the noise
WHen did the rich and powerful elite
Slowly and unnoticed
Come and steal our innocense?
Entranced - we danced their dance
The stage is set the crowd is on their knees
I wonder is there hope for us
A place where we can all be free
I wonder is there life inside a soul that dies
I wonder is there hope for us
We're stranded with no place to go
I'm feeling so alone
I'll try to make my way
Through one more dayEmbed
