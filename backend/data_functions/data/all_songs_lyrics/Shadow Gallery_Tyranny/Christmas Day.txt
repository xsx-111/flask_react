Christmas Day LyricsOutside the twilight rides high
And whispers of love sound deep in the night
Hope and promise of peace in our land
Is this Christmastime?
Dark winter watches our fire
And brings us promise of a new day
Distant eyes have long gone away
Too far to see the snow that falls
The winds of change have come and gone
The cold has come, I've been left out
I need your warmth - you're all I have
If you're chasing a dream to nowhere
It's enchantment that leads the way
Just believe in yourself and go there
The gift of hope on Christmas Day
If every eye holds a blank stare
After winter's gone away
Just believe in yourself and go there
You and I on Christmas Day
There's a time when your doubts won't matter
There's a time all your fears can wait
All the times in the year for laughter
Oh, Christmas Day
