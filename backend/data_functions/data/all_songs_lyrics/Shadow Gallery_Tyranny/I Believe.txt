I Believe LyricsLong ago a living story
Walked the whole world prophesying
Told of days when the hand of God
Pulls away from the world
All hell starts breaking out
I see it clear
It pounds the cold into your life
It turns to gray what's black and white
I've torn their mask off
I can see them
What a bloody mess
That's our world!
My father's final moments
And I was there to catch his last breath
He spoke so eloquently
Said: "Listen boy, the way it goes
Is solely up to you and you alone
To live your life in strength that's been passed on
Blood to blood."
So we come to a crossroad
I'm not sinking - do you see me?
I am standing where the strong of heart
Meet the wicked bad
Murals painted in the dungeon
Were the dreams that caused transforming
I am coming back to life again
Life again
A power's lifting me, I journey to the light
Many secrets passed before my eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til new horizons will unfold
Tearing down the walls between us, resurrect this poisoned world
‘Fore the hopes and dreams of all the land are blown into the sky
There are things worth more than money - you got to learn to hold them high
I believe - I believe
I've seen what comes of greed and money
I feel a growing call for action
We need changes now like never before
Never in this world
The more I think about it
I know a woman who just might set the course for me
‘Cause I believe
I believe in what she says
Sometimes this world is simply trembling, crumbling
Coming time to banish it for evermore (Evermore)
The time for final judgment’s close at hand
Four horsemen mount on high
Wake up in the morning to the sound of children dying
The latest technology mesmerize them
Love strong enough that it can pull you from the fire
Now what about you? What about you? I am alive!
It's just a matter of time 'til new horizons will unfold
Tearing down the walls between us, resurrect this poisoned world
‘Fore the hopes and dreams of all the land are blown into the sky
There are things worth more than money - you got to learn to hold them high
I believe - I believeEmbed
