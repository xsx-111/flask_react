Out of Nowhere LyricsYesterday is over
Stripped of my clearance - fired
I don't know what to do
Haunted by empty faces
Victims of warring madness
If they only knew
Their world's a bloody mess
Some corporate bottom line
I tried to ask and they treat me like a threat
And they slammed the door behind
Yesterday I walked away into a cold cold city
So afraid our world today is just a house of lies
Just believe in what you feel
They used to say they used to say
Then out of nowhere
I melt into my busy day
Reaching out in my world
Becomes a matter of
Connections to the net
I've locked myself in real good
Investigative research
Looking for what is real
Welcome to the brave new world
No light inside my soul
The more I learn the deeper in I'm drawn
The deeper in I fall
Yesterday I walked away into a cold cold city
Ain't it strange how wars get raged to sounds of smashing dreams
Just believe in what you feel
They used to say they used to say
Then out of nowhere
One world
No Chance
Is this the new human race?
A faceless contact with life
Imaginary places stealing all of my time
Is this a test of my faith?
What's to become of my life
I used to see it so clear
But now I've lived to see it pass away
Before my eyesEmbed
