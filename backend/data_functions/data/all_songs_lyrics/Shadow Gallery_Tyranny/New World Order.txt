New World Order LyricsGood day my fellow citizen
I don't mean to intrude
But allow me to get right down to the point
We've monitored transmissions
We calculate your moves
Did you really think you're hidden from our sight?
Your name's been added to a list that's been compiled
Our agency considers you a risk
Secret power I can't believe
Growing stronger I feel them
Strengthening their grip
So there you are you crossed the line
You pathetic little man
Well rest assured the worst you feared is true
In the seduction of society we play upon desire
Spoiled and drunk that's you
Can this be happening?
This world is just a grand facade
You're just a simple man at heart
A victim playing out a part
Oh I just want my freedom
Where are the ones who back you now?
I feel abandoned feel like
Screaming at the walls
Too bad the walls have ears
This never ever should have been
But that's the way it is
This is the new world order
This is the corporate sponsored
Changing of the guard
The march is on
I can feel it - I can feel it's tyranny
It's all about the power
This rising new world order
Strong arm of the law
The march is on
I can see it - I can see it's tyranny
The point you fail to see is
The simple beauty of our subtle mind control
Brainwashing media is all we need to set the boundaries
Advanced communication
You're at our fingertips now
We own the TV stations
Entertainment, Publications
Wall street is our breeding ground
The sphere of our control extends through
Governments and leaders who will buy our arms
Yes buy our arms and run our evil wars
Run our evil wars run this evil world into the ground
This is the new world order
This your corporate sponsored life
I see through your disguises
Your rising new world order lies
You've no idea the power my new world order is alive
You don't really think you have a prayer
I don't know where to go to avoid your
Staring eyes and universal grasp upon all life
This world is mine!
This is the new world order
This your corporate sponsored life
It's all about the power
This rising new world order riseEmbed
