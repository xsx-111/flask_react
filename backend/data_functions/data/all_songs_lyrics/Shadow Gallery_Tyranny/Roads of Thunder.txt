Roads of Thunder LyricsA: EMPOWERED
Are your deeds so really bad?
Your secret life untold
Please tell me, just try me
But you say goodnight and shut me down until tomorrow
When you come to life again
And reveal just maybe
What's going on inside of you
The real you
Strange feeling
Right now I want to look you in the eyes and tell you how I feel
I've lived the life of a lonely man
And I've traveled roads of thunder calling out to Heaven
Send your rain on down
The time has come to make my move
I want to join with you
I'm not powerless tonight
I'm tired of silent conversations with a mystery
It's so strange
We both know we've grown so close
It's like you're mine and I am yours
And that's where things go wrong
You're not meant to be invisible
Please speak to me with spoken words
And prove you're real
I never knew that I could feel with such conviction
And I just don't understand what separates our world
I've lived the life of a lonely man
And I've traveled roads of thunder calling out to Heaven
Send your rain on down
Time has come to make my move
I want to join with you
I'm not powerless tonight
What if I cross the line
And I show you I mean business
Prove that we're alike and send some rain on down?
Seems to me in these busy days
It's not just what you say
You gotta turn it back on them and fight!
I feel my life turning pages at the mercy of the wind
There it is now
The course for me to take
Embed a virus in the system
Send their money flying to the ground
Financially restrained
The network down in flames
It's gonna take all that I know
But in the end they'll be mourning
Their system as it bleeds and dies
B: VIRUS 
C: POWERLESS
I've lived the life of a lonely man
Now there's no more time for waiting
What I've gone and done
I sent the rain on down
What happens next is now up to you
You gotta make a move
Don't leave me powerless tonight
I really mean it, we've got to talk
This is something you believe in
Calling out to Heaven
Send your line on down
Now you know that I'm on my own
I'm waiting by the phone
You're not powerless tonightEmbed
