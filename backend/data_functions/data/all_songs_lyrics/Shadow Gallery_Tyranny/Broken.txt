Broken LyricsI am only just a broken spirit
All the things unseen right before my eyes
How could I have ever been so blind
To the truth behind bitter lies?
I feel so lost and so alone in this room tonight
Is nothing ever going to change?
I've lost my will
I need somebody to help me write out my next page
Where I ride into the sunset
I race towards the dawn
I might have been a hero
A king and not just a pawn
But that's the way that the story goes, you know
"It's not that way for me"
And I wake up cold and lonely
And stare into the screenEmbed
