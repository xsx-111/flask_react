Going Down on Love Lyrics
Got to get down, down on my knees
Got to get down, down on my knees
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Going down on love
Going down on love
Going down, going down, going down

When the real thing goes wrong
And you can't get it on
And your love, she has gone
And you got to carry on
And you shoot out the light
Ain't coming home for the night
You know you got to, got to, got to pay the price

Somebody please, please help me
You know I'm drowning in the sea of hatred

I got to get down, down on my knees
I got to get down, down on my knees
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Going down on love
Going down on love
Going down, going down, going down
Something precious and rare
Disappears in thin air
And it seems so unfair
Nothing doing nowhere
Well, you burn all your boats
And you sow your wild oats
Well, you know, you know, you know the price is right

Got to get down, down on my knees
Got to get down, down on my knees
Got to get down, down on my knees
Got to get down, down on my kneesEmbed
