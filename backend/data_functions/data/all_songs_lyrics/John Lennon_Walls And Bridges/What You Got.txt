What You Got Lyrics
One...
Hey, hey!

Don't want to be a drag
Everybody got to bag
I know you know
About the emperor's clothes

You don't know what you got until you lose it
You don't know what you got until you lose it
You don't know what you got until you lose it
Oh, baby, baby, baby, give me one more chance

Well, it's Saturday night and I just got to rip it up
Sunday morning, I just got to give it up
Come Monday, momma, and I just got to run away
You know it's such a drag to face another day

You don't know what you got until you lose it
You don't know what you got until you lose it
You don't know what you got until you lose it
Oh, baby, baby, baby, give me one more chance
You know the more it change
The more it stays the same
You got to hang on it
You got to cut the string

You don't know what you got until you lose it
You don't know what you got until you lose it
You don't know, you don't know what you got until you lose it
Oh, baby, baby, baby, give me one more chance
Come on, girl, hey, alright
Hey, alrightEmbed
