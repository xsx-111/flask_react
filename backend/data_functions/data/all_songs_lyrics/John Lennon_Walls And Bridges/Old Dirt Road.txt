Old Dirt Road Lyrics
Ain't no people on the old dirt road
No more weather on the old dirt road
It's better than a mudslide, mamma, when the dry spell come
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, old dirt road

Ain't no difference on the old dirt road
Tarred and feathered on the old dirt road
Trying to shovel smoke with a pitchfork in the wind
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Breezing through the deadwood on a hot summer day
I saw a human being lazy boning out in the hay
I said uh, "hey Mr. Human can you rainmaker too?"
He said I guess it's O.K. you know the only thing we need is water
Cool, clear water, water
Water, water

Ain't no people on the old dirt road
No more weather on the old dirt road
It's better than a mudslide mamma when the morning comes
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, old dirt road
Keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on
So long, so long
So long, so long
Bye bye
Bye bye
Keep on keeping on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep onEmbed
