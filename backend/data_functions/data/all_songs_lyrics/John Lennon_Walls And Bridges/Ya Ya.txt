Ya Ya Lyrics
Okay, we'll do "Sitting in the La La"
That'll get rid of that
1, 2, 3, 4

Sitting in the la la
Waiting for the ya ya, mhm
Sitting in the la la
Waiting for the ya ya, uh huhu

It may sound funny
But it's alright honey, uh huhu

Hey, baby, worry
Don't make me worry, uh huhu
Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make me worry, uh huhu

It may sound umpty
But it's Humpty DumptyEmbed
