Whatever Gets You Thru the Night Lyrics
Whatever gets you through the night
It's alright, it's alright
It's your money or your life
It's alright, it's alright
Don't need a sword to cut through flowers
Oh no, oh no

Whatever gets you through your life
It's alright, it's alright
Do it wrong or do it right
It's alright, it's alright
Don't need a watch to waste your time
Oh no, oh no

Hold me darlin', come on listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me darlin' come on listen to me, come on listen to me
Come on listen, listen

Whatever gets you to the light
It's alright, it's alright
Out the blue or out of sight
It's alright, it's alright
Don't need a gun to blow your mind
Oh no, oh no
Hold me darlin' come on listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me darlin' come on listen to me, come on listen to me
Come on listen, listenEmbed
