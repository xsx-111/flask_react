Taipan LyricsTaipan
He'll get you when he can
Ooh
He'll get you when he can
Makes his home in a mangrove tree
Sleep plantation family
White man planter, Bundaberg rum
Childhood rattle, trumpet and drum
Stay with me
Stay with me, oh yeah
Until the morning comes
Taipan
He'll get you when he can
Ooh
He'll get you when he can
These days, I can't explain
But I can smell the monsoon rain
Seasons come, and seasons turn
More and more, canefields burning
Early in the morning, the afternoon
Pathways blazed in a mangrove moon
Burning down my eyes
(Railroad goes, Kalamia mill
If the heat don't get you, Taipan will
Six o'clock, the whistle sings
C.S.R. is the sugar-cane king)
Stay with me
Stay with me
Taipan
He'll get you when he can
Ooh
He'll get you when he canEmbed
