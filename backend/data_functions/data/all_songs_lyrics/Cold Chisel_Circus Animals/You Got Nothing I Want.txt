You Got Nothing I Want Lyrics
You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't need your crying lies
I don't need stupid alibi's
I don't need convertible cars (ow)
And don't think that you can push me too far

You got the money and I got the time
Nothing better to do, so you might just change my mind

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't want to see you again (oh no)
I don't want you for a friend
I don't want you hanging around
I don't mind just putting you down
You got the money and I got the time
Nothing better to do, so you might just change my mind

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
Yeah

I don't wanna have to tell you
Oh, how that you should do your job
I don't wanna have to be the one to shock your happy home

Yeah, you got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
Woh you ain't got nothing
You got nothing I want Embed
