Wild Colonial Boy LyricsI am a wild colonial boy
My name you'll never see
My land is ruled by Anglophiles
And forces foreign to me
I do not curse your referees
In boardrooms far away
Yeah who am I to question these
Who plan their final day
I've never known the jealousies
The overcrowded pain
I live and breathe the silences
The dust where no man reigns
I'm in love
I got blazing light
Ten thousand miles of ocean
I'm alone
And there's more like me
Ignoring the end of their show
And when they shaft my brother dear
And pay him off with lies
I fill my hand with the Union card
And aim between their eyes
And if I smile
When they crawl around
Too condescending to blame me
I am young
Baby they're so old
Gothic, religious and tame
I am just a wild colonial boy
My name you'll never see
I breathe the silence that destroys
All their desperate harmonyEmbed
