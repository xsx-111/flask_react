No Good For You Lyrics
Your last Margarita and she's standing behind
But she wants to be seated but you're reading her mind

And ain't it a shame, but she's no good for someone like you
And she'll bring you down, she's no good for you

Her husband's out workin' late
Makin' another man rich
She's down at the bar
You can hear that same old singles pitch

And ain't it a shame, that she's no good for someone like you
Well she'll bring you down, she's no good for you

Well you don't know why she came here tonight
She just can't seem to stay away
And you know that it just ain't right
She drowns her heart and makes her play yeah

And ain't it a shame, that she's no good for someone like you
Well she'll bring you down, she's no good for you
The ceiling is spinnin'
You need a moment alone
She's leaning over the table
And won't stop talking, goes on and on and on

And ain't it a shame, that she's no good for someone like you
Well she'll bring you down, she's no good for you
Yeah-eah-eah-eah!


Well you don't know why she came here tonight
She just can't seem to stay away
And you know that it just ain't right
She drowns her heart and makes her play yeah

And ain't it a shame, but she's no good for someone like you
Well she'll bring you down, she's no good for you

And she's no good for youEmbed
