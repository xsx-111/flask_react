Bow River Lyrics
Listen now to the wind, babe
Listen now to the rain
I feel that water lickin' at my feet again

I don't wanna see this town no more
Wastin' my days on a factory floor
The first thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

Anytime you want babe, you can come around
But only six days separates me and the great Top End
I been working hard, twelve hours a day
And the money I saved won't buy my youth again

I'm goin' for the heat babe, and the tropical rain
In a place where no man's puttin' on the dog for me
I'm waitin' on the weekend, set of brand new tyres
And back in Bow River, just where I wanna be

Oh, listen now to the wind, babe
Listen now to the rain
And feel that water lickin' at my feet again
I don't wanna see this town no more
Too many years made up my mind
To go or stay, right to my dying day

I don't wanna see another engine line
Too many years and I owe my mind
The first set of wheels headin' back Bow River again
The first thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

I got the motor runnin', I got the rest of my days
Sold everything I owned for just a song
So anytime you want babe, you can come around
But don't leave it too late, you just might find me gone

Oh listen now to the wind, babe
Listen now to the rain
I feel that water lickin' at my feet again

I don't wanna see this town no more
Too many years made up my mind to go or stay
Right to my dying day
I don't wanna see another engine line
Too many years and I owe my mind
The first set of wheels headin' back Bow River again

I don't need the score, I'm goin' through the door
Gonna tell the man I don't want no more
Pick up a fast car and burn my name in the road

One week, two week, maybe even more
I piss all my money up against the damn wall
The first thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again
The first thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

The first thing you know I'll be back in Bow River
AgainEmbed
