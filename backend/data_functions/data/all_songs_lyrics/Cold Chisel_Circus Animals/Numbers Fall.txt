Numbers Fall LyricsYou ain't got nothin' that you need so bad
That you couldn't give it up for a choice of two
An unseen chance is gonna come your way
Before this night is through
Blackjack, baccarat, matters of the heart
If you've just got the money
You're a loser to start
And you can fold away your dreams as they come true
Dreams come true
Walkin' down Forbes Street
Early hours of Wooloomooloo
Chancy games in a hotel room
On Springfield Avenue
And if the numbers fall
And if the numbers fall right
And if the numbers fall
I know all my dreams come true
I know you're old
Cause all you're laying down is
Easy gold
You never take your heart uptown anymore
You don't bleed anymore
The Forbes Street croupiers
Are lookin' like cashers at a
Black and White Charity Ball
Roll 'em up once
Roll 'em up twice
The rustle of the money
And the click o' the dice
Five-fifty dollars on the wheel
Oughta make it
For six I'll teach your sister to
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Rich girls, bad girls
Jumpin' on a fad girls
Cuttin' things fine is how I first met you
Livin' outside in the real estate
You know we stake a little more
Than just a dollar or two
And if the numbers fall
And if the numbers fall right
And if the numbers fall
I know all my dreams'll come trueEmbed
