Roman Holiday Lyrics
Do you remember the taste of my lips that night
I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall
That separated the dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
Late December, with my heart in my chest
And the clouds of my breath
Didn't know where we were running to
But don't look back

Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday

Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
'Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you
And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late
Didn't know where I was running to
But I won't look back
Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday

Feet first, don't fall
Or we'll be running again
Keep close, stand tall

Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
