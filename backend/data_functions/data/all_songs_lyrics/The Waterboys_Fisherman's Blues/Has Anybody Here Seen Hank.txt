Has Anybody Here Seen Hank LyricsI ain't here for to do any business
(I got nobody special to thank/I'm not looking for glory or thanks)
I'm trying to find
A friend of mine
Has anybody here seen Hank
Well he's sure to be wearing a Stetson
He's as long and as thin as a plank
He's got a fistful of charm
And a gun beneath his arm
Has anybody here seen Hank
Now he ain't in the back of a limo
And he ain't in his bed
He ain't in jail
He ain't out on bail
He ain't getting out of his head
I don't care what he did with his women
I don't care what he did when he drank
I want to hear just one note
From his lonesome old throat
Has anybody here seen Hank
Has anybody here, has anybody here
Has anybody here seen HankEmbed
