And a Bang on the Ear LyricsLindsay was my first love she was in my class
I would have loved to take her out but i was too shy to ask
The fullness of my feeling was never made clear
But i send her my love with a bang on the ear
Nora was my girl when i first was in a group
I can still see her to this day, stirring chicken soup
Now she's living in australia working for an auctioneer
But i send her my love with a bang on the ear
Deborah broke my heart and i the willing fool
I fell for her one summer on the road to liverpool
I thought it was forever but it was over in a year (oh dear)
But i give her my love with a bang on the ear
The home i made with Bella became a house of pain
We weathered it together bound by a ball and chain
Is started up in fife, and ended up in tears (oh dear)
But i send her my love with a bang on the ear
Krista was a rover from Canada she hailed
We crossed swords in San Francisco we both lived to tell the tale
I dont know now where she is oh but if i had her here
I'd give her my love with a bang on the ear
So my woman of the hearthfire, harbour of my soul
I watch you lightly sleeping and sense the dream that does unfold (like gold)
You to me are treasure, you to me are dear
So i'll give you my love with a bang on the earEmbed
