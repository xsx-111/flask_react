When Will We Be Married Lyrics(Traditional)
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bed
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bed
You have your eye on Jimmy
Long Jimmy Lee
You have your eye on Jimmy
Anda fine man he
You have your eye on Jimmy
But you'd better let him be
Because when you go, Molly-o
You'll be gone with me
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bed
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bed
You have your eye on Johnny
Thin Johnny Fee
You have your eye on Johnny
And a fine man he
You have your eye on Johnny
But you'd better let him be
Because when you go, Molly-o
You'll be gone with me
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bed
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bed
I made a black bow
For your pretty head
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
I made a black bow
For your bonny head
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bed
When will we be married Molly
When will we be wed
When will we be
Bedded in the same bedEmbed
