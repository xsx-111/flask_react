We Will Not Be Lovers Lyrics

You just stepped into the maintrack, climbed down off the fence
Words are your weapon, lies are your defence
I know what you want, and I see what you see
You're looking for somebody, but he isn't me
Find yourself another because we will not be lovers

How your eyes are like tortures and your presence is bliss
I never knew time could speed and zip like this
The touch of your flesh is tough to resist
Planets collide, collide at the smack of your kiss
But you can kiss your brother because we will not be lovers

Now you're pulling down curtains
You've been sparking old flames
You've been causing disturbance crying for shame
You've been Knocking on doors
You've been abusing my name
You've been casting up doubt
You've been throwing your blame
But you can throw it at your mother
We will not be lovers
Now the world's full of trouble
Everybody's scared
The landlords are frowning
Cupboards are bare
People are scrambling (people are scrambling)
Like dogs for a share (like dogs for a share)
It's cruel and it's hard
But it nothing compared to what we do to each other
To each other

We will not be lovers! no, no
We will not be lovers, no, no, no, no, no
We will not be lovers, no, no, no, no, no
