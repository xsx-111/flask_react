Got Me on the Line Lyrics"Hello?"
Well cocktails for two, me and you
It's some fun hot afternoon
Whenever I'm alone
I sit and pick up the phone, give a call
She's so hot to have and to hold me
She said "I'll be your one and only"
I know what it means to be alone
Got me on the line
Ready for the night
You got me on the line
Now you'll think twice
You like your home sweet home all alone
You will be callin' me
I've heard the news around the town
You're not gonna hang up on me
She's so hot to have and to hold me
She said "I'll be your one and only"
I know what it means to be alone
Got me on the line
Ready for the night
You got me on the line
Long distance kept me holding on
Got me on the line
Ready for the night
You got me on the line
Now you'll think twice
Got me on the line
Long distance kept me holdin' on
You got me on the line
Ready for tonight, tonight, tonight (Tonight)
Hey!
"Nobody hangs up on me."Embed
