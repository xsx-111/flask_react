Closer to My Heart LyricsAh!
I listen to you, are you listening to me
The way that you are, it's easy to see
Feelings for you, now I feel free
I'm lost in time
It's not the way that you hold me
It's not that I really care
It's not to say that to love is to own me
You're tangled up in my lair
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
When you cross the line
You're one step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
One step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
Indecision, it's all been heard
No more confusion, the page has turned
Still with the darkness of the night
I always see the light
It's not the way that you hold me
It's not that I really care
It's not to say that to love is to own me
You're tangled up in my lair
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
When you cross the line, then you'll find
That you're one step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
One step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
When you cross the line, then you'll find
That you're one step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
(One step) Closer to my heart
One step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
One step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
Closer to my heartEmbed
