What You Give Is What You Get LyricsI make my moves
I make them right
I don't refuse
I keep it light
I take command
Of the scene
Because for me
There's no in-betweens
I keep holdin' on
Holdin' on through the night
I keep holdin' on
Holdin' on through the night
'Cause it's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get
It's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
I take my time
And I don't care
This love ain't right
What's fair is fair
If you just ask
You will receive
Give me the task
I aim to please
I keep holdin' on
Holdin' on through the night
I keep holdin' on
Holdin' on through the night
'Cause it's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get
It's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
'Cause it's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
It's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
It's so easy, yeah
'Cause it's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get is what you get)
It's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
'Cause it's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
It's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)Embed
