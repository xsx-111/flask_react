You Should Know by Now LyricsMy blood is thicker than water
I'm livin' out my life
I'll have my friends forever
We'll walk the sands of time
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
I never take no chances
Don't stand for compromise
I'll find the hidden treasure
I'm only passin' by
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
Can you hear me tellin' you (Tellin' you)
I've got something to say (Hey)
Don't you know it's nothin' new
Don't you get in my way, get in my way
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by nowEmbed
