Never Use Love LyricsHey!
I'm gonna make my statement
Don't need arrangements
I said you're not gonna make tracks
All over my life
When push comes to shove I'll be pushin' you down
Better think twice when you take that step
That you got both feet on the ground
Never use love (Never use love)
I don't want to fight
I won't get in your way
Don't give me the right
Never use love
I've gotta find my place
Don't need no replacements
When you think you're too much
Then I've had enough, hell yeah!
When push comes to shove I'll be pushin' you down
Better think twice when you take that step
That you got both feet on the ground
Never use love (Never use love)
I don't want to fight
I won't get in your way
Don't give me the right
Never use love (Never use love)
I don't want to fight
Never use love
Never use love
Never use love
Never use love
Never use love
Never use love
Never use love
Never use loveEmbed
