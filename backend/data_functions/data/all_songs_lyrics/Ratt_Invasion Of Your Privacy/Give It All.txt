Give It All LyricsTaken away on a ride
Not far from here
Well, no wasting time
She's got plans for me
She came behind
And then showed me her thighs
You know what I mean
Well, no way to say she could win the likes of me
The life of me
She said
I'd like to wear you out and give it all to you
I'll find a reason now
Just give it all
Just give it all
I want to give you all my love tonight
(Give it all)
Just give a sign to me
I'll make it right
(Give it all)
A fashion plate in a way
She really was
She had style and class
Understand she'll pay to dance
She moved my soul
Don't you know she's here to please
Well, I'm on my knees
Can't you see?
Move in on me
Move in on me
She said
I'd like to wear you out
And give it all to you
I'll find a reason now
Just give it all
Just give it al
Give it all
(Give it all)
Give it all
(Give it all)
I said give it all
(Give it all)
Give it all
(Give it all)
Hey
I want to give you all my love tonight
(Give it all)
Just give a sign to me
I'll make it right
(Give it all)
(Give it all)Embed
