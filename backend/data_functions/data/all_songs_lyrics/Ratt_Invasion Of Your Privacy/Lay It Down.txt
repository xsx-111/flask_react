Lay It Down LyricsI know you don't really know me
I know you don't really care to see me
I'm into total affection
Not being scared if you never please me
You know you really want to lay it down
Right now and how
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Under the sheets, you will find me
I know that nothing's for free
You take what's good for your pleasin'
I'll take what's good for this crazy evening
You know you really want to lay it down
Right now and how
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
And I know you only want romance
I'll give you all that I can
If you give me just one chance, to prove myself
In love
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, yeah yeah yeah
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it downEmbed
