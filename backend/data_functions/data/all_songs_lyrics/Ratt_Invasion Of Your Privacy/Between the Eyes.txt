Between the Eyes LyricsI don't like your cheatin' misfit way
I don't stand for givin' it away
So you want some action, ask me why
You say you want to keep me in your target sight
Can't you see the world turn and hear the cries?
Can't you see you're burnin' me right between the eyes?
I don't like your hot and cold device
You know I'm the only one this time
Can't you see the world turn and hear the cries?
Can't you see you're burnin' me between the eyes?
You hardly notice
Can't you see you're burnin' me right between the eyes?
I see you burnin' me between the eyes
I don't like your cheatin' misfit ways
I don't stand for givin' it away
Can't you see the world turn and hear the cries?
Can't you see you're burnin' me between the eyes?
You hardly notice
Can't you see you're burnin' me right between the eyes?
You hardly notice
Can't you see you're burnin' me right between the eyes?
Right between the eyes
Right between the eyes
You hardly notice
Can't you see you're burnin' me between the eyes?
(Between the eyes)
(Between the eyes)
I see you burnin' me between the eyesEmbed
