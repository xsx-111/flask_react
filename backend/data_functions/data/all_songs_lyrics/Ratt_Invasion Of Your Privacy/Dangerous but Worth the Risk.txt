Dangerous but Worth the Risk LyricsDangerous
But worth the risk
The things you do
To get your fix
You'll head for fun
You're on my list
Live for love
Will get you this
I know something, you know that it's true
I can feel it when I'm next to you
Dangerous but worth the risk
Your life's not threatened, but your lovin' is
Dangerous but worth the risk
The pressure's on
You're on the run
You're gettin' loose
You're havin' fun
Streets are cold
But remember this
We are dangerous
But worth the risk
I know something, you know that it's true
I can feel it when I'm next to you
Dangerous but worth the risk
Your life's not threatened, but your lovin' is
Dangerous but worth the risk
I know it's true
I know it's you
It's you
It's true
Dangerous but worth the risk
Your life's not threatened, but your lovin' is
Dangerous but worth the risk
Dangerous but worth the risk
Your life's not threatened, but your lovin' is
Dangerous but worth the risk
I can feel it when I'm next to you
Dangerous but worth the risk
Dangerous but worth the risk
Dangerous but worth the risk
I know something, you know that it's true
It's you
It's trueEmbed
