The Steps Lyrics
So baby
When I'm near you
You can't feel me
I'm lightnin'
You used to come by
And sit down by my side
You would come in close
And take off all my clothes

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand
Why you don't understand me, baby
And every day I wake up and I make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me, baby

All the ivy
Is growing sideways
You won't stop it
'Til it covers all of our place
Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand
Why you don't understand me, baby
And every day I wake up and I make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me, baby

If I go right and you go left
Hey, I know we'll meet up again
And if you go left and I go right
Hey, maybe that's just life sometimes

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand
Why you don't understand me, baby
And every day I wake up and I make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me, baby10Embed
