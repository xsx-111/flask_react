Another Try Lyrics
One thing or two things
Never really mattered that much to me
Now all these apologies are on repeat
Is it destiny or just chemistry?
We're living in such extremes
And life won't wait around

So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line

One thing's true
Every memory leads back to you
Got your hat in the back faded up
Camo tee in the crease of the passenger seat
And every time I try to leave them out
My feelings come back around

So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line
But are we gonna give it another try?
But are we gonna give it another try?
Wrapped up in your old fleece
I put it on when I can't sleep
When I call and I can't reach you
Worried that it makes me look weak to you
(Just one more time, time)

So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line

Baby (We can give this another try)
Baby (If it don't work, then it's alright)
I'm wishing the best, baby
I'm wishing the best, baby (If it don't work, then it's alright)
I'm wishing the best, baby
I'm wishing the best, baby (If it don't work, then it's alright)1Embed
