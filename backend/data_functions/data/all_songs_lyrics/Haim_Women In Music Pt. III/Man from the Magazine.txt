Man from the Magazine Lyrics
One, two, three

Man from the magazine, what did you say?
"Do you make the same faces in bed?"
Hey, man, what kind of question is that?
What did you really want me to say back?
What's going on behind those dark glasses?
Is this what you think making a pass is?
Wondering which door could get me out fastest
When I tell it now

I don't want to hear
It is what it is, it was what it was
I don't want to hear
It is what it is, it was what it was
You don't know how it feels, you expect me to deal with it
'Til I'm perfectly numb
But you don't know how it feels

Man from the music shop, I drove too far
For you to hand me that starter guitar
"Hey, girl, why don't you play a few bars?"
Oh, what's left to prove?
I don't want to hear
It is what it is, it was what it was
Don't make me hear
It is what it is, it was what it was
You don't know how it feels, you expect me to deal with it
'Til I'm perfectly numb

But you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
