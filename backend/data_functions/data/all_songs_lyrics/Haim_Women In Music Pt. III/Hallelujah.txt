Hallelujah Lyrics
I met two angels, but they were in disguise
Took one look to realize
Tell 'em anything and they will sympathize
These arms hold me tight
Old fears, helped to ease them in my mind
New tears say that they will dry in time

Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah

Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
Been that way since '95
Give me direction when it is hard to fight
Three roads, one light
Now and then I can lean my back to yours
Travelin' like our feet don't touch the floor

Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?

I had a best friend but she has come to pass
One I wish I could see now
You always remind me that memories will last
These arms reach out
You were there to protect me like a shield
Long hair, running with me through the field
Everywhere, you've been with me all along
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah? (Hallelujah)
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
