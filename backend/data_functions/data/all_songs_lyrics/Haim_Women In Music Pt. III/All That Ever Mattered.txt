All That Ever Mattered Lyrics
When I look at your face
When I look in your eyes
This is not what you wanted
You never liked surprises
It's not about them or what they think we do
I never cared about what they said
I only cared about me and you

I'm not something that you can buy
You know I've never been that type (Fuck no)
Never cared about this life
'Cause if you took it away

All that ever mattered was you, baby
All that ever mattered was you, baby
And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you

So what is it like now that you don't have me?
So what is it like? Never mind, don't tell me
Do you think about all the things I did to you?
Do you think about how to get me back?
When you remember that, to me
All that ever mattered was you, baby
All that ever mattered was you, baby
And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you

I'm pulling away (I'm not something that you can buy)
You know I've never been that type (Fuck no)
I'm pulling away (Never cared about this life)
I'm pulling away ('Cause if you took it away)

All that ever mattered was you, babe
All that ever mattered was you, baby
And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you, baby3Embed
