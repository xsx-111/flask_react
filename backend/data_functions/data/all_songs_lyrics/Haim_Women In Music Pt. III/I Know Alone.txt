I Know Alone Lyrics
Been a couple days since I've been out
Calling all my friends, but they won't pick up
Found another room in a different place
Sleeping through the day and I dream the same (I don't wanna)

I don't wanna give, I don't wanna give too much
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel at all

'Cause nights turn into days
That turn to grey
Keep turning over
Some things never grow
I know alone
Like no one else does
Some things never change
They never fade
It's never over
Some things never grow
I know alone
Like no one else does

Been a couple days since I've been around
Woke up at the wheel on the edge of town
It all looked the same, every mile
Screaming every word of "Both Sides Now" (I don't wanna)
And I don't wanna give, I don't wanna give too much
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel at all

'Cause nights turn into days
That turn to grey
Keep turning over
Some things never grow
I know alone
Like no one else does
Some things never change
They never fade
It's never over
Some things never grow
I know alone
Like no one else does

(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
Days get slow like counting cell towers on the road
I know alone and I don't wanna talk about it
Friday hits and I feel like wasting everybody's time
When Sunday comes, they expect me to shine
(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
When Sunday comes, they expect me to shine
(Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
I know alone, I know alone (Now Sunday comes and they expect her to shine)
I know alone, I know alone
Some things never change (I know alone, I know alone)
They never fade (I know alone, I know alone)
Some things never grow (I know alone, I know alone)
I know alone (I know alone, I know alone)
I know alone, I know alone
I know alone, I know alone
I know alone, I know alone
I know alone6Embed
