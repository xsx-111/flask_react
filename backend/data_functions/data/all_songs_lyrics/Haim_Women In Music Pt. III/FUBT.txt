FUBT Lyrics
I kinda like it when you leave me at the party late
'Cause every now and then, I wanna feel that empty space
I kinda like it when you say the things you shouldn't say
'Cause those are all the things that I was thinkin' anyway
It's wrong, but you could do no wrong
And baby, even though it makes me miserable

It's fucked up, but it's true
That I love you like I do
I'm just gon' keep on lovin' you
It's tough to get through
Either way, I'm gonna lose
So I'm just gon' keep on lovin' you

I spend my mornings overthinkin' all my old mistakes
But I would never judge your problems in the same way
You beat yourself up and I let you take it out on me
Another day, another hour, no apology
How can I sleep when I can't dream at night?
All of my needs I say I don't need
How can I dream when I can't sleep at night?
All of my needs I say I don't need
And it's fucked up, but it's true
That I love you like I do
But I'm just gonna keep on loving you
It's tough to get through
Either way I'm gonna lose
So I'm just gon' keep on loving you

It's fucked up, but it's true
Gonna keep on loving you
'Til my days are through1Embed
