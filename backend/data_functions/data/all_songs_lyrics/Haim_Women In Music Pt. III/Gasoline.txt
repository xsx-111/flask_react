Gasoline Lyrics
You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up like I
Never smoked a pack

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad
And I did it back
You needed ass, well, what's
Wrong with that?

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat
We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
When you lie in between my legs, it doesn't matter
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Faster and faster

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease3Embed
