3 AM Lyrics
Hey, uh, what's up?
Just calling to see if you're still up
But straight to voicemail, uh
Yeah, no biggie
Um, if you're up or whatever, just hit me up

Now you're calling
3 AM, my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is, "Have I lost my mind?"
But I'm picking up for the last time

Either way, I'm gonna lose
But I just wanna give
I just can't stop staring at it
I just can't resist

I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away, floating away
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away, floating away
Now you're calling
3 AM, my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is, "Have I lost my mind?"
But I'm picking up for the last time

You and I don't have to meet
But it's fun to think we could
On the screen and in my jeans
Just make me feel good

I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away, floating away
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away, floating away

Now you're calling
3 AM, my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is, "Have I lost my mind?"
But I'm picking up for the last time
Now you're calling, 3 AM
Now you're calling, 3 AM
Now you're calling, 3 AM
Now you're calling, 3 AM2Embed
