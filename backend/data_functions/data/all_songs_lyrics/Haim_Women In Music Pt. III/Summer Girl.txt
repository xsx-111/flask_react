Summer Girl Lyrics
L.A. on my mind, I can't breathe
You're there when I close my eyes, so hard to reach
Your smiles turn into cryin', it's the same release
And you always know, and you always know

I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl

Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do

Lightnin' in your eyes, you can't speak
You've fallen from the sky, down to me
I see it in your face, I'm relief
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl
I'm your summer girl

Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do

Peer around the corner at you
From over my shoulder, I need you
I need you to understand
These are the earthquake drills that we ran
Under the freeway overpasses
The tears behind your dark sunglasses
The fears inside your heart's deepest gashes
Walk beside me
Not behind me
Feel my unconditional love
Do-do, do-do-do-do (And I can see the angels coming down)
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do (Like a wave that's crashing on the ground)
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do (And I can see the angels coming down)
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do (Like a wave that's crashing on the ground)
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do

And I can see the angels coming down
Like a wave that's crashing on the ground9Embed
