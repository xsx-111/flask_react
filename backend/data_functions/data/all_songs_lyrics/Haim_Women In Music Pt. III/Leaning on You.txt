Leaning on You Lyrics
I might forget to turn out all the lights
But you take care of me when I have to leave at dawn
I might sleep in past all my alarms
But you take care of us when I make it tough because

It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won't you let me know
If I’m not alone?
Leaning on you

Was I fearless at seventeen years old?
Or was I faking it? I was just a kid leaving home
Now I get scared for reasons I don't know
Is it just because I ain't tough enough
Being alone?

It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won’t you let me know
If I'm not alone?
And I like what we got
But I'm scared of what it's not
So won't you let me know
If I'm not alone?
Leaning on you

It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won't you let me know
If I'm not alone?
And I like what we got
But I’m scared of what it’s not
So won't you let me know
If I’m not alone?
Leaning on you4Embed
