Los Angeles Lyrics
Los Angeles
Give me a miracle, I just want out from this
I've done my share of helping with your defense
But now I can't dismiss
It's killing me
Hometown of mine
Just got back from the boulevard, can't stop crying
The guy at the corner shop gave me a line and a smile
I know he was trying
But a lie is a lie

On these days, these days, I can't win
These days, I can't see no visions
I'm breaking, losing faith
These days, these days
(These days, these days)
These days, these days
(These days, these days)

New York is cold
I tried the winter there once, nope
Clearly the greatest city in the world
But it was not my home
I felt more alone
These days, these days, I can't win
These days, I can't see no visions
I'm breaking, losing faith
These days, these days
(These days, these days)
I'm thinking about leaving

Sometimes I speed down Crescent Heights
I can't hardly feel it running every light
But I wasn't fazed 'cause it wasn't mine
Was I just dreaming?
And every time I think I might (Send my love, send my tears)
(Waving back to my fears)
Leave this city for the first time (City of mine)
I wake up on the other side (Send my love, send my tears)
Oh-oh (Waving back to my fears)
Wondering, "Was I just dreaming?" (City of mine)
"Was I just dreaming?" (Send my love, send my tears)
Oh-oh (Waving back to my fears)
(City of mine)
"Was I just dreaming?"1Embed
