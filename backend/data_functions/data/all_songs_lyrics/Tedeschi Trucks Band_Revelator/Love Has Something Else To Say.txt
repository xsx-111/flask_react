Love Has Something Else To Say LyricsI know you know right from wrong
It don't change a thing, just the same old song
But you know I see you bring it on yourself
When I point at you, yeah, it comes back to me
Ain't no reason to hold it all inside
It all makes sense when you realize
Love has something else to say
When you go on changing my mind
Now that we have found our way
When you go on changing our minds
Can't trust your head, you can't trust in him
You can't fight the feeling that you put away
It's all the same, it's always up and down
Ain't nothing changed except a change in time
Ain't no reason to hold it all inside
All makes sense when you realize
Love has something else to say
When we go on changing our minds
Now that we have found our way
When we go on changing our mind
Ain't no reason, ain't no reason to change
When you're on the right track
I know it's hard now, know it's hard to do right
When you want to do wrong
Ain't no reason, ain't no reason to change
When you're on the right track
I know that it is hard, I know it's hard to do it right
When you want to do wrong
Love has something else to say
When we go on changing our minds
Now that we have found our way
When we go on changing our minds
Love has something else to say
When we go on changing our minds
Love, love, love, love
When we go on changing our minds
Love has something else to say
When we go on changing our minds
Love has something else to say
When we go on changing our minds
Love, love, love, love
When we go on changing our minds
Love has something else to say
When we go on changing our mindsEmbed
