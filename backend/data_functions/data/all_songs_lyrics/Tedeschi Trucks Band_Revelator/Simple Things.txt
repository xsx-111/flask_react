Simple Things LyricsWhen you look into the mirror
Are you proud of what you see?
Do you take it all for granted?
Do you have all that you need?
Now I don't want to tell you
That I've heard it all before
'Cause I've been taking
More than I've been giving
And underneath my shadow
There's so much that lies in store
Simple things
Make it all worth living
Looking for life without sorrow
Love without pain
So you've built these walls around you
To protect all that you own
You have kept out what's important
How's it feel to be all alone?
I don't want to tell you
That I've heard it all before
'Cause I've been taking
More than I've been giving
And underneath my shadow
There's so much that lies in store
Simple things
Make it all worth living
I don't claim to know the answers
I just know I could do much more
No excuses anymore
Now I've opened up my window
Hear the children on the street
Love has stolen all the bitterness
And sent it off with the breezeEmbed
