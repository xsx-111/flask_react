Come See About Me Lyrics
Tired of waiting on you
After all we've been through

If you want me still
I know I can do for you
Anything you want me to
So why don't you come see about me?
Come see about me, baby
Come see about me, yeah

Time is wasting away
After all, it's been a long day, and
     
If you want me still
I know I can do for you
Anything you want me to
So why don't you come see about me?
Come see about me, baby
Come see about me, yeah
If you want me still
I know I can do for you
Anything you want me to
So why don't you come see about me?
Come see about me, baby
Come see about me, yeahEmbed
