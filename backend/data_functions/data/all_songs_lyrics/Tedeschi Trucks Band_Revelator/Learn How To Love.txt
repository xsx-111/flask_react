Learn How To Love Lyrics
Tired of living without
When others have so much
If I could find someone
To bring that loving touch
All this time's been wasted
No more words to spare
And if I knew how to love
I would take you there

I won't let go
And I won't give up
I'm gonna learn how to love you
I'm gonna show you somehow

If my time is over
Can I learn how to give?
Can I throw down this chain
And find a new way to live?
Though it won't be easy
All I need is a friend
And with you here by my side
I'm ready to start again
I won't let go
And I won't give up
I'm gonna learn how to love you
I'm gonna show you somehow
I won't let go
And I won't give up
I'm gonna learn how to love you
I'm gonna show you somehow

I will know you
When I see you in my dreams
So take my hand and follow me
To ecstasy

I'm gonna learn how to love you
I'm gonna show you somehow
Gonna love you
Tell me how
Gonna love you
Gonna love you now
Love you
Gonna love you
Gonna love you
Gonna show you howEmbed
