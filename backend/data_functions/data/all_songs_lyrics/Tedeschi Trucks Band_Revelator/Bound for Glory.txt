Bound for Glory LyricsTell your story
Roll the truth around your head
Bound for glory
I ain't getting out of this bed
The sun comes struggling on
Yesterday's dead and gone
Tell your story
Put the night back in your veins
Bound for glory
I ain't coming to again
The sun comes struggling on
Yesterday's dead and gone
And I feel I'm bound for glory
Dreaming in a cowboy song
I feel I'm bound for glory
Can you feel it?
Bound for glory!
Can you feel it?
Glory bound!Embed
