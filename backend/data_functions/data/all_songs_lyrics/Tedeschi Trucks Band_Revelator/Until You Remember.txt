Until You Remember LyricsEvery night I pray
That you'll come back today
And hold me like you used to do
Every night I spent
Just waiting on your scent
Needing just a trace of you
Well, I know it ain't refined
But I'll hold your place in line
Until you remember that you're mine
It's not my first mistake
I'm sleeping wide awake
You know I can't think straight about you
And it's nothing that I planned
To let you slip through my hands
I'm burning with a love that's turned blueEmbed
