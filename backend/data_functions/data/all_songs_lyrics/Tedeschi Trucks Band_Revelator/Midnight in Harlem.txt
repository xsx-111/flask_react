Midnight in Harlem Lyrics
Well, I came to the city
I was running from the past
My heart was bleeding
And it hurt my bones to laugh
Stayed in the city
No exception to the rules, to the rule
He was born to love me
I was raised to be his fool, oh his fool

(Walk that line) Walk that line
(Torn apart) Torn apart
Gotta spend your whole life trying
(Ride that train) Ride that train
(Free your heart) And free your heart
It's midnight up in Harlem

I went down to the river
And I took a look around
There were old man's shoes
There were needles on the ground
No more mysteries, baby
No more secrets, no more clues
The stars are out there
You can almost see the moon
The streets are windy
And the subway's closing down
Gonna carry this dream
To the other side of town

(Walk that line) Walk that line
(Torn apart) Torn apart
Gotta spend your whole life trying
(Ride that train) Ride that train
(Free your heart) And free your heart
It's midnight up in Harlem1Embed
