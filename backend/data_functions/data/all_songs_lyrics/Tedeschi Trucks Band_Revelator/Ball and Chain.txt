Ball and Chain LyricsHallelujah, we got some rain
Yeah, we prayed for mud
To the low ground of yesterday
Comes the flood
I'm so lucky
My pride and joy
Is my ball and chain
And they're one and the same
Thought I was bound to get away
Now I'm just bound
I don't mind when the hurricane
Comes aroundEmbed
