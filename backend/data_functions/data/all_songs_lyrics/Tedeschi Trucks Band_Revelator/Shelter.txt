Shelter LyricsThey made their promises
Then they walked away
Fair-weather friends
Are gone for good
You never cared about
What others had to say
And through it all
You understood
You are my prayer in times of trouble
I'll be your answer when you call
Shelter you, shelter me
Wake up, but keep dreaming
That you were born to fly
When your heart is heavy
Like a stone
I'll lift your burden high
Until you realize
That through the storm
You soldiered on
You showed me that your actions
Speak louder than your wordsEmbed
