These Walls LyricsShe wakes up in the morning
To a kettle on the stove
Peeling wallpaper
House next to a dusty road
She prays, oh Lord
Don't let these walls fall down
'Cause she's got no money
But she works like hell
She loved him like a lady
Never did her too well
She prays, oh Lord
Don't let these walls fall down
'Cause it's been so damn hard
Since her man left town
Says, I've been thinking
'Bout you, baby
For such a long, long time
She can't help but wonder
On those rainy Saturdays
Where he is and where he's been
Is another trapped in his haze?
She prays, oh Lord
Don't let these walls fall down
'Cause she's not lonely
And she's learned to get along
How many years will it take
Before he is really gone?
She prays, oh Lord
Don't let these walls fall down
'Cause it's been so damn hard
Since her man left town
Says, I've been thinking
'Bout you, baby
For such a long, long timeEmbed
