Cast Off Lyrics
Cast off from the shadows
Cast off from the bricks when they fall
I need some attention
It's all that you're focused on


Take off if you're willing
Speak out if you know that you are
Unable to follow
Silly rabbits gotta run 'cause they're prey

Sell it to me
Eloquently
There's no room left to do
Everything that you said you'd do
Break out the rats
It's not coming back
There's no room left to do
Everything that you said you'd doEmbed
