Refute Lyrics
This is a verse about a man who dared
To fall head over heels for a woman who shared
Similar interests, similar looks
Similar taste in similar books
Lost in the riddle of her Southernish eyes
Paint-on lips and French knee highs
The world was telling him love is dead
But he's turning that logic on its head

Marry on
Marry on and you will know
Marry on

This is a verse about a woman who dared
To fall head first for her young au pair
Middle-class values and normalcy
To her that was so last century
She wooed her with Ritalin and drugged Nehi
Egon Schiele prints and French fries
The kind of story made for the stage
The kind of story, just jumps of the page
I tell you
Marry on
Marry on and you will know
Marry on

Marry on, children
But be aware, the world doesn't want you anymore

I know you'd like to refute all I say
I know you'd like to refute all I say
I know you'd like to refute
All that I have shared today2Embed
