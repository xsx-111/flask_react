Shiggy LyricsCome from the underground
Throw me right back where I belong
I got no time for this
Sir!
Whenever forever
All right
You've seen the blind opinions
You've seen them walking so damn tall
I'd like to be your best friend
Whenever forever
All right
Don't speak your dumb wisdom
I'm not so easily confused
I've been the runaround
Sir!
Take it forever
All right
You got the sticks a-talking
You've got a fine imagination
Of all the minor slaves
It's taking forever
Nobody sees it
Nobody stares
It's part of the reason
Part of the dare1Embed
