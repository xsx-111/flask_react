Kite LyricsMomentarily amused by
Intellectual wolves like that
Over and done with
Intellectual wolves like that
Intellectual wolves like that
Hiding out
Flying lower than a kite shoved in the closet
No deposit, no return
Just right now
I'm not looking for the kind of guy who'll turn my third place medal into gold
Love maneuvers on the omnibus
Pairing up in lab coats for that frog dissection
Look at his guts
Holy ghost
Am I just another milepost on the ascension to wherever you roll?
You take it from the back side
Love is open wide
Uh-huh
Just right now
I'll start looking for the kind of guy who turns my third place medal into gold
Why you gotta ask?
Why don't you just know?
Why you gotta ask?
Why don't you just know?
The time has come and passed
And now I gotta go1Embed
