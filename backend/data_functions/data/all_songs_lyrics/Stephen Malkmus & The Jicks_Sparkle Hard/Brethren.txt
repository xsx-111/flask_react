Brethren Lyrics
Such a fine life, relenting and good for the most part up to now
Though you know it could all fall apart
In an instant, come crashing down
The song and dance, it's part of the trance
I don't know when I picked it up
The avoidance drips from your chin

You'll never win with the brethren (brethren)
Brethren (brethren)
Brethren (brethren)

Headlock

So you flip-flop over again
To the dark side of the coliseum
Down into a hole, into the cellar, here we go
Peruse the data and you will see
I am correct, now notice me
An invitation to be a star

You know you are with the brethren
Brethren
Brethren
Brethren
Headlock
Before you get booed off the stage
Find a door that opens out
And skip the pleasantries
Pretend the crowd is Germany
See ya later
Hey buddy, know you are the audience 
The situation's never in doubt

Just hear me out with the brethren
Brethren
Brethren
