Bike Lane LyricsAnother beautiful bike lane
Another beautiful bike lane
The cops, the cops that killed Freddie
Sweet, young Freddie Gray
Got behind him with their truncheons
And choked the life right out of him
His life-expectancy was max 25
Go, Freddie, go
Another beautiful bike lane
Another beautiful bike lane
Poor cops, they're so busy
Shuttling the miscreants
From the streets, to the station
And now they've got an audience
Kick off your jackboots, it's time to unwind
Freddie, go
Another beautiful bike lane
Another beautiful bike lane
Another beautiful bike lane
(Another beautiful bike lane, beautiful)
Another beautiful bike lane
(Another beautiful bike lane, beautiful)
Another beautiful bike lane
(Another beautiful bike lane, beautiful)
Another beautiful bike lane
And another, and another, and another
(Another beautiful bike lane, it's beautiful)1Embed
