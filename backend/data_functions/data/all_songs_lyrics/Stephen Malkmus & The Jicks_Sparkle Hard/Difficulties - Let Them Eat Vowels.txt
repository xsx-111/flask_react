Difficulties / Let Them Eat Vowels LyricsDifficulties
I'll be there for the lowest lows
And most of the highs
Ever evolving
Well, talk is cheap, I know
And actions, they speak volumes
Louder than a plane
Rocks all, deadline chaser!
Obstacles around the bend
Your exquisite bend
Nobody warned me
It's like you really care, I know
Something about someone
Close to you is well
Rocks all, deadline chaser!
Dif-fi-cul-ties
Dif-fi-cul-ties
Dif-fi-cul-ties
Di-fi
Di-fi
Let Them Eat Vowels
High openness and vanilla bliss
Real recognizes real
Urbanity for the 
In the eye of the beholder
Let's try to be a gentle man sir
Let's luck out together
I can bend this spoon with my liquid tunes
And fuck you like a feather
No one will care to love, with time
When you get by, you might decide
You can't abide to fight the fight
You got some demons on your breath
Microaggress, you must confess
You need a foil, you want to spoil
All we have made
A cavalcade of reacting morality (no no no no no no)
It's a cattle crawl
Top drawer, rent seeker
High floor, no weaker
You're a highbrow omnivores
Come on
Some more, some more, some more, some more
Some more, some more, some more, some moreEmbed
