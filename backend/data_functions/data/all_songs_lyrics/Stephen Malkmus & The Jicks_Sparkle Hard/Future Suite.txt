Future Suite LyricsRun along, good vibrations
Like a bee in the sun
Be a song of elation
That was meant to be sung
By a band you invented
When the night was so young
Time was meant to be savored
By the last ones that got stung
What is money, but potential well-being
Pressed into a material form
But if you journey to that jive orbit
You'll be wanting it more and more
But the future allows vexation
With synthetic cosmic dust
I'm at peace with my mentors
I cannot avoid their thrust to
Come before the lash
Before the critters come
Before my time, we'll see
Everybody knows that he's coming out the execution tree
Come, before the lash
Before the critters, come
Before my time, we'll see
Everybody knows that he's coming out the execution treeEmbed
