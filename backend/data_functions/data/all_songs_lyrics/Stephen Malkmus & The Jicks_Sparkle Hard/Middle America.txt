Middle America Lyrics
Blame stops until you do
Blame stops until you do
Do your major duty
And crawl right back again

Time gets to me and I
The heir apparent just might try
You know you should be winning
Time won't wait for you
To grow

Crush me back to where I belong
Hold me down there anchor strong
Fill me up 'til I overflow
In the wintertime
In the wintertime
When we get down to it
You wanted to

Arms never get on top
You heed that notion and you'll drop
I will not be one of the watchers
I will not disappear
Time gets to me and I
Wonder how to simplify
You know you should be blushing
To a hue of Robitussin
Flow

Men are scum, I won't deny
May you be shit-faced the day you die
And be successful in all your lies
In the wintertime
In the wintertime
When we get down to it
You wanted to

Do you think you got the nerve?
It doesn't take much nerve
Just kiss yourself metaphorically
And open the door and piss if you need to

Gonna get it when it's hot
Come and get it, ready or not
It fits in your grip, such a feminine trip
Revel in the rubber pavilion
Of gold
Captured in a mason jar
Will you be my whisper unnamed star?
In a galaxy so far far far
From the wintertime
From the wintertime
From the wintertime
Wandering through2Embed
