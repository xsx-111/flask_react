Rattler Lyrics
You remind me of
Facebook too/due
Such a fine parrot
You're a bottle I could use
Finding out
Spot that 
We all wanna want it
Water park, you're due

Try me out
Just for kicks
Faint resistance
Are desperate, my friend
Think it out, take a pick
It's a great existence
Such a fine fine mess you're inEmbed
