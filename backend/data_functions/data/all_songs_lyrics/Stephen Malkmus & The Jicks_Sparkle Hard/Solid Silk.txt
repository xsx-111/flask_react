Solid Silk LyricsMake up an innocent, average girl
Kissing under prairie moon, no one knows
She's so amazing
Love and poverty, wealth and hate
How you gonna beat it out if you don't know?
You don't have to forget
Pile into Jackie, he's up for it
He'll never see the butter-side of his daily bread
Colored lucky fiscal plague, information, dust
Piled over everyone
Everyone of us
It's a violation
Numbskull chip off of some old block
Dagger glances for the kid, he's running off
It's so contagious
He'll step on you if you talk too true
Rubber bullets for the clown
It's slug-eat-slug
It's annihilation
Scratched out a doggerel verse or two
To set you back on your way, back to you
In a minute
Cynical pinnacles, we swung too high
Flaccid as a wedding cake, but tight makes right
With a kiss goodnight1Embed
