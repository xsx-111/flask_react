Gap Lyrics
So put a spanner in the works of your mind
It’s easier to work but I don’t mind
You’re better in defeat so just don’t try
To take away all the things so dear in my life

I have to break down all the corners of the world
Don’t heap this praise on me, I know I don’t deserve it
But what’s all this I see? Yeah, you’re leaving right beside me
And I miss you and I need you and I do

But don’t go and take my love
I won’t let you, I’m saying please don’t go
Don’t go, take my love
I won’t let you, I’m saying please don’t go

Well, leave your lover now, it’s your turn
And see your mother now, I hope she’s okay
You’re better in defeat so let’s not try
To take away all the things so dear in our lives

I have to break down all the corners of the world
Don’t heap this praise on me, I know I don’t deserve it
But what’s all this I see? Yeah, you’re leaving right beside me
And I miss you and I need you and I do
But don’t go and take my love
I won’t let you, I’m saying please don’t go
Don’t go, take my love
I won’t let you, I’m saying please don’t go

All of my life trying to understand
All of my life trying to hold a hand


I have to break down all the corners of this world
Don’t heap this praise on me, I know I don’t deserve it
What’s all this I see? Yeah, you’re leaving right beside me
And I miss you and I love you and that's true3Embed
