Do You Wanna Lyrics
I was hoping that you had an atlas in your head
So fed up of the same old man
There's broken bedrooms and there are broken hands
You were so fed up of the same old broken man

Do you wanna, do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Oh, I came to tell you that you're my favourite girl
And would you like it if I put you into my world?
There's broken hearts in the basement and broken love on the street
Are you so fed up of it always involving me?

Do you wanna, do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Do you want, do you want to
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you want to, babe, I know you want to
I know you want to make love to me
Do you wanna, do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, babe, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me
Do you wanna, do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me1Embed
