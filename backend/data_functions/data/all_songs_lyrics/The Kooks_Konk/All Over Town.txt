All Over Town Lyrics
Dear sir, did I see you fleeting?
I care for your heart but not for it beating
You tried to put a frown on me, fell me down
You're spreading bad things about me all over town
But I'll show no frown

Because all over town
Yes, all over town
There are people who would undermine you if they could
Don't let them in

What do you see when you see me, sir?
The very same thing that makes you bitter
So you'll say all these outrageous things, that's what you do
Yes, but you're no poet, man, you just want everyone looking at you
So I'll show no frown

Because all over town
Yes, all over this town
There are people who would undermine you if they could
Don't let them in

Oh, all over town
Yes, all over this town
There are people who would undermine me if they could
Won't let them in1Embed
