Vicious Lyrics
All in my head with thoughts of the Underground
On my way to see you again
'Cause we've been on this leg so goddamn long
It's hard to see it has an end
Oh, it does have an ending

But I'm so vicious, dear, to you
Although you never give me problems
And you're so kind, so warm to me
In my head, there's so many questions
Won't you go? Don't be my slave, girl
I wouldn't have it that way
You're so kind, I'm out of my mind, dear

Yes, I do, girl, I do, I want to go to Chelsea
Oh, just to talk and feel you
'Cause you've been hiding, oh, you've been hiding out
But I'm coming back there to get you
Yes, I'm coming to get you

But I'm so vicious, dear, to you
Although you never give me problems
And you're so kind, so warm to me
In my head, there's so many questions
Won't you go? Don't be my slave, girl
I wouldn't have it that way
You're so kind, I'm out of my mind, dear
(The cities don't know) I can't get
Well, I'm coming back there to get you
Oh, I'm coming to get you

But I'm so vicious, dear, to you
Although you never give me problems
And you're so kind, so warm to me
In my head, there's so many questions
Won't you go? Don't be my slave, girl
I wouldn't have it that way
You're so kind, I'm out of my mind, dearEmbed
