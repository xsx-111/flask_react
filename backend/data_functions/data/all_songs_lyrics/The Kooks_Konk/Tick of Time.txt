Tick of Time Lyrics
But oh, honey, please, don't shed no tears
As long as I'm here

It's far too early in the morning to be trying to call you
And far too early in the daytime to be thinking about that
But I (but I), but I (but I), but I am

What did I do in a past life, oh, to deserve this?
Yeah, the way I make myself
He's far too innocent to be a part of such a cruel world
And it is, and it is (and it) and it is

And so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride
Hoping I could write her a rhyme
That might stop the tick of time
Get off this situation and feel fine
Get off this situation and feel fine

What did I do to deserve her love?
I have to ask myself
When I am such a bad man but only to her
(Only to her, only) only to her
Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride
Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride
Wishing, hoping I can rhyme her a rhyme
That might stop the tick of time
Get off this situation and feel fine
Get off this situation and feel fine1Embed
