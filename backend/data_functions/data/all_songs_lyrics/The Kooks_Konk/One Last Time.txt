One Last Time Lyrics
Can I hold you one last time?
To fight the fear that is growing in my mind
I know I did us both all so wrong
I know I'm not always all that strong
A, B, C, D, E, F and G
Oh, that reminds me of when we were free
Before life began to tear us apart
Remember those classes when we thought we were so smart?

Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh

We were lovers in every way
Left school together, went back to my place
Now I can hardly remember her face
Before I met her I was sad

Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh

And can I hold you one last time?
To fight this fear that is growing in my mind2Embed
