Stormy Weather Lyrics
Yes, I like stormy weather
From my window sill
But you ain't, yeah, you ain't so clever
You got it all made up

But it feels like love, love, love
Oh, yes and it feels like touch, touch, touch

I sit around to pass the time
I try to get it off my mind
And I live in a world oh, so small
That I can't get around at all

But it feels like love, love, love
Oh, yes and it feels like touch, touch, touch

What did I say? What did I say?
What did I say? Oh, I didn't mean it
What did I do, oh, to hurt you?
I didn't mean it, oh, woah, I didn't mean it
I'm not saying that it's all made up
There's people there to comb your hair
But I'll seek out another soul
One girl that's so beautiful

But it feels like love, love, love
Oh, yes and it feels like touch, touch, touch

What did I say? What did I say?
What did I say? Oh, I didn't mean it
What did I do, oh, to hurt you?
I didn't mean it, oh, woah, I didn't mean it

And it feels like love, love, love
Yes and it feels like touch, touch, touch
Yes and it feels like love, love, love
Yes and it feels like touch, touch, touch
Oh, yes and it feels like love, love, love
Oh, yes and it feels like touch, touch, touch

Oh, yes and it feels like love, love, love
Oh, yes and it feels like love, love, loveEmbed
