Sway Lyrics
Say whatever you have to say, I'll stand by you
And do whatever you have to do to get it out
And not become a reactionary to hurt the ones you love
You know you never meant to but you did
Oh yeah, you did
Be whoever you have to be, I won't judge you
And sing whatever you have to sing to get it out
And not become a recluse about your house, come out
I know you never meant to but you did
Oh, but you did

Still I need your sway
'Cause you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul
'Cause you're always soulful
And I, and I need your heart
'Cause you're always in the right places

And take whatever you have to take, you know I love you
And come however you have to come
And get it out and get it out
And t-t-t-t-take it out on me and take it out on me
I'd give it you all, I'd give it you all, I'd give it
I'd give it you all, I'd give it you all, yes, I would give it you all
'Cause I need your sway
'Cause you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul
'Cause you're always soulful
And I, and I need your heart
'Cause you're always in the right places


Oh, oh yes, you know
I would give it you all

Still I need your sway
'Cause you always pay for it
And I, and I need your soul
'Cause you're always soulful
And I, and I need that heart
'Cause you're always in the right places8Embed
