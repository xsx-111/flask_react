Bad Taste in My Mouth Lyrics
The night's just getting longer
Oh, am I still lonely?
Yeah, the days are getting slower
For some reason, I'm still lonely

Now I've got everything I've wanted
There's still a bad taste in my mouth
And now I've found all the things that I've wanted
There's still a bad taste in my mouth

See, I sent away my baby
I sent her packing without a chain
So now she ain't my baby
Yeah, but I still love her all the same

Now I've got everything I've wanted
There's still a bad taste in my mouth
And now I've found all the things that I've wanted
There's still a bad taste in my mouth

So take me down there tonight
And feed me liquor
I don't want pain tonight
Where do I run to?
Where do I run to now that I've lost you?
Yeah, you, yeah
Now I've got everything I've wanted
There's still a bad taste in my mouth
And now I've found all the things that I wanted
There's still a bad taste in my mouth
There's still a bad taste in my mouth
There's still a bad taste in my mouthEmbed
