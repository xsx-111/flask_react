Mr. Maker Lyrics
Mr. Maker, he's got it made
A beautiful wife and a baby on the way
And his bills are already paid
No need to scrimp, no need to save
But all around him the world grows hard
He thinks to himself he must have played a lucky card
If he was alone he'd give it all away
To people and things that he wanted to save

But oh no, it's alright, Mr. Maker, he'll be fine
It's alright, it's okay, because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Doesn't stop to think that it's because of he
Always doing right, he stays healthy
The girls in the alleys won't get hold of him
He's got no time for that kind of sin
And he, he's not a member of the Catholic Church
The pastor of his town got sent down for dirt
He sees the boys from Sunday school
It's hard to believe what he read in the morning news

But oh no, it's alright, Mr. Maker, he'll be fine
It's alright, it's okay, because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Heartbeat, stay heavy
Love us all please, stay on your feet for me, for me
Stay on your feet for me, for me
Stay on your feet for me

But oh no, it's alright, Mr. Maker, he'll be fine
It's alright, it's okay, because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah, oh yeah2Embed
