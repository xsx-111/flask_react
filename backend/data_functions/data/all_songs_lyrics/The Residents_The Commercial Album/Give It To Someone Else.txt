Give It To Someone Else Lyrics
I wanted to give it to someone else
And hear what they would say
I wanted to give it to someone else
And watch them as they played

I left it helpless all alone
And waiting on the floor
Squirming just a little bit
And looking at the door
He would take it as he wished
And I would listen in
Documenting as I would
The sound of slapping skin

I wanted to give it to someone else
And hear what they would say
I wanted to give it to someone else
And watch them as they played
I wanted to give it to someone else
And watch them as they playedEmbed
