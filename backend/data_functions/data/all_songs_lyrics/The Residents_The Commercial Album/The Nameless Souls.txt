The Nameless Souls Lyrics
She was just uncaring
She was just untrue
She was just indifferent
What else could she do?

I was just a stranger
I was just subdued
I was just uneasy
What else could I do?

We were just the nameless
Souls that sit inside
Wishing that we were
Someone on the outside
Wishing that we were
The ones on the outside
Wishing that we weren't
The ones who were stuckEmbed
