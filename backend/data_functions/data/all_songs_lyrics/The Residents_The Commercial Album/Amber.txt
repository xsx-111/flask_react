Amber Lyrics
Life is just a situation
Life is just a game
Life is just a whirlwind
And it's calling out my name

Amber were the autumn leaves
And amber was her skin
Amber was the evening
When the whirlpool pulled her in
It was irresistible
Was what she used to say
Like the sound of running horses
Early in the dayEmbed
