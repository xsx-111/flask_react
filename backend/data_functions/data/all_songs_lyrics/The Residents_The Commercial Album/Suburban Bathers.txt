Suburban Bathers Lyrics
Suburban bathers own the sea
But just between you and me
The sun has never fully set
That's seen the bather fully wet

I see the sea
The sea sees me

They seem to run to morning light
And crash the boards between the night
If they'd learn to love themselves
They might survive the murky depths

I see the sea
The sea sees me

If I'd learn to love myself
I might survive the murky depthsEmbed
