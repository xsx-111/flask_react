My Work Is So Behind Lyrics
Smoke was feeling up the house
A burning yearning heat
The cats were watching through the haze
And licking at their feet
They were licking at their feet

A caller came and looked at me
And asked me if I'd mind
I said I would not normally
My work is so behind
I'm just way behind

The fire it sparkled in his smile
And then beneath his skin
And so he jumped right in right in
And so he jumped right inEmbed
