The Talk Of Creatures Lyrics
Mumbling weighs upon my mind
The talk of creatures in my spine

A contest fought between two souls
To know which thought that each controls
They argue deep into the night
Displaying wrongs, inciting rights
They sing their songs with unknown tones
And keep the beat upon my bonesEmbed
