Act Of Being Polite Lyrics
I found her crying in the morning sitting in a chair
She was wrapping something up and wrapping it with care

I did not mean to hurt her when I fell asleep last night
I was just exhausted from the act of being polite
Oh yes I was just exhausted from the act of being polite1Embed
