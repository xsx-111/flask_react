When We Are Together LyricsOh, I remember you said can I fight and breathe
So now I always, always hold my breath you see
You're my heaven, you're my spaceman in your shiny shiny suit
I'll send up all my prayers and hope they're understood
Love started making sense
I always make mistakes at my expense
Love has placed a seed
And you're the sun that shines down upon me
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
It's been too long since I've tried to take the time
So now I'm fallin', fallin' into the sublime
When you brush against a stranger
And you both apologise
And when you see in them something you recognise
Love started making sense
I always make mistakes at my expense
Love has placed a seed
And you're the sun that shines down upon me
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelingsEmbed
