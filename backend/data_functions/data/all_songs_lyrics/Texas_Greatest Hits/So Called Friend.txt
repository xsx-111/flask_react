So Called Friend LyricsYeh I'm gonna make you wonder if you're my friend
Yeh I'm gonna make you wonder if you're my friend
Yeh that's the way I choose them, all my friends
Do you think you're close with all your promises
Do you think I act strange when you talk to me
It's cause I don't see you
Yeh I'm gonna make you wonder if you're my friend
Yeh I may as well tell you, you'll never be my friend
Aah that's the way I choose them, all my friends
The telephone only rings when you've got success
You only want us when we're at our best
But we don't hear you
Yeh I'm gonna make you wonder if you're my friend
It isn't our fault that your life's depressed
We've listened and we've learned
That all of the words that you say
Yeh all of the words that you say
Mean nothing
Yeh I'm gonna make you wonder if you're my friendEmbed
