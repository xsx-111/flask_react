Put Your Arms Around Me LyricsAre you ready maybe
Are you willing to run
Are you ready to let yourself drown
Are you holding your breath
Are you ready or not
Are you ready maybe
Do you long to confess
Do you feel that you're already known
Are you sure of yourself
Would you lie if you're not
You tire me out
Don't wanna let that happen
A secret screamed so loud
Why did you let that happen
Hoo hoo so put your arms around me
You let me believe that you are someone else
Hoo hoo cause only time can take you
So let me believe
That I am someone else
Maybe, are you ready to break
Do you think that I push you too far
Would you open yourself
Are you reckless or not
You tire me out
Don't wanna let that happen
A secret screamed so loud
Why did you let that happen
Hoo hoo so put your arms around me
You let me believe that you are someone else
Hoo hoo cause only time can take you
So let me believe
That I am somewhere else
Let me believe that I am somewhere else
Sha la la la la

Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Hoo hoo so put your arms around me
Hoo hoo so put your arms around me
Make me believe
Take me take me
Somewhere
Somewhere
Let me believe
Cause only time can take you
So stopEmbed
