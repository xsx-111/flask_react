Guitar Song LyricsI feel bad and beautiful, in all the strangest places
You feel good, your sweet taste, the weather's
Changing as I look at your face
Falling, fall to the floor, falling, you know we can
Haven't had a dream in such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day
So many songs, in my mind
Maybe that's cause I've drunk so much wine
There's lights in your eyes
But out the window, it's gone dark outside
Falling, fall to the floor, falling, you know we can
Haven't had a dream in a such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day
Haven't had a dream in a such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day
It'll be alright, if you stay tonight
Haven't had a dream in a such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all dayEmbed
