So in Love with You LyricsI'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
Whether it is right or it's wrong
I'm too weak to be strong
I'm so in love with you
Well you say you need something
To help you when you're down
To take your fears away
Yeah, you say you'd do anything
To keep your feet off the ground
And help you on your way, yeah
You're all that I need
Yeah, you are all that I need
I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
Whether it is right or it's wrong
I'm too weak to be strong
I'm so in love with you
And when you see your reflection
You see it isn't you
And then you turn the other way, yeah yeah
And I can watching you suffer
Yourself and your pain
So please don't fade away, yeah...
You are all that I need
Yeah, you all that I need
I'm so in love with you (I'm so in love, I'm so in love)
I'm so in love with you (I'm so in love with you)
Whether it is right or it's wrong (I'm so in love)
I'm too weak to be strong (I'm so in love)
I'm so in love with you (I'm so in love)
Yes I am...
I'm so in love (I'm so in love with you)
I'm so in love, I'm so in love (I'm so in love, with you oh yeah)
I'm so in love with you (you got to tell me)
I'm so in love with you (you know you got to tell me)
I'm so in love with you (whether it is right or worng)
I'm so in love (oooooh)

I'm so in love
I'm so in love with you (ooooh)Embed
