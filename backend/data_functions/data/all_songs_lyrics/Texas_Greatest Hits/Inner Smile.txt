Inner Smile LyricsOne, two, three, four
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah)

You gave me something like loving
And took me in so soon
You took my feelings for nothing
Came back at noon
And just maybe I'm ready
To show myself to you

So if I lose my patience
You must try to understand (try to understand)
And if I lose my patience, oh yeah
Cause you make me feel
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause you make me feel wild
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You touch my inner smile
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me in the mood
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So come on make your move and free me
You make my wishes as much as
Your kisses make me blue
If I'm a river, where will you escape away to?
But maybe, I'm ready, I'm falling into you
So if I lose my patience
You must try to understand (try to understand)
And if I lose my patience, oh yeah

Cause you make me feel
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause you make me feel wild
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You touch my inner smile
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me in the mood
So come on make your move and free me
(Free me, free me)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, yeah, yeah

Cause you make me feel
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause you make me feel wild
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You touch my inner smlie
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me in the mood
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So come on make your move
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And touch my inner smile
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come and get my inner smile
Smile, smile, ye-yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I need to be alone(oh ye-yeah)
There's times I need for you to phone (oh)
Sometimes you make me feel so high
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's times I ask myself why
Sometimes I need to be alone1Embed
