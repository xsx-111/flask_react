Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day) (Extended Mix) Lyrics
As I walk in the shadow of death
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest
Your host this eve, Mr. H-O-T
N-I-X, you get splashed with the Tec
Nobody go 'til the God say so
You got a second or more to run for the door
Before I blow back off the map, contact
You didn't know Stat' could get down like that

And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide
I can no longer run, oh no no
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide
For there's no longer fall, oh no no

All day every day

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same
About you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you
See my pinky
See my thumb
See that kid with the pump-shot-gun
Mister Mef, hold the fort most def
Cats is dead wrong
Song's too long
Mister-Big Mouth, could that be tra'
You need to dish out your style
No doubt
Shaolin strut through the Shaolin slum
Rum-pum-pum on ma Shaolin drum

And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide
I can no longer run, oh no no
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide
For there's no longer fall, oh no no

All day every day

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same
About you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you
I've said good night
Tried to sleep tight
One time for you crooked ass
Two time for your crooked ass
I just dream of being
Go close your eyes cause I've closed mine
Three time for your crooked ass, wuh
Four time for your crooked ass
Ahhhh, will you dream of me
Yeahhhh

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same
About you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
(Momma used to say be a ladies man)
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you
(All day, every day)
If you slip up get up what up when you step up to challenge
Staten Island, in the balance
What up, you smilin'
You better check yo' cal-en-der
For the Methtical slug, uh uh
John John Blazini
All day every day, with the souffle'
All you cats got to react, to jump back
Kiss yourself, 'fore you get smacked
By the my appa-ra-tus comin' through with the stat-us
Connect-in', lethal weapon, lethal injection
Visual unseen, like gene
When I had men, I'm unforgiven
Locked in prison, in the Wu-Tang dirty dungeon
You should come into my 12 bar dirty dozen
Love you to death now, kiss of death
Every body wants to do what they gotta do, to breath, try to eat
Your minds on the rhymin', dancin', runnin' in money
They get dope biz, step in the square, cats 'n' Clan over here
Playas'
Yeah, an' it's all G-O-NEE
HeheEmbed
