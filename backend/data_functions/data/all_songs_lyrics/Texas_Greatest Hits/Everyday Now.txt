Everyday Now LyricsI just woke up and I can see it now
It's never been this close before
Tried to tell myself I didn't care
Crying out why am I here
There's no point in me hiding
And only now I can see
Everyday now
Everyday now
The blame's gonna fall on me
Something deep inside said move away
Try to leave what's good behind
And I still ask myself
Why I let it go
All these years were wasted time
There's no point in me hiding
And only now I can see
Everyday now
Everyday now
The blame's gonna fall on me
Everyday now
Everyday now
The blame's gonna fall on me
Cause I never told you
That I could never live without it
Now the blame's on me
Everyday now
Everyday now
The blame's gonna fall on me
Everyday now
Everyday now
The blame's gonna fall on me
Everyday now
Everyday now
The blame's gonna fall on meEmbed
