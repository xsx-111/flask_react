Halo LyricsBright light city
You're her religion
Superstars in their own private movie
Play just like children
Lies that take her
Places she's never seen
The kiss and tell of it all
To her it seems so obscene
She's so pretty
Her hair is a mess
We all love her
To that we confess
She has a halo
We really do adore her
For she has a halo
Can we touch her
For their blindness
She sees much further
Like on a wide-screen viewing
Going down on her
She's so pretty
Her hair is a mess
We all love her
To that we confess
She has a halo
We really do adore her
For she has a halo
Can we touch her
She believes in everything
She believes in nothing, in everything
Halo, halo, halo, halo
Halo, halo, halo, halo
She has a halo
We really do adore her
For she has a halo
Can we touch her
She has a halo
We really do adore her
For she has a halo
Can we touch her
She believes in everything
She believes in nothing, in everything
She believes in everything
She believes in nothing, in everything
For she has a halo
She has a haloEmbed
