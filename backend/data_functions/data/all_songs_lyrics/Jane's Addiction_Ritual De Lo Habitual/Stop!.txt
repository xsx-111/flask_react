Stop! Lyrics
Señores y señoras:
Nosotros tenemos más influencia con sus hijos que tú tiene, pero los queremos
Creado y regado de Los Ángeles, ¡Juana's adicción!

Here we go!
No...
No way!
No one
Gonna stop
Now go!

Save the complaints
For a party conversation
The world is loaded
It's lit to pop and nobody is gonna stop

No... one
No one!
No way!
Gonna stop
Now go!
Farm people
Book wavers, soul savers
Love teachers!
Lit to pop and nobody is gonna stop

No one (Did you get control of her mind like that?)
Move on

One come a day, the water will run
No man will stand for things that he had done
Hurrah!
And the water will run

One come a day, the water will run
No man will stand for things that he had done
Hurrah!
And the water will run
Will run, oh
Will run, ohoh
Good, go!

Gimmie that!
Gimmie that, your automobile
Turn off that smokestack
And that goddamn radio
Hum... along with me
Hum along with the TV
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh no

No one's!
Gonna!
