Been Caught Stealing LyricsI've been caught stealing;
Once when I was 5...
I enjoy stealing
It's just as simple as that
Well, it's just a simple fact
When I want something
I don't want to pay for it
I walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey all right! If I get by, it's mine
Mine all mine!
My girl, she's one too
She'll go and get her a skirt
Stick it under her shirt
She grabbed a razor for me
And she did it just like that
When she wants something man
She don't want to pay for it
She walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey all right! If I get by, it's mine
Mine all mine!
We sat around the pile
We sat and laughed
We sat and laughed and
Waved it into the air!
And we did it just like that
When we want something
We don't want to pay for it
We walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey, all right! If I get by, it's mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine...4Embed
