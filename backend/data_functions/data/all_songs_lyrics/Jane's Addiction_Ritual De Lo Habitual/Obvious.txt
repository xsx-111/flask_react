Obvious LyricsHey, you don't know me! You don't know me but you just keep on looking
At me down low. Oh no! Digging something up... Digging something up...
Always digging something up... Oh no!
Hey you! I don't know you. I don't even want to, but you just kee
P
Looking at me down low. Oh no! Digging something up... Digging something
Up... Always digging something up... Oh no! And you make it so *#... Make
It so obvious...
Hey you! Fools don't fit in the boots that I tread in, but you just
Keep on looking at me down low. Oh no! Digging something up... Digging
Something up... Always digging something up... Oh no! And you make it so
*#... But do you get it? Make it so *#... You never get it. You got to owe
Me something before you know what is joke and what is up. I worked my fingers
To the bone and I won't let you stop me going up. Why do you have to make it
So!-so!-so!-so!-so! Obvious!? Oh no! Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...
