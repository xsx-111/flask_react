Classic Girl Lyrics4:05; in my neighborhood
When shots go off, no one bothers
A "POP," and a reply
"POP," and no reply...
Dinosaurs
On the quilt I wore
With a girl
Such a classic girl...
Such a classic girl...
Such a classic girl
Gives her man great ideas
Hears you tell your friends
"Hey man, listen to my great idea!"
It's true I am a villain
When you fall ill
That's probably
Because men never can be
Not like a girl
A classic girl...
Such a classic girl...
They may say
"Those were the days...,"
But in a way
You know for us these are the days
Yes, for us these are the days
And you know you're my girl!
Such a classic girl...
Such a classic girl...
Yeah for us these are the days...1Embed
