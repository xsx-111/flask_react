Bad Love LyricsI see a robbery
That's nothing new
I see a robber
Broken right in two
Bad love
Bad love
Took a little something
From the wonderland
Took a little lovin'
Love that burned his hand
Bad love
Bad love
Now here's the problem
There's nothing wrong
Compared to no love
Bad love can't be wrong
Bad love
Bad love
Bad love
Bad love
I'm in love and it don't seem bad but it don't
(unintelligible)
But it ain't bad but it ain't no good and it ain't no love and it
(unintelligible)
Jeremy Cricket's got a hold on me
(unintelligible)Embed
