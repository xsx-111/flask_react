Automatic Mojo LyricsIts righteousness is shining
It walks in ruby shoes
There's not too much of nothing
You cannot make it do
I cross the muddy river
To dig a diamond mine
I got a good thing working
On diamond mining time
Candle lights begin to glow
Automatic mojo
I got some cotton candy
I got a spool of thread
I'm gonna weave a basket
And put it on my head
Inside the mighty basket
I carry rattlesnakes
You got to be a monkey
To see the sense it makes
Candle lights begin to glow
