Look at the Rain LyricsBeen down to the corner
About once or twice
I don't know but it's been nice
I ain't got no money
I can't buy a damn thing
That I might like
Let's go down to the dime store
On some moonless night
And look at the rain
I got a shirt that cost a dollar twenty-five
I know I'm the best dressed man alive
I put it on and head down to the local dive
To put the icing on extraordinary rides
When I am done I leave 'em happy but insane
For to look at the rain
I'm a messed up torn down
Worthless bag of trouble
I take way too much
And I get right in your hair
I got a real sharp pin
With which to burst your bubble
This is trouble distribution
And I'm giving you your share
Won't tell you nothing 'cause that's my aim
But I love the rainEmbed
