Dry Rain LyricsYou said you'd make it grow
You said you'd make it green
But I see dusty fields
Broken rock is all I see
And all around me
I see your storm clouds
Another lies about to fall
It seemed like it was real
Felt like water to my skin
But I stepped through the rainbow
And saw the desert deep within
And all around me
Are roaring waters
But I won't let me
Be swept away
And all around me
I see the Pharaohs
I see collections
Of hats and gunsEmbed
