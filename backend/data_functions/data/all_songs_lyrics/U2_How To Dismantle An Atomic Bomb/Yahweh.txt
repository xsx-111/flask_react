Yahweh Lyrics
Take these shoes
Click clacking down some dead end street
Take these shoes
And make them fit
Take this shirt
Polyester white trash made in nowhere
Take this shirt
And make it clean, clean
Take this soul
Stranded in some skin and bones
Take this soul
And make it sing

Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, Yahweh
Still I'm waiting for the dawn

Take these hands
Teach them what to carry
Take these hands
Don't make a fist, no
Take this mouth
So quick to criticize
Take this mouth
Give it a kiss
Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, Yahweh
Still, I'm waiting for the dawn
Still waiting for the dawn
The sun is coming up

The sun is coming up on the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean
Oh

Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, tell me now
Why the dark before the dawn?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh

Take this city
A city should be shining on a hill
Take this city
If it be your will
What no man can own
No man can take
Take this heart
Take this heart
Take this heart
And make it break1Embed
