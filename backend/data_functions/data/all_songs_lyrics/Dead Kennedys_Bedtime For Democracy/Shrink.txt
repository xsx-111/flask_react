Shrink LyricsIf only people could shrink
Our world wouldn't be so overcrowded
Bring ourselves down to size
There'd be so much more food to go around
Why don't we build a machine
With all the know-how of the industries?
We put a man on the moon
We're gonna need more room to breathe real soon
Drink your vaccine and let's shrink
And bring your poodle so it doesn't eat us
The roads will be so wide
No traffic jams when we're half a foot tall
Bring what you need down here
We'll shrink it all by microwave
Don't want to die like dinosaurs
We'll have enough resources to go around
So now you've made the big shrink
Meanwhile we'll keep acting big
We well-bred beautiful people
Who says we have to go too?
Cops and mason businessmen
Were exempted from the ovens
As if you weren't already
The rest of you are all our termites nowEmbed
