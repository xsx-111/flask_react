Take This Job and Shove It LyricsTake this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
My woman left and took all the reasons I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way as I'm walking out the door
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
My woman left and took all the reasons I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way as I'm walking out the door
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
I've been working in this factory from now on fifteen years
All this time I've seen my woman drowning in her tears
I've seen a lot of good people die who had a lot of bills to pay
I'd give the shirt right off my back if I had the nerve to say
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
My woman left and took all the reasons I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way as I'm walking out the door
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
Well that foreman, he's a regular dog, the line boss, he's a fool
Got brand new skinhead hair cuts, thinks that he's so cool
One of these days I'll blow my top or somebody's gonna pay
I'd hate to see their faces when I get up the nerve to say
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
My woman left and took all the reasons I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way as I'm walking out the door
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more
Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here
Ain't working here
Ain't working here no moreEmbed
