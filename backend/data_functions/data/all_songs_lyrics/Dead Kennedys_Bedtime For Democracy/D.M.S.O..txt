D.M.S.O. Lyrics
D.M.S.O
Crypto wonder drug in vogue
Some people say it cures arthritis
Maybe that's why it keeps getting banned
It's absorbed directly through the skin
Mix it with lemon juice
Touch your fingertips
You'll taste the lemon

The police started a riot
Down at the courthouse again
Running amok, spilling blood
Bashing heads
I do my part behind the lines
Swabbing door handles of cop cars
With D.M.S.O
Mixed with L.S.D

D.M.S.O
D.M.S.O
