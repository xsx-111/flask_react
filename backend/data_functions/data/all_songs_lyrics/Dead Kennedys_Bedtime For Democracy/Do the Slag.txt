Do the Slag Lyrics
Have you heard about the latest craze
That's sweeping across the nation
All the punks from coast to coast
Have discovered an old invention
Your hair's too long
Man, you're a queer
You're too new wave
Put down that beer

Do the slag, look at 'em run
Do the slag, hey, you scum
Do the slag, ain't it fun?
Do the slag, let's all be dumb

Badmouth the people we don't know
Make sure it's behind their backs
Don't let new people in our scene
It's more fun than having a friend
We'll slag everyone each and every night
So we can pretend that we're all right
Make those pricks feel just so small
We'll show the world we're three feet tall
Slander their integrity
Doubt their humanity
Talk about their haircuts
Are their politics correct?
Do the slag, look at 'em run
Do the slag, hey, you scum
Do the slag, ain't it fun?
Do the slag, let's all be dumb


Don't let those sissies on the floor
They're unhip, man, they brought the wrong clothes
Let's all do the latest craze
'Cause having allies never pays
Slander their integrity
Doubt their humanity
Talk about their haircuts
Are their politics correct?

Do the slag, look at 'em run
Do the slag, ain't it fun?
Do the slag, hey, you scum
Do the slag, let's all be dumb
Do the slag, look at 'em run
Do the slag, ain't it fun?
Do the slag, hey, you scum
Do the slag, let's all be dumbEmbed
