Triumph of the Swill LyricsWe came home and found our son lying dead on his bed of a gunshot wound. He had is headphones on and there was an Ozzy record on the turn table. So we called our lawyer
Life can only better
All you need to do is fall in love
Everyone else has fun but you
Buy that fun, you'll fit in too
Dance your problems away, government music
Cheap escape to that mind control beat, government music
Mellow out, life's too hard
You won't even want to think
See the macho cock-rock metal heroes
Vomit fire out of their big mouths
Shake your fists obediently
Make Leni Riefenstahl real proud
See the Aryan bozo with the red guitar
Parachute on the White House lawn
Gonna bomb the commies with his air guitar
So dumb he can't drive 55
Like Bing Crosby before them, government music
Too idiotic to be real, government music
You want it loud?
We'll make sure it goes nowhere so you won't get ideas
Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swill
Music is banned in Khomeini's Iran
On the grounds that it stimulates the brain
We've done him one better in the land of coke and honey
Using music to put people's brains to sleep
Ever wonder why commercial radio's so bad?
It's 'cause someone upstairs wants it that way
If The Doors or John Lennon were getting started now
The industry wouldn't sign 'em in a million years
So what do we get? Government music
Christian censorship and taxed blank tapes, government music
Shoppers strung out on our false hopes
Will flock to obey
Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swillEmbed
