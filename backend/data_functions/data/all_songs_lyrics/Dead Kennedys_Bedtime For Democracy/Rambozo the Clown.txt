Rambozo the Clown LyricsWe got a deadly toy to brainwash your boy
An egocentric muscle thug kicks butt on screen like a bat out of hell
Bullshitter in the Indochina shop, pull the string in his back, we win the war
That we never should have started at all
A cabbage patch terrorist to call our own
Who rewrites history with a machine gun
Don't think about it, kill it
That's what we teach your child
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo the clown
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo the clown
To draft age kids it sure looks fun
Kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out
Like video games, no mess, just fuel for a mass lapse of common sense
You can be Don Quixote, we'll dice you with our windmill blades
Brawn over brain means a happy ending
G.I. Joe in the cereal bowl
Gray shrapnel-flavored chewing gum
Mass murder ain't just painless now that we've made it cute
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo the clown
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo the clown
War is sexy, war is fun, iron ego, red dawn
Be a wolverine, you'll rule the hills
Just get some guns and cheerios
Any kid can conquer Libya, just steal a fighter plane
Look who came home in a wheelchair
V.A. Hospital, they don't care
We're the machine, you're just a tool
Who fell for the myth
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo the clown
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo the clown
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo the clown
Rambozo, Rambozo
Rambozo
Hey Rocky
Watch me pull a massacre out of my pants
Again?!Embed
