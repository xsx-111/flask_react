I Spy LyricsYou look at me from the back of the room
All I see is a bumbling buffoon
Head down like you don't see much
Until you move in to make your bust
I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me
Disguised like you're one of the scene
Just stand alone with no real friends
Scared people will find out who you are
Alone in the world without your telephone beeper
I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me
Curious folks ask questions of life
But you can't answer 'cause your heart's like a knife
Still you feel you sing the last song sung
You're just a heartless piece of scum with a gun
I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me
I spy
I spy
I spy
I spyEmbed
