Macho Insecurity LyricsName one thing on Earth lower than a tough guy (tough guy)
Who talks with his fists instead of using his head (his head)
Who beats the shit out of anything he can't understand
Behind the muscle mask is a scared little boy
Called macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
You can't stand yourself
Got a bitch with me, why don't you say it to my face? (my face)
It's so easy to mouth off to others, where's your proof? (your proof)
Maybe we can talk if you'd just drop your act
Nothing's ever solved by making childish threats
That's macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
You can't stand yourself
Why do you want people to be so afraid of you?
Why are you so scared of anything that's different?
No one's ever there when you need friends, you wonder why
It's because you take yourself so seriously
But being such a clown
Gives the rest of us the right to laugh
At your macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
You can't stand your
Macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
You can't stand yourselfEmbed
