Anarchy for Sale LyricsStep right up, folks!
Anarchy for sale
T-shirts only ten dollars, badges only $3.50
I nicked the design, never asked the band
I never listen to them either
Buy, buy, buy from Circla A
Like hula hoops, it's a disposable craze
Another fast food fad to throw away
It's anarchy for sale, anarchy for sale, anarchy for sale
Sheep unite, get your cuddly boots and studs
Be sure to rebel in the proper style
Rebel along the paths we pick
Out of fear of peer pressure we create
Hey you, get those flyers off my wall
No commie peace shit in my boutique
No one here cares what that all means
Our anarchy is for sale, anarchy for sale, anarchy for sale
Our town sucks, our scene rules
To belong you must buy into it
So we sold you metal spike bracelets
So come on, let's see a good fight
That's anarchy for sale
Anarchy for sale
