Cesspools in Eden LyricsPoison is bubbling beneath your dream home
Buried there years before
Kid runs in crying from playing in the garden
"Mommy, I burned my hands"
What's making our eyes so itchy?
Don't rub 'em, they'll swell up
Oh, it's a big waste dump
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We built your ticky-tacky houses on landfill soil
To cover up a gift we left you years before
Of toxic chemicals and leaking gas
Just dig a little while, you'll find our acid baths
Cesspools in Eden
Oozing away
Groundwater's poisoned, air stings like hell
The lines for doctors grow long
Over martinis the company laughs
We don't owe you a damn thing
But what about all these fainting spells?
How'd you like a lick from my open sores?
And oh, why are our babies stillborn?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
A storage tank's leaking, it's about to explode
Why evacuate when you can watch the fun?
Nothing happens here, get out the lawn chairs
We'll drink pink lemonade and watch Martinez burn
Cesspools in Eden
Oozing away
Leak by the day
The land we sold you is right atop our acid pits
We fill them by the truckload in the dead of night
There's a thousand more toxic tips of the iceberg
We pay a little bribe or we just don't report them
And see what you get?
Cesspools in Eden, in Eden
No accident
Just a little of our greed-fueled negligence
So you've found the proof why your cancer rate's shot up
What are you gonna do when we've got all the cards?
Times Beach, Rocky Flats, Love Canal and Bhopal
Merry Christmas, hostages, from the folks that care
Cesspools
In Eden (x4)
Have a nice dayEmbed
