Potshot Heard Round the World LyricsHey, yo, we're the United States Marines
We know you've all been killing each other for at least two thousand years
But we're here now to protect the family of
Christian heroin warlords most friendly to the west
So you knock off this fighting or we'll tell mom
Ever notice news is staged like TV wrestling shows?
With Reagans and Khaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes
Or those wildlife documentaries where a lion from a zoo
Kills a deer tied down ahead of time at the perfect camera angle
When lemmings balk at dying for Disney, they're just hurled off the cliff
We are gathered here today to take photos of the president
Pretending to mourn these brave young men who came home from Beirut
Gift-wrapped in body bags, a truck bomb blew them to bits
We knew they were sitting ducks, we sacrificed 'em, Aztec style
So we could use their dead meat to cook up war fever back home
So make sure you take lots of pictures and slant your news our way
Just like in Wild Kingdom, we first tied down the prey
We want people boiling for revenge in their living rooms
So we can go play shoot-em-up anywhere we choose
And our backers can cash in without the public asking questionsEmbed
