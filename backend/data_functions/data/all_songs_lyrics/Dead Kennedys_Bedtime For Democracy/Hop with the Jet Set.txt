Hop with the Jet Set LyricsI said come on to pleasures unknown
Where we fly to when we are all bored
Come on for the ride
When we hop with the jet set tonight
We'll sun ourselves red down in Montego Bay
Hotel-hired guards keep the natives away
We'll save the whales, go watch 'em feed
Buzz around them in boats 'til they won't breed
Just here for the ride
Then we hop with the jet set tonight
Check out them Injuns' ancestral art
Some of that would look cute up on our walls
Yeah, suits us fine
When we hop with the jet set tonight
We'll hire out some poachers to go steal their dolls
Who cares if they're sacred? They look awful cute
Nat. Geographic found a stone-age tribe
Let's feed them their first hot dogs on film
Won't that be a prize
To show to the jet set tonight?
"Aren't they cute, aren't they pure?" muse subscribers back home
Next weekend the junta exterminates them
Back home by the sea at our outdoor cafe
Our chameleon tongues catch the flies in the airEmbed
