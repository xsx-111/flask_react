Flower of the Mountain Lyrics
Yes
First I gave him a bit of seed cake out of my mouth
And it was leap year like now, yes
16 years ago, my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath, yes
He said I was a flower of the mountain, yes
So we are flowers all a women's body, yes

Stepping out off the page into the sensual world
Stepping out

And Gibraltar as a girl where I was a flower of the mountain, yes
When I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used
Or shall I wear a red, yes
And how he kissed me under the moorish wall
And I thought well as well him as another

Stepping out off the page into the sensual world
Stepping out off the page into the sensual world

And then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes
And then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower
And first I put my arms around him yes
And drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes
And his heart was going like mad and yes
I said yes I will
Yes
