All Your Yeahs Lyrics
Hush don't you cry
In the next life
She takes me to the water
Don't say a word

And when I ask her
Is she doing alright
She's a rollercoaster
And yeah, she's a fire in the night

Lay your dead flowers
All in a row
Sooner or later
We're gonna let them go

And when she asks me
Are we doing it right
Come a little closer
You've got nothing left to hide

Hush don't you cry
In the next life
And when they ask us
Are we happy inside
We're a rollercoaster
And yeah, we're a fire in the night
What can you say
All your yeahs
It's your life
Do you right
Give them love

All your yeahs
What can you say
All your yeahs
It's your life
Do you right
Give them love
And give them away2Embed
