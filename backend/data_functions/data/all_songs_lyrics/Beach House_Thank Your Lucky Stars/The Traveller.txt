The Traveller LyricsWhen I come home
You're just lying there
Face against the wall
Never had a care
I am just a traveller
There's no light in this room
And the body's aching at night
Would I be acting up
If I said it's not enough
Who knows who else who is with
No one is with the traveller
There's a light in my eyes
And a future invisible now
Heard it's your birthday
Candles in a row
Better blow them quick
Before they're melting on the floor
You were never a traveller
There's no light in your room
And the bodies don't ache in the night
Would I be acting up
If I said not that much
Who else would do anything for the traveller
There's a light in her eyes
And a future visible touch
I was looking out of the window at the sky
Starless vigil of a life that has gone by
Saturn turning and I feel there's not much more
For a vision of the night turn off your light4Embed
