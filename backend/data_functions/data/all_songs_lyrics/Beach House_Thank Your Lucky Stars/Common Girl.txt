Common Girl Lyrics
You used to live in this part of town
Until you hit the ground
She makes movies where she cries on cue
She still lives downtown

But it's okay
'Cause she's common anyway
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, pay the bills

She's the one with the lazy eye
Promises never come filled
Takes the pills and hides the notices
Cartoon rings of ill will

But it's okay
'Cause she's common in every way
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, pay the bills

Nobody special done a good thing
For somebody else
Taking advantage of that good thing
For nobody else
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)3Embed
