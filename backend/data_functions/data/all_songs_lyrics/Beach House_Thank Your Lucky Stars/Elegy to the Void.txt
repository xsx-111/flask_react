Elegy to the Void LyricsTo your sons and daughters
Bending at the altar
Disappearing in the mirror
Watch it as it burns out
(It is just a flame)
Freckle faced young virgin
(It is just a game)
Platinum vision
Bringing you down again and again
Again and again
Black clock looming distant
You're a great white
They were never listening
Waiting for the light to come again
Deep beneath the waves
Lilies of the day
Garden of remains
Diamond maiden chained
To your sons and daughters
Bending at the altar
Don't you disappear in the mirror again and again
Again and again
Deep beneath the waves
White-winged birds of May
Run from hollow hills
Walk into the night
Deep beneath the waves
Lilies of the day
Run from hollow hills
Walk into the night1Embed
