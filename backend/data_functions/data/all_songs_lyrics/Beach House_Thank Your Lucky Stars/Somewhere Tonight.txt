Somewhere Tonight Lyrics
Pink and blue were dancing
Empty floor, shadows lancing
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight

Red and blue combination
Old man finds elation
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight

Love me, see what I see tonight
Let us find elation
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight
Nowhere on an ordinary nightEmbed
