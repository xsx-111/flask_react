One Thing LyricsOne thing yeah about you
Always yeah always know
What's happening
Perfect in the morning
And you ruin it in the evening
Remarkable
When a likeness comes
You're lucky just to meet
Come down the hill
And up the stairs
She never really sleeps
Closer now in the mirror
Your reflection, my reflection
Growing nearer
Pressure oh the pressure
In confession
Hallelujah
Remarkable
When a likeness comes
You're always out of reach
The faces in the secondhand
A little fuck off kiss
Remarkable
That you're lucky just to meet
Come down the hill
Cause she never really sleeps2Embed
