The Money Will Roll Right In  Lyrics

I'm going to Hollywood
They'll see that I'm so good
I won't care how I feel
And I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields

I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

I want to be a star
I'm going to have a car
And you'll have to admit
I'll be rich as shit

I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

I would give you some
If you only would have treated me nice
You'll wish that you did
And you'll feel pretty stupid

I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in

I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in8Embed
