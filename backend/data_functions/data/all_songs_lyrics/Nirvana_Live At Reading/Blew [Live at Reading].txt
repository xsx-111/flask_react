Blew  Lyrics
Now if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to lose
And If you wouldn't care I would like to leave
And If you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

Now if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And If you wouldn't mind I would like to lose
And If you wouldn't care I would like to leave
And If you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame


Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anything
You could do anythingEmbed
