D-7  Lyrics
Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Towards anti-social
So low, so low

Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday, mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them

Dimension seven

Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Towards anti-speachal
They'll take me with them
Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday, mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them


Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them
