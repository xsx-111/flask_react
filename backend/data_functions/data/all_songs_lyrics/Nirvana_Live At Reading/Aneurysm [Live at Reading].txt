Aneurysm  Lyrics
Come on over
Do the twist (aha)
I love you so much
It makes me sick
Overdo it
And have a fit (aha)
Come on over
And do the twist (aha)

Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me

Come on over
Do the twist (aha)
Overdo it
And have a fit (aha)
I love you so much
It makes me sick
Come on over
And do the twist (aha)
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me
Beat me out of me

She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin’ straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin’ straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heartEmbed
