Leave Lyrics
I've informed you to leave
'Cause I can't afford to lose more sleep
I get ill when I get tired
So I'll try to rest if you'll stand guard

Do do do do do do do do whoa
Do do do do do do do

I've informed you to leave
'Cause I can't stand to hear you breathe
I chew up and I choke down
The scraps you choose to leave around

Do do do do do do do do whoa
Do do do do do do do

Apparitions still won't leave me alone
It's as if you never left
How am I supposed to remember you
When you won't let me forget?
I've informed you to leave
Cause I can't afford to lose more sleep
There's your shoes, and there's the door
Please don't come here anymore

Do do do do do do do do whoa
Do do do do do do doEmbed
