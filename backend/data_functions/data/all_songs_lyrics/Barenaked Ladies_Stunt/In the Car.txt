In the Car Lyrics
She fed me strawberries
And freezer-burned ice cream
I said "Goodbye, I guess"
She lifted up her dress
And so I must confess
We made out one more
Time before I left for good
She thought I'd come back but I
Wouldn't want to seem like other guys

A book-and-record love
We sat and read our books
Between those longing looks
Compounded by our fear
My tongue inside her ear
My tongue inside her
In the basement of her mother's
House where we once taped the
First three sides of Sandanista! for my car

We were looking for ourselves
And found each other
In the car
It was rare to do much more
Than simply mess around
In the car
It was mostly mutual masturbation
Though we spoke of penetration
I'd have to wait for someone else to try it out
Once I had this dream
Where I slept with her mom
Unless I've got this wrong
A secret all along
Unless she hears this song
Unless she hears it
On a tape inside her car
With her new husband and she
Turns to him and says, "I think that's me"

In the car
We were looking for ourselves
And found each other
In the car
We groped for excuses
Not to be alone anymore
In the car
We were waiting for our lives
To start their endings

In the car
We were never making love
We were never making love
We were never making loveEmbed
