Never Is Enough Lyrics
What, am I to wake up suddenly and then
Enroll at the local college, earn me a degree
And I could work weekends?
If I work real hard
I could mow your back yard
I could go to Europe, travel with my friends
I could blow a thousand deutsche marks
To get drunk in a pub with some Australians
Buy a giant backpack
Sew a flag on the back

I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
You never have to do that stuff

I never had to spend a summer planting trees
I never worked my way through a forest inch by inch
Doubled over on my hands and knees
I never spent a single day in retail
Telling people what they want to hear
Telling people anything to make a sale
Eating in the food court
With the old and the bored
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
You never have to do that stuff

The world's your oyster shell
So what's that funny smell?
You eat the bivalve anyway
You're sick with salmonella
You get your PhD
How happy you will be
When you get a job at Wendy's
And are honored with employee of the month

I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
You never have to do that stuff
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
You never have to do that stuff
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
I never want to do that stuff
I think never is enough (Yeah, never is enough)
You never have to do that stuffEmbed
