Told You So Lyrics
I never jumped in and rescued you
But I wanted to
I didn't tell you which way to go
Cause I thought you'd know
You had a problem with your new found wealth
You brought it on yourself
I never told you I told you so, but I told you so

Have to let it go
It's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will

I never told you I agreed with you
I don't think I do
I wasn't sure quite what the whole thing meant
But I'm glad you went
I never thought that it could be painless
But it is I guess
I had myself fooled into needing you
Did I fool you too?
Have to let it go
It's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will

A viral infection that can incubate for years
Caused by affection fallen deep into arrears
No medication to procure
Makes me pure, there's no cure, I am sure

I never mentioned how I've prayed for you
And now I've paid for you
I never said that I would wait for you
It's too late for you

It's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never willEmbed
