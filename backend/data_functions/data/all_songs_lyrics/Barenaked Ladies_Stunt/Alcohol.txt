Alcohol Lyrics
Alcohol, my permanent accessory
Alcohol, a party-time necessity
Alcohol, alternative to feeling like yourself
Oh alcohol, I still drink to your health

I love you more
Than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
(That's small talk)

Forget the cafe latte
Screw the raspberry iced tea
A Malibu and Coke for you, a G&T for me
Alcohol, your songs resolve like
My life never will
When someone else is picking up the bill

I love you more
Than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
Oh alcohol, would you please forgive me?
For while I cannot love myself
I'll use something else
I thought that alcohol was just for those with
Nothing else to do
I thought that drinking just to get drunk
Was a waste of precious booze
But now I know that there's a time
And there's a place where I can choose
To walk the fine line between
Self-control and self-abuse

I love you more
Than I did the week before
I discovered alcohol
Would you please ignore that you
Found me on the floor
Trying on your camisole?
Oh alcohol, would you please forgive me?
For while I cannot love myself
I'll use something else

Would you please forgive me?
Would you please forgive me?1Embed
