Filthy Rotten Scoundrel LyricsEvery days' the same for me, people come and people leave
And every days' a game for me, I'm always losing willingly
I keep telling myself, keep telling myself to be grateful
But that's not good for my health, not good for my health
Maybe my expectations let me down and I'm too far off the ground
And I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
No I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
When I'm old and lonley, I don't want my life to read
He was born and then he died and not much happened in between
Maybe my expectations let me down and I'm too far off the ground
And I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
No I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
So I'll work my way through outer space to try and set my feet on the
Ground
Maybe my expectations let me down and I'm too far off the ground
And I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
No I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
Expectations let me down and I'm too far off the ground
And I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
No I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
No I don't know what I've got 'til it's gone
No I don't know what I've got 'til it's goneEmbed
