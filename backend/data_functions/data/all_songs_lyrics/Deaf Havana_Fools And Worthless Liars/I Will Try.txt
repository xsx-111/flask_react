I Will Try LyricsSo I guess the table's turned
For the first time I can't find the words
To apologise for all the poor decisions and the lessons that I never learned
Cause I've got friends that have lost their father and they're much stronger than me
I know people who live their lives in the shadow that they're trying to be
And I will try my best to find a smile
And I will close my eyes and say i'm not afraid
And it's time that I was clear of all the negativity that I hold so dear
I lost my sight for far too long to take my mind off all my fears
But I found my way again
And I will try my best to find a smile
And I will close my eyes and say i'm not afraid
We will try our best to find a smile
And we will close our eyes and say we're not afraid
We will try our best to find a smile
And we will close our eyes and say we're not afraid
This time
I need to set aside my ways
And figure out all the things I have to changeEmbed
