Youth In Retrospect LyricsOh retrospect, It's a curse we can't prevent
And the days we loved the most have all been spent
And we smoked ourselves to an early grave, that ended with a fight
And i walked for miles and slept next to the bus shelter that night
There's a ghost down every street
In the places where we used to meet
Fifteen years i miss you far to much
There's a ghost down every street
In the places where we found our feet
Fifteen years is always old enough, So here's to growing up
We were the kings and queens, of the east coast village streets
With an air of confidence and grass stained knees
And the night were always (nights) were always long
And our inhibitions (inhibitions) gone
There's a ghost down every street
In the places were we used to meet
Fifteen years i miss you far to much
There's a ghost down every street
In the places where we found our feet
Fifteen years is always old enough, Three cheers for growing up, Three cheers for growing up
And we moved away, and we left the days where we were never tired (were never tired)
There's a ghost down every street
In the places were we found our feet
Fifteen years is always old enough
There's a ghost down every street
In the places where we used to meet
Fifteen years i miss you far to much
So here's to growing up
There's a ghost down every street
In the places where we found our feet
Fifteen years is always old enough
So here to growing up
Here's to growing up and giving inEmbed
