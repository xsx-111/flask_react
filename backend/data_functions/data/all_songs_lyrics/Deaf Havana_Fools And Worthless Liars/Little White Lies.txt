Little White Lies LyricsLately I've been wondering how these words would sound
If they were sung out loud instead of written down
Because this would be a letter if I could find the pen and paper
To tell you how, I'll only let you down
If I had any heart left, I'd give it all to you
To make up for the time spent, not telling the truth
Now all the hours, weeks and months
Just seem to merge right into one
I lost track of where I'd been
Cause I've been ch-ch-chasing my own tail
And running in circles for so long
I need to find myself again
If I had any heart left, I'd give it all to you
To make up for the time spent, not telling the truth (x2)
Because I've complied a list of all the places
I wanna see before I die, but I know I won't
I always drink too much and never sleep enough
I'm still a liar and I think I'll always be, I'll always
If I had any heart left, I'd give it all to you
To make up for the time spent, not telling the truth (x2)
If I had any heart left, I'd give it all to you
To make up for the time I spentEmbed
