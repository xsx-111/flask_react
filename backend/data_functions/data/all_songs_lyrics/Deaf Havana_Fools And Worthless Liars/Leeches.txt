Leeches LyricsYou started staring at the walls again
And the pictures turned back into empty frames
Your sense will go before your looks will leave you
And in time the ones you love will all leave too
No dreams are not how they seemed back when you were young
You lost your way and you couldn't overcome
The times you'd hide, what's been building up inside
'Cause dreams aren't how they seemed when you were young
And I follwed you for miles through foreign sights
To the house where all your demons came to life
And I saw fear and innocence in childrens eyes
Then your face changed and I ran back into the night
No dreams are not how they seemed back when you were young
You lost your way and you couldn't overcome
The times you'd hide, what's been building up inside
'Cause dreams aren't how they seemed when you were young
I saw the colours drained from your veins, through the teeth of leeches
Dreams are not how they seemed back when you were young
You lost your way and you couldn't overcome
The times you'd hide, what's been building up inside
'Cause dreams aren't how they seemed when you were young
No they're not what they used to beEmbed
