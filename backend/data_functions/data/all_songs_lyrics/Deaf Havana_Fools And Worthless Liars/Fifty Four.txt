Fifty Four LyricsDear you know I fear I'm growing weak
I left you in the dark for a bottle and cheap company
You took me home, gave me a bed or half of yours atleast
And my god that was good enough for me
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for me
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for me
We'd sleep until the evening sun had burnt
And stay awake 'til the neighbours left, the next morning for work
The first time that we slept I felt my life rewind
And a nervous child replaced the ageing fool I left behind
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for me
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for me
You put your faith in me and I let you down
You put your faith in me and I let you down
You put your faith in me and I let you down
But I feel so sure, I feel so...
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for me
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for me (still good enough for me)
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for me
I'll keep holding on 'cause we are young and we are free
And my god that's still good enough for meEmbed
