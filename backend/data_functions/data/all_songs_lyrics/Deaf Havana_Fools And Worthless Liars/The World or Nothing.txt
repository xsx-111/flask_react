The World or Nothing LyricsThe streetlights hurt my eyes more than usual tonight, no sense of
Direction and my visions blurred, I think I'll lay down for a while. But I
Don't have a bed of my own just a space in someone else's, no I don't have
A bed of my own just a space in someone else's, or at least for now...
I'm swallowed up by hungry streets and thirsty back alleys, the more I try
To find my feet the more the city mocks me. The fresh air fills my lungs
The alcohol burns into my skin and I feel so tired and scared about
Everything
I'd clip my wings just for an excuse, for not putting myself to better use
We all care too much about not caring enough, 'cause we're all too scared
To leave behind our youth
We're a self-destructive generation who's obituaries will be; "Due to
Excessive boredom the body gave in to liver failure and heart disease it
Seems"
I'd clip my wings just for an excuse, for not putting myself to better use
We all care too much about not caring enough, 'cause we're all too scared
To leave behind our youth
To tell you the truth I'm just scared, but at least I'm not alone, at least
I'm not alone
And we'll sing 'til we can't speak, yeah we'll sing until we believe
And we'll sing 'til we can't speak, yeah we'll sing until we believe
And we'll sing 'til we can't speak, yeah we'll sing until we believeEmbed
