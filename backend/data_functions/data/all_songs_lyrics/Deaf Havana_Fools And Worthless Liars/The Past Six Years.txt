The Past Six Years LyricsThese days my friends aren't who they used to be
We were all sinners and drunks but now they're too mature for me
Because Mike's on daytime radio and Jon played Reading and Leeds
But i'm still playing The Purple Turtle on new years eve
We are sick and we are tired
We're all fools and worthless liars
Young and unemployable
Lonely, drunk and beautiful
We are sick and we're so tired
So tired
Through these cynical, old, bitter eyes, The future's hard to see
These songs do not mean half as much as they should do to me
Because I made plans of being more than just that band
Who had that song about friends and not much else
We are sick and we are tired
We're all fools and worthless liars
Young and unemployable
Lonely, drunk and beautiful
We are sick and we're so tired
So tired
I'm not getting any younger
My bones aren't getting any stronger
My breath won't last for that much longer
We are sick and we are tired
We're all fools and worthless liars
Young and unemployable
Lonely, drunk and beautiful
We are sick and we're so tired
So tiredEmbed
