Without Someone Lyrics
I watch the cars move
I watch the lights up on the window
I walk along the street
I'm only thinking of you
I watch the clock staring from the wall
It hardly moves at all
It's you I'm waiting for

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone

All alone, no one around
I watch the shadows falling faster
The city lights begin to glow
And then I start to realise
I count the hours
As they slip away into another day
Wondering where you'll stay

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone
Still watching the cars move
Still watching the lights upon the window
I'm walking down the street
I'm only thinking of you
I hear the night as it calls to me
It plays a symphony
It says you're gone from me

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone1Embed
