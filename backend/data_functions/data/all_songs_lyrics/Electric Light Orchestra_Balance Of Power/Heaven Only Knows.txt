Heaven Only Knows Lyrics
(Heaven only knows)

Oh, I know it's strange
But I think that it's about to change
So I'll take the chance
To get back into the straight again

(Heaven only knows) I'm really on the level
(Heaven only knows) I'm trying to find a way
(Heaven only knows) I'm walking down
A straight and lonely road today

Oh, yeah
(Heaven only knows)

Now the sun will shine
And I'm gonna work it out this time
And before the light
All I gotta take is one more night

(Heaven only knows) I'm really on the level
(Heaven only knows) I'm trying to find a way
(Heaven only knows) I'm walking down
A straight and lonely road today
Heaven only knows, heaven only
(Heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows, heaven only
(Heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows, heaven only
(Heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows, heaven only

(Heaven only knows)
(Heaven only knows)

As the hours go by
I can only wonder why
You can change your mind
But you'll never change the price

(Heaven only knows) I'm really on the level
(Heaven only knows) I'm trying to find a way
(Heaven only knows) I'm walking down
A straight and lonely road today

Heaven only knows, heaven only
(Heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows, heaven only
(Heaven only knows) I'm really on the level
(Heaven only knows) I'm trying to find a way
(Heaven only knows) I'm walking down
A straight and lonely road

(Heaven only knows) I'm really on the level
(Heaven only knows) I'm trying to find a way
(Heaven only knows)Embed
