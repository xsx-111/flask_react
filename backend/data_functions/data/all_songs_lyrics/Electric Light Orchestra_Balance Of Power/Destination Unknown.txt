Destination Unknown LyricsI'm getting outta here, 'cause there's too many complications
Yeah, I'm getting outta here, don't get given any information
And if they ask you for a number to call, just say I'm gone, that's all
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, destination unknown
If anybody wants me, just say you don't know the address
'Cause I've had enough of the confusion and the madness
And should anybody ever try to stall, just say I'm gone, that's all
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, destination unknown
I'm tired of playing other peoples' games
Tired of waiting for some things to change
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, destination unknown
I'm tired of playing other peoples' games
Tired of waiting for some things to change
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, destination unknown
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Destination unknown, destination unknown
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown, I'm a long way from home
Destination unknown...Embed
