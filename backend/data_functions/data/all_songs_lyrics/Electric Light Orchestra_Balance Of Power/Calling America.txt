Calling America Lyrics
(Somebody)

Told her that there was a place like Heaven
'Cross the water on a 747
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
And pretty soon, she'd really got the notion
Of flying out across the big, blue ocean
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
(Ooh, in a modern world)

Talk is cheap on satellite
But all I get is
Information, I'm still here
Redial on automatic

(Calling America)
Can't get a message through
(Calling America)
That's what she said to do
(Calling America)
That's where she has to be
(Calling America)
She left a number for me
(Calling America)
But I'm just talking to a satellite
20,000 miles up in the sky each night
Yeah we're living in, in a modern world
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
All I had to do was pick up the phone
I'm out in space trying to talk to someone
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
(Ooh, in a modern world)

She left a number I could call
But no one's there, no one at all
There must be something going wrong
That number just rings on and on

(Calling America)
Can't get a message through
(Calling America)
That's what she said to do
(Calling America)
That's where she has to be
(Calling America)
She left a number for me
(Calling America)
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
Said she'd call when she'd been gone a while
Guess she's missing me across the miles
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world

(Calling America)
Can't get a message through
(Calling America)
That's what she said to do
(Calling America)
That's where she has to be
(Calling America)
She left a number for me

(Calling America)
(Calling America)
(Calling America)
(Calling America)
(Calling America)
