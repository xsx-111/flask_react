Is It Alright Lyrics
Dear Jo
Don't know where to begin, so I'll just say hello
Dear Jo
Is it so much better now you're on your own?

(Is it alright) You never believed in yourself
(Is it alright) Now that you're free, does it help?

Is it alright
Now that you got what you want?
And is it alright
Now that you're back where you belong?

Dear Jo
Are you living it up every place you go?
Dear Jo
If you're having a hard time, it sure don't show
Oh no

(Is it alright) You couldn't hold on in your mind
(Is it alright) Now is it okay, is it fine?
Is it alright
Now that you got what you want?
And is it alright
Now that you're back where you belong?

Dear Jo
Can you believe that it's been so long?
Dear Jo
Just thought I'd write and let you know

(Is it alright) you never believed in yourself
(Is it alright) but now that you're free, does it help?

Is it alright
Now that you got what you want?
And is it alright
Now that you're back where you belong?

Is it alright?
Is it alright with you?
Is it alright?
Is it alright with you?
Is it alright
Now that you got what you want?
And is it alright
Now that you're back where you belong?
Is it alright
Now that you got what you want?
And is it alright
Now that you're back where you belong?1Embed
