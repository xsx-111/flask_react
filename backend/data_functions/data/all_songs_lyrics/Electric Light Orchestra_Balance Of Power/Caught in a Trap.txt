Caught in a Trap LyricsSometimes you get caught in a trap and you don't know it
Sometimes it's better to get out before you blow it
Some people never learn they keep on falling
You can never get out if you keep on stalling
Then you get caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Caught in a trap with nowhere to run
Then you get caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Nowhere to turn, but it can't go on
Caught in a trap
Sometimes you got to know where to run for cover
Sometimes you're better out 'till the heat is over
Or you get caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Caught in a trap with nowhere to run
Then you get caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Nowhere to turn, but it can't go on
Caught in a trap
Don't know how it happens, but then it's too late
Then you gotta move on the times you contemplate
'Cause you got caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Caught in a trap with nowhere to run
Then you got caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Nowhere to turn, but it can't go on
Caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Caught in a trap with nowhere to run
Caught in a trap, caught in dead end
Nowhere to turn, but it can't go on
Caught in a trap
Caught in a trap
Caught in a trap
Caught in a trap...Embed
