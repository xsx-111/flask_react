The Rakes Progress LyricsWhat do you do when your roots have dissolved and broken down
And the soil that you grew in when you were small
Has become nothing more than dirt in some dirty town
When you list all the qualities that you despise
And you realize You're describing yourself
And breakin' someone up inside
Is your only source of prideEmbed
