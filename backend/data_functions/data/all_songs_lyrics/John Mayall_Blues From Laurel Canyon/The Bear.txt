The Bear LyricsI've been living with the Bear in a big house full of blues
Going back through the years, hear any record you choose
The sun is shining down and the Bear is rolling in the shade
Everybody is gonna boogie, blues roll night and day
Turn on all of the people who got no place to stay
All the men of Canned Heat are part of my family
I'm gonna remember the things they did for me
I got to be moving, they call me Wandering John
I'll see you, old Bear. I'll be back 'fore long...Embed
