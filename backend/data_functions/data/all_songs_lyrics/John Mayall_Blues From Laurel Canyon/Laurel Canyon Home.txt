Laurel Canyon Home LyricsEach and every morning
When the sun is high
I hunt around the Canyon
Till I find a place to lie
Oh, oh, it's so beautiful to be alone
Got the sun and trees and silence
I'm in my Laurel Canyon home
Looking back a century
I look at where I stand
It must have looked the same as when
Apaches roamed the land
Now the sun is sinking
It's time to reminisce
Here's a way of living
That I will sorely missEmbed
