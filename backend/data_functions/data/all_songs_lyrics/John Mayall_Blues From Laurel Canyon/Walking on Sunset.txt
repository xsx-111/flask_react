Walking on Sunset LyricsWatching all the people like the waves along the shore
They hang around he whiskey and every open store
I'm walking on sunset
And I'll never reach the end
I'm walking on sunset
Everything is like a friend
All the pretty women, never seen a better crop
Music all around, the flashing lights will never stop
Standing at the corner watching every kind of car
Friendly people come and say they wanna see your star
The cops were in the car but they never bothered me
A new magic world - I never felt so freeEmbed
