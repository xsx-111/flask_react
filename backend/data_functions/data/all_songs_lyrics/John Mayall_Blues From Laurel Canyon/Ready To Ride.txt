Ready To Ride LyricsI've waited a long time
To get my loving done
There's so much beauty around here
I'm bound to find me one
I said, "Baby
Don't you run, you can't hide
My love is boiling over
'Cos right now I'm ready to ride"
Took me one week to find her
We danced a special way
She got me so excited
That I couldn't walk away
Love all night till the morning
She nearly wrecked my mind
She's got to be the best lover
A man could ever hope to findEmbed
