Miss James LyricsI read about her in the magazine
The writer painted her in colors of a queen
Other people said bad things instead
So I was curious to check up what I'd read
But askin' around
She couldn't be found
Strange, elusive Miss James
Two weeks later, I was down the Shrine
Saw a pretty girl who would suit me fine
Rushin' around we forgot to trade names
I didn't connect her with the one they called Miss James
I was surprised
When I realized
The two were one and the same
I had the phone company give her number to me
I called her at home, she said she was alone
Would she see me tonight?
Yeah, that was alrightEmbed
