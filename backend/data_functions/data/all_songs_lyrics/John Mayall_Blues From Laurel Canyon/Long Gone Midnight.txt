Long Gone Midnight LyricsLong gone midnight
And I want my woman so bad
No use waiting for her
She won't come, I call that sad
Long gone midnight
And it's a cold wait till the dawn
Sometimes love can make you wish
That you had never been born
Long gone midnight
And I miss her though she don't care
When you've just lost your lover
There's nowhere to go
NowhereEmbed
