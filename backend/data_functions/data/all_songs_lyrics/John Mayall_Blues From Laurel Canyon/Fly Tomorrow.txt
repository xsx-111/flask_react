Fly Tomorrow LyricsGotta fly tomorrow
Gotta pack my gear
Re-adjust my mind
My time is near
Fly tomorrow
Got to pack up my gear
Fly tomorrow
Now my time is drawing near
Fly tomorrow
Get ready for the change
Living back at home
Gonna be so strange
Fly tomorrow
Get ready for the change
Fly tomorrow
Living back home is gonna be strange
Got to fly tomorrow
Got to be goodbye
'Fore tomorrow's over
I'll be in the sky
Fly tomorrow
Well, it's got to be goodbye
Fly tomorrow
I'll be way up in the sky
Way up in the sky
Way up in the sky
Way up in the sky
Way up in the sky
In the sky, in the sky
In the skyEmbed
