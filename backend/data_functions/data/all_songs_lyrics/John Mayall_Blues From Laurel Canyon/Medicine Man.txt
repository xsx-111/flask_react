Medicine Man LyricsI had a bit of bad luck
Something I would never plan
Got a little trouble
Help me any way you can
I'm out of circulation
So take me to your medicine man
Loving is a gamble
Never knowing who to choose
Find yourself a winner
Then you find you picked to lose
Now I've gone and lost
And I don't want no "Told you so's"
Maybe you were lucky
Funny, that's the way it goesEmbed
