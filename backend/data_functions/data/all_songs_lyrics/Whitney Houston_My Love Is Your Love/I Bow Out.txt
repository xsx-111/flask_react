I Bow Out Lyrics
I'm tired of playing this game
And I won’t play it no more
And I won’t take it no more
Through with being your fool
And I won’t do it no more
And I won’t, I won’t keep up this act
Not for one minute
I’m going to pull, I’m going to pull this curtain down, no

This time I won’t play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out (I won’t be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow out (I won’t be staying 'round, baby)
I bow out

Can’t go on with the show
You’re just a stage I went through
Now you’re just fading from view, yeah babe
It’s time for a change of scene
Guess I’ll be taking my leave
I guess I won’t, I won’t stay in this play
Not for one minute
I’m going to make, I’m going to make my exit now
Oh baby
This time I won’t play this game (This time I won't)
I made a vow to make a change (Made a vow)
And I bow out (I won’t be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain (I decline)
And I resign the masquerade (Ohhh)
And I bow out (I won’t be staying 'round, baby)
I bow out

When you’re left standing on that stage all alone
Maybe you will realize
You should of learned to treat me right
And when this final act is finally through
Maybe you’ll wish you’d been
The kind of man you should have been
Now watch me say goodbye
And walk right out of your life
Oh baby, all right babe

This time I won’t play this game (This time)
I made a vow to make a change (This time I made up my mind)
And I bow out (I bow, I won’t be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain (I decline boy)
And I resign the masquerade (No more stayin out)
And I bow out (Gonna bow out)
I won’t be staying 'round, baby
This time I won’t play this game
I made a vow to make a change (Said I)
And I bow out (I gotta bow out, do you believe it?)
I decline to take the pain (I need you to hear me)
And I resign the masquerade (Do you hear me baby?)
And I bow out (I won’t be staying 'round, baby)
This time I won’t play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out (Ooh-ooh-ooh baby I bow out)
I decline to take the pain (I said I bow out)
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow outEmbed
