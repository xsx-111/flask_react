In My Business Lyrics
Hey, this is Whitney and Missy, y'all
Ninety-nine, uh
Hey Missy, can ya believe this girl? (Uh-uh, uh)
Misdemeanor
Miss Missy Misdemeanor, uh
Ya heard?
Ha-ha (Yo)

Hey baby, I get so many people (Uh)
Telling me they seen you up in the mall
Are they mistaken? (Uh)
All up on some chick as though
I don't exist, what is this? Ohhh

Why they all in my business?
It's just too ridiculous
I can't get no sleep
They just keep warning me
Should I believe it?
They say I don't need it
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind?

Haunting me (Uh)
Too many people say you're faking me
They ask what have you done lately
They say we won't last
They're predicting that it's over, it's over
Too many girls they dislike me
Since I got you, they wanna fight me
Cause I'm the chick walkin' 'round with the ring
Tell me why these hoes, they don't even like me
Too many girls they dislike me
Since I got you they wanna fight me
Cause I'm the chick walkin' 'round with the ring
Tell me why these hoes, they don't even like me
Why they all in our business?

Why they all in our business?
It's just too ridiculous (So ridiculous)
I can't get no sleep (They won't let me sleep)
They just keep warning me (Aw baby)
Should I believe it?
They say I don't need it (Don't need it)
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind?
(My, my, my, my, my, my mind)
Why they all in our business? (My, ohh)
It's just too ridiculous (So ridiculous)
I can't get no sleep (I've got to sleep y'all)
They just keep warning me
Should I believe it? (Believe it)
They say I don't need it (I don't need it)
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind?
Oh boy (It's over now)
It's all the love that you've given (That you've given me)
They mad cause love is what they missin' (Love is what they missin)
That's why they stay up in my business (Uh-huh)
They all up in our business

Why they all in our business? (Up in my business)
It's just too ridiculous (So, so ridiculous)
I can't get no sleep (I lost sleep now)
They just keep warning me (Stop callin me)
Should I believe it? (Don't believe it!)
They say I don't need it
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind?
Why they all in our business? (Oooh-ooh-ooh baby)
It's just too ridiculous (Oooh-ooh-ooh baby)
I can't get no sleep (I can't sleep y'all)
They just keep warning me (Keep on warning me)
Should I believe it? (Don't wanna believe it)
They say I don't need it (Oh)
Don't they know I made up my mind, my mind? (My, my, my mind)

Why you all in my business?
Heh, get a jobEmbed
