Get It Back Lyrics
Y'all ready
Uh, Whitney
Darkchild
Uh uh, back
Couldn't get it back, couldn't get it back
Oh no, uh
Yeah, ooh
Check it out, c'mon

Remember when it all began
We were all in love, uh
Then came the friends
Telling you when
Your time for me was good enough
I constantly had to compete
With your crew and their schemes
Remembering back in the day
I used to mean everything

(If we could just get it back)
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change with you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back
Now tell me why so many nights
You had so much to do, baby
When you said bye
Sometimes I tried
I tried to make you choose
Now tell me how you can allow
Your boys to control, darling
The time we shared
It was unfair
But now you need to know

(Now if I told you)
That I'm moving on
(Boy, what would you do?)
Oh, things just ain't the same, nah nah na-nah
(We were supposed to)
Oh baby, conquer everything, yeah yeah now
(Boy, let me tell you)
You've got to make a change, oh boy

(If we could just get it back)
Oh darling, to the way we used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back
(If we could just get it back)
Can we do it, can we do it, can we do it, can we do it now, baby?
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me, boy
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back, babe

Remember how we used to dance?
I liked the way we used to dance
Girl, let me see you dance
Just dance with me, dance with me
Remember how we used to dance? (can we do it, uh?)
I liked the way we used to dance (can we do it, boy?)
Girl, let me see you dance
Just dance with me, dance with me
If we could just get it back

(If we could just get it back)
Oh-ooh, come on now
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me, boy
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back
(If we could just get it back)
Oh, to the way we used to be, baby
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
Back to the way we used to be, baby
(We were oh so deep in love)
I remember, I remember, ooh-oh
If we could just get it back

(If I told you)
(If we could just get it back)
Oh Lord, just get it on back to the way it used to be
(Boy what would you do)
(My only wish would be that)
If we could just get it back, uh
(Now if I told you)
(I remember how it was)
Ooh baby, come on now
(Boy what would you do)
(We were oh so deep in love)
Show me, show me, show me, show me
If we could just get it back

If we could just get it back
If we could just get it backEmbed
