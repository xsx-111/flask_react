Oh Yes Lyrics
Oh yes boy (say yes)
Ooh yeah (oh yes)
Oh say yes boy (say yes)
Ooh yeah (uh uh uh uh)
Turn me up
Ooh yeah (yes)
Oh yes
Yes

The day you held me in your arms
I still smell the scent of you
On my dress, unbelievable
And you were so masculine
The way I felt your chest up next to mine
Felt you in my heart
And now I breathe your love

You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily
You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily

Yes, yes, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, yes, yes

The time you looked into my eyes
I felt like falling in love
And I was mesmerized
'Cause it's something that you do baby
That makes me feel this way
And I can't explain
You're my joy, my peace, my happiness
And you, you, you, you baby

You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily
You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily

Yes, yes, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, yes, yes

You're the best lover I ever knew
Can't nobody do me like you do
Put that all on my last dime
No one else worth none of my time
Everything about you I love
You were sent from the skies above
You came here to rescue me
And now I'm free
You're the best lover I ever knew
Can't nobody do me like you do
Put that all on my last dime
No one else worth none of my time
Everything about you I love
You were sent from the skies above
You came here to rescue me
And now I'm free

You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily
You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily
You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, daily
You are so amazing
Unbelievable baby
It's you that make me smile
When everything gets crazy
You're the one I love
No other man can faze me
'Cause you're in my heart, I'm in your heart
Every minute, dailyEmbed
