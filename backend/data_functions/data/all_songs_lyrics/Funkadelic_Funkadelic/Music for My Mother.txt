Music for My Mother Lyrics
Man, I was in a place
Called Keeprunnin', Mississippi one time
And I heard someone on my way back
Sounded a little something like raw funk to me
So I slowed down and took a listen
And this is all I could hear, baby

Whoa-hah-hey
Whoa-hah-ha

It got so good to me, man, that I stopped runnin'
My feet was tired anyhow
So I reached in my inside pocket
And got my harp out
Sit down by old beat-up railroad train
And get me, get myself a little of that old funky thang

Can you all feel what I mean?
This is what you call way back younger funk

Say it loud - I'm funky and I'm proud
Say it loud - I'm funky and I'm proud
Say it loud - I'm funky and I'm proud
I'm aging
