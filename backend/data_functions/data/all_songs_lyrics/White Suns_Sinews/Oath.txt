Oath LyricsI speak with a thousand voices when I recite these words
To call down the structure that enshrines your head
And trap you beneath the rubble
Cursed by hired bricklayers, whispering to their tools
I speak with a thousand voices when I recite these words
To short-circuit the device buried in your chest
And leave you gasping like a fish
Alone on the floor of a darkened hall
I speak with a thousand voices when I recite these words
To summon a pestilence to fall upon your house
And keep your rooms quiet
With death and mourning
May your seeds turn to stone
May your wealth turn to sand
May your innards blacken with shame
May your stains fade with timeEmbed
