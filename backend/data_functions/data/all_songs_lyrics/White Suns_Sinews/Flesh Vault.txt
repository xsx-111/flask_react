Flesh Vault LyricsCurled around my center, I do not feel time
Until my senses announce departure
My scent becomes fetid
The walls, adorned with my detritus
Become menacing
I crawl through a century
Kicking free of narcotic tendrils
The way is unmarked
But the map is in me
I was born with my eyes openEmbed
