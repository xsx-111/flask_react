Temple LyricsMy bones grind in their sockets
Drowning out all other sound
Up to my knees in a fine powder
Breathing my own dust
A crude monument to my isolation
Howling halls, untrodden
Oracular glyphs, unexamined
A tomb mistaken for a palace
I build this knowingly
May the peak someday eclipse me
Are the gods solemnly gnawing at the base?
Or are they waiting for the pinnacle to reach them?Embed
