Cenote LyricsI descended
To the underground pool
Looking for you
Drawn by your radiance
Feeling my way through the dark
Hands on damp walls
I came upon you
You dripped
From stalactites
Pounding new shapes
Into sheer rock
Carving millennial doors
Where once was naught
I caught a glimpse
Of the white splash
Before your deepest dive
So I waited for you to surface
As the cave grew dark
And the water stilled to glass
But you never did
And the voices of the rest
Trailed down to my ear
I followed the path
Blank and dumb
Back up into
The screaming forestEmbed
