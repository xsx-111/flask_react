Footprints Filled LyricsSand piles up
Throughout each night
And with the sun
I awake
To the weight
Of the dunes
So i spend each day
In the trough of a wave
Digging, shoveling
Pushing, clawing
Heaving, pawing
Between my teeth, I taste it
Screw my eyes shut, I see it
I sift the night's deposit
And find my strength buried
The luminous hands on the ropes
Pull my prayers up into the skyEmbed
