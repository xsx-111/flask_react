Off Night Backstreet Lyrics
Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I say I love you, I don't know
Loving without trusting, you get frostbite and sunstroke
I wish I felt nothing, you pimp, laughing and strutting her to my chartered seat
Your old off night back street

It's been stinger to stinger, darling, it's been heart to heart
You still keep me from finishing any new love I start
Now she's moved in with you, she's keeping your house neat
And your sheets sweet and I'm your off night back street

I can feel your fingers feeling my face
There are some lines you put there and some you erase
Maybe I'm just dramatizing, I don't care
It's home, it can be heaven when we play fair
But these sentimental journeys late at night, high in some back room
You're calling me to be your off night back street

You give me such pleasure
You bring me such pain
Who left her long black hair
In our bathtub drain?Embed
