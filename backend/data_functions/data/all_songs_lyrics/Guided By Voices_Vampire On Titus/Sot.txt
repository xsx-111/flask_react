Sot Lyrics
I walked into a place
A living space of total grace
And time without, 'cause I'm tripped out, is through

And there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be here right now
There's nothing I'd rather do

I stepped into a place
A living space of total grace
And time without, 'cause I'm tripped out, is through

And there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be here right now
There's nothing I'd rather do
There's nothing I'd rather do
Than be here right now
There's nothing I'd rather doEmbed
