#2 in the Model Home Series Lyrics
My automated spouse
Has a bug in her blouse
Invading my private space

And secretly she sees, and secretly she sees, and secretly she sees
And secretly she sees, and secretly she sees

My cyber-son has found my gun
My favorite son has found
My favorite son has found my gun

And now the fun begins, and now the fun begins
And now the fun begins, and now the fun begins
And now the fun begins, and now the fun begins
And now the fun beâ€”now the fun beginsEmbed
