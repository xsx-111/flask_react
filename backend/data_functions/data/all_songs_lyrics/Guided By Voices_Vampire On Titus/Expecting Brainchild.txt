Expecting Brainchild Lyrics
"Bob, would you and Living Praise Choir lead us in "To God Be the Glory'?"

It isn't quite ready
It's almost 5:30
Scholars and flunkies
Faggots and junkies
Incinerator in a blood red sky
Kill the head and the body will die
I can't tell you that I'm happy
But I can tell you that my clothes are snappy

It's time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, to draw the line
It's time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, to draw the line

Superman died tonight
Ate a pound of Kryptonite
Drank a quart of brotherly love
Fell straight from the sky above
And if there's a hell below
Kenneth Ray ain't gonna go
He lost his soul in the Korean War
I lost my concentration when I opened the door
And it's time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, to draw the line
It's time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, to draw the line
Time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, to draw the line
It's time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, to draw the lineEmbed
