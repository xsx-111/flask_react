What About It? Lyrics
Now and then it's a way out life
Yes, indeed, it's a strange effect
A couple of brothers with a jar full of oil
Said, "Grab it quick before it spoil"

What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?

Time is money if not well spent
Ain't no doubt it takes practice
To reprogram that static jive
And fly away like Grandfather Five

What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
(We're finding time for wasting time)
What about it?
(We're finding time for wasting time)
What about it?
(We're finding time for wasting time)
(We're finding time for wasting time)Embed
