Non-Absorbing Lyrics
Do you see me?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Like I see you?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Do you see me?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Like I see you?
Doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Do you see me?

Time lost, can't ever understand the lines like most
We wants to be alone, we can't be alone

Do you see me?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Like I see you?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Do you see me?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Like I see you?
Doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Do you see me?
Can't believe the things we ask for
Can't believe the things we want
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see me?
Do you see more than I do?

Do you see me?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Do you see me?

Do you see more than I do?
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see more than I do?Embed
