Perhaps Now the Vultures Lyrics
Shot down from the rafters
And off to ever after
Consider this a failure
So be it, urchin's promise
The curse is working
The trail of bodies
That leaves no suspects
What did you expect?

And get it, get it here, get it now

The news is not worthy
Don't even look
Don't be cornered into thinking
Invited to the lynching

Specify instructions
I'll shoot the arrow straight up
I'll frame your ugly mugshot
Add insult to buckshot
And then I'll drink with glycerol frog-eye
Yeah, she can tell you every detailEmbed
