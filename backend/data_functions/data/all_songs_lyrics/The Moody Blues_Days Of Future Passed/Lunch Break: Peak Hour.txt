Lunch Break: Peak Hour Lyrics

I see it all through my window it seems
Never failing, like millions of bees
Pull out the drawer, no time to be won
Only to do, what can be done?

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day, one hour a night
Sees crowds of people, oh-oh-oh
Home, in full flight

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour

It makes me want to run out
And tell them, they've got time
Take a step back out and look in
I've found out, I've got time

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day, one hour a night
Sees crowds of people, oh-oh-oh
Home, in full flight

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hourEmbed
