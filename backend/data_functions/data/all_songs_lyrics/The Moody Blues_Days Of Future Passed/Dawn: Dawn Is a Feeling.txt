Dawn: Dawn Is a Feeling Lyrics
Dawn is a feeling, a beautiful ceiling
The smell of grass just makes you pass into a dream
You're here today, no future fears
This day will last a thousand years, if you want it to

You look around you, things they astound you
So breathe in deep, you're not asleep, open your mind.
You're here today
No future fears
This day will last
A thousand years, if you want it to

Do you understand that all over this land there's a feeling?
In minds far and near, things are becoming clear with a meaning

Now that you're knowing, pleasure starts flowing
It's true, life flies, faster than eyes could ever see
You're here today, no future fears
This day will last a thousand years, if you want it toEmbed
