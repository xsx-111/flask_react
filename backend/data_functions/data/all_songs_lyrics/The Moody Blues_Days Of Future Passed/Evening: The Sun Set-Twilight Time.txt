Evening: The Sun Set/Twilight Time LyricsEvening:


When the sun goes down, and the clouds all frown
Night has begun for the sunset
See it with your eyes, Earth's re-energized
By the sun's rays everyday
Take a look out there, planets everywhere

When the sun goes down, and the clouds all frown
Night has begun for the sunset
Shadows on the ground, never make a sound
Fading away in the sunset
Night has now become day for everyone

I can see it all, from this great height
I can feel the sun, slipping out of sight
And the world still goes on, through the night


Twilight time, to dream awhile
Unveils a deepening blue
As fantasy strides, over colourful skies
The form disappearing from view

In twilight time, dream with me awhile

A nightingale plays a dark mellow phrase
Of notes that are rich and so true
An aerial display by the firefly brigade
Dancing to tunes no one knew

In twilight time, dream with me awhile
In twilight time, dream with me awhile

Building castles in the air
Whistling to the wind
As nature bows down her head
See what tomorrow brings

In twilight time, dream with me awhile

Bats take to wing like puppets on string
Prancing through cool evening air
In a sightless glide, no reason to hide
From the ray of the sun's blinding stare

In twilight time, dream with me awhile
In twilight time, dream with me awhile1Embed
