The Day Begins Lyrics


Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey and yellow - white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion
Pinprick holes in a colourless sky,
Let insipid figures of light pass by
The mighty light of ten thousand suns
Challenges infinity and is soon gone
Night time, to some a brief interlude
To others the fear of solitude
Brave Helios wake up your steeds
Bring the warmth the countryside needsEmbed
