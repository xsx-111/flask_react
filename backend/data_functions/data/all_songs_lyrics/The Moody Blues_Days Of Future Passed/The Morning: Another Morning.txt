The Morning: Another Morning Lyrics

Balloons flying, children sighing
What a day to go kite flying
Breeze's cool, away from school
Cowboys fighting out a duel

Time seems to stand quite still
In a child's world it always will

Fishes biting, so exciting
Lunchtime sounds so inviting
Angler Bill, he gets a thrill
Sitting, watching bobbing quill

Time seems to stand quite still
In a child's world it always will

Yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's sighs
Watch children play, they seem so wise

Mary Green, today's a queen
While thousand dollies are a dreaming
Cotton frocks and golden locks
Her palace is an orange box

Time seems to stand quite still
In a child's world it always will
