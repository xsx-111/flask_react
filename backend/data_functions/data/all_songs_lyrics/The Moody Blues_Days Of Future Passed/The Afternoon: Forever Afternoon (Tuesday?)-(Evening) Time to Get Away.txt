The Afternoon: Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)/(Evening) Time to Get Away LyricsPart I: Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)

Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see, now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me, chasing the clouds away
Something, calls to me
The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear, explain it all with a sigh


I'm looking at myself reflections of my mind
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind
So gently swaying through the fairyland of love
If you'll just come with me you'll see the beauty of
Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon

Tuesday, afternoon
I'm just beginning to see, now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me, chasing the clouds away
Something, calls to me
The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear, explain it all with a sigh

Part II: (Evening) Time To Get Away

Evening has come to pass
The time of day doesn't last
Evening, has earned its place today
I'm tired of working away

Working, living, it brings
Only way to have those things
Toiling has born too many tears,
Turn 'round all those past years

Evening time to get away
Evening time to get away
Evening time to get away
'Til next day

Live all you people, you can see where you're at
It doesn't really hurt you, so it can't be bad

Live all you people, you can't see where you're at
It doesn't really hurt you, so it can't be bad

Evening time to get away
Evening time to get awayEmbed
