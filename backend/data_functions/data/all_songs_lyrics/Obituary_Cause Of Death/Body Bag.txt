Body Bag Lyrics
You're rising
Cure you of the dead
Body in the shadow
Calling of the dead
You're dying
Live beyond the way
Falling through the gates
Scavenge you

With the darkening light
Through the falling going low
Through the death of those
The dying

We're dying
Healing of the one
Falling of the days
Charring in the sun
We're dying
Killing for the need
Violence of the ways
Slowly bleed

Killing for the need (you're fallen dead)
Rising of the dead (with the fallen ways)
Rising from the dead (with you)
The killing for the need (the darkened light)
The rising of the dead (the glories killed)
Rising from the dead (with the darkened light)
