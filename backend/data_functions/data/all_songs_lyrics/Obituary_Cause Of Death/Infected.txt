Infected Lyrics

Rot beneath below
Killing the chance to die - the rising of the dead
The pain denies the soul
Even after
The killing gently
Dissection of the light - the rotting of the soul
The pain realize the wounds - lives

You light the soul
Killing ones they save - the rotting of the soul
Dying of the pain
Killing the soul

Killing send you to your grave
Dying soon the one they save
Tearing rid you of your limbs
Infection soon sets in

Peeling rid you of your skin - infected
Coming soon the end of life
Die - cure you of infliction
