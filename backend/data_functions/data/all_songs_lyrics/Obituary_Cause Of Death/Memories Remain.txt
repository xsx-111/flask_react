Memories Remain LyricsYou're rotting this way
You're destined to die
Loud is the shouting, of the chosen ones
Rotting in hell, living the pain
Loud is the shouting, of the chosen child, child
Life goes on, even after death, life goes on
Killing for the need, raping the ways
Now is the coming of the chosen in chains
Rotting the way, you're killing the days
Loud is the shouting of the chosen life, life
Life goes on, even after death
I'm telling you, life goes on
Life goes on1Embed
