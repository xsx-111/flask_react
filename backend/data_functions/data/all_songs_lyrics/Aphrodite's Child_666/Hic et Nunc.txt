Hic et Nunc LyricsHere and now
Here and now
Fixing the ceiling
I got a feeling
Sing it again
Here and now
Here and now
Show me the season
Give me the reason
Sing it again
We got the system to fuck the System
We got the system to fuck the System
We got the system to fuck the System
We got the system to fuck the System
Here and now
Here and now
Whisper a meaning
Nobody's leading
Sing it again
Sing it again
Here and now
Here and now
I got a feeling
Somebody's missing
Sing it again
Sing it again
Here and now
Here and now
Here and now
Here and nowEmbed
