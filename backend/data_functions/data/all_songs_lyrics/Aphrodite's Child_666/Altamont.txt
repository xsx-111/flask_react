Altamont LyricsThis is the sight we had one day on the High Mountain
We saw a lamb with seven eyes
We saw a beast with seven horns
And a book sealed with seven seals
Seven angels with seven trumpets
And seven bowls filled with anger
Those are the pictures
Of what was
Of what is
And of what has to come
We are the people
The rolling people
The why people
The waiting people
The wanting people
The tambourine people
The alternative people
The angel people
We are the people
The rolling people
The why people
The waiting people
The wanting people
The tambourine people
The alternative people
The angel people
The angel peopleEmbed
