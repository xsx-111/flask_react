The Beast LyricsWho can find the Beast?
She's big, she's bad
She's wicked, she's sad
Who can fight the Beast?
She comes, she goes
Who ever knows...
Who can fight the Beast?
She's big, she's bad
She's wicked, she's sad
Who can find the Beast?
She comes, she goes
Who ever knows...
Who can fight the Beast?
Who can fight the Beast?
She's big, she's bad
She's wicked, she's sad
Who can find the Beast?
She comes, she goes
Who ever knows...
Who can fight the Beast?
She's big, she's bad
She's wicked, she's sad
Who can find the Beast?
She comes, she goes
Who ever knows...
Who can find the Beast?
...sad
...goes
...sad
...goes
Pame!!
She's big
She's bad
She's wicked
She's sad
She's big
...sad
She comes
She goes
Who ever knows
...sad
