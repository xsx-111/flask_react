Aegian Sea LyricsI saw the souls
I saw the martyrs
I heard them crying
I heard them shouting
They were dressed in white
They'd been told to wait
The sun was black
The moon was red
The stars were falling
The earth was trembling
And then a crowd
Impossible to number
Dressed in white
Carrying palms
Shouted amid
The hotless sun
The lightless moon
The windless earth
The colourless sky
They'll no more suffer from hunger
They'll no more suffer from thirst
They'll no more suffer from hunger
They'll no more suffer from thirst
They'll no more suffer from hunger
They'll no more suffer from thirst1Embed
