Break LyricsBye
Bye, my friend, goodbye
With a lie
You forget and break it
You make it
You make it
You make it
You make it
Cry
In my empty room
And we try
To forget and break it
Fly
High
And then
You make it
Bye
Bye, my friend, goodbye
With a lie
You forget and break it
You make it
You make it
You make it
You make it
Do it!Embed
