Babylon Lyrics
Fallen, fallen, fallen
Is Babylon the great
Space is getting bounded
Time is getting late
Masters fall and wonder
People rise and wait
Fallen, fallen, fallen
Is Babylon the great

You don't need a coin
I don't have to shine
We don't know the reason
But I need you madly
And you need me too
And we need each other
Need each other
Need each other

Fallen, fallen, fallen
Is Babylon the great
Space is getting bounded
Time is getting late
Masters fall and wonder
People rise and wait
Fallen, fallen, fallen
Is Babylon the great

You don't need a coin
I don't have to shine
We don't know the reason
But I need you madly
And you need me too
And we need each other
Need each other
Need each otherEmbed
