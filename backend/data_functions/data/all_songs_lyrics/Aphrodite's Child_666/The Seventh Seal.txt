The Seventh Seal LyricsAnd when the Lamb opened the next two seals
We saw the souls
We saw the martyrs
We heard them crying
We heard them shouting
They were dressed in white
They'd been told to wait
The sun was black
The moon was red
The stars were falling
The earth was trembling
And then a crowd
Impossible to number
Carrying flowers
Shouted amid the hotless sun
The lightless moon
The windless earth
The colourless sky
How much longer will we suffer from hunger?
How much longer will we suffer from thirst?
And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal
Silence covered the skyEmbed
