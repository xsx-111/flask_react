The Four Horsemen Lyrics
And when the Lamb
Opened the first seal
I saw, I saw the first horse
The horseman held a bow
Now when the Lamb
Opened the second seal
I saw, I saw the second horse
The horseman held a sword

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black
The last one is a green
The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black
The last one is a green

And when the Lamb
Opened the third seal
I saw, I saw the third horse
The horseman had a balance
Now when the Lamb
Opened the fourth seal
I saw the fourth horse
The horseman was the pest
The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black
The last one is a green
The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black
The last one is a green
The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black
The last one is a green
The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black
The last one is a green
