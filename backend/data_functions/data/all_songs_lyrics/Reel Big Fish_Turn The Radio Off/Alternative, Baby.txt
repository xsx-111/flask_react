Alternative, Baby Lyrics
Well, I see you up on stage and I
Don't know just what you're sayin'
But you're my hero
But a guy just kicked me in the head
A little girl just passed out dead
I'm in between a big jock and a sweaty skinhead
But I love you, whatever that means

But I don't wanna talk to you
'Cause I know I'd just say something stupid
And I know you've got better things to do

Hey, little alternative girl
Said don't you wanna be my friend?
You know I'm singin' all my songs for you
And it's alright if you don't understand

Well, maybe I shouldn't be so serious
Tellin' you that everything sucks
'Cause I don't wanna bring you down
But it never, never works out right
I'm gonna lose, give up the fight
I won't get what I want, won't get anything
But I love you, whatever that means

And they don't wanna talk to me
'Cause they know what I'll turn out to be
I said I was cool but I can't lie to you


And I don't wanna start again
'Cause I know it'll be the same in the end
I didn't like it the first time anyway
