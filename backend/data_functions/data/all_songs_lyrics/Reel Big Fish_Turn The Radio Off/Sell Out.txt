Sell Out Lyrics
"Well, I know you can't work in fast food all your life
But don't sign that paper tonight", she said
But it's too late
And I don't remember what I read
Don't remember what they said
I guess it doesn't matter
Guess it doesn't matter anymore

You're gonna go to the record store
You're gonna give 'em all your money
Radio plays what they want you to hear
Tell me it's cool, I just don't believe it

Sell out with me, oh yeah
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money
And everything's gonna be all right

No more flippin' burgers puttin' on my silly hat
You know I don't want that no more
And I didn't ask when we'd get paid, I quit my day job anyway
I guess it doesn't matter
Guess it doesn't matter anymore
'Cause you're gonna go to the record store
You're gonna give 'em all your money
Radio plays what they want you to hear
Tell me it's cool, I just don't believe it

Sell out with me, oh yeah
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money
And everything's gonna be

And I don't think it'll be so bad
And I know it won't be so bad
'Cause the man said, "That's the way it is"
And the man said, "It don't get better than this"
No, no, no

So I signed on to the record company
They say they're gonna give me lots of money
If I play what they want you to hear
Tell me it's cool and I'll sure believe it

Sell out with me, oh yeah
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money
And everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The record company's gonna make everything alright
"Baby, don't you sign that paper tonight", she said
"But I can't work in fast food all my life"2Embed
