Skatanic LyricsWatchin' you sleep, I'm lookin' in your window
And everyday I drive past your house
Standin' in your front yard, why don't you come out?
Watchin' you sleep (Oh-o), nowhere to hide (Whoa-o-o)
One of these days I'm gonna come inside
Must be love, what else could it be?
Fuck you bitch I, love you; I'm not crazy
Walkin' up to her, now she's walkin' away
I just wanna talk to you
Maybe she's got better things to do
Don't be afraid (Oh-o) to feel my touch (Whoa-o-o)
Don't worry babe I won't hurt you much
Must be love, what else could it be?
Fuck you bitch I, love you; I'm not crazy
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
No matter what you say
(Here I come)
Must be love, what else could it be?
Fuck you bitch I, love you; I'm not crazy
Must be love, what else could it be?
Must be love, what else could it be?
Must be love, what else could it be?
Must be love (Fuck you)1Embed
