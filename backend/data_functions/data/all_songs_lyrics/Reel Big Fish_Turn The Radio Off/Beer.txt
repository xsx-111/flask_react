Beer Lyrics
She called me late last night, to say she loved me so
It didn't matter anymore
I say she never cared
And that she never will
I'd do it all again
I guess I'll have to wait until then

And if I get drunk well, I'll pass out
On the floor now baby
You won't bother me no more
And if you're drinkin' well, you know
That you're my friend and I say
I think I'll have myself a beer

She called me late last night, to say she loved me so
But I guess she changed her mind
Well I should have known, it wouldn't be all right
But I can't live without her
So I won't even try...

And if I get drunk well, I'll pass out
On the floor now baby
You won't bother me no more
And if you're drinkin' well, you know
That you're my friend and I say
I think I'll have myself a beer
Maybe some day, I'll think of what to say
Maybe next time I'll remember what to do
She looks like heaven, maybe this is hell
Said she'd do it all again, she'd promise not to tell!

And if I get drunk well, I'll pass out
On the floor now baby
You won't bother me no more
She said
It's okay boy cause you know
We'll be good friends and I say
I think I'll have myself a beer
I think I'll have myself a beer
Woooooooooooh
Woooooooooooh
Woooooooooooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, huh, huh
Uh, huh, huh1Embed
