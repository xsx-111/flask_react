Everything Sucks LyricsThere's a ska band on my street
A little ska band
Everybody thinks that they're so fuckin' neat
There was nothin' on the radio
Gonna make my own band
Play my own shows but that don't work
So I'm givin' up again
She said she loved me cause I played guitar
That's okay, I didn't love her at all and I say
I'm givin' up because
I know everything sucks yeah
I know everything sucks whoa
I know everything sucks
And this is gonna be the last time
You hear me complain
Well, I went down
To the show
Everybody was there
I didn't wanna go (here we go!)
Cause everything they do is so fuckin' cool
Every song is a hit and the girls like 'em too
I can't do that so I'm givin' up again
I don't know why I learned to play guitar
Nobody's gonna know who we are and I say
Yeah yeah yeah
Why would they even care
I know everything sucks yeah
I know everything sucks whoa
I know everything sucks
And this is gonna be the last time
You hear me complain
She said some day
We'll get back together maybe
And she said some day
Things'll be much better baby
But i don't believe her
And i don't think i need her anymore
Yeah yeah yeah!
Because, I know everything sucks yeah
I know everything sucks whoa
I know everything sucks
And this won't be the last time
You hear me complainEmbed
