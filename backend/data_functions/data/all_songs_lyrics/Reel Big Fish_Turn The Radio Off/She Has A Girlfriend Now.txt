She Has A Girlfriend Now LyricsShe has a girlfriend now
She has a girlfriend now
She has a girlfriend now, she said
"Guys don't do no more for me"
"You never loved me, like i wanted you to"
(you never loved me, nooooo)
"I said I loved you baby, what do you want me to do?"
(what do you want me to do?)
She said she found someone who's gonna hold her hand
She said she found someone who's gonna understand
She don't need nobody to be her man
She don't need nobody to be her man
She has a girlfriend now
She has a girlfriend now
She has a girlfriend now, she said
"Guys don't do no more for me"
She said she found someone who's gonna hold her hand
She said she found someone who's gonna understand
She don't need nobody to be her man
She dont need nobody to be her man
She has a girlfriend now
She has a girlfriend now
She has a girlfriend now, she said
"Guys don't do no more for me"
Well I never thought it would end like this
Just because I've got no tits
I'll shave my legs
I'll wear a bra
I'd even cut my penis off for you
(oh, that's so sweet!)
She has a girlfriend now
(She has a girlfriend now)
She has a girlfriend now
(She has a girlfriend now)
She has a girlfriend now
(She has a girlfriend now)
She has a girlfriend now
