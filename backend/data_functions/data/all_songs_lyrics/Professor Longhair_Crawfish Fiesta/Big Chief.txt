Big Chief LyricsMe got fire, can't put it out
Heap fire water gonna make me shout
I'm goin' down an-a get my squaw
Me might buy a great big car
I'm gonna do ev'rything I could
Me Big Chief, I'm feeling good
Me Big Chief, I got um tribe
Got my squaw right by my side
My Flagboy, he just went by
My Spyboy, he's full of fire
Me whole tribe is havin' fun
We gonna dance 'til mornin' come
