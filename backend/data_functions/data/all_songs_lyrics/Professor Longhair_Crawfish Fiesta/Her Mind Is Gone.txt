Her Mind Is Gone LyricsHer Mind Is Gone
If you got a woman
You don't understand
Don't have to call a Doctor
Give her to another Man
Chorus:
Cause her Mind is Gone
Yeah, her Mind is Gone
When a women does your wrong, she won't do right no more
I remember when I fist got married
I tried to settle down
But the woman I took for my wife
Took me for a clown
Chorus:
I bought her rubies and diamonds
I even bought her a house
We lasted only 2 weeks
Then she through me out
Chorus:
Lead
Sometime she thinks she well
Sometime she thinks she won't
On the times she should
That's the time she won't
Chorus
So now you've heard my story
I ain't going to say no more
If you got a women like mine, then
Down the road you goEmbed
