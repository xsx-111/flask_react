In The Wee Wee Hours LyricsIn the night
In the night
In the night
Whoo, well in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and day
See the jukebox play as you gets near
And everybody will be high off of beer
In the night
I said in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and day
Won't nobody here won't have to stand in line
C'mon inside and have a good time
In the night
Whoo, well in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and day
And the girls out here gets real real rough
Callin' for whisky and a nip of snuff
In the night
Whoo, lord, in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and day

In the night
In the night
In the night
Whoo, well in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and day
See the jukebox play when you get near
And everybody will be high off of beer
In the night
I said, in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and day
Nobody here won't have to stand in line
C'mon inside and have a good time
In the night
Whoo, well in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and day
And the girls out here gets real real rough
Callin' for whisky with a dip of snuff
In the night
Whoo, lord in the night
In the wee wee hours, 'ween midnight and dayEmbed
