Something on Your Mind LyricsI know there is something on your mind
I can tell by the way you look at me
I know there is something on your mind, baby
By the way you look at me
But I'm wondering if you're gonna
Bring me happiness, darling
Oh, if you're gonna bring me misery
No, you don't have to tell me
Because I think I understand
No, no, you don't have to tell me nothing, darling
Because I think I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Lord, I'll do the best I can
No, you don't have to tell me
Because I think I understand
No, no, you don't have to tell me nothing, baby
Because I think I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Lord, I'll do the best I canEmbed
