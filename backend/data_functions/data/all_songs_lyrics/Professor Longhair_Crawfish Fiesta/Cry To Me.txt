Cry To Me LyricsWhen your baby leaves you
Leaves you all alone
And no body
Calls you on the phone
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Here I am, honey
Come on, come on
Cry to me
When you're all alone
In an empty room
And there's nothing there
But the smell of perfume
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Here I am, honey
Come on, come on
Cry to me
Oh baby, nothing could be
Sadder than a glass of wine alone
When this loneliness is just a waste of time
Oh baby, you don't have to walk
Walk on alone
If your lover don't return
Take my hand, won't you, honey?
Come on and walk with me
Oh yeah
When you're workin'
Till the break of dawn
Late in the night
When no one shows
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Here I am, honey
Come on, come on
Cry to me
I said that nothing could be
Sadder than a glass of wine alone
And loneliness, loneliness, is just a waste of time
Oh baby, you don't have to walk
Walk on alone
If your lover don't return
Take my hand, won't you, honey?
Come on and walk with me
Oh yeah
When you're waiting
Till the break of dawn
Late in the night
When no one shows
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Here I am, honey
Come on, come on
Cry to me
Don't you feel like crying, girl?
Crying to me?
Don't you feel like cry to-
Cry to-
Cry to-
Cry to meEmbed
