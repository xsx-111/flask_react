Bald Head LyricsLooky there
(Bald head)
She ain't got no hair
(Bald head)
Well, you looky there
(Bald head)
Show me this girl there
(Bald head)
Whoa, looky there
(Bald head)
I see no hair
(Bald head)
Oh, looky there
(Bald head)
Well, this girl here

Y’know folks, this lil' girl I been trying to tell you about?
Supposed to been a good friend of mine's wife
But every day you know old boy’d be telling me the same thing:
He wish he would've married on some other night
Looky there
(Bald head)
She didn't have no hair
(Bald head)
Well you looky there
(Bald head)
Show me this girl there
(Bald head)
Whoa, looky here
(Bald head)
She ain't got no hair
(Bald head)
Oh, looky there
(Bald head)
Well, this girl here
Now this kid comes down every morning, worrying a poor boy to death
She was beggin' him to take her out to a ball
But he got her straight, no, he told her they couldn't afford to take no chances
If you carry the girl, she'll have to stand out in the hall
Looky there
(Bald head)
She didn't have no hair
(Bald head)
Well you looky there
(Bald head)
Show me this girl there
(Bald head)
Whoa, looky here
(Bald head)
She ain’t got no hair
(Bald head)
Oh, looky there
(Bald head)
Well, this girl here

Now the boy decided to take the girl out for a walk
Round out by 
What he did, but he got stopped, he wanted to make a little love
Put his arms around her, knickety-knocked the wig off
Looky there
(Bald head)
She didn’t have no hair
(Bald head)
Well you looky there
(Bald head)
Show me this girl there
(Bald head)
Whoa, looky here
(Bald head)
She ain't got no hair
(Bald head)
Oh, looky there
(Bald head)
Well, this girl here

Looky there
(Bald head)
She ain’t got no hair
(Bald head)
Well you looky there
(Bald head)
Show me this girl there
(Bald head)
Whoa, looky here
(Bald head)
I don't see no hair
(Bald head)
Oh, looky there
(Bald head)
She ain't got no hairEmbed
