Red Beans LyricsGot my red beans cookin'
Got my red beans is cookin'
Got my red beans is cookin'
Got my red beans is cookin'
Yea my red beans is cookin'
When they get done
I'm gon' give you some
I'm goin' down to Louisiana
Gonna find me a ham bone boy
I'm goin' down to Louisiana
Gonna find me a ham bone boy
I'm gonna have all these women
Jumpin' for joy
I ain't foolin'
I ain't foolin'
I ain't foolin'
I ain't foolin'
I'm gonna have all these women
Jumpin' for joy
Got my red beans cookin'
Got my red beans is cookin'
Got my red beans is cookin'
Got my red beans is cookin'
Yea my red beans is cookin'
When they get done
I'm gon' give you some
Oh, come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
I'm gonna have all these women
Jumpin' for joyEmbed
