Ten Seconds To Midnight LyricsTen
Apes turn into men
And grapes turn into wine
How we made it to nine
I'll never know
Eight
Man looks for a mate
But fate plays cruel tricks
And seven turns to six
Still he's alone
Along comes number five
Eureka I'm alive
I think therefore I am
A lucky man
Three
From this balcony
The two of us can see
The place where we first met
One wet SundayEmbed
