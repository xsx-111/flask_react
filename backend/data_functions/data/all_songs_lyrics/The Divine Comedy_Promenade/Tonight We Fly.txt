Tonight We Fly Lyrics
Tonight we fly
Over the houses
The streets and the trees
Over the dogs down below
They'll bark at our shadows
As we float by on the breeze

Tonight we fly
Over the chimney tops
Skylights and slates
Looking into all your lives
And wondering why
Happiness is so hard to find

(We'll fly)
Over the doctor, over the soldier
Over the farmer, over the poacher
Over the preacher, over the gambler
Over the teacher, over the writer
Over the lawyer, over the dancer
Over the voyeur
Over the builder and the destroyer
Over the hills and far away
Tonight we fly
Over the mountains
The beach and the sea
Over the friends that we've known
And those that we now know
And those whom we've yet to meet

And when we die
Oh, will we be that
Disappointed or sad
If heaven doesn't exist
What will we have missed
This life is the best we've ever had1Embed
