The Summerhouse LyricsDo you remember the way it used to be?
June to September in a cottage by the sea
Distant cousins, local kids
We climbed every tree together
And it never ever rained
'Til we climbed back on the train
That would take us so far away
From the village and the rain
And the summerhouse
Where we found new games to play
Do you remember Sunday lunch on the lawn?
Daring escapes at midnight
And costumeless bathes at dawn
You were only nine years old
And I was barely ten
It's kind of weird to be back here again
Do you remember
The summerhouse
Our summerhouse?Embed
