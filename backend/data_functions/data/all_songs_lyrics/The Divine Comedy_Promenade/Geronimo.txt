Geronimo Lyrics
While they have been eating the rain has started falling
Gradually gathering in strength what began a drizzle
Has now become torrential and doesn't look like coming to an end
The two bedraggled figures that huddle in the doorway
With nothing vaguely waterproof to wear are now secretly wishing
They'd listened to their mothers when being told to always be prepared
Screaming "Geronimo!"
They run for it, down the road with an arm around her waist
He leads her to a place he knows

Soaked through, but happy they squelch up to the landing
The room before them makes a welcome sight
The coal fire is throwing strange shapes upon the hearth rug
And crying out to be knelt down beside
She pulls off her jumper and flings it in the corner
He picks it up and hangs it on a chair
She puts on a record and sings into her coffee
He puts a blanket round her, sits her down and dries her beautiful hairEmbed
