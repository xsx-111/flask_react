A Seafood Song LyricsWho'll have a fishy
On a little dishy?
Who will have a fishy
When the boat comes...
And then he says
"With our glasses both raised in a toast
Let's sing for those in peril on the sea
Who cater ceaselessly
To thy every wish with every fish
As fresh as fish can be
Y'see, I do like my oysters
My king prawns and caviar
No matter how far away they are
I'll be there"
And then she says
"Now with our glasses both raised in this toast
Let's sing for those in peril on the sea
Who labour tirelessly
In their tiny boats off John O' Groats
Their socks soaked for me
Y'see, I do like my lobster
My hake, skate and rainbow trout
And if there's a fishy smell about
I'll be there"
And then, and then
We'll sing for those in peril on the sea
Don't be frightened, don't be scared
Chop off their heads and little legs
Then peel away the shell
And open up your senses to the smell
The sound and colour, touch and taste
Of crabs, cod, clams and kippers
Scampi, squid, sole, shark and scallop
Winkles, whelks, whale and whiting
Seaweed, swordfish, sardines and sea urchin
Haddock, halibut, herrings and eel
Cockles, mussels, mackerel, geel
Pilchard, plankton, St Peter's fish and plaice
Octopussy, jellyfishy
And dolphin's an aquired taste
Who'll have a fishy
On a little dishy?
I will have a fishy
When the boat comes inEmbed
