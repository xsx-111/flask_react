Remote Control Lyrics
Who needs remote control
From the Civic Hall
Push a button
Activate
You got to work
You're late

It's so grey in London town
With a Panda car crawlin' around
Here it comes
Eleven o'clock
Where can we go now?

Can't make a noise
Can't get no gear
Can't make no money
Can't get outta here

Big business it don't like you
It don't like the things ya' do
They got no money
They got no power
They think you're useless
An' so you are, punk!
They had a meeting in Mayfair
They got ya' down and they want to keep you there
It makes them worried
Their bank accounts
That's all that matters
You don't count

Can't make no progress
Can't get ahead
Can't stop the regress
Don't wanna be dead
(Look out those rules and regulations)


Who needs the Parliament
Sittin' makin' laws all day
They're all fat and old
Queuin' for the House of Lords
Repression (gonna start on Tuesday)
Repression (gonna be a Dalek)
Repression (I am a robot)
Repression (I obey)1Embed
