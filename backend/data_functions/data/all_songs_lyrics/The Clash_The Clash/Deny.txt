Deny Lyrics
Deny, you're such a liar
Wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the eye
Deny, you're such a liar
Sellin' your no no all the time

And you said we were goin' out to The Hundred Club
Then you said "It ain't my scene"
Then you turned up alone
Then you turned up alone

Deny, you're such a liar
Wouldn't know the truth hit you in the street
Deny, you're such a liar
You're sellin' your no no all the time

Then said you'd given it up
Gone and kicked it in the head
You said you ain't had none for weeks
Baby I seen your arms, baby I seen your arms

Deny, you're such a liar
Wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the eye
Deny, you're such a liar
Sellin' your no no all the time
Do you think I'm a ravin' idiot?
Just got off the boat
"Step in line, sign this form"
Baby ain't got a heart
You ain't got a hope

(What a liar)
Deny you're such a liar
Deny, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Let's hear it for true love
You know like in the 12P comic
In a room filled with scream a'with ice cream
Boy meets girl
Somebody gets run over
Oh, everybody cried
But I don't know why
I'm a fool, I can't control
I've read a'one too many books
I believe everything I read
What they've written in the Slutsville paper
Deny, you're such a lie1Embed
