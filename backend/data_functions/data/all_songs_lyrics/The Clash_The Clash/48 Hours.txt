48 Hours Lyrics
Friday or Saturday, what does that mean?
Short space of time an' needs a heavy scene
Monday is comin' like a jail on wheels

Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs a'forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, forty-eight thrills

So tell me, and I'll take the tube
You know a girl, yeah well she's bound to be rude
Can't a'get a'nothin' at the places I've been

Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs a'forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, forty-eight thrills

I've combed this town from top to bottom
Try to get around but my legs are broken
Every time, I miss it, 'cause I ain't got a ticket
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs a'forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, forty-eight thrills

Cheap thrills
And he got thrills
Kickin' for kicks

Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs a'forty-eight
Forty-eight hours needs forty-eight
Thrills, forty-eight thrillsEmbed
