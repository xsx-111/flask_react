Garageland Lyrics
Back in the garage with my bullshit detector
Carbon monoxide makin' sure it's effective
People ringin' up makin' offers for my life
I just want to stay in the garage all night

We're a garage band, oh
We come from Garageland, oh

Meanwhile things are hottin' up in the West End alright
Contracts in the offices, groups in the night
My bumming slumming friends have all got new boots
And someone just asked me if the group would wear suits

We're a garage band, oh
We come from Garageland, oh

I don't want to hear about what the rich are doin'
I don't want to go to where, where the rich are goin'
They think they're so clever, they think they're so right
But the truth is only known by guttersnipes
We're a garage band, oh
We come from Garageland, oh

There's twenty-two singers! But one microphone
Back in the garage
There's five guitar players! But one guitar
Back in the garage
Complaints! Complaints! What an old bag

Back in the garage
Back in the garage
Back in the garage1Embed
