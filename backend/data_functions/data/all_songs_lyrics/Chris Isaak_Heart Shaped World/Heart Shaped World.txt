Heart Shaped World Lyrics
Trouble going round, trouble going down
What happened to you little baby
What happened to you little girl?
She said she'd always love you, in you heart shaped world

Trouble going round, trouble in this town
What happened to you little baby
What happened to you little girl?
She left you out there crying, in your heart shaped world

I know what love means too you, I love you to
It hurts to watch her laugh at you, with someone new
Trouble, trouble


Trouble going round, round, round, round, round
Big cold sunless skies tumbling down, down, down, down
What happened to you little baby
What happened to you little girl?
She said she'd always love you, in you heart shaped world
In your heart shaped world
(Trouble, trouble) in your heart shaped world
(Trouble, trouble) in your heart shaped world
Trouble, heart shaped world
Trouble, in your heart shaped world
(Trouble, trouble) in your heart shaped
(Trouble, trouble) in your heart shaped world1Embed
