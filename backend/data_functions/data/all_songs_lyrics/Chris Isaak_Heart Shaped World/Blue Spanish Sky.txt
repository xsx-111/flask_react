Blue Spanish Sky Lyrics
It's a big blue spanish sky
Lay on my back and watch clouds roll by
I've got the time to wonder why
She left me

It's a slow sad spanish song
I knew the words but I sang them wrong
The one I love has left and gone
Without me

Now she's gone, our world has changed
Watching a blue sky, thinking of rain

It's a slow sad spanish song
I knew the words but I sang them wrong
The one that I love has left and gone
Without me

It's a big blue spanish sky
I lay on my back and watch clouds roll by
I only wish I could make you cry
Like I do
Like I do
Like I doEmbed
