Forever Young Lyrics
I knew the first time we meet we'd be lovers
Last time we kissed I was blue
First time you left I discovered
That there won't be another like you

Forever young, love will always be
Forever young, love will always be

Every day you were gone I was lonely
Each night you were gone I was blue
Now darling I'll be with you only
And our love will always be true

Forever young, love will always be
Forever young, our love will always be

And to the end I know I will love only you

I knew the first time we meet we'd be lovers
Last time we kissed I was blue
The first time you left I discovered
That there won't be another like you
Forever young, love will always be
Forever young, love will always beEmbed
