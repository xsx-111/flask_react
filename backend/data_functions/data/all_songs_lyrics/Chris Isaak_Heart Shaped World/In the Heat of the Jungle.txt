In the Heat of the Jungle LyricsIn the heat of the jungle, in the heat of the night
Sat an African princess in the pale moonlight
Saying go bobalua, go baby go
I love you, I love, you, goodnight
I go hide in the jungle, and I dance til' I drop
With an African princess and nope I don't stop
I watch tv til' midnight I do
Just what I please, I love you, I love you, goodnight
In the heat of the jungle, in the heat of the night
Sat an African princess in the pale moonlight
Saying go bobalua, go baby go
I love you, I love, you, goodnight
Hey...Ohh... Just gets crazy from here!Embed
