Wrong to Love You Lyrics
Little girl standing and I'm so alone
Little girl whispers, "Stranger come home."
Sad little eyes, so much to say
Oh, what a game little girls play, and it must be

Wrong to love you like I do
Must be wrong to love you like I do

Little girl talking, casting her spell
Little girl moving, moving so well
I can hear music, sounds so far away
And I can hear voices, I know just what they say

Must be wrong to love you like I do
It must be wrong to love you like I do

My head goes around and 'round
My heart comes a-tumbling down
Your hot kisses only make know it's true
Your loving only makes me think of you

(Do I do I do I do I do I do I do
Do I do I do I do I do I do I)
There will be no song of love there will be no sweet refrain
There will be no soft goodbye or slow walk in the rain
(Do I do I do I do I do I do I do
Do I do I do I do I do I do I)
There will be no whispered words, no vows that can't come true
There's only me waiting here for you and it must be

Wrong to love you like I do, (Wrong to love you) it must be
Wrong to love you like I do. (Wrong to love you)
Wrong to love you, (Wrong to love you)
Wrong to love you, (Wrong to love you)
Wrong to love you, (Wrong to love you) Like I do
Do I do I do I do I do I do I do
Do I do I do I do I do I do I
I do!Embed
