Kings of the Highway LyricsThe one that I loved used to laugh when I cried
The one that I loved wouldn't stay by my side
If love could've lasted forever, I'd be with her today
If love could've lasted forever, I'd still hear her say
"Darlin', kings of the highway, we will be"
The faster you drive, the less you can feel
The lights on the road are strange and unreal
When there's nothing to lose, there's nothing to win
In a night without day, on a road without end
Darling, kings of the highway, we will be
And you're hoping the sun won't rise
You're hoping the sun won't rise
Kings of the highway, we will be
The one that I loved used to laugh when I cried
The one that I loved wouldn't stay by my side
If love could've lasted forever, I'd be with her today
If love could've lasted forever, I'd still hear her say
"Darlin', kings of the highway, we will be"
Darling, kings of the highway, we will be
Darling, kings of the highway, we will be
We will beEmbed
