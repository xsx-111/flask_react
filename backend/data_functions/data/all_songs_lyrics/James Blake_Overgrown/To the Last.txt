To the Last LyricsWe're going to the last, you and I
We're going to the last, you and I
You’re more to me than any, any sum
Never enough for an only son
And I won't have you tell me it went wrong
All I’ve seen is what you’ve done
To the last, you and I
To the last, you and I
For me, for me
For me, for me
For me, for me
For me, for me
For me, for me
You compare yourself in so many lights
And I won't have you tell me it went wrong
All I see is what you've done
For me, for me
For me, for me
For me, for me
For me
We're going to the last, you and I
We're going to the last, you and I
We're going to the last, you and I
To the last, you and I8Embed
