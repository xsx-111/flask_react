I Am Sold Lyrics
Linked like dog to man
I am sold

And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel

You said it was a flash of green
But you don't know

And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
(And we lay, nocturnal)
Speculate what we feel
(And we lay, nocturnal)
Speculate what we feel

And I don't embellish you
The snow comes like a breath
But it may be the constellation
That shows us where we are
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
(Speculate what we feel)
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
(And we lay, nocturnal)

It's the most alone you felt
And I'm glad I could help
I could talk this over
Twenty times again
Everything you learned from us I learned
It's the most alone you felt
I'm glad I could help

And I don't embellish you
The snow comes like a breath
But it may be the constellation
That shows us where we are

And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
(Speculate what we feel)
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
(And we lay, nocturnal)
(And we lay, nocturnal)
(And we lay, nocturnal)
(Speculate what we feel)11Embed
