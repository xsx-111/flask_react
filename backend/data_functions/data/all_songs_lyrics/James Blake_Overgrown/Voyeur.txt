Voyeur Lyrics
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me

'Cause I am flawed

And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
If I know her mind was on me

And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
If I know her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me

And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
If I know her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me

And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
If I know her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
And her mind was on me
