Digital Lion Lyrics
(What-)
(What fee-)
(What feels like months)
(What-)
(What fee-)
(What feels like months)
But really it's days
Digital lion
(I can see you prowling)
Digital lion
I can see you prowling
And even if you ask right
For what feels like months
But really it's days
For what feels like months
But really it's days
Digital lion
