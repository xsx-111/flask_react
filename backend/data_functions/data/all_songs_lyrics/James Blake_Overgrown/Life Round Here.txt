Life Round Here Lyrics
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done

Now we’re at square one
And we wait too long
'Til we’re at square one
We never done...

Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done

Now we’re at square one
And we wait too long
'Til we’re at square one
Til we’re at square one
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done40Embed
