Take a Fall for Me Lyrics
He can't marry her
He can't marry her yet
Son, your journey's hard

The seven Elohim (Take a fall for me)
Breathe a breath of life inside the human being
Joined through this love, nothing could come between
Blood is thicker than mud, liquor the elixir of love
Turn this square dance into a passion hug
Tight as the grip of the squid
Gentle as the finger touch of a newborn kid
I wouldn't trade her smile for a million quid
Don't let my love fall, keep building it
I heard through the grapevine (Take a fall for me)
That great love, it takes time
Sex shapes the body, truth shapes the mind
Candle light dinners of fish and chips with vinegar
(All of me)
With a glass of cold stout or wine or something similar
(All you will is)
Swim the English Channel to the Italian Peninsula
Her strong pheromones with cologne enhance the stench of her (Stay in time)
But she asked for romance, spent this love into her
Don't let me fall, always remember us (He can't marry her yet)
Don't throw the dice
Don't let them throw the rice
Don't throw my soul over to the poltergeist
His heart was cold like it was soaked in ice
A stroke of your love is like a stroke of life
Melt in the heat of my passion
Magnetic attraction
It's causing a strong reaction (He can't marry her yet)
I need you like I need satisfaction
I need you like I need satisfaction
(-yet, -yet)
What will become of me
If I can't show my love to thee?
What will become of me?
What will become of me
If I can't show my love to thee? (He can't 'arry her yet)
What will become of me?
I heard (Take a fall for me) through the grapevine
That great love, it takes time
Sex shapes the body, Truth shapes the mind
Candle light dinner, fish and chips with the vinegar
With a glass of cold stout or wine or something similar
Swim the English Channel to the Italian Peninsula
Her strong pheromones with cologne enhance the stench of her
But she asked for romance, I'm deep into her
Donâ€™t let her fall, always remember us
Don't marry him, no no no no no
Don't marry him (He can't marry her)
Don't marry him, don't carry him to paradise
Don't let them throw the dice
Don't let them throw the rice
Don't turn my soul deep into the poltergeist
His heart turns cold like it was soaked in ice (He can't marry her)
Melt inside the heat of my passion
Magnetic attraction, to cause a strong reaction
I need you like I need satisfaction
I need you like I need satisfaction
Don't turn away from me
What will become of me?
If I can't show my love to thee
There'll be none of me
You'll leave me with none of me
Not even one of me16Embed
