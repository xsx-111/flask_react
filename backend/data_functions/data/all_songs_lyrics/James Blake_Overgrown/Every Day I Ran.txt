Every Day I Ran Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
I am
I laugh (The last)
Don't be so fast
Slow it down to a screeching halt
But think before he talk
Every day

I laugh
When you think that you have seen the last of emotions
I laugh
Slow it down to
I laugh
When you think that you have seen the last of emotions
I laugh
Slow it down to
I laugh
When you think that you have seen the last of emotions
I laugh
Slow it down to
I laugh
When you think that you have seen the last of emotions
I laugh
Slow it down to
I laugh
When you think that you have seen the last of emotions
I laugh
Slow it down to
I laugh
When you think that you have seen the last of emotions
I laugh
Slow it down to
I laugh
When you think that you have seen the last of emotions
I laugh
Slow it down to
Every day I ran1Embed
