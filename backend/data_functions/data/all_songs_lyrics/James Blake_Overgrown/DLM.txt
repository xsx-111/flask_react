DLM Lyrics
She knows a good thing now
Without our love and darkening at all
In my hair and in my thoughts
In my hair and in my thoughts
We spend the whole day sore
We're feeling more apart
And we know we can do more

(Mm) Please, don't let me hurt you more
(Mm) It's in your stare and at your core
(Mm) Please, don't let me hurt you more
(Mm) Please, don't let it hurt you more

I know this journey (Will end) soon
The colour of our lights
And our lives they can resume

Please, don't let it hurt you more
It's in your stare and at your core9Embed
