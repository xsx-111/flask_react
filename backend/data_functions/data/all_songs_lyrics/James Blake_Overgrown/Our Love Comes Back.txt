Our Love Comes Back LyricsYou know how we’ve grown
And how they capture every tone
Well, everyone’s a writer
Well, I see the pictures of every life and the day they die
But it’s your image burnt into my mind
And again I find
That it’s worth the climb
And I love that it's right on time
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night4Embed
