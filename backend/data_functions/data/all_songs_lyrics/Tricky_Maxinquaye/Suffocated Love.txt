Suffocated Love Lyrics
It's too good, it's too nice
She makes me finish too quick
Is it love? No, not love
She turns my sexual trick
She says she's mine, I know she lies
First, I scream, then I cry
Take a second of me
You beckon, I'll be
She suffocates me
She suffocates me with suggestion
I ask 'Do you feel the same?'
And later on, maybe
I'll tell you my real name
She's so good, she's so bad
You understand, I can't stand
Now I could just kill a man
She's on her knees, I say please
I caress her silly lies, she's got brown eyes

I think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me
And stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know why
Forgive and you're forgiven
Kingdom come
Can you wait for yours, I need to taste some
Life's pretty funny, I laugh while she spends my money
She's my freak, I guess I'm weak
You ask what is this?
Mind your business
I pass idle days with my idle ways
'Til the twelfth of always
She walks my hallways
I keep her warm, but we never kiss
She cuts my slender wrists
Let's waste some more time
I sign the dotted line
A different level
She - devil

I think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me
And stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know why

You ask what is this?
Mind your business
I pass my idle days with my idle ways
Til the twelfth of always
She walks my hallways
I keep her warm but we never kiss
She says I'm weak and immature
But it's cool, I know what money's for
Push comes to shove
Her tongue's her favorite weapon on attack
I slap her back, she mostly hates me
I think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me
And stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know why

Can I take off your clothes before we go out?
And when you're helpless, I'll scream and shout
We finish everyday (well, anyway)
Sixty-nine degrees
My head's between your knees
You ask what is this?
Mind your business
It's too good, it's too nice
She makes me finish too quick
Is it love? No, not love
She turns my sexual trick
She says she's mine, I know she lies
First, I scream, then I cry
Take a second of me
You beckon, I'll be
Take a second of me

I think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me
And stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know why
I know why the caged bird sings, I know why
