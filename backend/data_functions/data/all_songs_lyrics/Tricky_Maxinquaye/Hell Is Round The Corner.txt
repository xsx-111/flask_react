Hell Is Round The Corner LyricsI stand firm for our soil (a source)
Lick a rock on foil (nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me, (They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in Stussy
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter (been livin' on a study)
If you believe and (or) deceive common sense says shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my life
And when you walk, do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take further evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence
A reference to your preference to say
I'm a good neighbor, I trudge, (shrug)
So judge me for labor
Live version of the song. The bond on me ensures (lobotomy) my good behavior
The constant struggle (strum) ensures my insanity
Passing the ignorance ensures the struggle for my family
We're hungry beware of our appetite
Distant drums bring the news of a kill tonight
The kill which I share with my passengers
We take our fill, take our fill, take our fill
I stand firm for our soil (a source)
Lick a rock on foil (nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me, (They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in Stussy
Confused by different memories
Details of Asian remedies
Conversations, of what's become of enemies
My brain thinks bomb-like
So I listen he's a calm type
And as I grow, I grow collective
Before the move sit on the perspective
Mr. Quaye (Mr. Kray) lay in the crevice. (Distant cradle in the crevice)
And watches from the precipice
Imperial passage
Heat from the sun some days slowly passes
Until then, you have to live with yourself
Until then, you have to live with yourself10Embed
