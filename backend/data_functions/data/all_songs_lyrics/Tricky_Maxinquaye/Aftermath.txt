Aftermath Lyrics
For once, there's someone
For he, for she
For once, there's someone
For he, for me

Your eyes resemble mine
You see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom
Speak of our peoples plan
I'll be here for my baby
For my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you
Things you need to hear

So this is the Aftermath

"Let me tell you about my mother"

How can I be sure?
In a world that's constantly changing
How can I be sure?
Just when I thought
I was winning
Just when I thought
I could not be stopped2Embed
