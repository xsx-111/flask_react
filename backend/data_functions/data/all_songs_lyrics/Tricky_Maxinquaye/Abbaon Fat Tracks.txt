Abbaon Fat Tracks LyricsFuck you in
Tuck you in
Suck you in
"Then you fly, fly as fast as you can to Baby Jesus" (from the movie "The Rapture")
I am she
Mistakes of men
Gritty teeth
Fists all clenched
And breast stroke
Lots of touching
See you in the sauna
There'll be big fauna
At my hotel, motel
Hotel, motel
I fuck you in the ass
Just for a laugh
With the quick speed
I'll make your nose bleed
I ride the pre-menstrual cycle
Forget about Michael
Now here's the big blast
I like the big catch
I'll spray you straight through
I spray your daydreams
Enjoy myself
Within myself
And back again
Encouraging sin
A powerful mind
Devious mind for a devious kind
Ugly noises and strange ways
By the two praise
I roll up the blue bills
I snort the cheap thrillsEmbed
