Pumpkin LyricsPumpkin, you're hollow within
More how I'm too slow
Let their harm give us some
Sad until like flowers untamed
Shine out ends
I find what'll make him
Love me
Life is our find
Hollow is he
I can't breathe and I can't see
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand
You go your way and I'll see mine
Feels like wasted time
And it feels like I must be blind
How'd you like yourself?
You don't know yourself
To a hollow kind, don't mind
Love is some of you
Dabble in fall of failure
How, how bad
I smell of she
And I fail to be
Well anyway
Well anyway
Well anyway
See how high
Go on
I can't see and I can't breathe
I can't see and I can't breathe
I can't see and I can't breathe
I can't see and I can't breathe
Well anyway
Well anyway
Well anyway1Embed
