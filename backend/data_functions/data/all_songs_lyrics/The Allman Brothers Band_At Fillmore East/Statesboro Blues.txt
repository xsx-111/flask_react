Statesboro Blues Lyrics
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door

I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
I woke up this morning, had them Statesboro Blues
Well, I looked over in the corner baby, and Grandpa seemed to have them too

Well my momma died and left me, my poppa died and left me
I ain't good looking baby but I'm somewhat sweet and kind
I'm goin' to the country, baby do you wanna go?
But if you can't make it baby, your sister Lucille said she wanna go
And I sure will take her

I love that woman, better than any woman I've ever seen
Well I love that woman better than any woman I've ever seen
Now she treat me like a king, yeah, yeah, yeah
And she look like a dog gone queen

Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your doorEmbed
