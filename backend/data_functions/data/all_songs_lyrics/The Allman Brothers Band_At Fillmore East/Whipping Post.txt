Whipping Post Lyrics
I've been run down
I've been lied to
I don't know why
I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money
Wrecked my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinking in some crosstown bar

Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying


My friends tell me
That I've been such a fool
And I have to stand by and take it, babe
All for loving you
I drown myself in sorrow
As I look at what you've done
But nothing seems to change
The bad times stay the same
And I can't run
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying


Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying4Embed
