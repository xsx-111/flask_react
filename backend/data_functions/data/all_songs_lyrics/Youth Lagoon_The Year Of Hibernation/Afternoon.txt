Afternoon LyricsThe TV lights the room
Like a strobe against the wall
I've watched all afternoon without watching at all
I'm thinking of you dear
Every moment I'm awake
I tied my hands with rope, and now I want to escape
Did I make a mistake?
There's a demon on the loose
He's a head-hunter I'm sure
Cause I saw him late last night
Knocking on my bedroom door
I have worries in my blood
Pumping through my body's veins
And when I speak I don't make sense
But believe me when I sing4Embed
