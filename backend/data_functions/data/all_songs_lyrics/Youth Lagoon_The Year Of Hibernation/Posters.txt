Posters LyricsWhen I was only 9 years old
I had a lawyers mouth
But without the law or without the education or motivation
I knew what I wanted to be (wanted to be)
Even though each year it never was the same vocation
I started getting older I took it on myself
To find out why I'm the way that I am
But I can't find a conclusion
Though I think I'm getting closer
I know I'm getting closer
My whole wall is filled with posters
My whole life is filled with posters
I used to be outspoken doing anything for someone's attention
And when that changed I guess you thought
That I was no longer me
Although I finally found me
So take the other bodies
And put them by your TV
You'll make real friends quickly
You'll make real friends quickly
But not meEmbed
