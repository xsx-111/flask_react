Ghost to Me (Bonus Track) LyricsFollow me, I see your silhouette
By your mother and your fathers bed
Your father grins as he hears what you said
To me in the park on the blanket
Home is where I call the ghost of my own
That haunts the basement where I sleep alone
It's seen the burns on my skin showing bones
And asks me why I still sleep with my phone
Wandering back from campus half asleep
Across the bridge leading to your keep
Every minute is a memory
You don't exist you're just a ghost to meEmbed
