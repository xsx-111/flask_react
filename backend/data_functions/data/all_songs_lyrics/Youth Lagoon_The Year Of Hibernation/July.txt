July LyricsExplosions pillaging the night
Like fireworks on the Fourth of July
It's me my lady our friends and I
Smoking cigars and yelling at cars as they travel by
We scaled a ladder ascending to the roof
While five years ago I wept and no one knew
Holding my guitar I strummed a tune
Singing, "I love you but I have to cut you loose"
Ah-ah-ahah-ah-ahah-ah-ah-ahah-ah-ah (Repeat)
The neighbours light off
Small bombs we watch
From the rooftops
Safely, so safely
If I'd never let go
Then only god knows where I would be now
I built a bridge between us and I slowly burned it
Five years ago in my backyard I sang love away
Little did I know, real love had not quite yet found me
Ah-ah-ahah-ah-ahah-ah-ah-ahah-ah-ah (Repeat)3Embed
