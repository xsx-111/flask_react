The Wanton Song Lyrics
Silent woman in the night, you came
Took my seed from my shaking frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on

Silent woman through the flames, you come
From the deep behind the sun
Seems my nightmares, my loving gun
Left me barely holding on, oh

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run

Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one?
Ooh, in the darkness can you hear me call?
Another day has just begun
Another day, yeah

Ooooh
Silent woman, my face is changed
Some know in ways to come
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
And the wheel rolls on, rolls on
Rolls on, rolls on, babe, oooooooh2Embed
