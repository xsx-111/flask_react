Knot LyricsRising up
Broken down by will of time
Swallow pride, wake you up divine
Protects the low
Watching those who will not shine
What is lost, we will find
Gave up lifetime
Not on time, set shows the den
The center moves the spineless free
Senses are dead
Push your head, but cannot see
Can't look back up from the deep
This side the wind keeps blowing
Yet cuts me to the bone
And now these hearts keep beating
No gestures cold as stone
The falling spade
The wheel to blame the warning now
Onto a burning massive flame
The heavy fate to soon create will never die
What still belongs possess the threat
This doubtless spree of chaos
Woven into the skies
No gods of ancient ages
A coven we despiseEmbed
