Gemini LyricsThose days, where were we to go?
Stumbling down the empty streets that were swallowing us whole
Breathing was the thing, we traversed these hazy mountain paths
Sipping harsh elixir, the ice above us melting fast
I'm coming home
It's been so long
I'm coming home
Held fast the ship that board us forth
Enveloped in the darkness, buried frosty dreams in all
Spoke to me in slumber, fleeing on the wings of dawn
Ember flame arising, we better journey on
I'm coming home
I'm coming homeEmbed
