B.B.K. Lyrics
So you see I've gotten this far
Please give me some place to rage
I'm not trying to go there so take me away
Life sometimes pisses me off
It's never a good trip for me
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away

Night, so I play!
Give me a sign!
This is day!
Give me some patience, so I pray!
It's time to die!
Is that what I want?

There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved
Is there something wrong with me?
For once in my life, I'd like to be really set free
Let me be me

Night, so I play!
Give me a sign!
This is day!
Give me some guidance, so I pray!
It's time to die!
Is that what I want?
Take me away
Taken away
Take me away
Taken away

Night, so I play!
Give me a sign!
This is day!
Give me some patience, so I pray!
It's time to die!
Is that what I want?
Night, so I play!
Give me the sign!
This is day!
Give me some guidance, so I pray!
It's time to die!
Is that what I want?2Embed
