Pretty Lyrics
So, so young
Raped
But I don't realize
Small, white legs, broke
The pain between her thighs

I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor
What a disgrace
Who do I feel sorry for?

Skin so cold
How could someone steal a life?
Takes the blame
Wait, I got some shit to say

I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor
What a disgrace
Who do I feel sorry for?
Smashed and raped!
Not again, this is a real crime
What a pretty face
Who do I feel sorry for?
Wait, something now rips my heart
And takes my soul
I wait too late now, I feel hurt inside
Take my soul away!
Away!

I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor
What a disgrace
Who do I feel sorry for?
Smashed and raped
Not again, this is a real crime
What a pretty face
Who do I feel sorry for?5Embed
