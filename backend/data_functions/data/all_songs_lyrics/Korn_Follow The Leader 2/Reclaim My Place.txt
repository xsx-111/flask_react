Reclaim My Place Lyrics
What the fuck?

I'm so numb therefore I can't relate
I'm so dumb there is nothing to hate
Really is it me or is it fate?
Give me peace or release for fuck's sake

Give them something to say
Something super fly, never played
All I hear is disgrace
Erase them all and reclaim my place

In the past I was known as a freak
Had no friends, picked on â€˜cause I was weak
Save my ass, I got into this band
Never thought the band would pick on the man

Give them something to say
Something super fly, never played
All I hear is disgrace
Erase them all and reclaim my place
Reclaim my place!
Reclaim my place!
Reclaim my place!
Say it to my face

So I look around at all these stupid little faces
Something I can never slap but I embrace
You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be
You want to fuck around, then come on fuck with me
You think you can relate, you'll never ever find
You think you feel my hate, look at me and you will find
My fate you always raped, I will always be the sound
You want to fuck with me, come on, fucking play

Now you can feel it, my heart beats down!
Yes, you feel it come, right now!
You can feel it, my heart beats down!
Yes, you feel it come, right now!
You can feel it, my heart beats down!
Yes, you feel it come, bow down!
Bow down!
Bow down!
Bow down!
Give them something to say
Something super fly, never played
All I hear is disgrace
Erase them all and reclaim my place

What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?1Embed
