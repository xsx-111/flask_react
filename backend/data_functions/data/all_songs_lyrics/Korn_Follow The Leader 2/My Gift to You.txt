My Gift to You Lyrics
There you are my precious
Not long ago
Hiding behind the shadows
Of your broken soul
Why is it always you want something
You can never have?
Why did you try to tell me?
How could you be this way?

Your throat I take grasp
Then your eyes roll back
Love racing through my veins
Your heart stops beating
Black orgasms
I kiss your lifeless skin

There you are my precious
With your broken soul
Rubbing my crotch elated
Taking control
Why is it always you fuck up something
You have always had?
Why'd you try to tell me?
How could you be so cold?
Your throat I take grasp
Then your eyes roll back
Love racing through my veins
Your heart stops beating
Black orgasms
I kiss your lifeless skin

Here I am, just a man
Feeling pain, gives me life
Relieving us is my plan
I'd do anything just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your...

I hate you!
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you!
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you!
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you!
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you!
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you!
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you!
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you!
Your throat I take grasp
Then your eyes roll back
Love racing through my veins
Your heart stops beating
Black orgasms
I kiss your lifeless skin
Lifeless skin!
Lifeless skin!
Lifeless skin!
Lifeless skin!1Embed
