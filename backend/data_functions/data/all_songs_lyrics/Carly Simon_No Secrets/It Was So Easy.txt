It Was So Easy Lyrics(Carly Simon/Jacob Brackman)
I remember a time, rompin' through the woods
Sun against our skin instead of clothes
When we felt hungry we would eat, when we felt glad we'd dance
And whenever we felt drowsy we would doze
It was so easy then, never takin' any stands
It was so easy then, holdin' hands
I remember a time when our fears could be named
And courage meant not refusing dares
I remember when we took such cares to step never on the cracks
Not only in the squares
Or else we'd be abducted by the bears
It was so easy then, never makin' any plans
It was so easy then, holdin' hands
(interlude)
It was so easy then, never makin' any plans
It was so easy then, holdin' hands
And now we are grown, with debts and regrets
And broken hearts and sentimental schemes
Now every tender failure seems to overthrow old dreams
Love can drive a normal woman to extremes
It was so easy once, holdin' hands without a plan
It was so easy once, holdin' hands
Just holdin' handsEmbed
