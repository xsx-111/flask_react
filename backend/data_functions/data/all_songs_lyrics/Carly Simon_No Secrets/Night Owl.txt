Night Owl Lyrics(James Taylor)
Now a fish kinda likes the water
And that's just where he wants to be
And a monkey kinda digs bananas
So he lives in the top of a tree
But my eyes are made for darkness
So the nightime is right for me
'Cause I'm a night owl honey, sleep all day long
I'm a night owl honey, sleep all day long
Most folks like the daytime
'Cause they like to see the shining sun
They're up in the mornin'
Off and a runnin' till they're too tired for havin' fun
But when the sun goes down
And the bright lights shine
My daytime has just begun
'Cause I'm a night owl honey, sleep all day long
I'm a night owl honey, sleep all day long
Won't you turn out them bright lights baby
I said they're just about to drive me blind
Oh won't you draw then curtains for me papa
Watch and you'll see my love light shine
Now there are two sides to this great big world
And one of them is always night
If you can take care of business in the sunshine baby
I guess you're gonna be alright
But don't come looking for me to lend you a hand
My eyes just can't stand the light
'Cause I'm a night owl honey, sleep all day long
Yeah I'm a night owl honey, sleep all day long
Sleep all day long
Night owl honey
