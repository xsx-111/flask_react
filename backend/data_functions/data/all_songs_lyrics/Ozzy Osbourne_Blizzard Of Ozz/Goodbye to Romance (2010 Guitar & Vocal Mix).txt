Goodbye to Romance (2010 Guitar & Vocal Mix) Lyrics
Yesterday has been and gone
Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain?
Everybody's having fun except me
I'm the lonely one
I live in shame

I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

I've been the King, I've been the clown
Now, broken wings can't hold me down
I'm free again
The jester with the broken crown
It won't be me, this time around, to love in vain

I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end
And I feel the time is right, although I know
That you just might say to me:
"What you gonna do, what you gonna do?"
But I have to take this chance
Goodbye to friends and to romance
And to all of you
And to all of you
Come on, now


I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

And the weather's lookin' fine
And I think the sun will shine again
And I feel I've cleared my mind
All the past is left behind again
I say goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends
I tell ya
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the endEmbed
