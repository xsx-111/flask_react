No Bone Movies Lyrics
Silver screen such a disgrace
I couldn't look her straight in the face
A blue addiction I live in disgust
Degradation I'm being eaten by lust

No bone movies 

Inspiration that's blue and uncut
Can't kick the habit obssesion of smut
Voyeur straining in love with his hand
A poison passion pulsating gland


Flaps
I shouldn't do it the guilt tells me why
I just can't stop it I try and I try
X-rated demon that lives in my head
Hungry for bodge and he wants to be fed
