Steal Away (The Night) Lyrics
Now I feel the time is right
Love will flow like wine tonight
Give your love and it will come to you, yeah
If you feel that you and me
Could escape and hold the key
To a paradise that's true and free, yeah

Steal away
Steal away
Steal away the night
You gotta steal it, come on baby

Now I've met your honesty
You are here and I am free
Broken chains have fallen all around, yeah
Point my finger at the fools
Broken chains and broken rules
Let it be rebellion rules tonight, yeah

Steal away
You gotta steal away
Steal away the night
Could it be a dream come true
Now that I am here with you?
Tearful eyes of joy is something new, yeah
Run away with me tonight
Dream the dream and light the light
Happiness is what you give to me, oh yeah

Steal away
Steal away
You gotta steal away the night
Steal away
Steal away
You gotta steal away the night
Steal away
Steal away
Steal away the nightEmbed
