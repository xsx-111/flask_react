Suicide Solution Lyrics
Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows, away tomorrows
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape The Reaper
You can't escape the Master Keeper

'Cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth
What you saw can be Hell on this earth, Hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle
The Reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The Reaper's you and The Reaper is me

Breaking laws, knocking doors, but there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan
Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about
Ah, now people, you really know where it's at
Ah, ah you got it, fox
Get the flaps out, Satan, Satan, Satan, ha ha ha

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows
Take me away, oh, oh, tomorrow
It's never gettin' fixed, no flaps, nobody, no flaps, nothing?3Embed
