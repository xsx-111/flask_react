Virgo Clowns LyricsLet us free you from the pain
Let us see you smile again
Let us unlock all the chains
You're broken-hearted
Let us help you to forget
Let us help you unlock it
It's not nearly time to quit
You've only started
You gotta sit down, funny face
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Let us shake you by the hand
Let us help you understand
Take your head out of the sand
And shake it free now
Let us help you to go on
We are here to lean upon
Now you know exactly just who
You want to be now
Come on, sit down, funny face
Oh, let your laughter
Yeah, let your laughter fill the room
Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Let us lift you up on high
See the twinkle in your eye
Raise you up into the sky
And say it's easy
Hey, let the trumpets ring it
Oh, let the angels sing it
Let your pretty feet go dancing
Let your worn out mind go prancing
And sit down, oh, funny face
Oh, let your laughter fill the room
Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Oh, let your laughter fill the room, c'mon
Let your laughter fill the room
Let your laughter fill the room
Let your laughter fill the room
Let it fill the room
Oh, let it fill the room
Oh, let the laughter fill the room, oohEmbed
