Blue Money LyricsPhotographer smile
Take a break for a while
Take a rest
Do your very best
Take five, honey
Five, honey
Search in your bag
Light up a fag
Think it's a drag
But you're so glad
To be alive, honey
Alive, honey
Say, when this is all over
You'll be in clover
We'll go out and spend
All a your blue money, blue money
Well the cameraman smiles
Take a break for a while
Do your best
Your very best
Take five, honey
Take five
Well, you search in your bag
To light up a fag
Think it's a drag
But you're so glad
To be alive, honey
Alive, honey
Say, when this is all over
You'll be in clover
We'll go out and spend
All a your blue money, blue money
Say, when this is all over
We'll be in clover
We'll go out and spend all your
Blue money, blue money
Juice money, loose money
Juice money, loose money, honey
What kind a money, honey?
Juice money, loose money, blue money
Juice money, loose money, blue money
Hey, alright, juice moneyEmbed
