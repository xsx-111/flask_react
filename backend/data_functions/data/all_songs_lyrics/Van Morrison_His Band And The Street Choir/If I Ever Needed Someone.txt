If I Ever Needed Someone LyricsLord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
To see me through the daytime
(See me through the daytime)
And through the long, lonely night
To lead me through the darkness
And on into the light
To stand with me when I'm troubled
(Stand with me when I'm troubled)
And help me through my strife
At times get so uncertain, I turn to You
Turn to You, in my young life
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Someone to hold onto
(Someone to hold to)
And keep me from all fear
Someone to be my guiding light
And keep me ever dear
To keep me from-a my selfishness
(To keep me from my selfishness)
To keep-a me from-a my sorrow
To lead me on to givingness
So I can see a new tomorrow
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Someone to walk with
Whoa, someone to hold by the hand
Someone to talk with
Someone to understand
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
To call on when I need You
(Call on when I need You)
And I need You, very much
To open up my arms to You
(Feel your tender touch)
Feel your tender touch
To feel it and to keep it
(Feel it and keep it)
To keep it right here in my soul
(Yeah, yeah)
And care for it and keep it with me
(Never, never to grow old)
Never to grow old
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
Lord, if I ever needed someone
I need You
One more time, again
Lord, if I ever needed, needed some a-one
I need You
Lord, oh if I ever needed some a-one
I need YouEmbed
