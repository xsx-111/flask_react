Get Up, Stand Up Lyrics
Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

You, preacher man don't tell me
Heaven is under the earth
You a duppy and you don't know
What life is really worth
It's not all that glitter is gold
And half the story has never been told
So now we see the light
We gonna stand up for your rights
Come on

Get up, stand up, brother
Stand up for your rights, come on
Get up, stand up, sisters
Don't give up the fight, I'm beggin' you to
Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
I say don't give up the fight
'Cause you know most people think
A great God will come from the skies
Take away every little thing
And left everybody dry
But if you know what life is worth
You would look for yours right here on earth
And now we see the light
We gonna stand up for our rights
Come on

Get up, stand up
Don't make them push you 'round
Stand up for your rights, come on brothers
Get up, stand up, be brave, now
Don't give up the fight, I say
Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Don't let them hold you down
Get up, stand up
I say don't give up the fight
We're sick and tired of this game of technology
Humbly asking Jesus for His mercy
We know and we know and understand
Almighty Jah is a living man
You fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
And now we see the light
We gonna stand up for our rights
Come on
Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights, come on brothers
Get up, stand up
I say don't give up the fight
Don't let them push you 'round
I say, get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Come on sisters
Get up, stand up
I say don't give up the fightEmbed
