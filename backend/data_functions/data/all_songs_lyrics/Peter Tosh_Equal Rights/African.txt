African LyricsDon't care where you come from
As long as you're a black man, you're an African
No mind your nationality
You have got the identity of an African
'Cause if you come from Clarendon
(You are an African)
And if you come from Portland
(You are an African)
And if you come from Westmoreland, you're an African
So don't care where you come from
As long as you're a black man, you're an African
No mind your nationality
You have got the identity of an African
'Cause if you come from Trinidad
(You are an African)
And if you come from Nassau
(You are an African)
And if you come from Cuba, you're an African
So don't care where you come from
As long as you're a black man, you're an African
No mind your complexion
There is no rejection, you're an African
'Cause if your 'plexion high, high, high
If your 'plexion low, low
And if your 'plexion in between, you're an African
So don't care where you come from
As long as you're a black man, you're an African
No mind denomination
That is only segregation, you're an African
Cause if you go to the Catholic
(You are an African)
And if you go to the Methodist
(You are an African)
And if you go to the Church of Gods, you're an African
So don't care where you come from
As long as you're a black man, you're an African
No mind your nationality
You have got the identity of an African
Cause if you come from Brixton
(You are an African)
And if you come from Weesday
(You are an African)
And if you come from Wingstead
(You are an African)
And if you come from Bronx
(You are an African)
And if you come from Brooklyn
(You are an African)
And if you come from Queens
(You are an African)
And if you come from Manhattan
(You are an African)
And if you come from Canada
(You are an African)
And if you come from Miami
(You are an African)
And if you come from Switzerland
(You are an African)
And if you come from Germany
(You are an African)
And if you come from Russia
(You are an African)
And if you come from Taiwan
(You are an African)1Embed
