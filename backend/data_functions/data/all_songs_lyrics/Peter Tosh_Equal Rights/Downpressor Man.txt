Downpressor Man LyricsDownpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
Downpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
Downpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
All along that day
You gonna run to the sea
But the sea will be boiling
When you run to the sea
The sea will be boiling
When you run to the sea
The sea will be boiling
All along that day
You gonna run to the rocks
The rocks will be melting
When you run to the rocks
The poor rocks will be melting
When you run to the rocks
The rocks will be melting
I said, all along that day
So I said, downpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
I said, downpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
I said, downpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
All along that day
You drink your big champagne and laugh
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
You drink your big champagne and laugh
(Downpressor man)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
You drink your big champagne and laugh
(Downpressor man)
Ha ha
All along that day
I wouldn't like to be a flea
Under your collar man
I wouldn't like to be a flea
Under your collar man
I wouldn't like to be a flea
Under your collar
All along that day
You can run but you can't hide
You can run but you can't hide
You can run but you can't hide
Telling you all along that day
You gonna run to the Lord
Begging Him to hide you
You gonna run to the Lord
Begging Him to hide you
You gonna run to Jah
Begging Him to hide you
(All along the day)
All, all along the day
And I say downpressor man
Where you gonna run to
Where you gonna run to
Downpressor man
Where you gonna run to
(Downpressor man)
I said all along, along that day
(Downpressor man)
(Downpressor man)
Downpressor man
Downpressor man
(Downpressor man)
Downpressor man
Downpressor man
Where, downpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
Downpressor man
I don't know where you gonna run to
All along that day
Downpressor man, you can't run
You can't bribe Jah Jah
Can't call him in a bar
 drink some baby soup
Can't bribe him around the corner
Can't test him faith
Downpressor man, Lord
(Downpressor man)
Downpressor man
I said, downpressor man
(Downpressor man)
Don't run, downpressor man
Downpressor man
Where you gonna run to?
Downpressor man
You can't bribe no one
(Downpressor man)
Them no want no money

Cause money get funny
