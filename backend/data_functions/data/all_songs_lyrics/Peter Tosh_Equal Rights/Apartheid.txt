Apartheid Lyrics
You in a me land
Quite illegal
You're in a me land
Dig out me gold, yes
In a me land
Digging out me pearls
In a me land
Dig out me diamonds

We a go fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid
We got to fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid

You're in a me land
And you build up your 'partment
You're in a me land
You build up your regimes
You're in a me land
Only talk 'bout justice
You're in a me land
Handing down injustice

We got to fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid
Brothers got to fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid
You're in a me land
You no build no school for black children
You're in a me land
No hospital for black people
You're in a me land
You build your prison
You're in a me land
You build their camp

We got to fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid
We gonna fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid

But that couldn't rule, yeah

Filling ballistic missiles

Black man got to fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid
Come on then we'll fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid
We got to fight, fight, fight, fight against apartheid
