I Am That I Am Lyrics
I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations
Neither are you here to live up to mine, yeah
I don't owe no one no obligation
No one owe me none
So everything is fine, fine

I said, I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
I am that I am
I am, I am, I am

Don't underestimate
My ability
Don't definate my character
Don't belittle
My authority
It is time you recognize my quality

I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
Learn to love
To love your brother
Don't covet your neighbor
Flee from the city
It's getting shitty
It is full of out-equity

I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
I am that I am
I am, I am, I am
I am that I am
I am, I am, I am

I am the rock of the ages
You cannot move I at all
I am the son of lightining
You cannot move I at all
Son of Jacob
Cannot move me at all
I am the son of Moses
You can't move I at all
I am the son of David
You cannot move I at all
I am a firm ripe diamond
You cannot move I at all
You could a shed more tears
You cannot move I at all
You could a full of evil
You cannot move I at all
You could a try more nuttin'
You cannot move I at all
And you can try make a something
But that can't move I at all
And could a come with ism
You can't move I at all
And if you come with skism
That can't move I at all4Embed
