Losing Faith in Words LyricsI just can't see why you can't see what I mean
But I can't make things any plainer
The words get in the way -
Is that quite what I mean?
If not now, then certainly sooner or later
We've got a problem with communication -
Look, I scrabble with my hands
I try to get some head-room from the elevation
But you just don't understand
Most of the things we say mean we most of the time
Treat our speech with derision
Flap our hands in body-telegram - I know that gets through
So much better than anything said with precision
We've got a problem with communication
And it's getting quite absurd...
Well, I think I'm going to flip out from the sheer frustration
Yes, I'm losing faith in words
We've got a problem with communication
Only getting through in anagrams -
I try to get some linkage from articulation
I try to get some head-room from the elevation
I try to pull back something from my education...
Yes, I try to, try to, try to but I just don't understand
I try, I just don't understand
I talk, you just don't understand
Sometimes I don't know why I bother
But I'm botheredEmbed
