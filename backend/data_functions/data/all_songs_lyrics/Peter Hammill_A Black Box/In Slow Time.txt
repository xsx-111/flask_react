In Slow Time LyricsDance the dance
Dance the dance
Till show time
The show goes on
Dance the dance
Dance the dance
In slow time
If that's what you want
Dance the dance
In the back of the car
Dance the dance
In the cocktail bar
Till show time let it ride
Dance the dance
I feel I've been here before
Dance the dance
This could be anywhere at all
In slow time
Danced the dance
Or it soon will be;
Danced the dance
I'll be back here with me
In no time
Danced the dance
In no time danced the dance
Danced the dance
It's show time dance the dance
In slow timeEmbed
