Walkin' my baby underneath a tree
Everything seems real to me
And the evening stars do shine
I'm holding her by the palm of her hand
She seems to understand
And the evening stars do shine
You've been kind to me and I won't forget
Kinder than anybody's been to me yet
Ohhhhh ohhh
Wandering around now, nobody told me
I figured it out for myself
And the evening stars do shine
I was thinking just the other day
My, how things have changed since you've been mine
Oh oh ooh
You've been kind to me and I won't forget
Kinder than anybody's been to me yet
Ohhhhh ohhhEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
