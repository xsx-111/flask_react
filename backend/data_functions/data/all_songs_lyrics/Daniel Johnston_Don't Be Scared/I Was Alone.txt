I Was Alone LyricsIn a town any town
It was raining
I was walking down the sidewalk
Late one night, alone
I had been alone all that evening
I was rather tired of feeling this way
All of a sudden, I stopped walking
Turned around
And again I saw that I was alone
So, I went on down to the park
I ran into the park
Thought I heard something behind the bushes
But I was alone!
So, I walked down the middle of the road
The car! The car is coming!
It was gone!
Again, I was alone
So, I walked up the street
Down an alley
Slipped on some mud
I was alone and messy too
Down the sidewalk, past my block
All the lights were out, and I was alone
Walked into my apartment
I was alone
So, I put in my undies
And I was alone
Slipped into my bed, alone
Went to sleep
And I started to dream
I was at this big ball, there were millions of people
And they were all there and so was I!
There was so many people, all of them my friends!
Everyone... everyone talking, laughing, joking with me!
Oh, I was so... So happy. Oh, I was so happy!
And then... then suddenly, I woke up
And I was aloneEmbed
