Going Down LyricsI think of all the times
I felt so low
Every time I got feeling better
I got naive
And thought that it would stay
Going down
Going down
Going down again
Feeling small, very small
All, all the time
Been feeling like this
Since junior high
When will it all stop
Going down
Going down
Going down again
Think that I once had it all 
There's a man in me
I'm gonna destroy
And he will be no more
He'll be dead and I'll be free
I'll unlock that door
Going down
Going down
Going down againEmbed
