The Sun Shines Down on Me LyricsI'm getting closer to the fact
I've turned my back on silly dreams
I'm walking down that lonely road
And my heavy load
I didn't bother to bring it
And the sun shines down on me
I feel like I deserve it
When the sun shines down
I'm hiding out where you can't see
Behind a wall
In the back of the room
I'm crawling slowly through the dark
And feeling for a punchline
And the sun shines down on me
I want to feel like I deserve it
When the sun shine down
I'm walking down that empty road
But it ain't empty now
Because I'm on it
And I'm getting closer to a hope
That I can carry and take home with me
When the sun shines down on me
I feel like I have to earn it
When the sun shines down2Embed
