People see you on the street
And kindly ask you, "Who are you seeing, now"
You turn so ashamed
Lost without a dame
Everybody says you gotta have a girl
Everybody says you gotta get a girl
And give her your name
Lost without a dame
I've been lost since I lost you
Tell me, are you feeling the same way, too?
Or is this just a game?
Lost without a dame
Yeah...woooh!!!!!
Let's hear about the girls in my life
You know, my mama, she treated me mean
But that's not the same
