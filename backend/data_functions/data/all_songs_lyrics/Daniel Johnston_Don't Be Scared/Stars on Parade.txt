Stars on Parade, Stars on Parade!
There's a story about this kid named Sid
And he was born to be wild
I save cigarette butts for a monkey
In a mountain and I looked around
Some kind of friend went out one night
Walking in the premarital world the wicked world
Don't you ever wear my clothes again
Stars on Parade!
When I was a little happy
Happy, happy, happy
You wanted to be somebody
But you ain't no fun
Bomb bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
Jail babe don't you know I can't
Hoovering comes to mind
Somehow describing hoovering becomes
Important in a cold hard world
It's a very, like a rose, like a rose
Like a monkey in a blue bayou
Like a complete unknown
Like the wild wind blowing in the stars above
I'm looking for a nice girl
There was this big guy
Since I lost my smile
And your heart is weary
Stars on Parade!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
