Harley Man LyricsThere was this drunk up at the split rail in that bar
And he was staggerin' all around real skinny guy
And he was yellin', shootin' pool
And he said "I'm a Harley man
And I'll be a Harley man
'till the day I die."
"I'm a Harley man and I'll be a Harley man
Till the day I die" he said
"I'm a Harley man and I'll be a Harley man
Till the day I die," he said
Till the day he dies
He drank lots of beer
And he wanted everyone to know that he wasn't a queer
"I'm a Harley man and I'll be a Harley man
Till the day I die," he said
Till the day he dies
He was hardly a man
Though hardly a man at all
But he sure like his Harley
You'd see him staggerin' around
Staggerin' around up at the mall
Happy as can be
You see he was never really sober enough
To feel the pain of being an asshole
"I'm a Harley man and I'll be a Harley man
Till the day I die."
"I'm a Harley man and I'll be a Harley man
Till the day I die," he said
Till the day he diedEmbed
