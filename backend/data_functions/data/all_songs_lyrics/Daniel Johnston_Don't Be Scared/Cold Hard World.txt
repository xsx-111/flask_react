It's a cold hard world
It's a cold hard world
It's a cold hard world
Oh no
I heard Red Donley say
It was on the news today
It's a cold hard world
It's a cold hard world
It's hiking across the country
Looking for a bite to eat
You'd be surprised at the animals
And the people you'd meet
Rolling down that highway
With eyes fixed straight ahead
They have a caravan of cars
To bury the dead
And coke cans and pop bottles
Lined the streets like flowers instead
And this guy gave me a ride
I said this industrial waste sure stinks
He said he likes that smell
'cause that's the smell of money
I said "well, mister money stinks, too."
I met a fireman
He said you never forget burning flesh
And the librarian said
Do you have a card here?
I said I been coming here for weeks
Don't you recognize me by now
I checked out a million books
Just to get you to notice me
Somebody's house burned down
Somebody's hubcap fell off
Somebody's soul got lost
Somebody's heart got broke
I heard Red Donley say
It was on the news today
It's a cold hard world
