I Had a Dream LyricsI had a dream about you
You were the queen of quite a few
And I was there, but you didn't care
I didn't matter somehow
The band played and you sang a tune
And the stars fell down from the moon
And you smiled a smile that parted the sea
But you didn't notice me, no
Your eyes filled up the sky and they were blue
And you had a weird monkey there with you too
And he danced a jig and tipped his hat
And he turned around with a grin so fat
And he was me
There were lights and fireworks and cannons going off in your honor
And I was worried but a man said "Don't worry, nothing can harm her"
And I grabbed the microphone and I stood all alone
And I looked up at you, and you looked down at me
And then you said "Off with his head"
I had a dream about youEmbed
