Loner LyricsI wish I could be as happy as you
I wish I could have as much fun as you do
I wish I could be your friend
But I-I-I'm afraid
I wish I had my own way
But I rarely do
But I wish I had my way with you
I'm a loner - oh oh - loner
Been a loner since high school - oh yeah
And a loner ain't no fool - oh yeah
I'm a loner - oh - eh - eheh
Be a loner in a crowded room - oh yeah
Take me to an ocean, I'll be loner still
But I wish I could be your friend
I'm a loner - uh - uh
I'm a loner in my car - oh yeah
Sometimes it gets scary - oh yeah
Been a loner since high school - oh yeah
And a loner ain't no fool - oh yeah
But I wish I could be as happy as you
And I wish I could have as much fun as you do
I wish I could be your friend
But I-I-I'm afraid
I'm a loner
I'm a loner - uh
Lone, lone, lone
Lone, lone, lone, lone
Uh-uuh, uh-uuh, loner, uh
I'm a loner1Embed
