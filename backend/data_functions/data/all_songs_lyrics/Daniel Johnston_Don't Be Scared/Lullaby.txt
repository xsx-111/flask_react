Even when the jokes were bad
Think of all the fun we had
I just got back from church
Yee I really like that place
Love to see the children run and play
Watch the ladies gather round in circles
Domestic life
Love to see the children run and play
There was a storm outside as we drove home
The night sky was pure blue
I thought about all the different things
That happened to all the different people I knew
Even when the jokes were bad
Think of all the fun we had
I worked in an oil refinery
I didn't really like it
There was this girl there
Who acted like she hated me
But only because she loved me
Even though that wasn't healthy
It was kinda nice
Even when the jokes were bad
Think of all the fun we had
She said I was a real loser
But at least I'm real
And being real
Sometimes is a losing game
Even when the jokes were bad
Think of all the fun we hadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
