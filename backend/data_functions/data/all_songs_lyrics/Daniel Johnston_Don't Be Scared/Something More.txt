Something More Lyrics
Hi this Dale, I'm excited, this is live on the stage!
Haha!
Say somethin' more!
Somethin' more!

Hello?
Hello, is Bently there?
No, he isn't
He isn't? Um, do you know when he'll be home?
No, I have no Idea
Ok, Thanks a lot
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
What song is it you wanna hear?
Freebird?

Ronald's therapy part 1:
This is all I do for all my friends back... wherever they are
(Dale and Daniel unintelligible moaning)
Thank you, thank you. Thank you, very much

...Because as soon act like tears of god
Little girl, when everything is going great
Time to call up all the crowd
Undead white zombie
What's wrong with the schools?
Flogging the dead mummy (the dead mummy)
Free again, skiparoo
Hello Itchy, goodbye
Talk as much as you ever

Live for life, ain'tchye
Look out (Look out)
Look out (Look out)
Look out
Look out (Look out)
Look out (Look out)
Look out (Look out)
Look out
Look out (Look out)
Look out (Look out)Embed
