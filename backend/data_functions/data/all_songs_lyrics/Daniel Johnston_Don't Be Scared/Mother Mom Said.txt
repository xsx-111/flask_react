Mother Mom Said LyricsI had a reason
I had an excuse
My heart was bleeding
My head was in the noose
What did mother mom say?
What did mother mom say?
What did mother mom say?
What did mother mom say?
Mother mom said
Mother mom said
Mother mom said
Mother mom said, don't go
Mother mom said
My arms were shaking
Like a chicken wing coop
I had it all spelled out for me
In my alphabet soup
And those soup cans and pop bottles
Dancing in the nude
And the nervous radio played forgotten songs
That only an orphan could remember
And then everything fell apart
And then everything came together
And there were shoelaces there a million miles long
And I was gone
What did mother mom say?
What did mother mom say?
What did mother mom say?
Well, what did mother mom say?
Mother mom said
Mother mom said
Mother mom said
Mother mom said, don't go
Please don't go
My bank account just fell through
Elma says it happened to her son
And now I'm hitting the road
Elma says it happened to her son
Elma says
Elma says
Elma says
Elma told my mom
Elma told my mom
Elma told my mom
Elma told my mom
Elma told my mom, don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't goEmbed
