I Had Lost My Mind LyricsI had lost my mind
I lost my head for a while, was off my rocker, outta line, outta wack
See, I had this tiny crack in my head
That slowly split open and my brain snoozed out
Lyin' on the sidewalk and I didn't even know it
I had lost my mind
Why, I was sitting in the basement when I first realized it was gone
Got in my car, rushed right over to the lost and found
I said "pardon me, but I seem to have lost my mind."
She said "Well, can you identify it, please?"
I said "Why sure it's a cute little bugger
About yea big, a little warped from the rain"
She said "Well then sir, this must be your brain"
I said "Thank you ma'am, I'm always losin' that dang thing."
I had lost my brain
I had lost my brain
I had lost my mind
I had lost my mindEmbed
