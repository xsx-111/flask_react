Super Pop Lyrics
If I was an animal, I'd be a lion
If I was a car, I'd be an Aston Martin
If I was a genius, I'd be Isaac Newton
If I was a hero, I'd be Martin Luther

If you want to reach the top (Reach the top)
If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)
(The top)

If I was an actor, I'd be Marlon Brando (The top)
If I was a painter, I'd be Frida Kahlo (The top)
If I was a drink, I'd be a lemon drop (The top)
If I was a song, I would be super pop

If you want to reach the top (Reach the top)
If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)
If you want to reach the top (Reach the top)
If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)
(The top)

If I was a star, I would be who I am today
If I was a fighter, I'd be Cassius Clay
If I was emotion, I would be intense
If I was a man, I would be president
I'll be different
If I'm the president
I'll be different
If I'm the president
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

If I was an animal, I'd be a dog
If I was a dog, I would be a man
If I was a man, I'd be the president
If I was the president, I'd be different

If you want to reach the top (Reach the top)
If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)
If you want to reach the top (Reach the top)
If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)
(The top)

If you want to reach the top
You would start and never stop (Never stop - the top)
If you want to reach the top
You would start and never stop (Never stop)
If you want to reach the top (Never stop)
You would start and never stop (Never stop - the top)
(Reach the top - if you want to reach the top - never stop)
(Reach the top - if you want to reach the top - never stop)
(Reach the top - if you want to reach the top - never stop)1Embed
