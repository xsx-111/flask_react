Like It or Not Lyrics
You can call me a sinner
You can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because

This is who I am, you can
Like it or not, you can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no

Cleopatra had her way
Mata Hari too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox and it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the Femme without the Fatale
Please don't take offense
Don't let the fruit rot under the vine
Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because

This is who I am, you can
Like it or not, you can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no, you know
This is who I am, you can
Like it or not, you can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no, you know

No, no, you know
No, no, you know
No, no, you know
No, no, you know

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because
This is who I am, you can
Like it or not, you can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no, you know
This is who I am, you can
Like it or not, you can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no, you know

No, no, you know
No, no, you know
No, no, you know
No, no, you know1Embed
