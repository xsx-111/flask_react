Forbidden Love (2005) Lyrics
Just one kiss on my lips
Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture
Once upon a time
There was a boy
And there was a girl
Just one touch from your hands
Was all it took to make me falter

Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

Just one smile on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain
Once upon a time
There was a boy
There was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind of world
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

Just one kiss (Five)
Just one touch (Four)
Just one look (Three)
(Two)

Forbidden love (One), are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

Just one kiss (Five)
Just one touch (Four)
Just one look (Three)
Just one love (Two)
(One)2Embed
