Push Lyrics
You push me, to go the extra mile
You push me, when it's difficult to smile
You push me, a better version of myself
You push me, only you and no one else
You push me, to see the other point of view
You push me, when there's nothing else to do
You push me, when I think I know it all
You push me, when I stumble and I fall

Keep on pushing (Keep on)
Like nobody (Keep on)

Every race I win, every mood I'm in
Everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make, every step I take
Everything I know, it's all because you push me

You push me, when I don't appreciate
You push me, not to lie and not to hate
You push me, when I want it all to end
You push me, when I really need a friend
You push me, all I wanna do is cry
You push me, when it's hard for me to try
You push me, when I do it for myself
You push me, only you and no one else
Keep on pushing (Keep on)
Like nobody (Keep on)

Every race I win, every mood I'm in
Everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make, every step I take
Everything I do, it's all because you push me
You push me

Keep on pushing (Keep on)
Like nobody (Keep on)
(Keep on)
(Keep on)

(Every race I win) To go the extra mile
(Every mood I'm in) When it's difficult to smile
(Everything I do) A better version of myself
Only you and only you and only you
(Every move I make) To see the other point of view
(Every step I take) When there's nothing else to do
(Everything I do) When I think I know it all
Only you and only you and only you
Every race I win (To go the extra mile)
Every mood I'm in (When it's difficult to smile)
Everything I do (A better version of myself)
I owe it all to you (Only you and only you and only you)
Every move I make (To see the other point of view)
Every step I take (When there's nothing else to do)
Everything I do (When I think I know it all)
It's all because you push me
You push me2Embed
