I Love New York Lyrics
I don't like cities, but I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork
Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep

Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

If you don't like my attitude then you can F off
Just go to Texas, isn't that where they golf?
New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat, then get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Off my, off my, off my, off my, off my...3Embed
