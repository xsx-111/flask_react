Till the End of Time Lyrics
Love you till the end of time
Baby I will love you till the end of time

Close to me
Oh I need you close to me
Loving me
Close to you
How can I get close to you
Help me to

Why can't you see
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you
Till the end of time

I think of you
Every moment I go through
Thoughts of you
I dream of you
All I have are so many dreams of you
Won't you please come true
Why can't you see
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
Oh I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you till the end (till the end)
Till the end, till the end (till the end)
Till the end of time

Tell me what you need
Let me give you all of me
'Cause without you nothing's real
You're the reason that I feel
Tell me what you need
Let me give you everything
Every moment I'm alive
Until the end of time

Why, why can't you see
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
Don't you know that I, I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you till the end (till the end)
Till the end (till the end, till the end)
I would love you till the end of time
Love you till the end of time
Baby I will love you
(Until the end of time, till the end)
Love you till the end of time
Baby I will love you till the end of time
Love you till the end of time
Baby I will love you
Love you till the end of time
Baby I will love you till the end of time
Love you till the end of time1Embed
