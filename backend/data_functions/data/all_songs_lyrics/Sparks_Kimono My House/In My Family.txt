In My Family Lyrics
That's how it's gonna be
In my family
From the biggest branch to the smallest leaf
Still you're gonna see similarity

In my family
That's how it's gonna be

That's how it's gonna be
'Cause it's my family
Gonna live to see post-senility
Lots of time to spend with my family

In my family
That's how it's gonna be

There you got your Rockefeller
There you got your Edward Teller
J. Paul Getty is a splendid fellow, but
None of them would be in my family
In my family
That's how it's gonna be

Family
It's like any other family
Big and small
It's like any other family

That's how it's gonna be
Before and after me
Manufacturing many, many me's
Gonna hang myself from my family tree

In my family
That's how it's gonna be
In my family

Family, family
Family, familyEmbed
