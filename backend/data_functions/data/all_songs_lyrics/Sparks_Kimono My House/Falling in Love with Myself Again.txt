Falling in Love with Myself Again Lyrics
Similar mother, similar father
Similar dog, cat and fish
And we'll make the same wish
When the birthday candle's lit
We'll both be older
We won't get our wish
Yes I think that I'm falling in love with myself again

Yes I think I'm falling in love with myself again
Yes I think I'm falling
Yes I think I'm falling
Yes I think I'm falling in love with myself again

With her hand in my hand and my hand in hers
Don't we look a blur
Me and her and me and her
Hey kiss her, oh kiss her
Our friends do concur
Yes I think that I'm falling in love with myself again


I can't see with you in front of the mirror staring, staring
I can't hear myself think with all that music blaring, blaring
Yes I'm falling
Falling, falling
Falling, falling
Yes I'm falling
Yes I think I'm falling in love with myself again
I bring home the bacon and eat it myself
Here's to my health
Hope that I am feeling well
I'm burning the candle at both ends, oh well
Yes I think that I'm falling in love with myself again
