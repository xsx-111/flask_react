Babyface Lyrics
Watching your bright blue eyes in the freeze frame
I've seen them so many times
I feel like I must be your best friend
You're looking fine, so fine
Dressed up like a lovely day

Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, Babyface
Cover girl with natural grace
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?

Comin' home late at night to turn you on
Checkin' out every frame
I've got slow motion on my side
Turnin' around and around
With the sound and colour under my control
Round and around, goin' down
Dressed up like a lovely day

Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, Babyface
Tinfoil hair all tied up in lace
Babyface, Babyface
Bitter-sweet girl, won't you give me a taste
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?
Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, Babyface
Open that door, let me unpack my case
Babyface, Babyface
You're everywhere, child, you're all over the place
Babyface, Babyface
You're comin' to me from outer space
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?Embed
