Dirty Day Lyrics
I don't know you
You don't know the half of it
I had a starring role
I was the bad guy who walked out
They say be careful where you aim
Because where you aim, you might just hit
You can hold onto something so tight, you've already lost it
Dragging me down
That's not the way it used to be
You can't even remember
What I'm trying to forget

It was a dirty day
Dirty day

Looking for explanations
I don't even understand
If you need someone to blame
Throw a rock in the air, you'll hit someone guilty

From father to son
In one life has begun
A work
That's never done
Father to son
(Love, it won't last kissin' time)
(Love, it won't last kissin' time)
(Love, it won't last kissin' time)

Get it right
There's no blood thicker than ink
Hear what I say
Nothing's as simple as you think
Wake up
Some things you can't get around
I'm in you
More so when they put me in the ground

These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hillEmbed
