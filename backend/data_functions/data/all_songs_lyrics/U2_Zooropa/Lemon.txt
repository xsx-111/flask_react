Lemon Lyrics
Lemon, see-through in the sunlight
She wore lemon, never in the daylight
She's gonna make you cry
She's gonna make you whisper and moan
When you're dry she draws water from a stone

I feel like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slippin' under
I feel like I'm holding on to nothing

She wore lemon
To colour in the cold grey night
She had heaven
And she held on so tight
A man makes a picture
A moving picture
Through the light projected
He can see himself up close
A man captures colour
A man likes to stare
He turns his money into light
To look for her
And I feel like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore
And I feel like I'm swimming out to her

Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins

Lemon, see-through in the sunlight
A man builds a city
With banks and cathedrals
A man melts the sand
So he can see the world outside
(You're gonna meet her there)
A man makes a car
(She's your destination)
And builds a road to run them on
(You gotta get to her)
A man dreams of leaving
(She's imagination)
But he always stays behind

And these are the days when our work has come asunder
And these are the days when we look for something other
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins

A man makes a picture
A moving picture
Through the light projected
He can see himself up close
(You gonna meet her there)
A man captures colour
(She's your destination)
A man likes to stare
(There's no sleeping there)
He turns his money into light
(She's imagination)
To look for her

Lemon
She is the dreamer
She's imagination
(She had heaven)
Through the light projected
He can see himself up close
She wore lemonEmbed
