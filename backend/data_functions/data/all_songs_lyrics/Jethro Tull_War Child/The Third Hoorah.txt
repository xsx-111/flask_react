The Third Hoorah LyricsHoorah!
War Child, dance the days and nights away
Sweet child, how do you do today?
When your back's to the wall
And your luck is your all
Then side with whoever you may
Seek that which within lies waiting to begin
The fight of your life that is everyday
Dance with the War Child, the War Child
Hoorah!
War Child, dance the days and nights away
Sweet child, how do you do today?
In the heart of your heart, there's the tiniest part
Of an urge to live to the death
With a sword on your hip and a cry on your lips
To strike life in the inner child's breast
Dance with the War Child, the War Child
Hoorah!
War Child, dance the days and nights away
Sweet child, how do you do today?Embed
