Queen and Country LyricsThe wind is on the river
And the tide has turned too late
So we're sailing for another shore
Where some other ladies wait
To throw us silken whispers
Catch us by the anchor chains
But we all laugh so politely
And we sail on just the same
For Queen and Country
In the long dying day
And it's been this way for five long years
Since we signed our souls away
We bring back gold and ivory
Rings of diamonds, strings of pearls
Make presents to the government
So they can have their social whirl
With Queen and Country
In the long dying day
And it's been this way for five long years
Since we signed our souls away
(Guitar Solo)
For Queen and Country
In the long dying day
And it's been this way for five long years
Since we signed our souls away
They build schools and they build factories
With the spoils of battles won
And we remain their pretty sailor boys
Hold our heads up to the gun
Of Queen and Country
In the long dying day
And it's been this way for five long years
Since we signed our souls away
To Queen and Country
In the long dying day
And it's been this way for five long years
Since we signed our souls away
To Queen and Country
In the long dying day
And it's been this way for five long years
Since we signed our souls awayEmbed
