Rainbow Blues LyricsThrough northern lights on back streets ---
I told the coachman, Just drive me on
It's the same old destination
But a different world to sing upon
So he threw back his head and he counted
I jumped out about five to nine
And I waved at the stage door-keeper ---
Said, Mister, get me to the stage on time
Oh, but the rain wasn't made of water
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun
So I slipped behind a rainbow
And waited till the show had done
I packed my ammunition
Inside the crowd was shouting, Encore
But I had a most funny feeling ---
It wasn't me they were shouting for
So when the tall dark lady smiled at me
I said, Oh, baby let us go for a ride
And we came upon two drinks or four
And popped them oh so neatly inside
Oh, but the rain wasn't made of water
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun
So we slipped behind a rainbow
And lay there until we had done
Let me pack you deep in my suitcase
Oh, there's sure to be room for two ---
Or you can drive me to the airplane
But don't let me catch those rainbow blues
Oh, and the rain wasn't made of water
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun
So we slipped behind a rainbow
And lay there until we had done
Oh, and the rain wasn't made of water
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun
So we slipped behind a rainbow
And lay there until we had doneEmbed
