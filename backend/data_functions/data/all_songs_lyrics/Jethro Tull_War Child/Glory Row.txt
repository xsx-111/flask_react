Glory Row LyricsRise up all you fine young ladies and take arms for the show
Oh, we'll put your name up in lights
Put you down on Glory Row
Would you be the star of ages
To light your own way at night?
Might be a former beauty queen with your high smile stuck on so tightly
They come and they go down on Glory Row
It's the same old story, yes, it's the same old show
Well, hello all you gentlemen, I fear I'm a lot like you
We're wearing the same school tie but a different pair of shoes
How did you get to be who you are?
Will your children share the blame?
Is it really worth the time it takes
To carve your name on Glory Row?
Down on Glory Row
It's the same old story, yes, it's the same old showEmbed
