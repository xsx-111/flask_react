Saturation LyricsThey left me, leaving my house on fire, me running round ---
Got out through the window
While clinging to the skirts of fate was not my idea of fun
I'll jump to it gladly
The town was filled with smoke and hate
Came to my senses just too late to realize that all I ever owned was borrowed
I thanked them for having shown me that nothing ever really belongs to anyone
They burned my books and they broke my car, and gave the dog to a man who used him for breeding
They felled my trees and they tramped flowers and threw the kitten into my new pool
The same things done to other men had made them run away from the city
This being the case, I joined them there and breathing air spent the night with these new friendsEmbed
