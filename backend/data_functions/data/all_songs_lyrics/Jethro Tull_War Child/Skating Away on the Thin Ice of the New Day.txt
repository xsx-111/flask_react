Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day LyricsMeanwhile back in the year one
When you belonged to no one
You didn't stand a chance, son
If your pants were undone
'Cause you were bred for humanity
And sold to society
One day you'll wake up in the present day
A million generations removed from expectations
Of being who you really want to be
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
So as you push off from the shore
Won't you turn your head once more
And make your peace with everyone
For those who choose to stay
Will live just one more day
To do the things they should've done
And as you cross the wilderness
Spinning in your emptiness
You feel you have to pray
Looking for a sign that the universal mind
Has written you into the passion play
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
And as you cross the circle line
Well, the ice wall creaks behind
You're a rabbit on the run
And the silver splinters fly
In the corner of your eye
Shining in the setting sun
Well, do you ever get the feeling
That the story's too damn real
And in the present tense?
Or that everybody's on the stage
And it seems like you're the only
Person sitting in the audience?
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
Skating away, skating away, skating awayEmbed
