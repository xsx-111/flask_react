Ladies LyricsLadies of leisure
With their eyes on the back roads
All looking for strangers
To whom they extend welcomes
With a smile and a glimpse of
Pink knees and elbows;
Of satin and velvet
Good ladies, good fortune
Ladies
They sing of their heroes:
Of solitary soldiers
Invested in good health
And manner most charming
Whose favors are numbered
(none the less well intended)
By hours in a minute;
By those ladies who bless them
