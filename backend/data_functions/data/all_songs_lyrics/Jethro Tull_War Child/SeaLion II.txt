SeaLion II LyricsWould you like to see my lion?
My friend Cecil is damp and smooth
A damp smooth sea lion
Yes, Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a clever sealion
Cecil sometimes swims and often sits
And balances multi-coloured striped balls?
Yes, balances multi-coloured striped balls
Clever Cecil
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a seali-
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil the sealion is serene
He doesn't wear spectacles or a scarf
No central heating or cement?
No, the whole ocean is Cecil's home
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
Cecil is a sealion
(Cecil is a sealion)Embed
