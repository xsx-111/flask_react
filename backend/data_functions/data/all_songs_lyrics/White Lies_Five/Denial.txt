Denial Lyrics
You look from the roof to the smoke on good nights
Tall dreams at the beck of the stars seem alright
Your heart aglow
'Cause you know, you know
It was all raised up for your life
For your eyes

You live in the quiet that was sewn for good wives
Four kids - with the cat, might as well be called five
Oh, you know, you know
It's all for show
The city winks at your smile
It's your style

You know it's not denial
Not denial, not denial
Time is a fickle thrill
It's not denial, not denial
And there's a kind of heat
You leave behind when you go
It's not denial
Not denial, not denial
You lust for a love with the feel of old shoes
Great highs never brand, but the lows are all bruise
They know, they know
'Cause a childhood shows
A prize is hard to refuse
No excuse

You swear you'll come home in the week of New Year
No leaves on the oaks, oh, the past is too near
Oh, you know, you know
How they miss you so
Wish you all the best with old tears
With old fears

You know it's not denial
Not denial, not denial
Time is a fickle thrill
It's not denial, not denial
And there's a kind of heat
You leave behind when you go
It's not denial
Not denial, not denial
You know it's not denial
Not denial, not denial
Time is a fickle thrill
It's not denial, not denial
And there's a kind of heat
You leave behind when you go
It's not denial
Not denial, not denialEmbed
