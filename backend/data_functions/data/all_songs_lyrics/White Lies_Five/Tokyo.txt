Tokyo Lyrics
Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right and find a wrong

Go breathe it out, walk your walk
Come back when you're ready to talk
But heart ringing, take the call
Our life is in print to play
Flip the set if it's starting to fray
If there's nothing new to crave

'Cause you know
That every city has a Chinatown

Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right, and find a wrong
Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right, and find a wrong
Find a right, and find a wrong

Write back or just write it off
Hasn't everybody suffered enough
With the carcass left of us?
Your every unhappy cruise
Oh, you've never looked good in blue
And I'm the sunset, I'm the view

'Cause we know
That every city has a Chinatown

Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right and find a wrong
Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right and find a wrong

Find a right and find a wrong
Get me London, get me Seoul
Say it's me who's calling
Girl, I'm lower than a dog
And my ego's falling
Get me Bangkok, get me Rome
Where all the hope is hiding
Just know I'm numb and I'm alone
So come back to me crying

Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right and find a wrong
Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right and find a wrong
Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right and find a wrong
Call Tokyo, call New York
It's just same but different, love
Call Jupiter, call Lyon
Find a right and find a wrong
Find a right and find a wrong
Find a right and find a wrong
Find a right and find a wrong3Embed
