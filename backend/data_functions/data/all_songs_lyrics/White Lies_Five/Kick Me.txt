Kick Me Lyrics
I am the man who's always on the watch
Ever-listening, a god...
The host in a rut
Dead in the hand before the wave has struck
The driftwood of love: a table for one

So kick me, come on
Kick me, come on
I gotta nail the job
So kick me, come on
Kick me, come on
When your head is on the run
So kick me, come on
Kick me, come on
I know it's dark
But I can't be alone
I won't be alone

Live in the gaps hidden by the clock
An ocean, a rug, a blank you can hug
Shell on the land that pricks the heel you wrong
Does it glisten, the blood? Have you done enough?
So kick me, come on
Kick me, come on
I gotta nail the job
So kick me, come on
Kick me, come on
When your head is on the run
So kick me, come on
Kick me, come on
I know it's dark
But I can't be alone
I won't be alone

I won't be alone
I won't be alone
I won't be alone
I won't be alone
I won't be alone
I won't be alone
I won't be alone
I won't be aloneEmbed
