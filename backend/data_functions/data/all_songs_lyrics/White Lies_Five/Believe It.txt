Believe It Lyrics
All this trying to breathe
Is making me nervous
No, I can't uncurl my toes
Is that part of your service? Oh-oh
You've hung up your four degrees
I hope they're making this worth it
'Cause I've had the fear a week
And I've been trying to shirk it, oh-oh

He says believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You can pay any way you like
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You'll be good if you shut your eyes
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You can pay any way you like
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You'll be good if you shut your eyes

I read the top reviews
From your junkies and war vets
So you've not got much to lose
And I can't ignore it, oh-oh
He says believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You can pay any way you like
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You'll be good if you shut your eyes
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You can pay any way you like
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You'll be good if you shut your eyes

I'm the butt of the trick for you
Yet the hand that awards it
And you'd hook my lip for proof
If I could afford it, oh-oh

He says believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You can pay any way you like
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You'll be good if you shut your eyes
He says believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You can pay any way you like
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You'll be good if you shut your eyes
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You can pay any way you like
Believe it, believe it, believe it, believe it
You'll be good if you shut your eyes1Embed
