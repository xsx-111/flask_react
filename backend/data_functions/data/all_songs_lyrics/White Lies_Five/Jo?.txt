Jo? Lyrics
You hold the dice and I wait for your roll
It's not the first time that I'm losing control
With reddened eyes I blink out the days
I wait for your reply, am I still worth a save?

Where's your message for me Jo?
Time's not with me, don't you know
Call me back and pick me up
Take the pain and break it off
Break it off

It takes a lot to unload to the void
Always digging out of our pain in the noise
It takes a nerve to leave me in the ditch
Coiled about myself as I reach for the itch

Where's your message for me Jo?
Time's not with me, don't you know
I need answers for a friend
Write me back and break a trend
Where's your message for me, Jo?
Sent my flare up hours ago
Call me back and pick me up
Take the pain and break it off
Break it off
Storm clouds in the morning, voices raised tonight
Everything's a warning, everything's a fight
I wrote you all the details, wrote you all the truth
A stranger in my own bed, staying up for you1Embed
