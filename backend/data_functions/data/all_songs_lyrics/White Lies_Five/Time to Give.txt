Time to Give Lyrics
You turn to me
I say, "What's there to talk about?"
Over fifteen years we’ve talked about it all
I've learned to be as alone as together means
Because we bring me down
And I drive you up the wall

If you've got the mind to leave
Then pick a topic to talk about
God knows I’ve time to give
You've got the backbone to stick around

Eternity
I don't quit when the bets are down
I'm a careful man, but I'd lose it all for you
A word to me
Is enough iron to keep the peace
I can ruin a day, and I know I do, I do

If you've got the mind to leave
Then pick a topic to talk about
God knows I've time to give
You've got the backbone to stick around
If you’ve got the mind to leave
(Worse or something better)
Then pick a topic to talk about
(Health or heavy weather)
God knows I’ve time to give
(Take your car at midnight)
You've got the backbone to stick around
(Loopholes in the headlights)


A foolish dream
Sell the house but still keep the home
You know kids grow up
And they’ll pin the blame on you
I know the theme
Luck has never been into me
I'm a catch to pain
And you dress the scars for proof

If you've got the mind to leave
Then pick a topic to talk about
God knows I've time to give
You’ve got the backbone to stick around
If you've got the mind to leave
(Worse or something better)
Then pick a topic to talk about
(Health or heavy weather)
God knows I've time to give
(Take your car at midnight)
You've got the backbone to stick around
(Loopholes in the headlights)


Worse or something better
Health or heavy weather
Take your car at midnight
Loopholes catching light
Angels head to toeing
Bad blood overflowing
Dawn in your sister's kitchen
She never trusted him
You'll get your weekday evening
Handshakes, close to freezing
Bad cop pinned to your heart
Grace is a dying art
Nobody cares if you've got time to give
No, nobody cares if you've got time to give
Oh, nobody cares if you've got time to give
It's just an endless hole that you're falling in1Embed
