Strangers Room LyricsMy eyes were full of morning
And my mouth was full of night
I was in a strangers room
And I couldn't find the light
I rose to use a different bathroom
Than the one before
And what it is I'm running from
Is what it is I'm running for
Where do I go from here? Help me
I wish I could disappear and go away
From the knowing
That you've known me far too long
When I find a different tune
I guess I'll sing a different song
Where do I go from here? Help me
Wish I could disappear and go away from the morning
Cos my eyes are full of flight
I am in a strangers room
And I still can't find the lightEmbed
