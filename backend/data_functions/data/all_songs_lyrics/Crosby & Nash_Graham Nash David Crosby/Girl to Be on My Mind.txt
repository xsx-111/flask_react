Girl to Be on My Mind LyricsCome another year - and I am sitting here
Looking over all the Haight
As far as my eyes can see
What's happening to me? Trying to find
A girl to be on my mind
Come another year - will she be here?
I wonder what I'm looking for
But I'm looking everyday
Searching every face - trying to find
A girl to be on my mind
On my mind there is a question
Time - time
Only time will tell when time is right
I await my resurrection
Feeling fine
Come another year - will I be sitting here
Looking after someone else
Who's looking after me
That's happiness to me - so I'm trying to find
A girl to be on my mindEmbed
