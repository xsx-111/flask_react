Whole Cloth LyricsOn what do you base your life my friend?
Can you see around the bend?
Can you see?
On what star do you take your sight
On a cold and blowy night
Alone, alone?
Old man, can you make a mirror for me?
It's got to be clearer than air for me
'Cause you see I can't see me, no
And I always thought that I meant what I said
But you know that lately I've read
We were lying
All of us lying
Just makin' it up, yeah
Cuttin' it out of whole cloth, yeahEmbed
