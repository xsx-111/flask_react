Games LyricsBorn in the sunshine
Dyin' in the rain
Raised on laughter
Lost in a game
Love you
Love you
The game was bein' better
Wiser than you
Half an inch taller
A deeper shade of blue
Or thinkin' that I loved you
More than you love me
Failing to lay it on the line
All the time
The game of gettin' money
The game of gettin' more
The ego game of power
The ugly game of war
Kills love
Don't you know that?
Born in the sunshine
Dyin' in bad air
Started out honest
Wound up down there
Love you
Love youEmbed
