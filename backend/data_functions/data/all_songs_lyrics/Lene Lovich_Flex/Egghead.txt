Egghead LyricsBig wheels turning in my head oh
Growing up is a deadly business
My head was light and airy
Now my head is heavy as lead
Getting older night and day dear
I wonder if we'll ever make it
I feel so insecure oh
My mind is activated
Chorus
Counting fingers don't be slow
Bring the mirrors we must know
Looking smarter every day
Egghead ayayay!
Idea getting intellect oh
Can't you help to make the distance
I thought that I knew quite a lot but
What an uphill climate this is
(Egghead)
(Egghead)
