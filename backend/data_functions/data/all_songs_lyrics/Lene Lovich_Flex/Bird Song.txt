Bird Song LyricsA little bird told me, you were untrue...
Even though, I had, faith in you...
I believe, the lying words
Of the sly little bird
So with the bird, one day, you flew away
I woke up, too late, you had gone
Fading on....with the song
Of a hurting little bird
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
(chorus)
Still I watch the sky
Still I wonder why
Still I hope that I...
Can carry on...
If I can be strong
If you hear my song
You'll know that it was wrong, to say good bye..
Such a cold bird, so hard, captured your heart
Does it matter, I am, falling apart
Breaking fast, as the flesh
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Of a dead little bird
(chorus twice)
Still I watch the sky
Still I wonder why
Still I hope that I...
Can carry on...
If I can be strong
If you hear my song
You'll know that it was wrong, to say good bye..Embed
