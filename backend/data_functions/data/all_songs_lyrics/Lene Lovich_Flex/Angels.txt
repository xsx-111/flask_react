Angels LyricsThe angels are watching over me, constantly they say
The angels are always close to me in every game I play
And if I win or lose...
I know they'll see me through
The angels watch my every move
Confused and lost, like there's no way out
Till I see a light, shining from above
So I raise my head, to salute the sky
And I feel that light, take my spirit high
The angels are watching over me, constantly they say
The angels are always close to me in every game I play
And if I win or lose...
I know they'll see me through
The angels watch my every move
I could close my mind, to a lot of things
But tonight's the night, for remembering
There's a place for me, on the other side
When they call my name, for that final ride
The angels are watching over me, constantly they say
The angles are always close to me in every game I play
And if I win or lose...
I know they'll see me through
The angels watch my every moveEmbed
