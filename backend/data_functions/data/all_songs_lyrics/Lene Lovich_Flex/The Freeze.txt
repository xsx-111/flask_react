The Freeze LyricsThe icicles are forming in our eyes
As we go, as we go
The lucky ducks are waving us good bye
What a show, as we go
Don't forget your name, or the place from which you came
And the rest who still remain below
The best of us are taken by surprise
Even so, even so
We can't avoid the ultimate device
What a blow, even so
High and higher
How far do we go?
We can't expect to always see the sun shine
Frozen, silent, waiting in the cold
This is the longest night of all
The instruments are beating with a sigh
Yes we know, yes we know
It¹s time to close the door and say good night
Time to go, yes we know
All is cold tonight, but the stars are shining bright
And one day we¹ll see the light, I know
We can't expect to always see the sun shine
This is the longest night of allEmbed
