Wonderful One LyricsWonderful One who are you so perfect and precious to me
Beauty and body and soul, all that I wish I could be
What do you say
Time slips away
I am just floating from nowhere to nowhere it seems
Hold back the pain
Try to explain
You are the light in the darkness the light that I need
Life is a struggle for one make it double and two can't survive
Lean on me love me my shoulder is strong as my feeling inside
What do you say
Time slips away
I am devoted and totally programmed to please
Hold back the pain
Try to explain
You are the reason for all this emotion I feel
Chorus
Wonderful One
You're the song I sing oh
Here is the home where my heart belongs
Life is unkind and at times we all seem to be all out of place
Yesterday's image has passed but yet we may still find a trace
What do you say
Time slips away
I am still hoping to unlock the door to my dreams
Hold back the pain
Try to explain
You are the key to that ultimate answer I seek
Chorus repeat to fadeEmbed
