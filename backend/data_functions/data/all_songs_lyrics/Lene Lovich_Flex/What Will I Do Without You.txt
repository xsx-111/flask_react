What Will I Do Without You LyricsI take disasters in my stride
I dared upset me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
And those that need me on
Are sorry that they met me
(chorus)
But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without you
If time and tide in life
Perspires to defeat me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
I smile and carry on...
I will never let them beat me
(chorus)
But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without you
And if my seven senses won, that one should leave me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
And smile in the darkness...
I would be alright, believe me
(chorus)
But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without you
If that dark angle raises bony hands to clutch me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
I would not be a sting
If he decides to touch me
(chorus twice)
But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without youEmbed
