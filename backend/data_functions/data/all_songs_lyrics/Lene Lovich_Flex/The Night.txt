The Night LyricsBeware, of their promise
Believe, what I say
Before, I go forever
Be sure of what you say
So they paint a pretty picture
And they tell you that they need you
And they cover you with flowers
And they always keep you dreaming
They always keep you dreaming
You won't have a lonely hour
If the day could last forever
You might like your ivory tower
(chorus)
But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know your going to lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around
Around
Beware, of their promise
Believe, what I say
Before, I, I go forever
Be sure of what you say
And the words may come too easy
If you don't believe I'm leaving
If you find it comes too quickly
If you really think they love you
If you really thought they loved you
You would give your love so sweetly
If the day could last forever
You might fall in love completely
(chorus twice)
But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know your going to lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around
AroundEmbed
