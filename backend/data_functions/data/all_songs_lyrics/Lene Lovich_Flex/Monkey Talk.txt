Monkey Talk LyricsMonkey see monkey do monkey want to talk to you
Monkey got a lot to say
Monkey must communicate
Day is night, night is day
Everything is cross connected
It's a crazy cuckoo race
I am almost glad it's ended
Men and monkeys all are we
Swinging through eternity
Monkey see monkey do monkey want to talk to you
Monkey got a lot to say
Monkey must communicate
Play so hard
All the way
Broken bodies soon will mend
There's no need for you to cry
This is just a game my friend
Men and monkeys all are we
Swinging through eternity
Chorus
When the stars come tumbling down
And we find our feet once more upon the ground
There's no time to mess around
There's such a lot to do
Me and you
Men and monkeys all are we
Swinging through eternity
