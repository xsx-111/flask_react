Joan LyricsJoan are you listening to my voice?
You can't escape - you have no choice
It's just as real as anything said outside your head
The voice inside you bites your mind
You can't ignore the words this time
It's twice as loud as the jealous crowd that makes you cry
Like Joan of Arc you must be brave and listen to your heart
Imagination is essential to creative art
So look into your mind, and use what you may find
The answer lies behind your eyes, it's not that far
Joan it appears you've seen the light
You must allow the light to shine
Ignore the normal boundary lines that keep you tied
The world is full of hate and fear
You must expect to shed some tears
But precious are the eyes that see the new ideas
Like Joan of Arc you must be brave and listen to your heart
Imagination is essential to creative art
So look into your mind, and use what you may find
The answer lies behind your eyes, it's not that farEmbed
