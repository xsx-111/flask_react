You in This Light LyricsFeeling erodes
Moving like wash against the limestone
Leaving you cold
When I'm leaving you all alone
Hugging the walls
Finding the switch to turn the light on
To find you in a ball
Wrapped in the bedding. But
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
Feeling disarmed, a little raw, and decentered
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
What if we don't?
What if we never know?
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
Clutching you close your body felt like December
Shook awake early from the rocks of your tremors
Tracing my thumb over the miles of your memory
Now a bit brighter with a smile and a laughter
One in the same and what am I to be after
Dancing in private with the concept of never?
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
(Coming around again)
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
(Making some space to mend)
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
(Coming around again)
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
(Making some space to mend)
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
(Gaining the strength to stand)
You in this light feels like a thing I can't remember
(Feeling the love again)Embed
