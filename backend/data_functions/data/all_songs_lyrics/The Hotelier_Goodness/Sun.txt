Sun LyricsYou and I'd escape the night and call it summering
I'd hold your rays and ride for days while you spin endlessly
You undone, I felt safely strung between all your nerve endings
So you made waves to congregate and finally ask of me
Will you lay with me where the sun hits right?
When the tired days can't remember
How a blurring haze came across your eyes
Will you lay with me forever?
Focused state, wide awake in the eye of everything
You and me, twin-firing machines spending all our energy
I felt the shade cool and grey and glanced up suddenly
Aurora spray, a horizon away as I shout at the top of me
Will you lay with me in the sun tonight?
When the tired days can't remember
How a blurring haze came across my eyes
Will you lay with me forever?
Carved your name across the sky in a fit of exiting
With the polar night just in sight, will you come and visit me?
You and me, twin-firing machines spending all our energy
But if it's you undone, you undone, I can't sit with you
If it's you undone, you undone, I can't sit with you
And it's you undone, you undone, I can't sit in your sunEmbed
