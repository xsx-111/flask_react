Opening Mail for My Grandmother LyricsYour grip on my forearm, insert the wrong name
Holds me at your nightstand just inches away
With letters from faces we'll ask if you knew
Who send out another yearly review
I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you
We're making attendance, we're following through
So start the next post card, share with me the news
Your highness has spoken, I'm coming for you
From Gingie in San Fran, the grandkids are dear
The nurse from old St. Beth's was widowed this year
But they're making arrangements, you jest and allude
And nod at Sai Baba, you're laughingly rude
I'm coming for you, coming for you
Entirely brazen while coming unto
Your sunrise apartment and incredible view
Of birds that keep chirping "I'm coming for you"
I'm coming for you
Your beautiful brightness, perpetually new
So old in your body, the youth's in your mood
They're keeping your space there, they're dying for you
We'll sing your good graces when they come for you
But until that day's here, I'm coming for youEmbed
