Fear of Good LyricsSkin caked with sap of pine
Can't catch against my roaring mind
The coat slips off my etched spine
It's a weight no longer carried and I'm freezing
So freezing
Oh, so freezing
So freezing
A message to my brother sky
I long to hold your hand tonight
But when up against this summit's height
I'm tense, I'm small, I'm speechless and I'm freezing
So freezing
Oh, so freezing
So freezingEmbed
