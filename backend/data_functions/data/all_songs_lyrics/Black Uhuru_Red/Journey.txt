Journey LyricsTrodding the other day
On journey so far away
Trying to make a living to see
What I could achieve
I saw city state
Places of all human races
They are standing in front of I and I
Working scientifical
Advancement to corrupt the mind
Babylon in their little way
Thinking of all the benefits there are
I and I humble lion chant Mount Zion
I am at a pace
Why you scrabbing my face
Some must see they can earn
Cause I and I Black Uhuru
Stand fine burn
Brimstone burn brimstone burn
Brimstone burn brimstone burn
Trodding the other day
On a journey so far away away
Trying to make a living to see
What I can achieve
For the benefits of my grief
I saw men working scientifical
Advancement to corrupt the mind
Babylon is their little way
Brimstone burn brimstone burn
Brimstone burn brimstone burn
Get up get up get up
Everything is trial
Brimstone burn brimstone
Get up get up get up
Brimstone brimstone
Get up get up get upEmbed
