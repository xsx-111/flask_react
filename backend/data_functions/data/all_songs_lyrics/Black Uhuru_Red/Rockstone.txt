Rockstone LyricsThrowing rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
Throwing rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
Men standing over i and i and
We are not wild
Forcing jack hammers
Through the concrete wall
That's the only way a dread
Can make a bread
Satta dread satta you time soon
Come
Throwing rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
Throwing rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
I and i fore parents did
Have all the riches
Now it's taken away
And dem work iniquity and a
Burn bad lamp 'pon dem wanna
Neda
Dem a burn bad lamp and
Work iniquity wo oh
Every time i work on this
Truck mi tear off mi shirt
I trod it ital but duckie
Stitch his own up
We fling rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
Throwing rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
Throwing rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
Packing up rockstone upon a
Dumper truck
The queen would like to know
I and i know that for sure
Cause we down yea
We are the slave
We are the slave
Digging digging
Down a sandy gully
We do the holly gully
Enjoying plenty of collieEmbed
