Sponji Reggae - Discomix LyricsYou bum right here and you
Bounce over there sponji reggae
I say you bum right here and
You bounce over there
Sponji reggae
I say you rock right here and
You rock over there sponji reggae
I say you punch right here and you
Punch over there sponji reggae
A keep trying very hard to succeed
I almost lost my reflex
My bare feet was burn
That i almost lost my nerves
My fingers are shaking as the
Day start breaking
I could a never keep it no longer
I had to tell it to one another
Chorus:
You bum right here
Some say i am nuts zooky crazy
Want i to leave the music alone
They say go and look work
I and i are lazy
But i think for a while and
Say to my self
It's a time for every style
Chorus:
I may not be a movie star
I don't drive a big fancy car
I can afford only a winchester cigar
From the day i was born and
Given life
I and i a actor genius name it
