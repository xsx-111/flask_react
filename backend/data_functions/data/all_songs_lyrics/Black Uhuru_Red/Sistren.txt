Sistren LyricsIf you have a sistren an she
Come from country town
Home training and manners
She never know
Grandfather say oh mammy
Say forward gal a mountain side
Mek she go wash tub
Mek she go wash tub
Don't mek she go to waste
Don't mek she go to waste
Don't let she stand and wait oh
Don't mek she face disgrace
Don't let she go to waste
Don't let she go to waste
If you have a sistren and she
Come from woodland home
Irie spirit she has when she greets
You
It shows grandfather say
Oh mammy say forward gal a
Mountain side dub her up a ital fall
Dub her up a ital fall
Chorus
In a earth i would like the blessing
To be on all the children of israel
For the fear of jah is the
Beginning of wisdom
The sistren gone natty dread
All a wear tall frock instead
Chorus
Cultural vibes are her saying
A piece of silver don't strike her eye
She say reality is so nice
So take care women
African ruby i mean that truly
Come mek we forward down
A river to go beat old clothesEmbed
