Utterance LyricsWhat a joy to hear the
Utterance of a rasta (repeat)
Long long ago
They use to say
Rastafari going around
Taking little children away
But now time is at hand
I and i know those
Saying was wrong
And that rasta let them
Know their homeland
And seek their culture
What a joy to hear the
Utterance from a rasta (repeat)
I and i was granted
To drink from the fountain of life
I god will make i hold tight
I and i knee will not
Wobble i and i
A v.i.p international
And now they putting
Rasta on the air
Before that they used
Live in fear
What a joy to hear the
Utterance of a rasta (repeat)
There is a way that
Seemeth right to man
And yet in jah jah sight it wrong
It's not what you do is
How you do it
It's not what you say
But how you say it
You going be shot with shit
Go down in it
What a joy to hear the
Utterance from a rasta (repeat)Embed
