Puff She Puff Lyrics
Jah!

Puff she puff
No bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff
She puff, she puff
No bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff

Making love on hungry belly
I couldn't cope too long
With my bare long hands
I'm embarrassed most of the time
But it's not no crime
Children crying day and night
Can't find mummy

She just a puff
No bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff, claim she tough
She just a puff
She just a puff 'pon Rasta
She say, rude she rude, hard she hard
Tough she tough and soft she soft
Puff she puff
No bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff, hmm
Tough, she tough
No bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff
Enough you nuff
You cannot nuff 'pon Rasta
Hmm-mmm

Money I can hardly find
And white squall a bite
Simplest things get serious in these time
The things that you do when upset
Someday you're gonna regret, oh yeah
Tough, tough, tough, tough she tough

A puff she puff, no bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff, claim she tough
She just a puff, she just a puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff
*  Instrumental break *

Many a times when I check my life style
A been a living in another foot step of another man
I no man, man a failure
Tuff, tuff

She just a puff
She just a tuff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff, claims she tough
She just a chuck
No bother chuck 'pon Rasta
Chuck, she chuck

Man find himself doing all manner of evil
I and I a Ion's
So no bother come gwaan like you tough
A say a nuff, a kinda nuff
You just a jook
No bother jook 'pon Rasta
You puff puff, claim you tough
She just a puff, no bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff
A nuff, you nuff, a nuff, you nuff
A nuff, you nuff
So no bother jook
No bother jook 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff, claim she tough
She just a puff
No bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff

She puff, she puff
No bother puff 'pon Rasta
She puff, she puff1Embed
