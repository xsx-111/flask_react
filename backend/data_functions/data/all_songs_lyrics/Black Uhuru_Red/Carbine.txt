Carbine LyricsCivilian warring among each other
Only to achieve their coffin
So I and I stay away in the big apple
And trod it with care though its full of maggots
Cost of living reach the sky
And no ones knows why
It's just revolution time
So Cool off
Cool off the carbine a yard
Cool off cool off the carbine a yard
Be attentive to my call of Jah
I remember days of long ago
These thinge used to poison my people
I am willing
I am concerned
With the works of your own hand
Brings the activity of nature
The morning cause I and I to hear
The loving kindness of Jah
Everytime when I put my trust in Jah never wrong so I say
Cool off
Cool off the carbine a yard
So cool off
Cool off
Don't go a funeral so cool off can't tek the deddas
Cool off cool off the carblne a yard
It's a gunshot season
And we got overstanding
So it's best to qet down and reason
Stop trusting in the abundant of your riches
All you speak of is evolution
It's mind blowinq without direction
And situation objection corruption
Cool off cool off
The carbine a yard
Cool off cool off
The carbine a yard
So I say cool off
Cool off the carbine a yard
There is an understanding
To everything that is seen in existence
So cool off cool off the carbineEmbed
