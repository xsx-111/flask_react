Sponji Reggae Lyrics
You bum right here
And you bounce over there
Sponji reggae
I say you bum right here
And you bounce over there
Sponji reggae
I say you rock right here
And you rock over there
Sponji reggae
I say you pounce right here
And you pounce over there
Sponji reggae

A keep trying very hard to succeed
I almost lost my reflex
My bare feet was burn
Then i almost lost my nerves
My fingers start shaking as the
Day start breaking
I could a never keep it no longer
I had to tell it to one another
You bum right here…

Some say i am nuts zooky crazy
Want i to leave the music alone
They say go and look work
I and i are lazy
But i think for a while and
Say to my self
It's a time for every style

…

I may not be a movie star
I don't drive no fancy car
I can afford only a Winchester cigar
From the day i was born and
Given life
I and i a actor genius name it
Genuine character
