Youth of Eglington LyricsThe youths of Eglinton
Won't put down their Remington
The youth of Brixton
They have their 45 Smith and
Wesson pistol pistol
The youth of Utica Avenue
They just can't keep cool
So much gun shot some
Cripple some turn fool
They are responsible for a lot
Of children
And they need food
And they want to go to school
I say the youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
I say the youth of Kingston
Won't leave their Magnum
Pistol pistol
A very thin line to start the crime
Who will be the first to
Volunteer
You love you love your fuckery
Get up and get yourself together
You hear the words of Jah Jah
Coming from the hill top of
Dabra Dabra
Keep you strength
The youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
I say the youth of Brixton
They put down their 45 Smith
And Wesson pistol pistol
Stop and listen
They want you to fight the good fight
But save you strength
For strength of life
The youths in Africa
All a dem a thriller
I say the youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
The youth of Kingston
Won't leave their Magnum
Pistol pistol
Poor Jill she was a spill
She got hit by a stray shot
The youths of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
The youths of Brixton
They put down their 45 Smith
And Wesson pistol pistolEmbed
