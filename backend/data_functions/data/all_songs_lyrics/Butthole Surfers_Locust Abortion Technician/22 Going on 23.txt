Woman: I enjoy your show and I've been trying to get through for quite a while
Man: Well, we're glad you kept trying
Woman: Um, I have this problem. Last July, I was assaulted... sexually, and ever since then, I cannot sleep, I've been having trouble sleeping

(Woman:  Well, they told me, when I have these bad dreams, to try and put endings on the, the dreams, like I come out a winner. But every time I try to do that, I just...can't get anywhere.

(2nd Woman: And I watch one soap opera a day. And if he happens to walk in the house, I'm paranoid. I just jump up and turn off the TV.

And he says that he did all the traveling that he wanted to do while he was in the service.)Embed
