Human Cannonball LyricsAre you ready to rock?
Rock 'n' roll!
Pardon me, I'm only bleeding
But you cut me to the bone
My imperfections have reduced you
To a lowly animal
A part of me was introduced to you
Then it walked right out the door
And tonight you're probably feeling
Like a human cannonball
It used to be that loving you
Was easy, unrestrained
And now I'm only bleeding
But I'm loving only pain
Pardon me, I'm only bleeding
But you cut me to the bone
And tonight you're probably feeling
Like a human cannonball4Embed
