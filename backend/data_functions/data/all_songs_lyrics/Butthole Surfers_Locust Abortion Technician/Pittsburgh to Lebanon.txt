Pittsburgh to Lebanon LyricsWhen I crawled outta my momma
Well, I was blind as can be
I bought my first shotgun
At the age of three
Wine, whiskey and women, yow
By the time that I was five
Said, Lord, the way I am living
You know that I'm gonna wind up alive
Shotgun
Shotgun
Said oh, ho
Said hey, hey
Said shotgun
Said shotgunEmbed
