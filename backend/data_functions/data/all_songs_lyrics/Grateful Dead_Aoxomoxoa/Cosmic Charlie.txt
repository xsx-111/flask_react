Cosmic Charlie Lyrics
Cosmic Charlie, how do you do?
Trucking in style along the avenue
Dum de dum de doodley do
Go on home your mamas calling you

Kalico, kahlia, come tell me the news
Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her
Rosy red and electric blue
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe

Say you'll come back when you can
Whenever your airplane happens to land
Maybe I'll be back here too
It all depends on what's with you

Hung up waiting for a windy day
Kite one ice since the first of February
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow
But standing here I say I just don't know

New ones coming as the old ones go
Everything's moving here but much too slow now
A little bit quicker and we might have time
To say, "How do you do?" before we're left behind
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo
The very last lately inquired about you
It's really very one or two
The first you wanted, the last I knew

I just wonder if you shouldn't feel
Less concerned about the people unreal
The very first word is, "How do you do?"
The last go home your mamas calling you
Calling you, calling you, calling you, calling you

Go on home your mama's calling you
Go on home your mama's calling you
Go on home your mama's calling you
Go on home your mama's calling youEmbed
