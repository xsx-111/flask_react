Mountains of the Moon Lyrics
Cold mountain water, the jade merchant's daughter
Mountains of the moon, Electra bow and bend to me
Hi ho the carrion crow, fol de rol de de riddle
Hi ho the carrion crow, bow and bend to me

Hey, Tom Banjo
Hey, a laurel
More than laurel you may sow
More than laurel you may sow
Hey, the laurel
Hey, the city in the rain
Hey, hey, hey, the wild wheat waving in the wind

Twenty degrees of solitude, twenty degrees in all
All the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall
Lost is the long and loneliest town
Fairy sybil flying
All along the—
All along the mountains of the moon

Hey, Tom Banjo
It's time to matter
The earth will see you on through this time
The earth will see you on through this time
Down by the water
Marsh King's daughter
Did you know?
Clothed in tatters, always will be
Tom, where did you go?
Mountains of the moon, Electra, mountains of the moon
All along the—
All along the mountains of the moon
Hi ho the carrion crow, fol de rol de de riddle
Hi ho the carrion crow, bow and bend to me

Bend to me
