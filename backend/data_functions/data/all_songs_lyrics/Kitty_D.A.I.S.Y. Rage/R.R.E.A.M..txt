R.R.E.A.M. Lyrics
I'm a little Nipsey Hussle plus a little pixie dust
I'll piss all on your bike, I like to see your fixie rust
I'm in the pile of Fly-Lo wannabe followers
Sending photos in allover print nylons
Nylon magazine sayin' I hold the mic wrong
Smile glad like I wanna be in your Nikon's
Viewfinder, I'm the white ball in the corner pocket
Scratch the bumps on my skin like

Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'all
Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'all

I grew up on the shy side, the free wi-fi side
The O.C.D. side, you know it's me, Pryde
But I don't really have much of that, so
I'm blushin' while I'm running the show
And I don't wanna take a flick and I never take photos
I never say YOLO, I never say cheese
And I don't wanna pose 'cause I don't want 'em to see
The anxiety rash that I'm hiding under my sleeves
And it looks weak to get all red and
Itchy when I'm barely upset, but
It's bad enough to make 'em call a medic
I could be in Cali or Connecticut
I'm loud and always yelling and
I'm kinda like a pelican, 'cause my mouth
Is way bigger than my belly and
I like to keep some feathers on my skeleton
I'm not a bird but I pretend I am
When I shit on your head outside your residence
Without my medicine, I'm stressing 'cause
Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'all
Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'all
Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'all
Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'all

I'm a little Nipsey Hussle plus a little pixie dust
I'll piss all on your bike, I like to see your fixie rust
I'm in the pile of Fly-Lo wannabes
Prank callin' me all the time and
I just wanna grind and I just wanna flex
I don't really mind all of the politics and stress
I like to be the trending topic, the pound key
Even though I break out when they hound me and

Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'all
Rash rules everything around me (R.R.E.A.M.!)
Getting drowsy, Bena-Benadryl y'allEmbed
