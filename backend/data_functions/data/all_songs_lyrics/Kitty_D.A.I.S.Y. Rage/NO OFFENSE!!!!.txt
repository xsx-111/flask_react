NO OFFENSE!!!! Lyrics
I feel like I should think of something to say here
But I can't

You're fool's gold, you're cubic zirconium
You're hoein' 'em, you are cubic zirconium
You are fool's gold
You fit a fool's mold, glowin' like diamonds
Your molecules'll prove you're hoein' 'em
You're cubic zirconium
You're fool's gold
You fit a fool's mold, you're a fool, old man
You're, you're cubic zirconium
You are fool's gold
You're hoein' 'em, you're cubic zirconium

Had you wrapped around my finger but, er
There's a little green ring there now, ew
How will I get your residue off?
You're about as fraudulent as a mirage out in the desert
Blue peacock, you're puffin' out your feathers to
Bring a bunch of bitches backstage into your dressing room
So you can treat it like a petting zoo
And you get heated that I never do, why am I friends with you?
You say you're silver, but you're filler with a filagree
Ask the bitches that you've been chillin' with and they will agree
Smalls, you're not hittin' the balls, you're killin' me
Illegitimate like Bill and I am Hillary
You pillage all your image to appeal to the millions
And always askin', "Hey Kitty, you think they're feelin' me?"
Your dentured grandpa tried to grill it
You're as authentic as a handful of acrylics
You're synthetically made
You're crab with a K at the back of every China buffet
You're pinin' away to be cool, but you're a pint of the
Fake O'douls....lame...wanna be non-alcoholic whatever

You're fool's gold, you are cubic zirconium
You're hoein' 'em, you are cubic zirconium
You are fool's gold
You fit a fool's mold, glowin' like diamonds
Your molecules'll prove you're hoein' 'em
You're cubic zirconium
You're fool's gold, you're fool's gold
You're cubic zirconium, and you're hoein' 'em all
You're cubic zirconium
You're fool's gold
You fit a fool's mold, you fit a fool's mold
Oh god

This rhyme, it'll prickle like a pinecone
But won't stick, 'cause you're fickle as a rhinestone
You differ like the timezones
Every trend you're on the dick of it, I'm really sick of it
You think you're hard as Noreaga
So fake I'd find ya at a bodega
So babe, uh, you're a little flaker
But hey, at least you'll do whatever it takes, huh??
You're a Kardashian's ass
And you're AstroTurf, 'cause you're not actually grass
And you act so perfect but you know how roses smell and your hoax is so bogus
And I'm the only one that noticed
Dude, that's allEmbed
