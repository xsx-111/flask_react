Expendable Youth Lyrics
Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf, my battlefield
In no one's way, caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill

Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control...
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution

Injured soul on the hard ground
Head blown off, facedown
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death, homicide

Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control...
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution
Fighting you motherfuckers!


Struggling to survive
This drug-induced warfare
Having control...
A principal obsession
Expendable youth...
Fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend

Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution1Embed
