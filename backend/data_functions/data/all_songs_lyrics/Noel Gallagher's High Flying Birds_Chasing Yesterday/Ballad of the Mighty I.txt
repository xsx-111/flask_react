Ballad of the Mighty I Lyrics
Followed you down to the end of the world
To wait outside your window
In the heat of the rain I would call your name
But you just passed me by
If you put me up like a fly on the wall
Then you'll be to blame when the heavens fall
Give me a sign if you hear me call
But you just pass me by
The colours around me are fading away
And I'll be waiting, come what may

I'll find you (I'll find you)
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I've got to be the man who walks the earth alone

I followed the stars and I sailed to the sun
I held it in my fingers
Alone on the beach, on my own out of reach
When you just passed me by
I'd give you the world if you'd take my hand
But you left me alone in the sinking sand
Strike up the band for one last stand
But you just passed me by
Show me the rules of the games you play
And I'll be here waiting, come what may
I'll find you (I'll find you)
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I got to be the man who walks the earth
I'll find you (I'll find you)
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I've got to be the man who walks the earth alone


I've followed you now to the end of the world
To wait outside your window
In the heat of the rain I will call your name
But you just pass me by
Wherever you run I'll be on your tail
Whatever you're hiding behind your veil

I'll find you (I'll find you)
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I've got to be the man who walks the earth
I'll find you (I'll find you)
Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
If I've got to be the man who walks the earth alone10Embed
