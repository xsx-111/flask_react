Riverman Lyrics
There's something in the way
She moves me to distraction
I travelled all this way
To try and make amends
'Cause heavy in the air
Are the words that she left hanging
I tried to walk away
But I only stand and stare

The rain that comes
All of the love that was left behind
Is gone
When the riverman run
Find me the girl who electrifies the storm
In a little while she'll be gone
Maybe

I waited in the rain
My feet too wet to stand in
I shouted out your name
Behind a rainbow's end
But somewhere in the crowd
She heard me jingle jangling
Like a memory that fades
She slipped away again
The rain that comes
All of the love that was left behind
Is gone
When the riverman run
Find me the girl who electrifies the storm
In a little while she'll be gone
The rain that comes
All of the love that was left behind
Is gone
When the riverman run
Find me the girl who electrifies the storm
In a little while she'll be gone

The riverman run
The riverman run
The riverman run
The riverman run6Embed
