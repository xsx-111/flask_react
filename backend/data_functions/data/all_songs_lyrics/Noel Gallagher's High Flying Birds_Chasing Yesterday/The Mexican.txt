The Mexican Lyrics
They say that you need love
Just like a kid on crack
I got a feeling that what you are
Is kind of holding you back
They say you can't find your feet
Under the morning sun
I got a feeling that what you are
Might just be blowing away your mind

Thought I was talking about a new religion
Waiting on the outside, lost in the fog
I was only dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time, watching the clock

They say that you need love
Just like a kid on crack
I got a feeling that what you are
Is kind of holding you back
They say you can't feel the heat
Behind the setting sun
I got a feeling that what you are
Might just be blowing away your mind
Thought I was talking about a new religion
Waiting on the outside, lost in the fog
I was only dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time, watching the clock


Thought I was talking about a new religion
Waiting on the outside, lost in the fog
I was only dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time, watching the clock

Thought I was talking about a new religion
Waiting on the outside, lost in the fog
I was only dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time, watching the clock2Embed
