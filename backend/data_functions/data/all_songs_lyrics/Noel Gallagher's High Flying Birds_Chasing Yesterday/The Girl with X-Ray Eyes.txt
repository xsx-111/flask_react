The Girl with X-Ray Eyes Lyrics
Tried to hang on to myself
Don't believe in no-one else
And I'm shakin' like a leaf
As I fall into the street

But the girl with X-Ray eyes
She's gonna see through my disguise

Going nowhere down a hill
It's hard to swallow like the pill
That was twisted on your tongue
By the sea that was standing still
There was no-one to be seen
No-one left to hear my scream

So she took me by the hand
We followed clues left in the sand
As she swallowed space and time
We gathered pearls and swine
She shot me to the sun
Like a bullet from a gun
When the deed was done
In the morning she was gone

Turn the page and let it go
Like your mother told you so
Life, it stretches out for miles
The truth is on your stereo

But the girl with X-Ray eyes
She's gonna see through your disguise

So she took me by the hand
We followed clues left in the sand
As she swallowed space and time
We gathered pearls and swine
She shot me to the sun
Like a bullet from the gun
When the deed was done
In the morning she was gone3Embed
