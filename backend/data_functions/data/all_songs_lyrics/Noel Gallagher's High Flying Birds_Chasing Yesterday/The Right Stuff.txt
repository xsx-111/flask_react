The Right Stuff Lyrics
Out of the blue I heard an angel say...
“Give me your soul and I’ll be on my way...”
You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff

Are you a sleeper or a mortal soul?
Are you the devil with a heart of gold?
You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff

When your heart gets shattered and your jeans get frayed
And your baby sings the mourning at the end of the day
When your heart gets shattered and your jeans get frayed
And your baby sings the mourning at the end of the day

You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff
You and I2Embed
