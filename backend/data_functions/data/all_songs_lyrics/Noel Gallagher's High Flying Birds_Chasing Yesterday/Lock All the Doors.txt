Lock All the Doors Lyrics
She wore a star-shaped tambourine
Prettiest girl I'd ever seen
Was standing lost and lonely on the shore
I tried to catch her every night
Dancing on the road in her candlelight
But I can't seem to reach her anymore

Lock all the doors!
Maybe they'll never find us
I could be sure, like never before, this time
Get down on the floor!
Turn all the lights off inside
I could be sure, like never before, this time

You know it's mine
You know it's mine

She never hears me when I speak
I gotta find out where that magic sleeps
And I can feel you underneath my skin
Ready for take-off, warm inside
Cause I don't wanna sail on the ocean wide
Cause we might never live to meet again
Lock all the doors!
Maybe they'll never find us
I could be sure, like never before, this time
Get on the floor!
Turn all the lights off inside
I could be sure, like never before, this time

You know it's mine
You know it's mine


Lock all the doors!
Maybe they'll never find us
I could be sure, like never before, this time
Get on the floor!
Turn all the lights off inside
I could be sure, like never before, this time

You know it's mine
You know it's mine
You know it's mine2Embed
