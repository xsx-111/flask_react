While the Song Remains the Same Lyrics(One, Two, Three, Four)

Hold that thought, don't let me go
We can dance beneath the fireflies on an empty road
Itâ€™s a shame how memory fades to grey
We let love get lost in anger chasing yesterday

Find me a place where the sun shines through the rain
Find me a pleasure in the pain
While the song remains the same
Let it go on and on and on

Take me back to the town where I was born
'Cause I'm tired of being a stranger and I'm miles from home
We can hide by a lonely window pane
We can walk the streets of my life while they still remain

Find me a place where the sun shines through the rain
Find me a pleasure in the pain
While the song remains the same
Let it go on and on and on

Hold that thought, don't let me go
We can dance beneath the fireflies on an empty road1Embed
