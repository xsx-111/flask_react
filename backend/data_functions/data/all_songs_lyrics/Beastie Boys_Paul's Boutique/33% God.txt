33% God LyricsCan you feel it, can you feel it?
I say get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Get down
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you're going to dig this
It's the joint
Whooooo...whose car is that?
Wait a minute
Whoo-ha!
Get down
Just like this
Yo, get off the pipe, pussy!
Is your name Michael Diamond?
Wohoohaa...yeah
G-g-g-get down1Embed
