My Emotions Are Blinding Lyrics
Women are much closer to nature
So but can't you understand
Binary opposition
Hits me like a divine plan

I get hysterical, oh oh
It's empirical, oh yeah
I get hysterical, oh oh
It's empirical, oh yeah

My emotions, they are blinding
This is one night I can't go on surviving
Tell me one truth worth confiding
Baby, don't you know that my love is binding
My emotions, they are blinding
This is one night I can't go on surviving

Strike me like a sacred vision
If the night goes exactly as planned
I'll be giving all my attention
To the world's most interesting man
I'm just a vehicle, oh oh
For the material, oh yeah
I'm just a vehicle
And I won't be back again

My emotions, they are blinding
This is one night I can't go on surviving
Tell me one truth worth confiding
Baby, don't you know that my love is binding?
My emotions, they are blinding
This is one night I can't go on surviving
Tell me one truth worth confiding
Baby, don't you know that my love is binding?

It's metaphorical
For the categorical
It's metaphorical
For the categorical
I get hysterical
It's empirical
I get hysterical4Embed
