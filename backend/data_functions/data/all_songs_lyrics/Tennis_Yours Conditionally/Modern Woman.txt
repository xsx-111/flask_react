Modern Woman Lyrics
Kate, I'm so afraid you hate me
I think I might have made it true
There's no need to implicate me
You were never one for proof

All I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to get back the closeness you took
I know, that's the way you appreciate me
Even though we haven't spoken lately, oh

I think I might have made it real
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real
I think I might have made it so real

Kate, I know a modern woman
By the look and by the feel
We both cut imposing figures
Getting good at striking raw deals

All I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to forget the way you mistook
No, I'm not asking for forgiveness
I'm just getting tired of living with this, oh
I think I might have made it real
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real, honey
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real, honey
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real, honey
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real, honey
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real
I think I might have made it so real
I think I might have made it real, honey
I think I might have made it so realAll I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to get back the closeness you took
All I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to get back the closeness you took
All I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to get back the closeness you took
All I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to get back the closeness you took
All I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to get back the closeness you took
All I want is comfort in a touch or a look
All I want is to get back the closeness you took2Embed
