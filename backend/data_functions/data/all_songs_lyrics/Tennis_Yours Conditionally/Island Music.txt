Island Music Lyrics
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

Why can't I cry?
I've been trying every day
Why can't I cry?
I keep sighing through a haze
The earth in bloom
It's delicate and new
But, baby, I'm unmoved by you
Unmoved

Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

Why can't I cry?
Wings are flying 'cross the sky
Why can't I dream my way?
Through the living and breathing and dreaming
Like a daze
The earth in bloom, it's jealous and new
But, baby, I'm unmoved by you
Unmoved
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

I feel the prolapse of my heart
(do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Tends to tear the night right apart
(do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
On the faces in the spring
Never to feel a thing
Why can't I cry?
Cannot cry, cannot cry

Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-doEmbed
