10 Minutes 10 Years Lyrics
You could have me for ten minutes
You could have me for ten years
I could lose you in the hours
I could lose you in the tears, oh

The feeling's lost without you, oh my baby
Without you, oh my love
The feeling's gone completely

Those who measure time and distance
Haven't known a love like mine
There is only perfect closeness
Don't you leave it all behind

The feeling's lost without you, oh my baby
Without you, oh my love
The feeling's gone completely
The feeling's lost without you, oh my baby
Without you, oh my love
The feeling's gone completely
Oh, the feeling's lost without you, oh my baby
Without you, oh my love
I lose myself completely, oh
What have I got without you?
What have I got without you?
What have I got without you?
What have I got without you?
What have I got without you?
What have I got without you?
What have I got without you?
What have I got without you?

You could have me for ten minutes
You could have me for ten years
We are only single moments
Strung together and held dearlyEmbed
