Fields of Blue Lyrics
Follow me into sweet fields of blue
Moving right in to deliver you
Follow me into sweet fields of blue
Moving right in to
Delivering me to you

I really love you
What could I do?
I really need you
Oh, what's the use in resisting?
I really love you
I cannot help myself
I really need you
Oh, what's the use living without?

Follow me into infinite blue
All of the meaningless interludes
Every wave that rises in place
Strikes with a pattern
Obliterating me and you

I really love you
What could I do?
I really need you
Oh, what's the use in resisting?
I really love you
I cannot help myself
I really need you
Oh, what's the use living without?
You and I only
Over one hundred stories
Maybe I'm dreaming
Feel a bit like oblivion
You and I only
Over one hundred stories
Maybe I'm dreaming
Feel a bit like oblivion2Embed
