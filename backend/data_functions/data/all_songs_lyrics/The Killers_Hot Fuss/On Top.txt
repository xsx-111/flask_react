On Top Lyrics
Remember Rio and get down
Like some other DJ, in some other town
She's been trying to tell me to hold tight
But I've been waiting this whole night
But I've been down across a road or two
But now I've found the velvet sun
That shines on me and you

In the back, ah-ho, I can't crack
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top

The day is breaking, we're still here
Your body's shaking and it's clear
You really need it, so let go
And let me feed it, but you know
That I've been down across a road or two
But now I've found the velvet sun
That shines on me and you

In the back, ah-ho, I can't crack
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
We bring the bump to the grind, ah-ho
I don't mind, we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine


And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine now8Embed
